| **[SpA2V: Harnessing Spatial Auditory Cues for Audio-driven Spatially-aware Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00782v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Audio-driven video generation aims to synthesize realistic videos that align with input audio recordings, akin to the human ability to visualize scenes from auditory input. However, existing approaches predominantly focus on exploring semantic information, such as the classes of sounding sources present in the audio, limiting their ability to generate videos with accurate content and spatial composition. In contrast, we humans can not only naturally identify the semantic categories of sounding sources but also determine their deeply encoded spatial attributes, including locations and movement directions. This useful information can be elucidated by considering specific spatial indicators derived from the inherent physical properties of sound, such as loudness or frequency. As prior methods largely ignore this factor, we present SpA2V, the first framework explicitly exploits these spatial auditory cues from audios to generate videos with high semantic and spatial correspondence. SpA2V decomposes the generation process into two stages: 1) Audio-guided Video Planning: We meticulously adapt a state-of-the-art MLLM for a novel task of harnessing spatial and semantic cues from input audio to construct Video Scene Layouts (VSLs). This serves as an intermediate representation to bridge the gap between the audio and video modalities. 2) Layout-grounded Video Generation: We develop an efficient and effective approach to seamlessly integrate VSLs as conditional guidance into pre-trained diffusion models, enabling VSL-grounded video generation in a training-free manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SpA2V excels in generating realistic videos with semantic and spatial alignment to the input audios.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 3...</summary><p>The 33rd ACM Multimedia Conference (MM '25)</p></details> |
| **[HumanSAM: Classifying Human-centric Forgery Videos in Human Spatial, Appearance, and Motion Anomaly](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19924v2)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Numerous synthesized videos from generative models, especially human-centric ones that simulate realistic human actions, pose significant threats to human information security and authenticity. While progress has been made in binary forgery video detection, the lack of fine-grained understanding of forgery types raises concerns regarding both reliability and interpretability, which are critical for real-world applications. To address this limitation, we propose HumanSAM, a new framework that builds upon the fundamental challenges of video generation models. Specifically, HumanSAM aims to classify human-centric forgeries into three distinct types of artifacts commonly observed in generated content: spatial, appearance, and motion anomaly. To better capture the features of geometry, semantics and spatiotemporal consistency, we propose to generate the human forgery representation by fusing two branches of video understanding and spatial depth. We also adopt a rank-based confidence enhancement strategy during the training process to learn more robust representation by introducing three prior scores. For training and evaluation, we construct the first public benchmark, the Human-centric Forgery Video (HFV) dataset, with all types of forgeries carefully annotated semi-automatically. In our experiments, HumanSAM yields promising results in comparison with state-of-the-art methods, both in binary and multi-class forgery classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025.

| **[VR-PTOLEMAIC: A Virtual Environment for the Perceptual Testing of Spatial Audio Algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00501v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The perceptual evaluation of spatial audio algorithms is an important step in the development of immersive audio applications, as it ensures that synthesized sound fields meet quality standards in terms of listening experience, spatial perception and auditory realism. To support these evaluations, virtual reality can offer a powerful platform by providing immersive and interactive testing environments. In this paper, we present VR-PTOLEMAIC, a virtual reality evaluation system designed for assessing spatial audio algorithms. The system implements the MUSHRA (MUlti-Stimulus test with Hidden Reference and Anchor) evaluation methodology into a virtual environment. In particular, users can position themselves in each of the 25 simulated listening positions of a virtually recreated seminar room and evaluate simulated acoustic responses with respect to the actually recorded second-order ambisonic room impulse responses, all convolved with various source signals. We evaluated the usability of the proposed framework through an extensive testing campaign in which assessors were asked to compare the reconstruction capabilities of various sound field reconstruction algorithms. Results show that the VR platform effectively supports the assessment of spatial audio algorithms, with generally positive feedback on user experience and immersivity.</p></details> | <details><summary>to ap...</summary><p>to appear in EAA Forum Acusticum 2025</p></details> |
| **[Video Forgery Detection with Optical Flow Residuals and Spatial-Temporal Consistency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00397v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of diffusion-based video generation models has led to increasingly realistic synthetic content, presenting new challenges for video forgery detection. Existing methods often struggle to capture fine-grained temporal inconsistencies, particularly in AI-generated videos with high visual fidelity and coherent motion. In this work, we propose a detection framework that leverages spatial-temporal consistency by combining RGB appearance features with optical flow residuals. The model adopts a dual-branch architecture, where one branch analyzes RGB frames to detect appearance-level artifacts, while the other processes flow residuals to reveal subtle motion anomalies caused by imperfect temporal synthesis. By integrating these complementary features, the proposed method effectively detects a wide range of forged videos. Extensive experiments on text-to-video and image-to-video tasks across ten diverse generative models demonstrate the robustness and strong generalization ability of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[$MV_{Hybrid}$: Improving Spatial Transcriptomics Prediction with Hybrid State Space-Vision Transformer Backbone in Pathology Vision Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00383v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial transcriptomics reveals gene expression patterns within tissue context, enabling precision oncology applications such as treatment response prediction, but its high cost and technical complexity limit clinical adoption. Predicting spatial gene expression (biomarkers) from routine histopathology images offers a practical alternative, yet current vision foundation models (VFMs) in pathology based on Vision Transformer (ViT) backbones perform below clinical standards. Given that VFMs are already trained on millions of diverse whole slide images, we hypothesize that architectural innovations beyond ViTs may better capture the low-frequency, subtle morphological patterns correlating with molecular phenotypes. By demonstrating that state space models initialized with negative real eigenvalues exhibit strong low-frequency bias, we introduce $MV_{Hybrid}$, a hybrid backbone architecture combining state space models (SSMs) with ViT. We compare five other different backbone architectures for pathology VFMs, all pretrained on identical colorectal cancer datasets using the DINOv2 self-supervised learning method. We evaluate all pretrained models using both random split and leave-one-study-out (LOSO) settings of the same biomarker dataset. In LOSO evaluation, $MV_{Hybrid}$ achieves 57% higher correlation than the best-performing ViT and shows 43% smaller performance degradation compared to random split in gene expression prediction, demonstrating superior performance and robustness, respectively. Furthermore, $MV_{Hybrid}$ shows equal or better downstream performance in classification, patch retrieval, and survival prediction tasks compared to that of ViT, showing its promise as a next-generation pathology VFM backbone. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/deepnoid-ai/MVHybrid.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted (Oral) in MICCAI 2025 COMPAYL Workshop</p></details> |
| **[Adaptive Branch Specialization in Spectral-Spatial Graph Neural Networks for Certified Robustness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08320v3)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) combine spectral-spatial architectures for enhanced representation learning. However, limited attention has been paid to certified robustness, particularly regarding training strategies and underlying rationale. In this paper, we explicitly specialize each branch: the spectral network is trained to withstand l0 edge flips and capture homophilic structures, while the spatial part is designed to resist linf feature perturbations and heterophilic patterns. A context-aware gating network adaptively fuses the two representations, dynamically routing each node's prediction to the more reliable branch. This specialized adversarial training scheme uses branch-specific inner maximization (structure vs feature attacks) and a unified alignment objective. We provide theoretical guarantees: (i) expressivity of the gating mechanism beyond 1-WL, (ii) spectral-spatial frequency bias, and (iii) certified robustness with trade-off. Empirically, SpecSphere attains state-of-the-art node classification accuracy and offers tighter certified robustness on real-world benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial-Temporal-Spectral Unified Modeling for Remote Sensing Dense Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12280v3)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of multi-source remote sensing data has propelled the development of deep learning for dense prediction, yet significant challenges in data and task unification persist. Current deep learning architectures for remote sensing are fundamentally rigid. They are engineered for fixed input-output configurations, restricting their adaptability to the heterogeneous spatial, temporal, and spectral dimensions inherent in real-world data. Furthermore, these models neglect the intrinsic correlations among semantic segmentation, binary change detection, and semantic change detection, necessitating the development of distinct models or task-specific decoders. This paradigm is also constrained to a predefined set of output semantic classes, where any change to the classes requires costly retraining. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Spatial-Temporal-Spectral Unified Network (STSUN) for unified modeling. STSUN can adapt to input and output data with arbitrary spatial sizes, temporal lengths, and spectral bands by leveraging their metadata for a unified representation. Moreover, STSUN unifies disparate dense prediction tasks within a single architecture by conditioning the model on trainable task embeddings. Similarly, STSUN facilitates flexible prediction across multiple set of semantic categories by integrating trainable category embeddings as metadata. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets with diverse Spatial-Temporal-Spectral configurations in multiple scenarios demonstrate that a single STSUN model effectively adapts to heterogeneous inputs and outputs, unifying various dense prediction tasks and diverse semantic class predictions. The proposed approach consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting its robustness and generalizability for complex remote sensing applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 6 figures, Code link:https://github.com/walking-shadow/Official_TSSUN</p></details> |
| **[AudioMiXR: Spatial Audio Object Manipulation with 6DoF for Sound Design in Augmented Reality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02929v3)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present AudioMiXR, an augmented reality (AR) interface intended to assess how users manipulate virtual audio objects situated in their physical space using six degrees of freedom (6DoF) deployed on a head-mounted display (Apple Vision Pro) for 3D sound design. Existing tools for 3D sound design are typically constrained to desktop displays, which may limit spatial awareness of mixing within the execution environment. Utilizing an XR HMD to create soundscapes may provide a real-time test environment for 3D sound design, as modern HMDs can provide precise spatial localization assisted by cross-modal interactions. However, there is no research on design guidelines specific to sound design with six degrees of freedom (6DoF) in XR. To provide a first step toward identifying design-related research directions in this space, we conducted an exploratory study where we recruited 27 participants, consisting of expert and non-expert sound designers. The goal was to assess design lessons that can be used to inform future research venues in 3D sound design. We ran a within-subjects study where users designed both a music and cinematic soundscapes. After thematically analyzing participant data, we constructed two design lessons: 1. Proprioception for AR Sound Design, and 2. Balancing Audio-Visual Modalities in AR GUIs. Additionally, we provide application domains that can benefit most from 6DoF sound design based on our results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Revis...</summary><p>Revision necessary for accuracy</p></details> |
| **[Privacy-Preserving Driver Drowsiness Detection with Spatial Self-Attention and Federated Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00287v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Driver drowsiness is one of the main causes of road accidents and is recognized as a leading contributor to traffic-related fatalities. However, detecting drowsiness accurately remains a challenging task, especially in real-world settings where facial data from different individuals is decentralized and highly diverse. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for drowsiness detection that is designed to work effectively with heterogeneous and decentralized data. Our approach develops a new Spatial Self-Attention (SSA) mechanism integrated with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to better extract key facial features and improve detection performance. To support federated learning, we employ a Gradient Similarity Comparison (GSC) that selects the most relevant trained models from different operators before aggregation. This improves the accuracy and robustness of the global model while preserving user privacy. We also develop a customized tool that automatically processes video data by extracting frames, detecting and cropping faces, and applying data augmentation techniques such as rotation, flipping, brightness adjustment, and zooming. Experimental results show that our framework achieves a detection accuracy of 89.9% in the federated learning settings, outperforming existing methods under various deployment scenarios. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in handling real-world data variability and highlight its potential for deployment in intelligent transportation systems to enhance road safety through early and reliable drowsiness detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Identifying Unique Spatial-Temporal Bayesian Network without Markov Equivalence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10085v4)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying vanilla Bayesian network to model spatial-temporal causality can be a critical yet challenging task. Different Markovian-equivalent directed acyclic graphs would be identified if the identifiability is not satisfied. To address this issue, Directed Cyclic Graph is proposed to drop the directed acyclic constraint. But it does not always hold, and cannot model dynamical time-series process. Then, Full Time Graph is proposed with introducing high-order time delay. Full Time Graph has no Markov equivalence class by assuming no instantaneous effects. But, it also assumes that the causality is invariant with varying time, that is not always satisfied in the spatio-temporal scenarios. Thus, in this work, a Spatial-Temporal Bayesian Network (STBN) is proposed to theoretically model the spatial-temporal causality from the perspective of information transfer. STBN explains the disappearance of network structure $X\rightarrow Z \rightarrow Y$ and $X\leftarrow Z \leftarrow Y$ by the principle of information path blocking. And finally, the uniqueness of STBN is proved. Based on this, a High-order Causal Entropy (HCE) algorithm is also proposed to uniquely identify STBN under time complexity $\mathcal{O}(n^3\tau_{max})$, where $n$ is the number of variables and $\tau_{max}$ is the maximum time delay. Numerical experiments are conducted with comparison to other baseline algorithms. The results show that HCE algorithm obtains state-of-the-art identification accuracy.

| **[Spatial-Temporal Reinforcement Learning for Network Routing with Non-Markovian Traffic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22174v2)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been widely used for packet routing in communication networks, but traditional RL methods rely on the Markov assumption that the current state contains all necessary information for decision-making. In reality, internet traffic is non-Markovian, and past states do influence routing performance. Moreover, common deep RL approaches use function approximators, such as neural networks, that do not model the spatial structure in network topologies. To address these shortcomings, we design a network environment with non-Markovian traffic and introduce a spatial-temporal RL (STRL) framework for packet routing. Our approach outperforms traditional baselines by more than 19% during training and 7% for inference despite a change in network topology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Collaborative Perceiver: Elevating Vision-based 3D Object Detection via Local Density-Aware Spatial Occupancy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21358v3)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-based bird's-eye-view (BEV) 3D object detection has advanced significantly in autonomous driving by offering cost-effectiveness and rich contextual information. However, existing methods often construct BEV representations by collapsing extracted object features, neglecting intrinsic environmental contexts, such as roads and pavements. This hinders detectors from comprehensively perceiving the characteristics of the physical world. To alleviate this, we introduce a multi-task learning framework, Collaborative Perceiver (CoP), that leverages spatial occupancy as auxiliary information to mine consistent structural and conceptual similarities shared between 3D object detection and occupancy prediction tasks, bridging gaps in spatial representations and feature refinement. To this end, we first propose a pipeline to generate dense occupancy ground truths incorporating local density information (LDO) for reconstructing detailed environmental information. Next, we employ a voxel-height-guided sampling (VHS) strategy to distill fine-grained local features according to distinct object properties. Furthermore, we develop a global-local collaborative feature fusion (CFF) module that seamlessly integrates complementary knowledge between both tasks, thus composing more robust BEV representations. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that CoP outperforms existing vision-based frameworks, achieving 49.5\% mAP and 59.2\% NDS on the test set.

| **[Scalable Multi-Task Reinforcement Learning for Generalizable Spatial Intelligence in Visuomotor Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23698v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Reinforcement Learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in language modeling, its triumph hasn't yet fully translated to visuomotor agents. A primary challenge in RL models is their tendency to overfit specific tasks or environments, thereby hindering the acquisition of generalizable behaviors across diverse settings. This paper provides a preliminary answer to this challenge by demonstrating that RL-finetuned visuomotor agents in Minecraft can achieve zero-shot generalization to unseen worlds. Specifically, we explore RL's potential to enhance generalizable spatial reasoning and interaction capabilities in 3D worlds. To address challenges in multi-task RL representation, we analyze and establish cross-view goal specification as a unified multi-task goal space for visuomotor policies. Furthermore, to overcome the significant bottleneck of manual task design, we propose automated task synthesis within the highly customizable Minecraft environment for large-scale multi-task RL training, and we construct an efficient distributed RL framework to support this. Experimental results show RL significantly boosts interaction success rates by $4\times$ and enables zero-shot generalization of spatial reasoning across diverse environments, including real-world settings. Our findings underscore the immense potential of RL training in 3D simulated environments, especially those amenable to large-scale task generation, for significantly advancing visuomotor agents' spatial reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Adverse Weather Removal via Spectral-based Spatial Grouping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22498v2)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adverse weather conditions cause diverse and complex degradation patterns, driving the development of All-in-One (AiO) models. However, recent AiO solutions still struggle to capture diverse degradations, since global filtering methods like direct operations on the frequency domain fail to handle highly variable and localized distortions. To address these issue, we propose Spectral-based Spatial Grouping Transformer (SSGformer), a novel approach that leverages spectral decomposition and group-wise attention for multi-weather image restoration. SSGformer decomposes images into high-frequency edge features using conventional edge detection and low-frequency information via Singular Value Decomposition. We utilize multi-head linear attention to effectively model the relationship between these features. The fused features are integrated with the input to generate a grouping-mask that clusters regions based on the spatial similarity and image texture. To fully leverage this mask, we introduce a group-wise attention mechanism, enabling robust adverse weather removal and ensuring consistent performance across diverse weather conditions. We also propose a Spatial Grouping Transformer Block that uses both channel attention and spatial attention, effectively balancing feature-wise relationships and spatial dependencies. Extensive experiments show the superiority of our approach, validating its effectiveness in handling the varied and intricate adverse weather degradations.</p></details> | accepted by ICCV25 |

Simulating these materials, for instance using finite element methods, is often computationally demanding and slow. Worse, such methods can suffer from numerical artifacts called ``membrane locking'' that makes cloth appear artificially stiff. Here we propose a general framework, called Mass-Spring Net, for learning a simple yet efficient surrogate model that captures the effects of these complex materials using only motion observations. The cloth is discretized into a mass-spring network with unknown material parameters that are learned directly from the motion data, using a novel force-and-impulse loss function. Our approach demonstrates the ability to accurately model spatially varying material properties from a variety of data sources, and immunity to membrane locking which plagues FEM-based simulations. Compared to graph-based networks and neural ODE-based architectures, our method achieves significantly faster training times, higher reconstruction accuracy, and improved generalization to novel dynamic scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Added...</summary><p>Added middle name of Prof. Pai</p></details> |
| **[SpatialViz-Bench: Automatically Generated Spatial Visualization Reasoning Tasks for MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07610v3)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans can directly imagine and manipulate visual images in their minds, a capability known as spatial visualization. While multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) support imagination-based reasoning, spatial visualization remains insufficiently evaluated, typically embedded within broader mathematical and logical assessments. Existing evaluations often rely on IQ tests or math competitions that may overlap with training data, compromising assessment reliability. To this end, we introduce SpatialViz-Bench, a comprehensive multi-modal benchmark for spatial visualization with 12 tasks across 4 sub-abilities, comprising 1,180 automatically generated problems. Our evaluation of 33 state-of-the-art MLLMs not only reveals wide performance variations and demonstrates the benchmark's strong discriminative power, but also uncovers counter-intuitive findings: models show difficulty perception misaligned with human intuition, exhibit dramatic 2Dto-3D performance cliffs, default to formulaic derivation over visualization, and paradoxically suffer performance degradation from Chain-of-Thought prompting in open-source models. Through statistical and qualitative analysis of error types, SpatialViz-Bench demonstrates that state-of-the-art MLLMs continue to exhibit deficiencies in spatial visualization tasks, thereby addressing a significant lacuna in the field. The benchmark data and evaluation code are publicly available.</p></details> |  |

However, an uncertainty-aware fusion framework requires a grounded likelihood representing the uncertainty of human inputs. This paper presents a Feature Pyramid Likelihood Grounding Network (FP-LGN) that grounds spatial language by learning relevant map image features and their relationships with spatial relation semantics. The model is trained as a probability estimator to capture aleatoric uncertainty in human language using three-stage curriculum learning. Results showed that FP-LGN matched expert-designed rules in mean Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL) and demonstrated greater robustness with lower standard deviation. Collaborative sensing results demonstrated that the grounded likelihood successfully enabled uncertainty-aware fusion of heterogeneous human language observations and robot sensor measurements, achieving significant improvements in human-robot collaborative task performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 2025 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC); Supplementary video: https://cu-asl.github.io/fp-lgn/</p></details> |

Second, we present a hierarchical agent architecture for distributed spatial reasoning, with runtimes for agentic processes to interact the spatial representation, and a context-aware execution model that scopes reasoning to the smallest viable subspace. Together, these enable private, reliable, and low-latency spatial networking that can safely interact with agentic workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to HotNets 2025</p></details> |

However, the local discrepancy with well-validated census statistics and the propagated model uncertainties remain a challenge in such coarse-to-fine-grained mapping problems, specifically constrained by weak and conditional label supervision. Therefore, we present Deep Conditional Census-Constrained Clustering (DeepC4), a novel deep learning-based spatial disaggregation approach that incorporates local census statistics as cluster-level constraints while considering multiple conditional label relationships in a joint multitask learning of the patterns of satellite imagery. To demonstrate, compared to GEM and METEOR, we enhanced the quality of Rwandan maps of urban morphology, specifically building exposure and physical vulnerability, at the third-level administrative unit from the 2022 census. As the world approaches the conclusion of our global frameworks in 2030, our work has offered a new deep learning-based mapping technique towards a spatial auditing of our existing coarse-grained derived information at large scales.</p></details> | <details><summary>Non-p...</summary><p>Non-peer-reviewed Preprint | Keywords: urban morphology, building exposure, physical vulnerability, spatial disaggregation, deep clustering | Data: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13119552 | Code: https://github.com/riskaudit/DeepC4</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Spatial-Temporal Modeling for Real-Time Video Analysis: A Unified Framework for Action Recognition and Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22421v1)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time video analysis remains a challenging problem in computer vision, requiring efficient processing of both spatial and temporal information while maintaining computational efficiency. Existing approaches often struggle to balance accuracy and speed, particularly in resource-constrained environments. In this work, we present a unified framework that leverages advanced spatial-temporal modeling techniques for simultaneous action recognition and object tracking. Our approach builds upon recent advances in parallel sequence modeling and introduces a novel hierarchical attention mechanism that adaptively focuses on relevant spatial regions across temporal sequences. We demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks while maintaining real-time inference speeds. Extensive experiments on UCF-101, HMDB-51, and MOT17 datasets show improvements of 3.2% in action recognition accuracy and 2.8% in tracking precision compared to existing methods, with 40% faster inference time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Assessing Spatial Disparities: A Bayesian Linear Regression Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19171v4)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Epidemiological investigations of regionally aggregated spatial data often involve detecting spatial health disparities among neighboring regions on a map of disease mortality or incidence rates. Analyzing such data introduces spatial dependence among health outcomes and seeks to report statistically significant spatial disparities by delineating boundaries that separate neighboring regions with disparate health outcomes. However, there are statistical challenges to appropriately define what constitutes a spatial disparity and to construct robust probabilistic inferences for spatial disparities. We enrich the familiar Bayesian linear regression framework to introduce spatial autoregression and offer model-based detection of spatial disparities. We derive exploitable analytical tractability that considerably accelerates computation. Simulation experiments conducted on a county map of the entire United States demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, and we apply our method to a data set from the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) on age-standardized US county-level estimates of lung cancer mortality rates.</p></details> | 47 pages, 5 figures |
| **[An accuracy-runtime trade-off comparison of scalable Gaussian process approximations for spatial data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11448v3)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gaussian processes (GPs) are flexible, probabilistic, non-parametric models widely employed in various fields such as spatial statistics and machine learning. A drawback of Gaussian processes is their computational cost having $\mathcal{O}(N^3)$ time and $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ memory complexity which makes them prohibitive for large data sets. Numerous approximation techniques have been proposed to address this limitation. In this work, we systematically compare the accuracy of different Gaussian process approximations concerning likelihood evaluation, parameter estimation, and prediction taking into account the computational time required to perform these tasks. In other words, we analyze the trade-off between accuracy and runtime on multiple simulated and large-scale real-world data sets. We find that Vecchia approximations consistently emerge as the most accurate in almost all experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[STaR: Seamless Spatial-Temporal Aware Motion Retargeting with Penetration and Consistency Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06504v2)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motion retargeting seeks to faithfully replicate the spatio-temporal motion characteristics of a source character onto a target character with a different body shape. Apart from motion semantics preservation, ensuring geometric plausibility and maintaining temporal consistency are also crucial for effective motion retargeting. However, many existing methods prioritize either geometric plausibility or temporal consistency. Neglecting geometric plausibility results in interpenetration while neglecting temporal consistency leads to motion jitter. In this paper, we propose a novel sequence-to-sequence model for seamless Spatial-Temporal aware motion Retargeting (STaR), with penetration and consistency constraints. STaR consists of two modules: (1) a spatial module that incorporates dense shape representation and a novel limb penetration constraint to ensure geometric plausibility while preserving motion semantics, and (2) a temporal module that utilizes a temporal transformer and a novel temporal consistency constraint to predict the entire motion sequence at once while enforcing multi-level trajectory smoothness. The seamless combination of the two modules helps us achieve a good balance between the semantic, geometric, and temporal targets. Extensive experiments on the Mixamo and ScanRet datasets demonstrate that our method produces plausible and coherent motions while significantly reducing interpenetration rates compared with other approaches.

The unweighted adjacency matrix of a graph is commonly used to characterize the relationships between locations, resulting in the implicit assumption that all pairs of neighboring regions interact similarly, an assumption which may not be true in practice. It has been shown that more complex spatial relationships between graph nodes may be represented when edge weights are allowed to vary. Christensen and Hoff (2023) introduced a covariance model for data observed on graphs which is more flexible than traditional alternatives, parameterizing covariance as a function of an unknown edge weights matrix. A potential issue with their approach is that each edge weight is treated as a unique parameter, resulting in increasingly challenging parameter estimation as graph size increases. Within this article we propose a framework for estimating edge weight matrices that reduces their effective dimension via a basis function representation of of the edge weights. We show that this method may be used to enhance the performance and flexibility of covariance models parameterized by such matrices in a series of illustrations, simulations and data examples.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to JCGS.

This task requires simultaneous modeling of spatial information and dramatic prosody based on multimodal inputs, with high data collection costs. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first attempt to address these challenges. We construct MRSDrama, the first multimodal recorded spatial drama dataset, containing binaural drama audios, scripts, videos, geometric poses, and textual prompts. Then, we propose ISDrama, the first immersive spatial drama generation model through multimodal prompting. ISDrama comprises these primary components: 1) Multimodal Pose Encoder, based on contrastive learning, considering the Doppler effect caused by moving speakers to extract unified pose information from multimodal prompts. 2) Immersive Drama Transformer, a flow-based mamba-transformer model that generates high-quality drama, incorporating Drama-MOE to select proper experts for enhanced prosody and pose control. We also design a context-consistent classifier-free guidance strategy to coherently generate complete drama. Experimental results show that ISDrama outperforms baseline models on objective and subjective metrics. The demos are available at https://aaronz345.github.io/ISDramaDemo. We provide the dataset and the evaluation code at https://huggingface.co/datasets/AaronZ345/MRSDrama and https://github.com/AaronZ345/ISDrama.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM Multimedia 2025</p></details> |
| **[Evaluating the Impact Of Spatial Features Of Mobility Data and Index Choice On Database Performance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14466v2)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing number of moving Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices has led to a surge in moving object data, powering applications such as traffic routing, hotspot detection, or weather forecasting. When managing such data, spatial database systems offer various index options and data formats, e.g., point-based or trajectory-based. Likewise, dataset characteristics such as geographic overlap and skew can vary significantly. All three significantly affect database performance. While this has been studied in existing papers, none of them explore the effects and trade-offs resulting from a combination of all three aspects. In this paper, we evaluate the performance impact of index choice, data format, and dataset characteristics on a popular spatial database system, PostGIS. We focus on two aspects of dataset characteristics, the degree of overlap and the degree of skew, and propose novel approximation methods to determine these features. We design a benchmark that compares a variety of spatial indexing strategies and data formats, while also considering the impact of dataset characteristics on database performance. We include a variety of real-world and synthetic datasets, write operations, and read queries to cover a broad range of scenarios that might occur during application runtime. Our results offer practical guidance for developers looking to optimize spatial storage and querying, while also providing insights into dataset characteristics and their impact on database performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in 13th IEEE International Conference on Cloud Engineering (IC2E 2025)</p></details> |
| **[On prior smoothing with discrete spatial data in the context of disease mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16151v2)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Disease mapping attempts to explain observed health event counts across areal units, typically using Markov random field models. These models rely on spatial priors to account for variation in raw relative risk or rate estimates. Spatial priors introduce some degree of smoothing, wherein, for any particular unit, empirical risk or incidence estimates are either adjusted towards a suitable mean or incorporate neighbor-based smoothing. While model explanation may be the primary focus, the literature lacks a comparison of the amount of smoothing introduced by different spatial priors. Additionally, there has been no investigation into how varying the parameters of these priors influences the resulting smoothing. This study examines seven commonly used spatial priors through both simulations and real data analyses. Using areal maps of peninsular Spain and England, we analyze smoothing effects using two datasets with associated populations at risk. We propose empirical metrics to quantify the smoothing achieved by each model and theoretical metrics to calibrate the expected extent of smoothing as a function of model parameters. We employ areal maps in order to quantitatively characterize the extent of smoothing within and across the models as well as to link the theoretical metrics to the empirical metrics.</p></details> | 3 figures, 6 tables |

Transformer-based methods have become prevalent in online HD map construction; however, existing approaches often neglect the inherent spatial and semantic relationships among map elements, which limits their accuracy and generalization. To address this, we propose RelMap, an end-to-end framework that enhances online map construction by incorporating spatial relations and semantic priors. We introduce a Class-aware Spatial Relation Prior, which explicitly encodes relative positional dependencies between map elements using a learnable class-aware relation encoder. Additionally, we propose a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based Semantic Prior, which routes features to class-specific experts based on predicted class probabilities, refining instance feature decoding. Our method is compatible with both single-frame and temporal perception backbones, achieving state-of-the-art performance on both the nuScenes and Argoverse 2 datasets.</p></details> |  |

Although recent approaches predict gene expression from histology images, these methods require large external datasets, which leads to high-cost and suffers from substantial domain discrepancies that lead to poor generalization on new samples. In this work, we introduce ST-DAI, a single-shot framework for 3D ST that couples a cost-efficient 2.5D sampling scheme with an intra-sample domain-adaptive imputation framework. First, in the cost-efficient 2.5D sampling stage, one reference section (central section) is fully sampled while other sections (adjacent sections) is sparsely sampled, thereby capturing volumetric context at significantly reduced experimental cost. Second, we propose a single-shot 3D imputation learning method that allows us to generate fully sampled 3D ST from this cost-efficient 2.5D ST scheme, using only sample-specific training. We observe position misalignment and domain discrepancy between sections. To address those issues, we adopt a pipeline that first aligns the central section to the adjacent section, thereafter generates dense pseudo-supervision on the central section, and then performs Fast Multi-Domain Refinement (FMDR), which adapts the network to the domain of the adjacent section while fine-tuning only a few parameters through the use of Parameter-Efficient Domain-Alignment Layers (PDLs). During this refinement, a Confidence Score Generator (CSG) reweights the pseudo-labels according to their estimated reliability, thereby directing imputation toward trustworthy regions. Our experimental results demonstrate that ST-DAI achieves gene expression prediction performance comparable to fully sampled approaches while substantially reducing the measurement burden.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables, under review</p></details> |
| **[Reconstructing 4D Spatial Intelligence: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21045v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing 4D spatial intelligence from visual observations has long been a central yet challenging task in computer vision, with broad real-world applications. These range from entertainment domains like movies, where the focus is often on reconstructing fundamental visual elements, to embodied AI, which emphasizes interaction modeling and physical realism. Fueled by rapid advances in 3D representations and deep learning architectures, the field has evolved quickly, outpacing the scope of previous surveys. Additionally, existing surveys rarely offer a comprehensive analysis of the hierarchical structure of 4D scene reconstruction. To address this gap, we present a new perspective that organizes existing methods into five progressive levels of 4D spatial intelligence: (1) Level 1 -- reconstruction of low-level 3D attributes (e.g., depth, pose, and point maps); (2) Level 2 -- reconstruction of 3D scene components (e.g., objects, humans, structures); (3) Level 3 -- reconstruction of 4D dynamic scenes; (4) Level 4 -- modeling of interactions among scene components; and (5) Level 5 -- incorporation of physical laws and constraints. We conclude the survey by discussing the key challenges at each level and highlighting promising directions for advancing toward even richer levels of 4D spatial intelligence.

| **[A multivariate spatial model for ordinal survey-based data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20944v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Health surveys provide valuable information for monitoring population health, identifying risk factors and informing public health policies. Most of the questions included are coded as ordinal variables and organized into thematic blocks. Accordingly, multivariate modeling provides a natural framework for considering these variables as true groups, thereby accounting for potential dependencies among the responses within each block. In this paper, we propose a multivariate spatial analysis of ordinal survey-based data. This multivariate approach enables the joint analysis of sets of ordinal responses that are likely to be correlated, accounting for individual-level effects, while simultaneously improving the estimation of the geographical patterns for each variable and capturing their interdependencies. We apply this methodology to describe the spatial distribution of several mental health indicators from the Health Survey of the Region of Valencia (Spain) for the year 2022. Specifically, we analyze the block of questions from the 12-item General Health Questionnaire included in the survey.</p></details> |  |

It leverages the richness of stochastic modelling and ensemble learning, making it robust, scalable and suitable for large datasets. In addition, Spatialize provides a powerful framework for uncertainty quantification, offering both point estimates and empirical posterior distributions. It is implemented in Python 3.x, with a C++ core for improved performance, and is designed to be easy to use, requiring minimal user intervention. This library aims to bridge the gap between expert and non-expert users of geostatistics by providing automated tools that rival traditional geostatistical methods. Here, we present a detailed description of Spatialize along with a wealth of examples of its use.</p></details> |  |
| **[How to Bridge Spatial and Temporal Heterogeneity in Link Prediction? A Contrastive Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00612v2)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal Heterogeneous Networks play a crucial role in capturing the dynamics and heterogeneity inherent in various real-world complex systems, rendering them a noteworthy research avenue for link prediction. However, existing methods fail to capture the fine-grained differential distribution patterns and temporal dynamic characteristics, which we refer to as spatial heterogeneity and temporal heterogeneity. To overcome such limitations, we propose a novel \textbf{C}ontrastive Learning-based \textbf{L}ink \textbf{P}rediction model, \textbf{CLP}, which employs a multi-view hierarchical self-supervised architecture to encode spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Specifically, aiming at spatial heterogeneity, we develop a spatial feature modeling layer to capture the fine-grained topological distribution patterns from node- and edge-level representations, respectively. Furthermore, aiming at temporal heterogeneity, we devise a temporal information modeling layer to perceive the evolutionary dependencies of dynamic graph topologies from time-level representations. Finally, we encode the spatial and temporal distribution heterogeneity from a contrastive learning perspective, enabling a comprehensive self-supervised hierarchical relation modeling for the link prediction task. Extensive experiments conducted on four real-world dynamic heterogeneous network datasets verify that our \mymodel consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art models, demonstrating an average improvement of 10.10\%, 13.44\% in terms of AUC and AP, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Spatial Reasoning through Visual and Textual Thinking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20529v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The spatial reasoning task aims to reason about the spatial relationships in 2D and 3D space, which is a fundamental capability for Visual Question Answering (VQA) and robotics. Although vision language models (VLMs) have developed rapidly in recent years, they are still struggling with the spatial reasoning task. In this paper, we introduce a method that can enhance Spatial reasoning through Visual and Textual thinking Simultaneously (SpatialVTS). In the spatial visual thinking phase, our model is trained to generate location-related specific tokens of essential targets automatically. Not only are the objects mentioned in the problem addressed, but also the potential objects related to the reasoning are considered. During the spatial textual thinking phase, Our model conducts long-term thinking based on visual cues and dialogues, gradually inferring the answers to spatial reasoning problems. To effectively support the model's training, we perform manual corrections to the existing spatial reasoning dataset, eliminating numerous incorrect labels resulting from automatic annotation, restructuring the data input format to enhance generalization ability, and developing thinking processes with logical reasoning details. Without introducing additional information (such as masks or depth), our model's overall average level in several spatial understanding tasks has significantly improved compared with other models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Investigating the Effect of Spatial Context on Multi-Task Sea Ice Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20507v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Capturing spatial context at multiple scales is crucial for deep learning-based sea ice segmentation. However, the optimal specification of spatial context based on observation resolution and task characteristics remains underexplored. This study investigates the impact of spatial context on the segmentation of sea ice concentration, stage of development, and floe size using a multi-task segmentation model. We implement Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling with varying atrous rates to systematically control the receptive field size of convolutional operations, and to capture multi-scale contextual information. We explore the interactions between spatial context and feature resolution for different sea ice properties and examine how spatial context influences segmentation performance across different input feature combinations from Sentinel-1 SAR and Advanced Microwave Radiometer-2 (AMSR2) for multi-task mapping. Using Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping, we visualize how atrous rates influence model decisions. Our findings indicate that smaller receptive fields excel for high-resolution Sentinel-1 data, while medium receptive fields yield better performances for stage of development segmentation and larger receptive fields often lead to diminished performances. The fusion of SAR and AMSR2 enhances segmentation across all tasks. We highlight the value of lower-resolution 18.7 and 36.5 GHz AMSR2 channels in sea ice mapping. These findings highlight the importance of selecting appropriate spatial context based on observation resolution and target properties in sea ice mapping. By systematically analyzing receptive field effects in a multi-task setting, our study provides insights for optimizing deep learning models in geospatial applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hypergraph Neural Networks Reveal Spatial Domains from Single-cell Transcriptomics Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19868v2)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The task of spatial clustering of transcriptomics data is of paramount importance. It enables the classification of tissue samples into diverse subpopulations of cells, which, in turn, facilitates the analysis of the biological functions of clusters, tissue reconstruction, and cell-cell interactions. Many approaches leverage gene expressions, spatial locations, and histological images to detect spatial domains; however, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) as state of the art models suffer from a limitation in the assumption of pairwise connections between nodes. In the case of domain detection in spatial transcriptomics, some cells are found to be not directly related. Still, they are grouped as the same domain, which shows the incapability of GNNs for capturing implicit connections among the cells. While graph edges connect only two nodes, hyperedges connect an arbitrary number of nodes along their edges, which lets Hypergraph Neural Networks (HGNNs) capture and utilize richer and more complex structural information than traditional GNNs. We use autoencoders to address the limitation of not having the actual labels, which are well-suited for unsupervised learning. Our model has demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving the highest iLISI score of 1.843 compared to other methods. This score indicates the greatest diversity of cell types identified by our method. Furthermore, our model outperforms other methods in downstream clustering, achieving the highest ARI values of 0.51 and Leiden score of 0.60.</p></details> |  |

Vision-Language models Still Struggle With Spatial Understanding Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20174v1)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world applications, such as autonomous driving and humanoid robot manipulation, require precise spatial perception. However, it remains underexplored how Vision-Language Models (VLMs) recognize spatial relationships and perceive spatial movement. In this work, we introduce a spatial evaluation pipeline and construct a corresponding benchmark. Specifically, we categorize spatial understanding into two main types: absolute spatial understanding, which involves querying the absolute spatial position (e.g., left, right) of an object within an image, and 3D spatial understanding, which includes movement and rotation. Notably, our dataset is entirely synthetic, enabling the generation of test samples at a low cost while also preventing dataset contamination. We conduct experiments on multiple state-of-the-art VLMs and observe that there is significant room for improvement in their spatial understanding abilities. Explicitly, in our experiments, humans achieve near-perfect performance on all tasks, whereas current VLMs attain human-level performance only on the two simplest tasks. For the remaining tasks, the performance of VLMs is distinctly lower than that of humans. In fact, the best-performing Vision-Language Models even achieve near-zero scores on multiple tasks.

High-fidelity masks are converted into normalized 3D coordinates, from which we extract multi-metric spatial descriptors: principal component directions, kernel density hotspots, size-depth regression, and Delaunay edge statistics. We present four representative examples to illustrate key fragmentation patterns. Experimental results confirm the framework's accuracy, robustness to small-object crowding, and feasibility for rapid, automated blast-effect assessment in field conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Combined Channel Approach for Decoding Intracranial EEG Signals: Enhancing Accuracy through Spatial Information Integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06336v2)** | 2025-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intracranial EEG (iEEG) recording, characterized by high spatial and temporal resolution and superior signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), enables the development of precise brain-computer interface (BCI) systems for neural decoding. However, the invasive nature of the procedure significantly limits the availability of iEEG datasets in terms of both the number of participants and the duration of recorded sessions. To address this limitation, we propose a single-participant machine learning model optimized for decoding iEEG signals. The model employs 18 key features and operates in two modes: best channel and combined channel. The combined channel mode integrates spatial information from multiple brain regions, leading to superior classification performance. Evaluations across three datasets -- Music Reconstruction, Audio Visual, and AJILE12 -- demonstrate that the combined channel mode consistently outperforms the best channel mode across all classifiers. In the best-performing cases, Random Forest achieved an F1 score of 0.81 +/- 0.05 in the Music Reconstruction dataset and 0.82 +/- 0.10 in the Audio Visual dataset, while XGBoost achieved an F1 score of 0.84 +/- 0.08 in the AJILE12 dataset. Furthermore, the analysis of brain region contributions in the combined channel mode revealed that the model identifies relevant brain regions aligned with physiological expectations for each task and effectively combines data from electrodes in these regions to achieve high performance. These findings highlight the potential of integrating spatial information across brain regions to improve task decoding, offering new avenues for advancing BCI systems and neurotechnological applications.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods often overlook specific body part movements and their timing. In this paper, we address this issue by enriching the textual description with more details. Specifically, we propose the FineMotion dataset, which contains over 442,000 human motion snippets - short segments of human motion sequences - and their corresponding detailed descriptions of human body part movements. Additionally, the dataset includes about 95k detailed paragraphs describing the movements of human body parts of entire motion sequences. Experimental results demonstrate the significance of our dataset on the text-driven finegrained human motion generation task, especially with a remarkable +15.3% improvement in Top-3 accuracy for the MDM model. Notably, we further support a zero-shot pipeline of fine-grained motion editing, which focuses on detailed editing in both spatial and temporal dimensions via text.

The synergistic reasoning of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) enables cross-modal 3D spatial constraint construction. Nevertheless, existing methods have three key limitations: (1) coarse semantic granularity in constraint modeling, (2) lack of real-time closed-loop planning, (3) compromised robustness in semantically diverse environments. To address these challenges, we propose ReSem3D, a unified manipulation framework for semantically diverse environments, leveraging the synergy between VFMs and MLLMs to achieve fine-grained visual grounding and dynamically constructs hierarchical 3D spatial constraints for real-time manipulation. Specifically, the framework is driven by hierarchical recursive reasoning in MLLMs, which interact with VFMs to automatically construct 3D spatial constraints from natural language instructions and RGB-D observations in two stages: part-level extraction and region-level refinement. Subsequently, these constraints are encoded as real-time optimization objectives in joint space, enabling reactive behavior to dynamic disturbances. Extensive simulation and real-world experiments are conducted in semantically rich household and sparse chemical lab environments. The results demonstrate that ReSem3D performs diverse manipulation tasks under zero-shot conditions, exhibiting strong adaptability and generalization.

The first uses a particle filter reweighted via magnetic similarity, employing a heavy-tailed non-Gaussian kernel for enhanced stability. The second is a stateless sequence alignment technique that transforms real-time magnetic signals into the spatial domain and matches them to the map using a similarity measure. Experiments with operational train data show that the particle filter achieves track-selective, sub-5-meter accuracy over 21.6 km, though its performance degrades at low speeds and during cold starts. Accuracy tests were constrained by the GNSS-based reference system. In contrast, the alignment-based method excels in cold-start scenarios, localizing within 30 m in 92 % of tests (100 % using top-3 matches). A hybrid approach combines both methods$\unicode{x2014}$alignment-based initialization followed by particle filter tracking. Runtime analysis confirms real-time capability on consumer-grade hardware.

| **[Cross Spatial Temporal Fusion Attention for Remote Sensing Object Detection via Image Feature Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19118v1)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effectively describing features for cross-modal remote sensing image matching remains a challenging task due to the significant geometric and radiometric differences between multimodal images. Existing methods primarily extract features at the fully connected layer but often fail to capture cross-modal similarities effectively. We propose a Cross Spatial Temporal Fusion (CSTF) mechanism that enhances feature representation by integrating scale-invariant keypoints detected independently in both reference and query images. Our approach improves feature matching in two ways: First, by creating correspondence maps that leverage information from multiple image regions simultaneously, and second, by reformulating the similarity matching process as a classification task using SoftMax and Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) layers. This dual approach enables CSTF to maintain sensitivity to distinctive local features while incorporating broader contextual information, resulting in robust matching across diverse remote sensing modalities. To demonstrate the practical utility of improved feature matching, we evaluate CSTF on object detection tasks using the HRSC2016 and DOTA benchmark datasets. Our method achieves state-of-theart performance with an average mAP of 90.99% on HRSC2016 and 90.86% on DOTA, outperforming existing models. The CSTF model maintains computational efficiency with an inference speed of 12.5 FPS. These results validate that our approach to crossmodal feature matching directly enhances downstream remote sensing applications such as object detection.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in medical anomaly detection have demonstrated the effectiveness of CNN- and transformer-based approaches. However, CNNs exhibit limitations in capturing long-range dependencies, while transformers suffer from quadratic computational complexity. In contrast, Mamba-based models, leveraging superior long-range modeling, structural feature extraction, and linear computational efficiency, have emerged as a promising alternative. To capitalize on the inherent structural regularity of medical images, this study introduces SP-Mamba, a spatial-perception Mamba framework for unsupervised medical anomaly detection. The window-sliding prototype learning and Circular-Hilbert scanning-based Mamba are introduced to better exploit consistent anatomical patterns and leverage spatial information for medical anomaly detection. Furthermore, we excavate the concentration and contrast characteristics of anomaly maps for improving anomaly detection. Extensive experiments on three diverse medical anomaly detection benchmarks confirm the proposed method's state-of-the-art performance, validating its efficacy and robustness.

However, existing techniques often couple tracking speed adjustments directly with hand movements, reducing interaction flexibility. Inspired by the natural friction control inherent in the physical world, we introduce ForcePinch, a novel force-responsive spatial interaction method that enables users to intuitively modulate pointer tracking speed and smoothly transition between rapid and precise movements by varying their pinching force. To implement this concept, we developed a hardware prototype integrating a pressure sensor with a customizable mapping function that translates pinching force into tracking speed adjustments. We conducted a user study with 20 participants performing well-established 1D, 2D, and 3D object manipulation tasks, comparing ForcePinch against the distance-responsive technique Go-Go and speed-responsive technique PRISM. Results highlight distinctive characteristics of the force-responsive approach across different interaction contexts. Drawing on these findings, we highlight the contextual meaning and versatility of force-responsive interactions through four illustrative examples, aiming to inform and inspire future spatial interaction design.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, Coordinated Spatial Reuse (Co-SR) can potentially contribute to optimizing spectrum resource utilization. This mechanism is expected to enable simultaneous transmissions, thereby boosting spectral efficiency in dense environments and increasing the overall network performance. In this paper, we shed light on the performance of Co-SR for Wi-Fi 8 networks. For that, we propose an implementation of Co-SR aligned with ongoing Wi-Fi 8 standardization efforts. The evaluation is done on a Wi-Fi simulator, which allows us to study the performance of the proposed Co-SR mechanisms in relevant scenarios. The results obtained in a Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) consisting of four APs show delay reduction with Co-SR ranging from 31% to 95% when compared to Distributed Coordination Function (DCF).</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Communications Standards Magazine</p></details> |

Unlike the abundant 2D imagery, acquiring 3D data typically requires specialized sensors and laborious annotation. In this work, we present a scalable pipeline that converts single-view images into comprehensive, scale- and appearance-realistic 3D representations - including point clouds, camera poses, depth maps, and pseudo-RGBD - via integrated depth estimation, camera calibration, and scale calibration. Our method bridges the gap between the vast repository of imagery and the increasing demand for spatial scene understanding. By automatically generating authentic, scale-aware 3D data from images, we significantly reduce data collection costs and open new avenues for advancing spatial intelligence. We release two generated spatial datasets, i.e., COCO-3D and Objects365-v2-3D, and demonstrate through extensive experiments that our generated data can benefit various 3D tasks, ranging from fundamental perception to MLLM-based reasoning. These results validate our pipeline as an effective solution for developing AI systems capable of perceiving, understanding, and interacting with physical environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025 (Highlight)</p></details> |

The discrete negative Laplace operator is implemented using the finite element method, and we establish that its \(H^\infty\)-calculus is uniformly bounded with respect to the spatial mesh size. Using this finding, we derive a discrete stochastic maximal \(L^p\)-regularity estimate for a spatial semidiscretization of a linear stochastic heat equation. Furthermore, we provide a nearly optimal pathwise uniform convergence estimate for this spatial semidiscretization within the framework of general spatial \(L^q\)-norms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating judgment of spatial correlation in visual displays of scalar field distributions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17997v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work we study the identification of spatial correlation in distributions of 2D scalar fields, presented across different forms of visual displays. We study simple visual displays that directly show color-mapped scalar fields, namely those drawn from a distribution, and whether humans can identify strongly correlated spatial regions in these displays. In this setting, the recognition of correlation requires making judgments on a set of fields, rather than just one field. Thus, in our experimental design we compare two basic visualization designs: animation-based displays against juxtaposed views of scalar fields, along different choices of color scales. Moreover, we investigate the impacts of the distribution itself, controlling for the level of spatial correlation and discriminability in spatial scales. Our study's results illustrate the impacts of these distribution characteristics, while also highlighting how different visual displays impact the types of judgments made in assessing spatial correlation.

| **[Nonparametric inference for nonstationary spatial point processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17600v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Point pattern data often exhibit features such as abrupt changes, hotspots and spatially varying dependence in local intensity. Under a Poisson process framework, these correspond to discontinuities and nonstationarity in the underlying intensity function -- features that are difficult to capture with standard modeling approaches. This paper proposes a spatial Cox process model in which nonstationarity is induced through a random partition of the spatial domain, with conditionally independent Gaussian process priors specified across the resulting regions. This construction allows for heterogeneous spatial behavior, including sharp transitions in intensity. To ensure exact inference, a discretization-free MCMC algorithm is developed to target the infinite-dimensional posterior distribution without approximation. The random partition framework also reduces the computational burden typically associated with Gaussian process models. Spatial covariates can be incorporated to account for structured variation in intensity. The proposed methodology is evaluated through synthetic examples and real-world applications, demonstrating its ability to flexibly capture complex spatial structures. The paper concludes with a discussion of potential extensions and directions for future work.</p></details> |  |

Building foundational models for ST can significantly enhance the analysis of vast and complex data sources, unlocking new perspectives on the intricacies of biological tissues. However, modeling ST data is inherently challenging due to the need to extract multi-scale information from tissue slices containing vast numbers of cells. This process requires integrating macro-scale tissue morphology, micro-scale cellular microenvironment, and gene-scale gene expression profile. To address this challenge, we propose SToFM, a multi-scale Spatial Transcriptomics Foundation Model. SToFM first performs multi-scale information extraction on each ST slice, to construct a set of ST sub-slices that aggregate macro-, micro- and gene-scale information. Then an SE(2) Transformer is used to obtain high-quality cell representations from the sub-slices. Additionally, we construct \textbf{SToCorpus-88M}, the largest high-resolution spatial transcriptomics corpus for pretraining. SToFM achieves outstanding performance on a variety of downstream tasks, such as tissue region semantic segmentation and cell type annotation, demonstrating its comprehensive understanding of ST data through capturing and integrating multi-scale information.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accpe...</summary><p>Accpeted by ICML 2025</p></details> |

In particular, the effective exploitation of spatial-temporal correlations between point cloud frames remains largely unexplored. Addressing this gap, we propose a spatial-temporal attribute quality enhancement (STQE) network that exploits both spatial and temporal correlations to improve the visual quality of G-PCC compressed dynamic point clouds. Our contributions include a recoloring-based motion compensation module that remaps reference attribute information to the current frame geometry to achieve precise inter-frame geometric alignment, a channel-aware temporal attention module that dynamically highlights relevant regions across bidirectional reference frames, a Gaussian-guided neighborhood feature aggregation module that efficiently captures spatial dependencies between geometry and color attributes, and a joint loss function based on the Pearson correlation coefficient, designed to alleviate over-smoothing effects typical of point-wise mean squared error optimization. When applied to the latest G-PCC test model, STQE achieved improvements of 0.855 dB, 0.682 dB, and 0.828 dB in delta PSNR, with Bj{\o}ntegaard Delta rate (BD-rate) reductions of -25.2%, -31.6%, and -32.5% for the Luma, Cb, and Cr components, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Spatial Diversity for Region-based Active Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17367v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-of-the-art methods for semantic segmentation are based on deep neural networks trained on large-scale labeled datasets. Acquiring such datasets would incur large annotation costs, especially for dense pixel-level prediction tasks like semantic segmentation. We consider region-based active learning as a strategy to reduce annotation costs while maintaining high performance. In this setting, batches of informative image regions instead of entire images are selected for labeling. Importantly, we propose that enforcing local spatial diversity is beneficial for active learning in this case, and to incorporate spatial diversity along with the traditional active selection criterion, e.g., data sample uncertainty, in a unified optimization framework for region-based active learning. We apply this framework to the Cityscapes and PASCAL VOC datasets and demonstrate that the inclusion of spatial diversity effectively improves the performance of uncertainty-based and feature diversity-based active learning methods. Our framework achieves $95\%$ performance of fully supervised methods with only $5-9\%$ of the labeled pixels, outperforming all state-of-the-art region-based active learning methods for semantic segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>publi...</summary><p>published in IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 2021</p></details> |
| **[SFNet: A Spatial-Frequency Domain Deep Learning Network for Efficient Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16267v2)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that predominantly affects the elderly population and currently has no cure. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), as a non-invasive imaging technique, is essential for the early diagnosis of AD. MRI inherently contains both spatial and frequency information, as raw signals are acquired in the frequency domain and reconstructed into spatial images via the Fourier transform. However, most existing AD diagnostic models extract features from a single domain, limiting their capacity to fully capture the complex neuroimaging characteristics of the disease. While some studies have combined spatial and frequency information, they are mostly confined to 2D MRI, leaving the potential of dual-domain analysis in 3D MRI unexplored. To overcome this limitation, we propose Spatio-Frequency Network (SFNet), the first end-to-end deep learning framework that simultaneously leverages spatial and frequency domain information to enhance 3D MRI-based AD diagnosis. SFNet integrates an enhanced dense convolutional network to extract local spatial features and a global frequency module to capture global frequency-domain representations. Additionally, a novel multi-scale attention module is proposed to further refine spatial feature extraction. Experiments on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset demonstrate that SFNet outperforms existing baselines and reduces computational overhead in classifying cognitively normal (CN) and AD, achieving an accuracy of 95.1%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial Frequency Modulation for Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11893v2)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High spatial frequency information, including fine details like textures, significantly contributes to the accuracy of semantic segmentation. However, according to the Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem, high-frequency components are vulnerable to aliasing or distortion when propagating through downsampling layers such as strided-convolution. Here, we propose a novel Spatial Frequency Modulation (SFM) that modulates high-frequency features to a lower frequency before downsampling and then demodulates them back during upsampling. Specifically, we implement modulation through adaptive resampling (ARS) and design a lightweight add-on that can densely sample the high-frequency areas to scale up the signal, thereby lowering its frequency in accordance with the Frequency Scaling Property. We also propose Multi-Scale Adaptive Upsampling (MSAU) to demodulate the modulated feature and recover high-frequency information through non-uniform upsampling This module further improves segmentation by explicitly exploiting information interaction between densely and sparsely resampled areas at multiple scales. Both modules can seamlessly integrate with various architectures, extending from convolutional neural networks to transformers. Feature visualization and analysis confirm that our method effectively alleviates aliasing while successfully retaining details after demodulation. Finally, we validate the broad applicability and effectiveness of SFM by extending it to image classification, adversarial robustness, instance segmentation, and panoptic segmentation tasks.

| **[Efficient Bayesian Inference for Spatial Point Patterns Using the Palm Likelihood](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17065v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bayesian inference for spatial point patterns is often hindered computationally by intractable likelihoods. In the frequentist literature, estimating equations utilizing pseudolikelihoods have long been used for simulation-free parameter estimation. One such pseudolikelihood based on the process of differences is known as the Palm likelihood. Utilizing notions of Bayesian composite likelihoods and generalized Bayesian inference, we develop a framework for the use of Palm likelihoods in a Bayesian context. Naive implementation of the Palm likelihood results in posterior undercoverage of model parameters. We propose two approaches to remedy this issue and calibrate the resulting posterior. Numerical simulations illustrate both the efficacy of the method in terms of statistical properties and the superiority in terms of computational efficiency when compared to classical Markov chain Monte Carlo. The method is then applied to the popular \textit{Beilschmiedia pendula Lauraceae} dataset.</p></details> |  |

However, the high cost and scarcity of high resolution ST data remain significant challenges. We present Single-shot Sparser-to-Sparse (S2S-ST), a novel framework for accurate ST imputation that requires only a single and low-cost sparsely sampled ST dataset alongside widely available natural images for co-training. Our approach integrates three key innovations: (1) a sparser-to-sparse self-supervised learning strategy that leverages intrinsic spatial patterns in ST data, (2) cross-domain co-learning with natural images to enhance feature representation, and (3) a Cascaded Data Consistent Imputation Network (CDCIN) that iteratively refines predictions while preserving sampled gene data fidelity. Extensive experiments on diverse tissue types, including breast cancer, liver, and lymphoid tissue, demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in imputation accuracy. By enabling robust ST reconstruction from sparse inputs, our framework significantly reduces reliance on costly high resolution data, facilitating potential broader adoption in biomedical research and clinical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 5 figure, under review</p></details> |
| **[A Partitioned Sparse Variational Gaussian Process for Fast, Distributed Spatial Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16771v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The next generation of Department of Energy supercomputers will be capable of exascale computation. For these machines, far more computation will be possible than that which can be saved to disk. As a result, users will be unable to rely on post-hoc access to data for uncertainty quantification and other statistical analyses and there will be an urgent need for sophisticated machine learning algorithms which can be trained in situ. Algorithms deployed in this setting must be highly scalable, memory efficient and capable of handling data which is distributed across nodes as spatially contiguous partitions. One suitable approach involves fitting a sparse variational Gaussian process (SVGP) model independently and in parallel to each spatial partition. The resulting model is scalable, efficient and generally accurate, but produces the undesirable effect of constructing discontinuous response surfaces due to the disagreement between neighboring models at their shared boundary. In this paper, we extend this idea by allowing for a small amount of communication between neighboring spatial partitions which encourages better alignment of the local models, leading to smoother spatial predictions and a better fit in general. Due to our decentralized communication scheme, the proposed extension remains highly scalable and adds very little overhead in terms of computation (and none, in terms of memory). We demonstrate this Partitioned SVGP (PSVGP) approach for the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) and compare the results to the independent SVGP case.</p></details> |  |

However, existing audio-language models struggle with processing spatial audio and perceiving spatial acoustic scenes. We introduce the Spatial Audio Language Model (SALM), a novel framework that bridges spatial audio and language via multi-modal contrastive learning. SALM consists of a text encoder and a dual-branch audio encoder, decomposing spatial sound into semantic and spatial components through structured audio embeddings. Key features of SALM include seamless alignment of spatial and text representations, separate and joint extraction of spatial and semantic information, zero-shot direction classification and robust support for spatial audio editing. Experimental results demonstrate that SALM effectively captures and aligns cross-modal representations. Furthermore, it supports advanced editing capabilities, such as altering directional audio using text-based embeddings.</p></details> | 5 pages, 1 figure |

Existing methods typically necessitate supervised learning based on human-refined masks in the ventricular myocardium, which become impractical without contrast agents. We introduce a self-supervised framework, namely Codebook-based Temporal-Spatial Learning (CTSL), that learns dynamic, spatiotemporal representations from raw Cine data without requiring segmentation masks. CTSL decouples temporal and spatial features through a multi-view distillation strategy, where the teacher model processes multiple Cine views, and the student model learns from reduced-dimensional Cine-SA sequences. By leveraging codebook-based feature representations and dynamic lesion self-detection through motion cues, CTSL captures intricate temporal dependencies and motion patterns. High-confidence MACE risk predictions are achieved through our model, providing a rapid, non-invasive solution for cardiac risk assessment that outperforms traditional contrast-dependent methods, thereby enabling timely and accessible heart disease diagnosis in clinical settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at MICCAI 2025</p></details> |

However, most existing 3D multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) rely on compressing holistic 3D scene information or segmenting independent objects to perform these tasks, which limits their spatial awareness due to insufficient representation of the richness inherent in 3D scenes. To overcome these limitations, we propose Spatial 3D-LLM, a 3D MLLM specifically designed to enhance spatial awareness for 3D vision-language tasks by enriching the spatial embeddings of 3D scenes. Spatial 3D-LLM integrates an LLM backbone with a progressive spatial awareness scheme that progressively captures spatial information as the perception field expands, generating location-enriched 3D scene embeddings to serve as visual prompts. Furthermore, we introduce two novel tasks: 3D object distance measurement and 3D layout editing, and construct a 3D instruction dataset, MODEL, to evaluate the model's spatial awareness capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that Spatial 3D-LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of 3D vision-language tasks, revealing the improvements stemmed from our progressive spatial awareness scheme of mining more profound spatial information.

| **[Multivariate spatial models for small area estimation of species-specific forest inventory parameters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07118v2)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>National Forest Inventories (NFIs) provide statistically reliable information on forest resources at national and other large spatial scales. As forest management and conservation needs become increasingly complex, NFIs are being called upon to provide forest parameter estimates at spatial scales smaller than current design-based estimation procedures can provide. This is particularly true when estimates are desired by species or species groups. Here we propose a multivariate spatial model for small area estimation of species-specific forest inventory parameters. The hierarchical Bayesian modeling framework accounts for key complexities in species-specific forest inventory data, such as zero-inflation, correlations among species, and residual spatial autocorrelation. Importantly, by fitting the model directly to the individual plot-level data, the framework enables estimates of species-level forest parameters, with associated uncertainty, across any user-defined small area of interest. A simulation study revealed minimal bias and higher accuracy of the proposed model-based approach compared to design-based estimator. We applied the model to estimate species-specific county-level aboveground biomass for the 20 most abundant tree species in the southern United States using Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data. Model-based biomass estimates had high correlations with design-based estimates, yet the model-based estimates tended to have a slight positive bias relative to design-based estimates. Importantly, the proposed model provided large gains in precision across all 20 species. On average across species, 91.5% of county-level biomass estimates had higher precision compared to the design-based estimates. The proposed framework improves the ability of NFI data users to generate species-level forest parameter estimates with reasonable precision at management-relevant spatial scales.</p></details> | 40 pages, 7 figures |
| **[A Bayesian Geoadditive Model for Spatial Disaggregation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16376v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel Bayesian spatial disaggregation model for count data, providing fast and flexible inference at high resolution. First, it incorporates non-linear covariate effects using penalized splines, a flexible approach that is not typically included in existing spatial disaggregation methods. Additionally, it employs a spline-based low-rank kriging approximation for modeling spatial dependencies. The use of Laplace approximation provides computational advantages over traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approaches, facilitating scalability to large datasets. We explore two estimation strategies: one using the exact likelihood and another leveraging a spatially discrete approximation for enhanced computational efficiency. Simulation studies demonstrate that both methods perform well, with the approximate method offering significant computational gains. We illustrate the applicability of our model by disaggregating disease rates in the United Kingdom and Belgium, showcasing its potential for generating high-resolution risk maps. By combining flexibility in covariate modeling, computational efficiency and ease of implementation, our approach offers a practical and effective framework for spatial disaggregation.</p></details> |  |

Prior efforts have been made on accurate prediction of bike traffics, i.e., demand/pick-up and return/drop-off, to achieve system efficiency. However, bike station-level traffic prediction is difficult because of the spatial-temporal complexity of bike sharing systems. Moreover, such level of prediction over entire bike sharing systems is also challenging due to the large number of bike stations. To fill this gap, we propose BikeMAN, a multi-level spatio-temporal attention neural network to predict station-level bike traffic for entire bike sharing systems. The proposed network consists of an encoder and a decoder with an attention mechanism representing the spatial correlation between features of bike stations in the system and another attention mechanism describing the temporal characteristic of bike station traffic. Through experimental study on over 10 millions trips of bike sharing systems (> 700 stations) of New York City, our network showed high accuracy in predicting the bike station traffic of all stations in the city.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, UrbComp 2024</p></details> |

Although this task has seen impressive improvements in recent times, a focus on rapidly producing stronger models has come at the cost of detailed and fair scientific comparison. Differing training data, model architectures and generation paradigms make it difficult to disentangle the factors contributing to performance. Meanwhile, the motivations and nuances of certain approaches become lost in the literature. In this work, we aim to provide clear takeaways across generation paradigms for practitioners wishing to develop transformer-based systems for spatially-controlled generation, clarifying the literature and addressing knowledge gaps. We perform controlled experiments on ImageNet across diffusion-based/flow-based and autoregressive (AR) models. First, we establish control token prefilling as a simple, general and performant baseline approach for transformers. We then investigate previously underexplored sampling time enhancements, showing that extending classifier-free guidance to control, as well as softmax truncation, have a strong impact on control-generation consistency. Finally, we re-clarify the motivation of adapter-based approaches, demonstrating that they mitigate "forgetting" and maintain generation quality when trained on limited downstream data, but underperform full training in terms of generation-control consistency. Code will be released upon publication.</p></details> | preprint |

Current DIR implementations rely on discrete volumetric motion representation, which often leads to compromised accuracy and uncertainty when handling significant anatomical changes and sliding boundaries. This limitation affects the reliability of subsequent contour propagation and dose accumulation procedures, particularly in regions with complex anatomical interfaces such as the lung-chest wall boundary. Given that organ motion is inherently a continuous process in both space and time, we aimed to develop a model that preserves these fundamental properties. Drawing inspiration from fluid mechanics, we propose a novel approach using implicit neural representation (INR) for continuous modeling of patient anatomical motion. This approach ensures spatial and temporal continuity while effectively unifying Eulerian and Lagrangian specifications to enable natural continuous motion modeling and frame interpolation. The integration of these specifications provides a more comprehensive understanding of anatomical deformation patterns. By leveraging the continuous representations, the CPT-DIR method significantly enhances registration and interpolation accuracy, automation, and speed. The method demonstrates superior performance in landmark and contour precision, particularly in challenging anatomical regions, representing a substantial advancement over conventional approaches in deformable image registration. The improved efficiency and accuracy of CPT-DIR make it particularly suitable for real-time adaptive radiotherapy applications.</p></details> |  |

However, they still struggle with non-uniform lighting scenarios, such as backlit and shadow, appearing as over-exposure or inadequate brightness restoration. To address this challenge, we present a Spatially-Adaptive Illumination-Guided Transformer (SAIGFormer) framework that enables accurate illumination restoration.

Moreover, we introduce an Illumination-Guided Multi-head Self-Attention (IG-MSA) mechanism, which leverages the illumination to calibrate the lightness-relevant features toward visual-pleased illumination enhancement. Extensive experiments on five standard low-light datasets and a cross-domain benchmark (LOL-Blur) demonstrate that our SAIGFormer significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative metrics. In particular, our method achieves superior performance in non-uniform illumination enhancement while exhibiting strong generalization capabilities across multiple datasets.

Although previous methods leverage Euclidean representations in RGB or depth domains, such embeddings are inherently limited in capturing hierarchical event structures and spatio-temporal continuity. To address these limitations, we propose HyPCV-Former, a novel hyperbolic spatio-temporal transformer for anomaly detection in 3D point cloud videos. Our approach first extracts per-frame spatial features from point cloud sequences via point cloud extractor, and then embeds them into Lorentzian hyperbolic space, which better captures the latent hierarchical structure of events. To model temporal dynamics, we introduce a hyperbolic multi-head self-attention (HMHA) mechanism that leverages Lorentzian inner products and curvature-aware softmax to learn temporal dependencies under non-Euclidean geometry. Our method performs all feature transformations and anomaly scoring directly within full Lorentzian space rather than via tangent space approximation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HyPCV-Former achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple anomaly categories, with a 7\% improvement on the TIMo dataset and a 5.6\% gain on the DAD dataset compared to benchmarks. The code will be released upon paper acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mamba-based Efficient Spatio-Frequency Motion Perception for Video Camouflaged Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23601v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing video camouflaged object detection (VCOD) methods primarily rely on spatial appearance features to perceive motion cues for breaking camouflage. However, the high similarity between foreground and background in VCOD results in limited discriminability of spatial appearance features (e.g., color and texture), restricting detection accuracy and completeness. Recent studies demonstrate that frequency features can not only enhance feature representation to compensate for appearance limitations but also perceive motion through dynamic variations in frequency energy. Furthermore, the emerging state space model called Mamba, enables efficient perception of motion cues in frame sequences due to its linear-time long-sequence modeling capability. Motivated by this, we propose a novel visual camouflage Mamba (Vcamba) based on spatio-frequency motion perception that integrates frequency and spatial features for efficient and accurate VCOD. Specifically, we propose a receptive field visual state space (RFVSS) module to extract multi-scale spatial features after sequence modeling. For frequency learning, we introduce an adaptive frequency component enhancement (AFE) module with a novel frequency-domain sequential scanning strategy to maintain semantic consistency. Then we propose a space-based long-range motion perception (SLMP) module and a frequency-based long-range motion perception (FLMP) module to model spatio-temporal and frequency-temporal sequences in spatial and frequency phase domains. Finally, the space and frequency motion fusion module (SFMF) integrates dual-domain features for unified motion representation. Experimental results show that our Vcamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods across 6 evaluation metrics on 2 datasets with lower computation cost, confirming the superiority of Vcamba. Our code is available at: https://github.com/BoydeLi/Vcamba.</p></details> | 11 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Adjustable Spatio-Spectral Hyperspectral Image Compression Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23447v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid growth of hyperspectral data archives in remote sensing (RS), the need for efficient storage has become essential, driving significant attention toward learning-based hyperspectral image (HSI) compression. However, a comprehensive investigation of the individual and joint effects of spectral and spatial compression on learning-based HSI compression has not been thoroughly examined yet. Conducting such an analysis is crucial for understanding how the exploitation of spectral, spatial, and joint spatio-spectral redundancies affects HSI compression. To address this issue, we propose Adjustable Spatio-Spectral Hyperspectral Image Compression Network (HyCASS), a learning-based model designed for adjustable HSI compression in both spectral and spatial dimensions. HyCASS consists of six main modules: 1) spectral encoder; 2) spatial encoder; 3) compression ratio (CR) adapter encoder; 4) CR adapter decoder; 5) spatial decoder; and 6) spectral decoder module. The modules employ convolutional layers and transformer blocks to capture both short-range and long-range redundancies. Experimental results on two HSI benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed adjustable model compared to existing learning-based compression models. Based on our results, we establish a guideline for effectively balancing spectral and spatial compression across different CRs, taking into account the spatial resolution of the HSIs. Our code and pre-trained model weights are publicly available at https://git.tu-berlin.de/rsim/hycass .</p></details> |  |

A valuable approach to studying them requires accurate spatio-temporal information on land surface conditions. One of the most important variables for assessing and understanding these phenomena is Land Surface Temperature (LST), which is derived from satellites and provides essential information about the thermal state of the Earth's surface. However, satellite platforms inherently face a trade-off between spatial and temporal resolutions. To bridge this gap, we propose FuseTen, a novel generative framework that produces daily LST observations at a fine 10 m spatial resolution by fusing spatio-temporal observations derived from Sentinel-2, Landsat 8, and Terra MODIS. FuseTen employs a generative architecture trained using an averaging-based supervision strategy grounded in physical principles. It incorporates attention and normalization modules within the fusion process and uses a PatchGAN discriminator to enforce realism. Experiments across multiple dates show that FuseTen outperforms linear baselines, with an average 32.06% improvement in quantitative metrics and 31.42% in visual fidelity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first non-linear method to generate daily LST estimates at such fine spatial resolution.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in the 2025 International Conference on Machine Intelligence for GeoAnalytics and Remote Sensing (MIGARS)</p></details> |

Many existing solutions rely on computationally demanding deep learning models, which result in high latency and are unsuitable for embedded robotic devices with limited resources (such as intelligent vehicles/cars) where rapid detection is necessary to prevent accidents. This paper introduces LiteFat, a lightweight spatio-temporal graph learning model designed to detect driver fatigue efficiently while maintaining high accuracy and low computational demands. LiteFat involves converting streaming video data into spatio-temporal graphs (STG) using facial landmark detection, which focuses on key motion patterns and reduces unnecessary data processing. LiteFat uses MobileNet to extract facial features and create a feature matrix for the STG. A lightweight spatio-temporal graph neural network is then employed to identify signs of fatigue with minimal processing and low latency. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that LiteFat performs competitively while significantly decreasing computational complexity and latency as compared to current state-of-the-art methods. This work enables the development of real-time, resource-efficient human fatigue detection systems that can be implemented upon embedded robotic devices.</p></details> | 6 pages, 1 figure |

However, the complexity of data collection, classification, validation and processing result in cancer incidence figures often lagging two to three years behind the calendar year. In response, national or regional population-based cancer registries (PBCRs) are increasingly interested in methods for forecasting cancer incidence. However, in many countries there is an additional difficulty in projecting cancer incidence as regional registries are usually not established in the same year and therefore cancer incidence data series between different regions of a country are not harmonised over time. This study addresses the challenge of forecasting cancer incidence with incomplete data at both regional and national levels. To achieve our objective, we propose the use of multivariate spatio-temporal shared component models that jointly model mortality data and available cancer incidence data. The performance of these multivariate models are analyzed using lung cancer incidence data, together with the number of deaths reported in England in the period 2001-2019. Different model predictive measures have been calculated to select the best model.</p></details> | 36 pages |

However, these box annotations require tremendous human effort, limiting the scale and diversity of existing tracking datasets. In this work, we present a novel Self-Supervised Tracking framework named \textbf{{\tracker}}, designed to eliminate the need of box annotations. Specifically, a decoupled spatio-temporal consistency training framework is proposed to learn rich target information across timestamps through global spatial localization and local temporal association. This allows for the simulation of appearance and motion variations of instances in real-world scenarios. Furthermore, an instance contrastive loss is designed to learn instance-level correspondences from a multi-view perspective, offering robust instance supervision without additional labels. This new design paradigm enables {\tracker} to effectively learn generic tracking representations in a self-supervised manner, while reducing reliance on extensive box annotations. Extensive experiments on nine benchmark datasets demonstrate that {\tracker} surpasses \textit{SOTA} self-supervised tracking methods, achieving an improvement of more than 25.3\%, 20.4\%, and 14.8\% in AUC (AO) score on the GOT10K, LaSOT, TrackingNet datasets, respectively.

Buildings with similar features often share energy patterns, reflected by spatial dependencies in their operational data, which conventional prediction methods struggle to capture. To overcome this, we propose a multi-building prediction approach using spatio-temporal graph neural networks, comprising graph representation, graph learning, and interpretation. First, a graph is built based on building characteristics and environmental factors. Next, a multi-level graph convolutional architecture with attention is developed for energy prediction. Lastly, a method interpreting the optimized graph structure is introduced. Experiments on the Building Data Genome Project 2 dataset confirm superior performance over baselines such as XGBoost, SVR, FCNN, GRU, and Naive, highlighting the method's robustness, generalization, and interpretability in capturing meaningful building similarities and spatial relationships.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches often struggle to effectively model the intricate interdependencies among spatial, temporal, and contextual variables that govern accident outcomes. In this study, we introduce STARN-GAT, a Multi-Modal Spatio-Temporal Graph Attention Network, which leverages adaptive graph construction and modality-aware attention mechanisms to capture these complex relationships. Unlike conventional methods, STARN-GAT integrates road network topology, temporal traffic patterns, and environmental context within a unified attention-based framework. The model is evaluated on the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) dataset, achieving a Macro F1-score of 85 percent, ROC-AUC of 0.91, and recall of 81 percent for severe incidents. To ensure generalizability within the South Asian context, STARN-GAT is further validated on the ARI-BUET traffic accident dataset, where it attains a Macro F1-score of 0.84, recall of 0.78, and ROC-AUC of 0.89. These results demonstrate the model's effectiveness in identifying high-risk cases and its potential for deployment in real-time, safety-critical traffic management systems. Furthermore, the attention-based architecture enhances interpretability, offering insights into contributing factors and supporting trust in AI-assisted decision-making. Overall, STARN-GAT bridges the gap between advanced graph neural network techniques and practical applications in road safety analytics.</p></details> | 10 pages |

Existing state-of-the-art methods, like Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs), achieve high imputation accuracy; however, they suffer from significant computational costs and are notably time-consuming due to their iterative nature. In this work, we propose CoSTI, an innovative adaptation of Consistency Models (CMs) for the MTSI domain. CoSTI employs Consistency Training to achieve comparable imputation quality to DDPMs while drastically reducing inference times, making it more suitable for real-time applications. We evaluate CoSTI across multiple datasets and missing data scenarios, demonstrating up to a 98% reduction in imputation time with performance on par with diffusion-based models. This work bridges the gap between efficiency and accuracy in generative imputation tasks, providing a scalable solution for handling missing data in critical spatio-temporal systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 7 figures, 13 tables</p></details> |

However, obtaining lane-level traffic data has become a critical bottleneck for data-driven models due to limitations in the types and number of sensors and issues with the accuracy of tracking algorithms. To address this, we propose the Fine-grained Road Traffic Inference (FRTI) task, which aims to generate more detailed lane-level traffic information using limited road data, providing a more energy-efficient and cost-effective solution for precise traffic management. This task is abstracted as the first scene of the spatio-temporal graph node generation problem. We designed a two-stage framework--RoadDiff--to solve the FRTI task. solve the FRTI task. This framework leverages the Road-Lane Correlation Autoencoder-Decoder and the Lane Diffusion Module to fully utilize the limited spatio-temporal dependencies and distribution relationships of road data to accurately infer fine-grained lane traffic states. Based on existing research, we designed several baseline models with the potential to solve the FRTI task and conducted extensive experiments on six datasets representing different road conditions to validate the effectiveness of the RoadDiff model in addressing the FRTI task. The relevant datasets and code are available at https://github.com/ShuhaoLii/RoadDiff.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging Sequential Deep Operator Network and Video Diffusion: Residual Refinement of Spatio-Temporal PDE Solutions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06133v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video-diffusion models have recently set the standard in video generation, inpainting, and domain translation thanks to their training stability and high perceptual fidelity. Building on these strengths, we repurpose conditional video diffusion as a physics surrogate for spatio-temporal fields governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). Our two-stage surrogate first applies a Sequential Deep Operator Network (S-DeepONet) to produce a coarse, physics-consistent prior from the prescribed boundary or loading conditions. The prior is then passed to a conditional video diffusion model that learns only the residual: the point-wise difference between the ground truth and the S-DeepONet prediction. By shifting the learning burden from the full solution to its much smaller residual space, diffusion can focus on sharpening high-frequency structures without sacrificing global coherence. The framework is assessed on two disparate benchmarks: (i) vortex-dominated lid-driven cavity flow and (ii) tensile plastic deformation of dogbone specimens. Across these data sets the hybrid surrogate consistently outperforms its single-stage counterpart, cutting the mean relative L2 error from 4.57% to 0.83% for the flow problem and from 4.42% to 2.94% for plasticity, a relative improvements of 81.8% and 33.5% respectively. The hybrid approach not only lowers quantitative errors but also improves visual quality, visibly recovering fine spatial details. These results show that (i) conditioning diffusion on a physics-aware prior enables faithful reconstruction of localized features, (ii) residual learning reduces the problem, accelerating convergence and enhancing accuracy, and (iii) the same architecture transfers seamlessly from incompressible flow to nonlinear elasto-plasticity without problem-specific architectural modifications, highlighting its broad applicability to nonlinear, time-dependent continua.</p></details> |  |
| **[IntentVCNet: Bridging Spatio-Temporal Gaps for Intention-Oriented Controllable Video Captioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18531v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intent-oriented controlled video captioning aims to generate targeted descriptions for specific targets in a video based on customized user intent. Current Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) have gained strong instruction following and visual comprehension capabilities. Although the LVLMs demonstrated proficiency in spatial and temporal understanding respectively, it was not able to perform fine-grained spatial control in time sequences in direct response to instructions. This substantial spatio-temporal gap complicates efforts to achieve fine-grained intention-oriented control in video. Towards this end, we propose a novel IntentVCNet that unifies the temporal and spatial understanding knowledge inherent in LVLMs to bridge the spatio-temporal gap from both prompting and model perspectives. Specifically, we first propose a prompt combination strategy designed to enable LLM to model the implicit relationship between prompts that characterize user intent and video sequences. We then propose a parameter efficient box adapter that augments the object semantic information in the global visual context so that the visual token has a priori information about the user intent. The final experiment proves that the combination of the two strategies can further enhance the LVLM's ability to model spatial details in video sequences, and facilitate the LVLMs to accurately generate controlled intent-oriented captions. Our proposed method achieved state-of-the-art results in several open source LVLMs and was the runner-up in the IntentVC challenge. Our code is available on https://github.com/thqiu0419/IntentVCNet.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose a hybrid spatio-temporal modeling framework that combines the interpretability and uncertainty quantification of Bayesian models -- estimated using the INLA-SPDE approach -- with the predictive power and flexibility of Random Forest (RF). Specifically, we introduce two novel algorithms, collectively named INLA-RF, which integrate a statistical spatio-temporal model with RF in an iterative two-stage framework. The first algorithm (INLA-RF1) incorporates RF predictions as an offset in the INLA-SPDE model, while the second (INLA-RF2) uses RF to directly correct selected latent field nodes. Both hybrid strategies enable uncertainty propagation between modeling stages, an aspect often overlooked in existing hybrid approaches. In addition, we propose a Kullback-Leibler divergence-based stopping criterion. We evaluate the predictive performance and uncertainty quantification capabilities of the proposed algorithms through two simulation studies. Results suggest that our hybrid approach enhances spatio-temporal prediction while maintaining interpretability and coherence in uncertainty estimates.</p></details> |  |
| **[LSDM: LLM-Enhanced Spatio-temporal Diffusion Model for Service-Level Mobile Traffic Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17795v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Service-level mobile traffic prediction for individual users is essential for network efficiency and quality of service enhancement. However, current prediction methods are limited in their adaptability across different urban environments and produce inaccurate results due to the high uncertainty in personal traffic patterns, the lack of detailed environmental context, and the complex dependencies among different network services. These challenges demand advanced modeling techniques that can capture dynamic traffic distributions and rich environmental features. Inspired by the recent success of diffusion models in distribution modeling and Large Language Models (LLMs) in contextual understanding, we propose an LLM-Enhanced Spatio-temporal Diffusion Model (LSDM). LSDM integrates the generative power of diffusion models with the adaptive learning capabilities of transformers, augmented by the ability to capture multimodal environmental information for modeling service-level patterns and dynamics. Extensive evaluations on real-world service-level datasets demonstrate that the model excels in traffic usage predictions, showing outstanding generalization and adaptability. After incorporating contextual information via LLM, the performance improves by at least 2.83% in terms of the coefficient of determination. Compared to models of a similar type, such as CSDI, the root mean squared error can be reduced by at least 8.29%. The code and dataset will be available at: https://github.com/SoftYuaneR/LSDM.</p></details> | 14 pages, 9 figures |

This allows for modeling non-linearities and interactions among predictor variables in a flexible data-driven manner and for accounting for spatio-temporal variation that is not explained by observable predictor variables. We also show how estimation and prediction can be done in a computationally efficient manner. In an application to a large U.S. mortgage credit risk data set, we find that both predictive default probabilities for individual loans and predictive loan portfolio loss distributions obtained with our novel approach are more accurate compared to conventional independent linear hazard models and also linear spatio-temporal models. Using interpretability tools for machine learning models, we find that the likely reasons for this outperformance are strong interaction and non-linear effects in the predictor variables and the presence of spatio-temporal frailty effects.</p></details> |  |

We propose COMPASS, a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework that enables decentralized agents to persistently monitor multiple moving targets efficiently. We model the environment as a graph, where nodes represent spatial locations and edges capture topological proximity, allowing agents to reason over structured layouts and revisit informative regions as needed. Each agent independently selects actions based on a shared spatio-temporal attention network that we design to integrate historical observations and spatial context. We model target dynamics using Gaussian Processes (GPs), which support principled belief updates and enable uncertainty-aware planning. We train COMPASS using centralized value estimation and decentralized policy execution under an adaptive reward setting. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that COMPASS consistently outperforms strong baselines in uncertainty reduction, target coverage, and coordination efficiency across dynamic multi-target scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reducing GPU Memory Fragmentation via Spatio-Temporal Planning for Efficient Large-Scale Model Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16274v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid scaling of large language models (LLMs) has significantly increased GPU memory pressure, which is further aggravated by training optimization techniques such as virtual pipeline and recomputation that disrupt tensor lifespans and introduce considerable memory fragmentation. Default GPU memory allocators of popular deep learning frameworks like PyTorch use online strategies without knowledge of tensor lifespans, which can waste up to 43\% of memory and cause out-of-memory errors, rendering optimization techniques ineffective or even unusable. To address this, we introduce STWeaver, a GPU memory allocator for deep learning frameworks that reduces fragmentation by exploiting the spatial and temporal regularity in memory allocation behaviors of training workloads. STWeaver introduces a novel paradigm that combines offline planning with online allocation. The offline planning leverages spatio-temporal regularities to generate a near-optimal allocation plan, while the online allocation handles complex and dynamic models such as Mixture-of-Experts (MoE). Built as a pluggable PyTorch allocator, STWeaver reduces fragmentation ratio on average by 79.2\% (up to 100\%) across both dense and sparse models, with negligible overhead. This enables more efficient, high-throughput training configurations and improves performance by up to 32.5\%.</p></details> |  |

Modeling and monitoring MAS requirements to guarantee overall mission objectives, safety, and reliability is an important problem. Such requirements implicitly require reasoning about diverse sensing and communication modalities between agents, analysis of the dependencies between agent tasks, and the spatial or virtual distance between agents. To capture such rich MAS requirements, we model agent interactions via multiple directed graphs, and introduce a new logic -- Spatio-Temporal Logic with Graph Operators (STL-GO). The key innovation in STL-GO are graph operators that enable us to reason about the number of agents along either the incoming or outgoing edges of the underlying interaction graph that satisfy a given property of interest; for example, the requirement that an agent should sense at least two neighboring agents whose task graphs indicate the ability to collaborate. We then propose novel distributed monitoring conditions for individual agents that use only local information to determine whether or not an STL-GO specification is satisfied. We compare the expressivity of STL-GO against existing spatio-temporal logic formalisms, and demonstrate the utility of STL-GO and our distributed monitors in a bike-sharing and a multi-drone case study.</p></details> |  |

Most existing methods rely on binary classifiers trained using real and fake image sequences, therefore hindering their generalization capabilities to unseen generation methods. Moreover, with the constant progress in generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), deepfake artifacts are becoming imperceptible at both the spatial and the temporal levels, making them extremely difficult to capture. To address these issues, we propose a fine-grained deepfake video detection approach called FakeSTormer that enforces the modeling of subtle spatio-temporal inconsistencies while avoiding overfitting. Specifically, we introduce a multi-task learning framework that incorporates two auxiliary branches for explicitly attending artifact-prone spatial and temporal regions. Additionally, we propose a video-level data synthesis strategy that generates pseudo-fake videos with subtle spatio-temporal artifacts, providing high-quality samples and hand-free annotations for our additional branches.

This abstraction classifies existing compressors and inspires new compressors as spatio-temporal compressors, with their effectiveness described by constructive stability criteria from nonlinear system theory. Subsequently, we incorporate these spatio-temporal compressors directly into standard continuous-time consensus flows and distributed primal-dual flows, establishing conditions ensuring exponential convergence. Additionally, we introduce a novel observer-based distributed primal-dual continuous flow integrated with spatio-temporal compressors, which provides broader convergence conditions.

While 3D CNNs have been effective at capturing spatiotemporal dynamics, recent Transformer models leverage self-attention to model long-range spatial and temporal dependencies. Despite achieving state-of-the-art performance on major benchmarks, Transformers remain computationally expensive, particularly with dense video data. To address this, we propose a lightweight Video Focal Modulation Network, DVFL-Net, which distills spatiotemporal knowledge from a large pre-trained teacher into a compact nano student model, enabling efficient on-device deployment. DVFL-Net utilizes knowledge distillation and spatial-temporal feature modulation to significantly reduce computation while preserving high recognition performance. We employ forward Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence alongside spatio-temporal focal modulation to effectively transfer both local and global context from the Video-FocalNet Base (teacher) to the proposed VFL-Net (student). We evaluate DVFL-Net on UCF50, UCF101, HMDB51, SSV2, and Kinetics-400, benchmarking it against recent state-of-the-art methods in Human Action Recognition (HAR). Additionally, we conduct a detailed ablation study analyzing the impact of forward KL divergence. The results confirm the superiority of DVFL-Net in achieving an optimal balance between performance and efficiency, demonstrating lower memory usage, reduced GFLOPs, and strong accuracy, making it a practical solution for real-time HAR applications.</p></details> | 17 pages |

Previous methods solve the issue of insufficient observation by leveraging 4D diffusion models to generate videos at novel viewpoints. However, the generated videos from these models often lack spatio-temporal consistency, thus degrading view synthesis quality. In this paper, we propose a novel sliding iterative denoising process to enhance the spatio-temporal consistency of the 4D diffusion model. Specifically, we define a latent grid in which each latent encodes the image, camera pose, and human pose for a certain viewpoint and timestamp, then alternately denoising the latent grid along spatial and temporal dimensions with a sliding window, and finally decode the videos at target viewpoints from the corresponding denoised latents. Through the iterative sliding, information flows sufficiently across the latent grid, allowing the diffusion model to obtain a large receptive field and thus enhance the 4D consistency of the output, while making the GPU memory consumption affordable. The experiments on the DNA-Rendering and ActorsHQ datasets demonstrate that our method is able to synthesize high-quality and consistent novel-view videos and significantly outperforms the existing approaches.

It serves as a cornerstone for achieving high-level autonomous driving. However, current approaches remain inadequate for accurately modeling the complex spatio-temporal interdependencies and the unpredictable variability of human driving behavior. To address these challenges, we propose CaSTFormer, a Causal Spatio-Temporal Transformer to explicitly model causal interactions between driver behavior and environmental context for robust intention prediction. Specifically, CaSTFormer introduces a novel Reciprocal Shift Fusion (RSF) mechanism for precise temporal alignment of internal and external feature streams, a Causal Pattern Extraction (CPE) module that systematically eliminates spurious correlations to reveal authentic causal dependencies, and an innovative Feature Synthesis Network (FSN) that adaptively synthesizes these purified representations into coherent spatio-temporal inferences. We evaluate the proposed CaSTFormer on the public Brain4Cars dataset, and it achieves state-of-the-art performance. It effectively captures complex causal spatio-temporal dependencies and enhances both the accuracy and transparency of driving intention prediction.</p></details> |  |

Leveraging fine-scale weekly mortality and high-resolution climate data from Austria (2002 to 2019), we assess how interactions between temperature, humidity, age, and gender influence mortality patterns. Our approach goes beyond conventional modelling by capturing complex dependencies through structured interactions across space-time, space-age, and age-time dimensions, allowing us to capture complex demographic and environmental dependencies. The analysis identifies district-level mortality patterns and quantifies climate-related risks on a weekly basis, offering new insights for public health surveillance.</p></details> |  |

| **[Reprogramming Vision Foundation Models for Spatio-Temporal Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11558v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have achieved remarkable success in natural language processing and computer vision, demonstrating strong capabilities in modeling complex patterns. While recent efforts have explored adapting large language models (LLMs) for time-series forecasting, LLMs primarily capture one-dimensional sequential dependencies and struggle to model the richer spatio-temporal (ST) correlations essential for accurate ST forecasting. In this paper, we present \textbf{ST-VFM}, a novel framework that systematically reprograms Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) for general-purpose spatio-temporal forecasting. While VFMs offer powerful spatial priors, two key challenges arise when applying them to ST tasks: (1) the lack of inherent temporal modeling capacity and (2) the modality gap between visual and ST data. To address these, ST-VFM adopts a \emph{dual-branch architecture} that integrates raw ST inputs with auxiliary ST flow inputs, where the flow encodes lightweight temporal difference signals interpretable as dynamic spatial cues. To effectively process these dual-branch inputs, ST-VFM introduces two dedicated reprogramming stages. The \emph{pre-VFM reprogramming} stage applies a Temporal-Aware Token Adapter to embed temporal context and align both branches into VFM-compatible feature spaces. The \emph{post-VFM reprogramming} stage introduces a Bilateral Cross-Prompt Coordination module, enabling dynamic interaction between branches through prompt-based conditioning, thus enriching joint representation learning without modifying the frozen VFM backbone. Extensive experiments on ten spatio-temporal datasets show that ST-VFM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating effectiveness and robustness across VFM backbones (e.g., DINO, CLIP, DEIT) and ablation studies, establishing it as a strong general framework for spatio-temporal forecasting.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches in this field usually struggle to capture the complex spatio-temporal dependencies in EV charging behaviors, and their limited model parameters hinder their ability to learn complex data distribution representations from large datasets. To this end, we propose a novel EV spatio-temporal large language model (EV-STLLM) for accurate prediction. Our proposed framework is divided into two modules. In the data processing module, we utilize variational mode decomposition (VMD) for data denoising, and improved complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (ICEEMDAN) for data multi-frequency decomposition. Fuzzy information granulation (FIG) for extracting multi-scale information. Additionally, ReliefF is used for feature selection to mitigate redundancy. In the forecasting module, the EV-STLLM is used to directly achieve EV charging and occupancy forecasting. Firstly, we fully capture the intrinsic spatio-temporal characteristics of the data by integrating adjacency matrices derived from the regional stations network and spatio-temporal-frequency embedding information. Then, the partially frozen graph attention (PFGA) module is utilized to maintain the sequential feature modeling capabilities of the pre-trained large model while incorporating EV domain knowledge. Extensive experiments using real-world data from Shenzhen, China, demonstrate that our proposed framework can achieve superior accuracy and robustness compared to the state-of-the-art benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deformable Dynamic Convolution for Accurate yet Efficient Spatio-Temporal Traffic Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11550v1)** | 2025-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal traffic prediction plays a key role in intelligent transportation systems by enabling accurate prediction in complex urban areas. Although not only accuracy but also efficiency for scalability is important, some previous methods struggle to capture heterogeneity such as varying traffic patterns across regions and time periods. Moreover, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which are the mainstream of traffic prediction, not only require predefined adjacency matrix, but also limit scalability to large-scale data containing many nodes due to their inherent complexity. To overcome these limitations, we propose Deformable Dynamic Convolution Network (DDCN) for accurate yet efficient traffic prediction. Traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are limited in modeling non-Euclidean spatial structures and spatio-temporal heterogeneity, DDCN overcomes these challenges by dynamically applying deformable filters based on offset. Specifically, DDCN decomposes transformer-style CNN to encoder-decoder structure, and applies proposed approaches to the spatial and spatio-temporal attention blocks of the encoder to emphasize important features. The decoder, composed of feed-forward module, complements the output of the encoder. This novel structure make DDCN can perform accurate yet efficient traffic prediction. In comprehensive experiments on four real-world datasets, DDCN achieves competitive performance, emphasizing the potential and effectiveness of CNN-based approaches for spatio-temporal traffic prediction.</p></details> | 7 pages |
| **[DRAN: A Distribution and Relation Adaptive Network for Spatio-temporal Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01531v3)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate predictions of spatio-temporal systems are crucial for tasks such as system management, control, and crisis prevention. However, the inherent time variance of many spatio-temporal systems poses challenges to achieving accurate predictions whenever stationarity is not granted. In order to address non-stationarity, we propose a Distribution and Relation Adaptive Network (DRAN) capable of dynamically adapting to relation and distribution changes over time. While temporal normalization and de-normalization are frequently used techniques to adapt to distribution shifts, this operation is not suitable for the spatio-temporal context as temporal normalization scales the time series of nodes and possibly disrupts the spatial relations among nodes. In order to address this problem, a Spatial Factor Learner (SFL) module is developed that enables the normalization and de-normalization process. To adapt to dynamic changes in spatial relationships among sensors, we propose a Dynamic-Static Fusion Learner (DSFL) module that effectively integrates features learned from both dynamic and static relations through an adaptive fusion ratio mechanism. Furthermore, we introduce a Stochastic Learner to capture the noisy components of spatio-temporal representations. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on weather prediction and traffic flow forecasting tasks.Experimental results show that our SFL efficiently preserves spatial relationships across various temporal normalization operations. Visualizations of the learned dynamic and static relations demonstrate that DSFL can capture both local and distant relationships between nodes.</p></details> | 15 pages, 10 figures |

Spatio-Temporal Anomaly detection plays an important role in ensuring system security and operational integrity. However, current data-driven approaches, largely driven by black-box deep learning, face challenges in interpretability, adaptability to distribution shifts, and robustness under evolving system dynamics. In this paper, we advocate for a causal learning perspective to advance anomaly detection in spatially distributed infrastructures that grounds detection in structural cause-effect relationships. We identify and formalize three key directions: causal graph profiling, multi-view fusion, and continual causal graph learning, each offering distinct advantages in uncovering dynamic cause-effect structures across time and space. Drawing on real-world insights from systems such as water treatment infrastructures, we illustrate how causal models provide early warning signals and root cause attribution, addressing the limitations of black-box detectors. Looking ahead, we outline the future research agenda centered on multi-modality, generative AI-driven, and scalable adaptive causal frameworks. Our objective is to lay a new research trajectory toward scalable, adaptive, explainable, and spatially grounded anomaly detection systems. We hope to inspire a paradigm shift in cybersecurity research, promoting causality-driven approaches to address evolving threats in interconnected infrastructures.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 1 figure, Under Review in Vision Paper Track-ACM SIGSPATIAL 2025</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Granular Spatio-Temporal Token Merging for Training-Free Acceleration of Video LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07990v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video large language models (LLMs) achieve strong video understanding by leveraging a large number of spatio-temporal tokens, but suffer from quadratic computational scaling with token count. To address this, we propose a training-free spatio-temporal token merging method, named STTM. Our key insight is to exploit local spatial and temporal redundancy in video data which has been overlooked in prior work. STTM first transforms each frame into multi-granular spatial tokens using a coarse-to-fine search over a quadtree structure, then performs directed pairwise merging across the temporal dimension. This decomposed merging approach outperforms existing token reduction methods across six video QA benchmarks. Notably, STTM achieves a 2$\times$ speed-up with only a 0.5% accuracy drop under a 50% token budget, and a 3$\times$ speed-up with just a 2% drop under a 30% budget. Moreover, STTM is query-agnostic, allowing KV cache reuse across different questions for the same video.

While most existing benchmarks evaluate models under offline settings with a fixed set of pre-recorded inputs, we introduce OST-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate Online Spatio-Temporal understanding from the perspective of an agent actively exploring a scene. The Online aspect emphasizes the need to process and reason over incrementally acquired observations, while the Spatio-Temporal component requires integrating current visual inputs with historical memory to support dynamic spatial reasoning. OST-Bench better reflects the challenges of real-world embodied perception. Built on an efficient data collection pipeline, OST-Bench consists of 1.4k scenes and 10k question-answer pairs collected from ScanNet, Matterport3D, and ARKitScenes. We evaluate several leading MLLMs on OST-Bench and observe that they fall short on tasks requiring complex spatio-temporal reasoning. Under the online setting, their accuracy declines as the exploration horizon extends and the memory grows. Through further experimental analysis, we identify common error patterns across models and find that both complex clue-based spatial reasoning demands and long-term memory retrieval requirements significantly drop model performance along two separate axes, highlighting the core challenges that must be addressed to improve online embodied reasoning. To foster further research and development in the field, our codes, dataset, and benchmark are available.

| **[Not Only Consistency: Enhance Test-Time Adaptation with Spatio-temporal Inconsistency for Remote Physiological Measurement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07908v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) has emerged as a promising non-invasive method for monitoring physiological signals using the camera. Although various domain adaptation and generalization methods were proposed to promote the adaptability of deep-based rPPG models in unseen deployment environments, considerations in aspects like privacy concerns and real-time adaptation restrict their application in real-world deployment. Thus, we aim to propose a novel fully Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) strategy tailored for rPPG tasks in this work. Specifically, based on prior knowledge in physiology and our observations, we noticed not only there is spatio-temporal consistency in the frequency domain of rPPG signals, but also that inconsistency in the time domain was significant. Given this, by leveraging both consistency and inconsistency priors, we introduce an innovative expert knowledge-based self-supervised \textbf{C}onsistency-\textbf{i}n\textbf{C}onsistency-\textbf{i}ntegration (\textbf{CiCi}) framework to enhances model adaptation during inference. Besides, our approach further incorporates a gradient dynamic control mechanism to mitigate potential conflicts between priors, ensuring stable adaptation across instances. Through extensive experiments on five diverse datasets under the TTA protocol, our method consistently outperforms existing techniques, presenting state-of-the-art performance in real-time self-supervised adaptation without accessing source data. The code will be released later.</p></details> |  |
| **[Advancing Spatio-Temporal Processing in Spiking Neural Networks through Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07517v3)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Implementations of spiking neural networks on neuromorphic hardware promise orders of magnitude less power consumption than their non-spiking counterparts. The standard neuron model for spike-based computation on such systems has long been the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron. A computationally light augmentation of the LIF neuron model with an adaptation mechanism has recently been shown to exhibit superior performance on spatio-temporal processing tasks. The root of the superiority of these so-called adaptive LIF neurons however is not well understood. In this article, we thoroughly analyze the dynamical, computational, and learning properties of adaptive LIF neurons and networks thereof. Our investigation reveals significant challenges related to stability and parameterization when employing the conventional Euler-Forward discretization for this class of models. We report a rigorous theoretical and empirical demonstration that these challenges can be effectively addressed by adopting an alternative discretization approach - the Symplectic Euler method, allowing to improve over state-of-the-art performances on common event-based benchmark datasets. Our further analysis of the computational properties of networks of adaptive LIF neurons shows that they are particularly well suited to exploit the spatio-temporal structure of input sequences without any normalization techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Nature Communications, July 2025</p></details> |
| **[Damba-ST: Domain-Adaptive Mamba for Efficient Urban Spatio-Temporal Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18939v2)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training urban spatio-temporal foundation models that generalize well across diverse regions and cities is critical for deploying urban services in unseen or data-scarce regions. Recent studies have typically focused on fusing cross-domain spatio-temporal data to train unified Transformer-based models. However, these models suffer from quadratic computational complexity and high memory overhead, limiting their scalability and practical deployment. Inspired by the efficiency of Mamba, a state space model with linear time complexity, we explore its potential for efficient urban spatio-temporal prediction. However, directly applying Mamba as a spatio-temporal backbone leads to negative transfer and severe performance degradation. This is primarily due to spatio-temporal heterogeneity and the recursive mechanism of Mamba's hidden state updates, which limit cross-domain generalization. To overcome these challenges, we propose Damba-ST, a novel domain-adaptive Mamba-based model for efficient urban spatio-temporal prediction. Damba-ST retains Mamba's linear complexity advantage while significantly enhancing its adaptability to heterogeneous domains. Specifically, we introduce two core innovations: (1) a domain-adaptive state space model that partitions the latent representation space into a shared subspace for learning cross-domain commonalities and independent, domain-specific subspaces for capturing intra-domain discriminative features; (2) three distinct Domain Adapters, which serve as domain-aware proxies to bridge disparate domain distributions and facilitate the alignment of cross-domain commonalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate the generalization and efficiency of Damba-ST. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on prediction tasks and demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization, enabling seamless deployment in new urban environments without extensive retraining or fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |

Radar sensors, capable of penetrating ice, provide detailed radargram images of these internal layers. In this work, we present ST-GRIT, a spatio-temporal graph transformer for ice layer thickness, designed to process these radargrams and capture the spatiotemporal relationships between shallow and deep ice layers. ST-GRIT leverages an inductive geometric graph learning framework to extract local spatial features as feature embeddings and employs a series of temporal and spatial attention blocks separately to model long-range dependencies effectively in both dimensions. Experimental evaluation on radargram data from the Greenland ice sheet demonstrates that ST-GRIT consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art methods and other baseline graph neural networks by achieving lower root mean-squared error. These results highlight the advantages of self-attention mechanisms on graphs over pure graph neural networks, including the ability to handle noise, avoid oversmoothing, and capture long-range dependencies. Moreover, the use of separate spatial and temporal attention blocks allows for distinct and robust learning of spatial relationships and temporal patterns, providing a more comprehensive and effective approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for 2025 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)</p></details> |

They pose, however, significant computational challenges in high-dimensional settings, which frequently arise in spatial-temporal applications. We present DALIA, a highly scalable framework for performing Bayesian inference tasks on spatio-temporal multivariate GPs, based on the methodology of integrated nested Laplace approximations. Our approach relies on a sparse inverse covariance matrix formulation of the GP, puts forward a GPU-accelerated block-dense approach, and introduces a hierarchical, triple-layer, distributed memory parallel scheme. We showcase weak scaling performance surpassing the state-of-the-art by two orders of magnitude on a model whose parameter space is 8$\times$ larger and measure strong scaling speedups of three orders of magnitude when running on 496 GH200 superchips on the Alps supercomputer. Applying DALIA to air pollution data from northern Italy over 48 days, we showcase refined spatial resolutions over the aggregated pollutant measurements.</p></details> |  |

However, in high-precision industrial scenarios such as semiconductor manufacturing, the absence of specialized benchmark datasets severely hampers research on modeling and predicting complex processes. To address this challenge, we make a twofold contribution.First, we construct and release the Chip Dicing Lane Dataset (CHDL), the first public temporal image dataset dedicated to the semiconductor wafer dicing process. Captured via an industrial-grade vision system, CHDL provides a much-needed and challenging benchmark for high-fidelity process modeling, defect detection, and digital twin development.Second, we propose DIFFUMA, an innovative dual-path prediction architecture specifically designed for such fine-grained dynamics. The model captures global long-range temporal context through a parallel Mamba module, while simultaneously leveraging a diffusion module, guided by temporal features, to restore and enhance fine-grained spatial details, effectively combating feature degradation. Experiments demonstrate that on our CHDL benchmark, DIFFUMA significantly outperforms existing methods, reducing the Mean Squared Error (MSE) by 39% and improving the Structural Similarity (SSIM) from 0.926 to a near-perfect 0.988. This superior performance also generalizes to natural phenomena datasets. Our work not only delivers a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) model but, more importantly, provides the community with an invaluable data resource to drive future research in industrial AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distributionally Robust Predictive Runtime Verification under Spatio-Temporal Logic Specifications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02964v2)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cyber-physical systems (CPS) designed in simulators, often consisting of multiple interacting agents (e.g. in multi-agent formations), behave differently in the real-world. We want to verify these systems during runtime when they are deployed. We thus propose robust predictive runtime verification (RPRV) algorithms for: (1) general stochastic CPS under signal temporal logic (STL) tasks, and (2) stochastic multi-agent systems (MAS) under spatio-temporal logic tasks. The RPRV problem presents the following challenges: (1) there may not be sufficient data on the behavior of the deployed CPS, (2) predictive models based on design phase system trajectories may encounter distribution shift during real-world deployment, and (3) the algorithms need to scale to the complexity of MAS and be applicable to spatio-temporal logic tasks. To address the challenges, we assume knowledge of an upper bound on the statistical distance between the trajectory distributions of the system at deployment and design time. We are motivated by our prior work [1, 2] where we proposed an accurate and an interpretable RPRV algorithm for general CPS, which we here extend to the MAS setting and spatio-temporal logic tasks. Specifically, we use a learned predictive model to estimate the system behavior at runtime and robust conformal prediction to obtain probabilistic guarantees by accounting for distribution shifts. Building on [1], we perform robust conformal prediction over the robust semantics of spatio-temporal reach and escape logic (STREL) to obtain centralized RPRV algorithms for MAS. We empirically validate our results in a drone swarm simulator, where we show the scalability of our RPRV algorithms to MAS and analyze the impact of different trajectory predictors on the verification result. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first statistically valid algorithms for MAS under distribution shift.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2311.09482</p></details> |

Specifically, it is challenging to address prompts that refer to 1) the entirety of an environment that an agent equipped with an MLLM can operate in; and simultaneously also refer to 2) recent actions that just happened and are encoded in a video clip. However, such a holistic spatio-temporal understanding is important for agents operating in the real world. To address this issue, we first develop a framework to collect a large-scale dataset. Using the collected "Reasoning about Environments and Actions" (REA) dataset, we show that recent methods indeed struggle to correctly answer the prompts. To improve, we develop a "spatio-temporal LLM" (ST-LLM), a model equipped with projectors to improve both spatial understanding of an environment and temporal understanding of recent observations. On the collected REA data, we show that the proposed method significantly improves results compared to prior work.

Current video-based approaches, while proficient in tracking, lack the sophisticated reasoning capabilities of large language models, limiting their contextual understanding and generalization. We introduce VideoMolmo, a large multimodal model tailored for fine-grained spatio-temporal pointing conditioned on textual descriptions. Building upon the Molmo architecture, VideoMolmo incorporates a temporal module utilizing an attention mechanism to condition each frame on preceding frames, ensuring temporal consistency. Additionally, our novel temporal mask fusion pipeline employs SAM2 for bidirectional point propagation, significantly enhancing coherence across video sequences. This two-step decomposition, i.e., first using the LLM to generate precise pointing coordinates, then relying on a sequential mask-fusion module to produce coherent segmentation, not only simplifies the task for the language model but also enhances interpretability. Due to the lack of suitable datasets, we curate a comprehensive dataset comprising 72k video-caption pairs annotated with 100k object points. To evaluate the generalization of VideoMolmo, we introduce VPoS-Bench, a challenging out-of-distribution benchmark spanning five real-world scenarios: Cell Tracking, Egocentric Vision, Autonomous Driving, Video-GUI Interaction, and Robotics. We also evaluate our model on Referring Video Object Segmentation (Refer-VOS) and Reasoning VOS tasks. In comparison to existing models, VideoMolmo substantially improves spatio-temporal pointing accuracy and reasoning capability.

Although these data can be used for effective local policymaking, their analyses are hindered by several challenges, such as limited information attributed to grouping, the presence of non-sampled areas, and the very low frequency of implementing surveys. To address these challenges, we propose a novel grouped-data-based spatio-temporal finite mixture model for estimating the income distributions of multiple spatial units at multiple time points. A unique feature of the proposed method is that all the areas share common latent distributions and that the mixing proportions, including spatial and temporal effects, capture the potential area-wise heterogeneity. Thus, incorporating these effects can smooth out the quantities of interest over time and space, impute missing values, and predict future values. By treating the HLS data with the proposed method, we obtain complete maps of the income and inequality measures at an arbitrary time, which can facilitate rapid and efficient policymaking with fine granularity.</p></details> |  |

However, there exist very limited FL works in surgical data science, and FL methods for other modalities do not consider inherent characteristics in surgical domain: i) different scenarios show diverse anatomical backgrounds while highly similar instrument representation; ii) there exist surgical simulators which promote large-scale synthetic data generation with minimal efforts. In this paper, we propose a novel Personalized FL scheme, Spatio-Temporal Representation Decoupling and Enhancement (FedST), which wisely leverages surgical domain knowledge during both local-site and global-server training to boost segmentation. Concretely, our model embraces a Representation Separation and Cooperation (RSC) mechanism in local-site training, which decouples the query embedding layer to be trained privately, to encode respective backgrounds. Meanwhile, other parameters are optimized globally to capture the consistent representations of instruments, including the temporal layer to capture similar motion patterns. A textual-guided channel selection is further designed to highlight site-specific features, facilitating model adapta tion to each site. Moreover, in global-server training, we propose Synthesis-based Explicit Representation Quantification (SERQ), which defines an explicit representation target based on synthetic data to synchronize the model convergence during fusion for improving model generalization.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we explore the potential of adapter tuning in image-to-video model adaptation and propose a novel video adapter tuning framework, called Disentangled-and-Deformable Spatio-Temporal Adapter (D$^2$ST-Adapter). It features a lightweight design, low adaptation overhead and powerful spatio-temporal feature adaptation capabilities. D$^2$ST-Adapter is structured with an internal dual-pathway architecture that enables built-in disentangled encoding of spatial and temporal features within the adapter, seamlessly integrating into the single-stream feature learning framework of pre-trained image models. In particular, we develop an efficient yet effective implementation of the D$^2$ST-Adapter, incorporating the specially devised anisotropic Deformable Spatio-Temporal Attention as its pivotal operation. This mechanism can be individually tailored for two pathways with anisotropic sampling densities along the spatial and temporal domains in 3D spatio-temporal space, enabling disentangled encoding of spatial and temporal features while maintaining a lightweight design. Extensive experiments by instantiating our method on both pre-trained ResNet and ViT demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art methods. Our method is particularly well-suited to challenging scenarios where temporal dynamics are critical for action recognition.

| **[Linking climate and dengue in the Philippines using a two-stage Bayesian spatio-temporal model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22334v1)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dengue is an infectious disease which poses significant socioeconomic and disease burden in many tropical and subtropical regions of the world. This work aims to provide additional insight into the association between dengue and climate in the Philippines. We employ a two-stage modelling framework: the first stage fits climate models, while the second stage fits a health model that uses the climate predictions from the first stage as inputs. We postulate a Bayesian spatio-temporal model and use the integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) approach for inference. To account for the uncertainty in the climate models, we perform posterior sampling and then perform Bayesian model averaging to compute the final posterior estimates of second-stage model parameters. The results indicate that temperature is positively associated with dengue, although extremely hot conditions tend to have a negative effect. Moreover, the relationship between rainfall and dengue varies in space. In areas with uniform amounts of rainfall all year round, rainfall is negatively associated with dengue. In contrast, in regions with pronounced dry and wet season, rainfall shows a positive association with dengue. Finally, there remains unexplained structured variation in space and time after accounting for the impact of climate variables and other covariates.</p></details> |  |
| **[VideoFusion: A Spatio-Temporal Collaborative Network for Multi-modal Video Fusion and Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23359v2)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Compared to images, videos better align with real-world acquisition scenarios and possess valuable temporal cues. However, existing multi-sensor fusion research predominantly integrates complementary context from multiple images rather than videos. This primarily stems from two factors: 1) the scarcity of large-scale multi-sensor video datasets, limiting research in video fusion, and 2) the inherent difficulty of jointly modeling spatial and temporal dependencies in a unified framework. This paper proactively compensates for the dilemmas. First, we construct M3SVD, a benchmark dataset with $220$ temporally synchronized and spatially registered infrared-visible video pairs comprising 153,797 frames, filling the data gap for the video fusion community. Secondly, we propose VideoFusion, a multi-modal video fusion model that fully exploits cross-modal complementarity and temporal dynamics to generate spatio-temporally coherent videos from (potentially degraded) multi-modal inputs. Specifically, 1) a differential reinforcement module is developed for cross-modal information interaction and enhancement, 2) a complete modality-guided fusion strategy is employed to adaptively integrate multi-modal features, and 3) a bi-temporal co-attention mechanism is devised to dynamically aggregate forward-backward temporal contexts to reinforce cross-frame feature representations. Extensive experiments reveal that VideoFusion outperforms existing image-oriented fusion paradigms in sequential scenarios, effectively mitigating temporal inconsistency and interference.</p></details> |  |
| **[CAST: Cross-Attentive Spatio-Temporal feature fusion for Deepfake detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21711v1)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deepfakes have emerged as a significant threat to digital media authenticity, increasing the need for advanced detection techniques that can identify subtle and time-dependent manipulations. CNNs are effective at capturing spatial artifacts, and Transformers excel at modeling temporal inconsistencies. However, many existing CNN-Transformer models process spatial and temporal features independently. In particular, attention-based methods often use separate attention mechanisms for spatial and temporal features and combine them using naive approaches like averaging, addition, or concatenation, which limits the depth of spatio-temporal interaction. To address this challenge, we propose a unified CAST model that leverages cross-attention to effectively fuse spatial and temporal features in a more integrated manner. Our approach allows temporal features to dynamically attend to relevant spatial regions, enhancing the model's ability to detect fine-grained, time-evolving artifacts such as flickering eyes or warped lips. This design enables more precise localization and deeper contextual understanding, leading to improved performance across diverse and challenging scenarios. We evaluate the performance of our model using the FaceForensics++, Celeb-DF, and DeepfakeDetection datasets in both intra- and cross-dataset settings to affirm the superiority of our approach. Our model achieves strong performance with an AUC of 99.49 percent and an accuracy of 97.57 percent in intra-dataset evaluations. In cross-dataset testing, it demonstrates impressive generalization by achieving a 93.31 percent AUC on the unseen DeepfakeDetection dataset. These results highlight the effectiveness of cross-attention-based feature fusion in enhancing the robustness of deepfake video detection.</p></details> | 50 pages, 6 figures |
| **[A Modular Multitask Reasoning Framework Integrating Spatio-temporal Models and LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20073v1)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal data mining plays a pivotal role in informed decision making across diverse domains. However, existing models are often restricted to narrow tasks, lacking the capacity for multi-task inference and complex long-form reasoning that require generation of in-depth, explanatory outputs. These limitations restrict their applicability to real-world, multi-faceted decision scenarios. In this work, we introduce STReason, a novel framework that integrates the reasoning strengths of large language models (LLMs) with the analytical capabilities of spatio-temporal models for multi-task inference and execution. Without requiring task-specific finetuning, STReason leverages in-context learning to decompose complex natural language queries into modular, interpretable programs, which are then systematically executed to generate both solutions and detailed rationales. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we construct a new benchmark dataset and propose a unified evaluation framework with metrics specifically designed for long-form spatio-temporal reasoning. Experimental results show that STReason significantly outperforms advanced LLM baselines across all metrics, particularly excelling in complex, reasoning-intensive spatio-temporal scenarios. Human evaluations further validate STReason's credibility and practical utility, demonstrating its potential to reduce expert workload and broaden the applicability to real-world spatio-temporal tasks. We believe STReason provides a promising direction for developing more capable and generalizable spatio-temporal reasoning systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Spatio-Temporal Point Process for Fine-Grained Modeling of Reading Behavior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19999v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reading is a process that unfolds across space and time, alternating between fixations where a reader focuses on a specific point in space, and saccades where a reader rapidly shifts their focus to a new point. An ansatz of psycholinguistics is that modeling a reader's fixations and saccades yields insight into their online sentence processing. However, standard approaches to such modeling rely on aggregated eye-tracking measurements and models that impose strong assumptions, ignoring much of the spatio-temporal dynamics that occur during reading. In this paper, we propose a more general probabilistic model of reading behavior, based on a marked spatio-temporal point process, that captures not only how long fixations last, but also where they land in space and when they take place in time. The saccades are modeled using a Hawkes process, which captures how each fixation excites the probability of a new fixation occurring near it in time and space. The duration time of fixation events is modeled as a function of fixation-specific predictors convolved across time, thus capturing spillover effects. Empirically, our Hawkes process model exhibits a better fit to human saccades than baselines. With respect to fixation durations, we observe that incorporating contextual surprisal as a predictor results in only a marginal improvement in the model's predictive accuracy. This finding suggests that surprisal theory struggles to explain fine-grained eye movements.</p></details> | ACL 2025 |
| **[RePST: Language Model Empowered Spatio-Temporal Forecasting via Semantic-Oriented Reprogramming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14505v3)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal forecasting is pivotal in numerous real-world applications, including transportation planning, energy management, and climate monitoring. In this work, we aim to harness the reasoning and generalization abilities of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) for more effective spatio-temporal forecasting, particularly in data-scarce scenarios. However, recent studies uncover that PLMs, which are primarily trained on textual data, often falter when tasked with modeling the intricate correlations in numerical time series, thereby limiting their effectiveness in comprehending spatio-temporal data. To bridge the gap, we propose RePST, a semantic-oriented PLM reprogramming framework tailored for spatio-temporal forecasting. Specifically, we first propose a semantic-oriented decomposer that adaptively disentangles spatially correlated time series into interpretable sub-components, which facilitates PLM to understand sophisticated spatio-temporal dynamics via a divide-and-conquer strategy. Moreover, we propose a selective discrete reprogramming scheme, which introduces an expanded spatio-temporal vocabulary space to project spatio-temporal series into discrete representations. This scheme minimizes the information loss during reprogramming and enriches the representations derived by PLMs. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that the proposed RePST outperforms twelve state-of-the-art baseline methods, particularly in data-scarce scenarios, highlighting the effectiveness and superior generalization capabilities of PLMs for spatio-temporal forecasting.

| **[STACT-Time: Spatio-Temporal Cross Attention for Cine Thyroid Ultrasound Time Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18172v1)** | 2025-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Thyroid cancer is among the most common cancers in the United States. Thyroid nodules are frequently detected through ultrasound (US) imaging, and some require further evaluation via fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy. Despite its effectiveness, FNA often leads to unnecessary biopsies of benign nodules, causing patient discomfort and anxiety. To address this, the American College of Radiology Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TI-RADS) has been developed to reduce benign biopsies. However, such systems are limited by interobserver variability. Recent deep learning approaches have sought to improve risk stratification, but they often fail to utilize the rich temporal and spatial context provided by US cine clips, which contain dynamic global information and surrounding structural changes across various views. In this work, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Cross Attention for Cine Thyroid Ultrasound Time Series Classification (STACT-Time) model, a novel representation learning framework that integrates imaging features from US cine clips with features from segmentation masks automatically generated by a pretrained model. By leveraging self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms, our model captures the rich temporal and spatial context of US cine clips while enhancing feature representation through segmentation-guided learning. Our model improves malignancy prediction compared to state-of-the-art models, achieving a cross-validation precision of 0.91 (plus or minus 0.02) and an F1 score of 0.89 (plus or minus 0.02). By reducing unnecessary biopsies of benign nodules while maintaining high sensitivity for malignancy detection, our model has the potential to enhance clinical decision-making and improve patient outcomes.</p></details> |  |

However, existing Geographic Information Systems (GIS)-based systems struggle to integrate and manage of such large-scale and diverse data sources. To address these challenges, this paper proposes G-SEED (GeoSOT-based Scalable Encoding and Extraction for Forest and Grassland Spatio-temporal Data), a unified encoding and management framework based on the hierarchical GeoSOT (Geographical coordinate global Subdivision grid with One dimension integer on 2n tree) grid system. G-SEED integrates spatial, temporal, and type information into a composite code, enabling consistent encoding of both structured and unstructured data, including remote sensing imagery, vector maps, sensor records, documents, and multimedia content. The framework incorporates adaptive grid-level selection, center-cell-based indexing, and full-coverage grid arrays to optimize spatial querying and compression. Through extensive experiments on a real-world dataset from Shennongjia National Park (China), G-SEED demonstrates superior performance in spatial precision control, cross-source consistency, query efficiency, and compression compared to mainstream methods such as Geohash and H3. This study provides a scalable and reusable paradigm for the unified organization of forest and grassland big data, supporting dynamic monitoring and intelligent decision-making in these domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 2 figures.

| **[ASTER: Adaptive Spatio-Temporal Early Decision Model for Dynamic Resource Allocation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17929v1)** | 2025-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Supporting decision-making has long been a central vision in the field of spatio-temporal intelligence. While prior work has improved the timeliness and accuracy of spatio-temporal forecasting, converting these forecasts into actionable strategies remains a key challenge. A main limitation is the decoupling of the prediction and the downstream decision phases, which can significantly degrade the downstream efficiency. For example, in emergency response, the priority is successful resource allocation and intervention, not just incident prediction. To this end, it is essential to propose an Adaptive Spatio-Temporal Early Decision model (ASTER) that reforms the forecasting paradigm from event anticipation to actionable decision support. This framework ensures that information is directly used for decision-making, thereby maximizing overall effectiveness. Specifically, ASTER introduces a new Resource-aware Spatio-Temporal interaction module (RaST) that adaptively captures long- and short-term dependencies under dynamic resource conditions, producing context-aware spatiotemporal representations. To directly generate actionable decisions, we further design a Preference-oriented decision agent (Poda) based on multi-objective reinforcement learning, which transforms predictive signals into resource-efficient intervention strategies by deriving optimal actions under specific preferences and dynamic constraints. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of ASTER in improving both early prediction accuracy and resource allocation outcomes across six downstream metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>ASTER...</summary><p>ASTER: Adaptive Spatio-Temporal Early Decision Model for Dynamic Resource Allocation</p></details> |

This issue is particularly challenging in spatio-temporal analyses, where it has been less explored so far. To study the effects of air pollution on mortality in Italy, we argue that a model that simultaneously accounts for spatio-temporal confounding and for the non-linear form of the effect of interest is needed. To this end, we propose a Bayesian spatial dynamic generalized linear model, which allows for a non-linear association and for a decomposition of the exposure effect into two components. This decomposition accommodates associations with the outcome at fine and coarse temporal and spatial scales of variation. These features, when combined, allow reducing the spatio-temporal confounding bias and recovering the true shape of the association, as demonstrated through simulation studies. The results from the real-data application indicate that the exposure effect seems to have different magnitudes in different seasons, with peaks in the summer. We hypothesize that this could be due to possible interactions between the exposure variable with air temperature and unmeasured confounders.</p></details> | 46 pages, 11 figures |

Genesis employs a two-stage architecture that integrates a DiT-based video diffusion model with 3D-VAE encoding, and a BEV-aware LiDAR generator with NeRF-based rendering and adaptive sampling. Both modalities are directly coupled through a shared latent space, enabling coherent evolution across visual and geometric domains. To guide the generation with structured semantics, we introduce DataCrafter, a captioning module built on vision-language models that provides scene-level and instance-level supervision. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that Genesis achieves state-of-the-art performance across video and LiDAR metrics (FVD 16.95, FID 4.24, Chamfer 0.611), and benefits downstream tasks including segmentation and 3D detection, validating the semantic fidelity and practical utility of the generated data.</p></details> |  |

However, modeling real-world environments presents unique challenges as they dynamically change across both space and, crucially, time. To capture these composed dynamics, we introduce a Spatio-Temporal Road Image Dataset for Exploration (STRIDE) permuting 360-degree panoramic imagery into rich interconnected observation, state and action nodes. Leveraging this structure, we can simultaneously model the relationship between egocentric views, positional coordinates, and movement commands across both space and time. We benchmark this dataset via TARDIS, a transformer-based generative world model that integrates spatial and temporal dynamics through a unified autoregressive framework trained on STRIDE. We demonstrate robust performance across a range of agentic tasks such as controllable photorealistic image synthesis, instruction following, autonomous self-control, and state-of-the-art georeferencing. These results suggest a promising direction towards sophisticated generalist agents--capable of understanding and manipulating the spatial and temporal aspects of their material environments--with enhanced embodied reasoning capabilities.

In order to summarise information encompassed in such data, we combine two well known statistical modelling methods. To account for the spatial dimension, we use the intrinsic modification of the conditional autoregression, and incorporate it with the hidden Markov model, allowing the spatial patterns to vary over time. We apply our method into parish register data considering deaths caused by measles in Finland in 1750-1850, and gain novel insight of previously undiscovered infection dynamics. Five distinctive, reoccurring states describing spatially and temporally differing infection burden and potential routes of spread are identified. We also find that there is a change in the occurrences of the most typical spatial patterns circa 1812, possibly due to changes in communication routes after major administrative transformations in Finland.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we leverage a large-scale spatio-temporal dataset collected from Peru's national Digital Contact Tracing (DCT) application during the COVID-19 pandemic to forecast mobility flows across urban regions. A key challenge lies in the spatial sparsity of hourly mobility counts across hexagonal grid cells, which limits the predictive power of conventional time series models. To address this, we propose a lightweight and model-agnostic Spatial Neighbourhood Fusion (SPN) technique that augments each cell's features with aggregated signals from its immediate H3 neighbors. We evaluate this strategy on three forecasting backbones: NLinear, PatchTST, and K-U-Net, under various historical input lengths. Experimental results show that SPN consistently improves forecasting performance, achieving up to 9.85 percent reduction in test MSE. Our findings demonstrate that spatial smoothing of sparse mobility signals provides a simple yet effective path toward robust spatio-temporal forecasting during public health crises.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we utilise statistical spatio-temporal methods to combine data from various sources and resolutions, aiming to model krill abundance. Our focus lies in fitting the model to a dataset comprising acoustic measurements of krill biomass. To achieve this, we integrate climate covariates obtained from satellite imagery and from drifting surface buoys (also known as drifters). Additionally, we use sparsely collected krill biomass data obtained from net fishing efforts (KRILLBASE) for validation. However, integrating these multiple heterogeneous data sources presents significant modelling challenges, including spatio-temporal misalignment and inflated zeros in the observed data. To address these challenges, we fit a Hurdle-Gamma model to jointly describe the occurrence of zeros and the krill biomass for the non-zero observations, while also accounting for misaligned and heterogeneous data sources, including drifters. Therefore, our work presents a comprehensive framework for analysing and predicting krill abundance in the Southern Ocean, leveraging information from various sources and formats. This is crucial due to the impact of krill fishing, as understanding their distribution is essential for informed management decisions and fishing regulations aimed at protecting the species.</p></details> |  |

While recent data-driven methods like deep reinforcement learning improve microscopic realism, they often overlook critical macroscopic features such as crowd density and flow, which are governed by spatio-temporal spawn dynamics, namely, when and where agents enter a scene. Traditional methods, like random spawn rates, stochastic processes, or fixed schedules, are not guaranteed to capture the underlying complexity or lack diversity and realism. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach called nTPP-GMM that models spatio-temporal spawn dynamics using Neural Temporal Point Processes (nTPPs) that are coupled with a spawn-conditional Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for agent spawn and goal positions. We evaluate our approach by orchestrating crowd simulations of three diverse real-world datasets with nTPP-GMM. Our experiments demonstrate the orchestration with nTPP-GMM leads to realistic simulations that reflect real-world crowd scenarios and allow crowd analysis.</p></details> |  |

While SciML methods have made significant progress in tackling the issue of response prediction for individual time histories, creating a full spatial-temporal surrogate remains a challenge. This study proposes a novel variant of deep operator networks (DeepONets), namely the full-field Extended DeepONet (FExD), to serve as a spatial-temporal surrogate that provides multi-output response predictions for dynamical systems. The proposed FExD surrogate model effectively learns the full solution operator across multiple degrees of freedom by enhancing the expressiveness of the branch network and expanding the predictive capabilities of the trunk network. The proposed FExD surrogate is deployed to simultaneously capture the dynamics at several sensing locations along a testbed model of a cable-stayed bridge subjected to stochastic ground motions. The ensuing response predictions from the FExD are comprehensively compared against both a vanilla DeepONet and a modified spatio-temporal Extended DeepONet. The results demonstrate the proposed FExD can achieve both superior accuracy and computational efficiency, representing a significant advancement in operator learning for structural dynamics applications.</p></details> |  |

Although most prior research has focused primarily on binary Deepfake detection, the task of model attribution -- determining which generative model produced a given Deepfake -- remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce FAME (Fake Attribution via Multilevel Embeddings), a lightweight and efficient spatio-temporal framework designed to capture subtle generative artifacts specific to different face-swap models. FAME integrates spatial and temporal attention mechanisms to improve attribution accuracy while remaining computationally efficient. We evaluate our model on three challenging and diverse datasets: Deepfake Detection and Manipulation (DFDM), FaceForensics++, and FakeAVCeleb. Results show that FAME consistently outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and runtime, highlighting its potential for deployment in real-world forensic and information security applications.</p></details> |  |

For example, in real-world manufacturing problems like additive manufacturing, users adjust known machine settings while unknown environmental parameters simultaneously fluctuate. To make reliable predictions, it is desired for a model to not only capture long-range spatio-temporal interactions from data but also adapt to new and unknown environments; traditional machine learning models excel at the first task but often lack physical interpretability and struggle to generalize under varying environmental conditions. To tackle these challenges, we propose the Attention-based Spatio-Temporal Neural Operator (ASNO), a novel architecture that combines separable attention mechanisms for spatial and temporal interactions and adapts to unseen physical parameters. Inspired by the backward differentiation formula (BDF), ASNO learns a transformer for temporal prediction and extrapolation and an attention-based neural operator for handling varying external loads, enhancing interpretability by isolating historical state contributions and external forces, enabling the discovery of underlying physical laws and generalizability to unseen physical environments. Empirical results on SciML benchmarks demonstrate that ASNO outperforms over existing models, establishing its potential for engineering applications, physics discovery, and interpretable machine learning.</p></details> |  |

Studying this critical stage of the developing human brain, therefore, requires accurate brain models-referred to as atlases-of high spatial and temporal resolution. To meet these demands, established traditional atlases and recently proposed deep learning-based methods rely on large and comprehensive datasets. This poses a major challenge for studying brains in the presence of pathologies for which data remains scarce. We address this limitation with CINeMA (Conditional Implicit Neural Multi-Modal Atlas), a novel framework for creating high-resolution, spatio-temporal, multimodal brain atlases, suitable for low-data settings. Unlike established methods, CINeMA operates in latent space, avoiding compute-intensive image registration and reducing atlas construction times from days to minutes. Furthermore, it enables flexible conditioning on anatomical features including GA, birth age, and pathologies like ventriculomegaly (VM) and agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC). CINeMA supports downstream tasks such as tissue segmentation and age prediction whereas its generative properties enable synthetic data creation and anatomically informed data augmentation. Surpassing state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, efficiency, and versatility, CINeMA represents a powerful tool for advancing brain research.

However, existing time-to-space sequential methods often fail to effectively extract features in block-wise missing data scenarios. Meanwhile, the static graph structure for spatial feature propagation significantly constrains the models flexibility in handling the distribution shift issue for the nonstationary traffic data. To address these issues, this paper proposes a SpatioTemporal Attention Mixture of experts network named STAMImputer for traffic data imputation. Specifically, we introduce a Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework to capture latent spatio-temporal features and their influence weights, effectively imputing block missing. A novel Low-rank guided Sampling Graph ATtention (LrSGAT) mechanism is designed to dynamically balance the local and global correlations across road networks. The sampled attention vectors are utilized to generate dynamic graphs that capture real-time spatial correlations. Extensive experiments are conducted on four traffic datasets for evaluation. The result shows STAMImputer achieves significantly performance improvement compared with existing SOTA approaches.

Current memory systems often grapple with fundamental limitations in structural flexibility, temporal awareness, and the ability to synthesize higher-level insights from raw interaction data. This paper introduces Cognitive Weave, a novel memory framework centered around a multi-layered spatio-temporal resonance graph (STRG). This graph manages information as semantically rich insight particles (IPs), which are dynamically enriched with resonance keys, signifiers, and situational imprints via a dedicated semantic oracle interface (SOI). These IPs are interconnected through typed relational strands, forming an evolving knowledge tapestry. A key component of Cognitive Weave is the cognitive refinement process, an autonomous mechanism that includes the synthesis of insight aggregates (IAs) condensed, higher-level knowledge structures derived from identified clusters of related IPs. We present comprehensive experimental results demonstrating Cognitive Weave's marked enhancement over existing approaches in long-horizon planning tasks, evolving question-answering scenarios, and multi-session dialogue coherence.

One notable example is low-latency motion estimation (optical flow), which is critical for many real-time applications. In such applications, the computational efficiency of algorithms is paramount. Although recent deep learning paradigms such as CNN, RNN, or ViT have shown remarkable performance, they often lack the desired computational efficiency. Conversely, asynchronous event-based methods including SNNs and GNNs are computationally efficient; however, these approaches fail to capture sufficient spatio-temporal information, a powerful feature required to achieve better performance for optical flow estimation. In this work, we introduce Spatio-Temporal State Space Model (STSSM) module along with a novel network architecture to develop an extremely efficient solution with competitive performance. Our STSSM module leverages state-space models to effectively capture spatio-temporal correlations in event data, offering higher performance with lower complexity compared to ViT, CNN-based architectures in similar settings. Our model achieves 4.5x faster inference and 8x lower computations compared to TMA and 2x lower computations compared to EV-FlowNet with competitive performance on the DSEC benchmark. Our code will be available at https://github.com/AhmedHumais/E-STMFlow</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce ST-GraphNet, a spatio-temporal graph neural network framework designed to model and predict AV crash severity by using both fine-grained and region-aggregated spatial graphs. Using a balanced dataset of 2,352 real-world AV-related crash reports from Texas (2024), including geospatial coordinates, crash timestamps, SAE automation levels, and narrative descriptions, we construct two complementary graph representations: (1) a fine-grained graph with individual crash events as nodes, where edges are defined via spatio-temporal proximity; and (2) a coarse-grained graph where crashes are aggregated into Hexagonal Hierarchical Spatial Indexing (H3)-based spatial cells, connected through hexagonal adjacency. Each node in the graph is enriched with multimodal data, including semantic, spatial, and temporal attributes, including textual embeddings from crash narratives using a pretrained Sentence-BERT model. We evaluate various graph neural network (GNN) architectures, such as Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), Graph Attention Networks (GAT), and Dynamic Spatio-Temporal GCN (DSTGCN), to classify crash severity and predict high-risk regions. Our proposed ST-GraphNet, which utilizes a DSTGCN backbone on the coarse-grained H3 graph, achieves a test accuracy of 97.74\%, substantially outperforming the best fine-grained model (64.7\% test accuracy). These findings highlight the effectiveness of spatial aggregation, dynamic message passing, and multi-modal feature integration in capturing the complex spatio-temporal patterns underlying AV crash severity.</p></details> |  |
| **[STSBench: A Spatio-temporal Scenario Benchmark for Multi-modal Large Language Models in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06218v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce STSBench, a scenario-based framework to benchmark the holistic understanding of vision-language models (VLMs) for autonomous driving. The framework automatically mines pre-defined traffic scenarios from any dataset using ground-truth annotations, provides an intuitive user interface for efficient human verification, and generates multiple-choice questions for model evaluation. Applied to the NuScenes dataset, we present STSnu, the first benchmark that evaluates the spatio-temporal reasoning capabilities of VLMs based on comprehensive 3D perception. Existing benchmarks typically target off-the-shelf or fine-tuned VLMs for images or videos from a single viewpoint and focus on semantic tasks such as object recognition, dense captioning, risk assessment, or scene understanding. In contrast, STSnu evaluates driving expert VLMs for end-to-end driving, operating on videos from multi-view cameras or LiDAR. It specifically assesses their ability to reason about both ego-vehicle actions and complex interactions among traffic participants, a crucial capability for autonomous vehicles. The benchmark features 43 diverse scenarios spanning multiple views and frames, resulting in 971 human-verified multiple-choice questions. A thorough evaluation uncovers critical shortcomings in existing models' ability to reason about fundamental traffic dynamics in complex environments. These findings highlight the urgent need for architectural advances that explicitly model spatio-temporal reasoning. By addressing a core gap in spatio-temporal evaluation, STSBench enables the development of more robust and explainable VLMs for autonomous driving.</p></details> | <details><summary>Datas...</summary><p>Dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/ivc-lrp/STSBench, Code: https://github.com/LRP-IVC/STSBench</p></details> |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Information Freshness for Remote Source Monitoring in IoT Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04804v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread adoption of age of information (AoI) as a meaningful and analytically tractable information freshness metric has led to a wide body of work on the timing performance of Internet of things (IoT) systems. However, the spatial correlation inherent to environmental monitoring has been mostly neglected in the recent literature, due to the significant modeling complexity it introduces. In this work, we address this gap by presenting a model of spatio-temporal information freshness, considering the conditional entropy of the system state in a remote monitoring scenario, such as a low-orbit satellite collecting information from a wide geographical area. Our analytical results show that purely age-oriented schemes tend to select an overly broad communication range, leading to inaccurate estimates and energy inefficiency, both of which can be mitigated by adopting a spatio-temporal approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Expand and Compress: Exploring Tuning Principles for Continual Spatio-Temporal Graph Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12593v2)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread deployment of sensing devices leads to a surge in data for spatio-temporal forecasting applications such as traffic flow, air quality, and wind energy. Although spatio-temporal graph neural networks have achieved success in modeling various static spatio-temporal forecasting scenarios, real-world spatio-temporal data are typically received in a streaming manner, and the network continuously expands with the installation of new sensors. Thus, spatio-temporal forecasting in streaming scenarios faces dual challenges: the inefficiency of retraining models over newly arrived data and the detrimental effects of catastrophic forgetting over long-term history. To address these challenges, we propose a novel prompt tuning-based continuous forecasting method, following two fundamental tuning principles guided by empirical and theoretical analysis: expand and compress, which effectively resolve the aforementioned problems with lightweight tuning parameters. Specifically, we integrate the base spatio-temporal graph neural network with a continuous prompt pool, utilizing stored prompts (i.e., few learnable parameters) in memory, and jointly optimize them with the base spatio-temporal graph neural network. This method ensures that the model sequentially learns from the spatio-temporal data stream to accomplish tasks for corresponding periods. Extensive experimental results on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the multi-faceted superiority of our method over the state-of-the-art baselines, including effectiveness, efficiency, universality, etc.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> |

However, existing methods typically rely on transformer-based architectures, which often face challenges related to scalability and efficiency. To address these issues, we propose a novel, efficient human-human interaction generation method based on the Mamba framework, designed to meet the demands of effectively capturing long-sequence dependencies while providing real-time feedback. Specifically, we introduce an adaptive spatio-temporal Mamba framework that utilizes two parallel SSM branches with an adaptive mechanism to integrate the spatial and temporal features of motion sequences. To further enhance the model's ability to capture dependencies within individual motion sequences and the interactions between different individual sequences, we develop two key modules: the self-adaptive spatio-temporal Mamba module and the cross-adaptive spatio-temporal Mamba module, enabling efficient feature learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results on two interaction datasets with remarkable quality and efficiency. Compared to the baseline method InterGen, our approach not only improves accuracy but also requires a minimal parameter size of just 66M ,only 36% of InterGen's, while achieving an average inference speed of 0.57 seconds, which is 46% of InterGen's execution time.</p></details> |  |

Many end-to-end approaches rely on human annotations to learn intermediate perception and prediction tasks, while purely self-supervised approaches--which directly learn from sensor inputs to generate planning trajectories without human annotations often underperform the state of the art. We observe a key gap in the input representation space: end-to-end approaches built on MLLMs are often pretrained with reasoning tasks in 2D image space rather than the native 3D space in which autonomous vehicles plan. To this end, we propose S4-Driver, a scalable self-supervised motion planning algorithm with spatio-temporal visual representation, based on the popular PaLI multimodal large language model. S4-Driver uses a novel sparse volume strategy to seamlessly transform the strong visual representation of MLLMs from perspective view to 3D space without the need to finetune the vision encoder. This representation aggregates multi-view and multi-frame visual inputs and enables better prediction of planning trajectories in 3D space. To validate our method, we run experiments on both nuScenes and Waymo Open Motion Dataset (with in-house camera data). Results show that S4-Driver performs favorably against existing supervised multi-task approaches while requiring no human annotations. It also demonstrates great scalability when pretrained on large volumes of unannotated driving logs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR2025; Project website: s4-driver.github.io</p></details> |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Fuzzy-oriented Multi-Modal Meta-Learning for Fine-grained Emotion Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13541v4)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-grained emotion recognition (FER) plays a vital role in various fields, such as disease diagnosis, personalized recommendations, and multimedia mining. However, existing FER methods face three key challenges in real-world applications: (i) they rely on large amounts of continuously annotated data to ensure accuracy since emotions are complex and ambiguous in reality, which is costly and time-consuming; (ii) they cannot capture the temporal heterogeneity caused by changing emotion patterns, because they usually assume that the temporal correlation within sampling periods is the same; (iii) they do not consider the spatial heterogeneity of different FER scenarios, that is, the distribution of emotion information in different data may have bias or interference. To address these challenges, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Fuzzy-oriented Multi-modal Meta-learning framework (ST-F2M). Specifically, ST-F2M first divides the multi-modal videos into multiple views, and each view corresponds to one modality of one emotion. Multiple randomly selected views for the same emotion form a meta-training task. Next, ST-F2M uses an integrated module with spatial and temporal convolutions to encode the data of each task, reflecting the spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Then it adds fuzzy semantic information to each task based on generalized fuzzy rules, which helps handle the complexity and ambiguity of emotions. Finally, ST-F2M learns emotion-related general meta-knowledge through meta-recurrent neural networks to achieve fast and robust fine-grained emotion recognition. Extensive experiments show that ST-F2M outperforms various state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and model efficiency. In addition, we construct ablation studies and further analysis to explore why ST-F2M performs well.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[A Bayesian Spatio-Temporal Top-Down Framework for Estimating Opioid Use Disorder Risk Under Data Sparsity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02303v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>County-level estimates of opioid use disorder (OUD) are essential for understanding the influence of local economic and social conditions. They provide policymakers with the granular information needed to identify, target, and implement effective interventions and allocate resources appropriately. Traditional disease mapping methods typically rely on Poisson regression, modeling observed counts while adjusting for local covariates that are treated as fixed and known. However, these methods may fail to capture the complexities and uncertainties in areas with sparse or absent data. To address this challenge, we developed a Bayesian hierarchical spatio-temporal top-down approach designed to estimate county-level OUD rates when direct small-area (county) data is unavailable. This method allows us to infer small-area OUD rates and quantify associated uncertainties, even in data-sparse environments using observed state-level OUD rates and a combination of state and county level informative covariates. We applied our approach to estimate OUD rates for 3,143 counties in the United States between 2010 and 2025. Model performance was assessed through simulation studies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unraveling Spatio-Temporal Foundation Models via the Pipeline Lens: A Comprehensive Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01364v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal deep learning models aims to utilize useful patterns in such data to support tasks like prediction. However, previous deep learning models designed for specific tasks typically require separate training for each use case, leading to increased computational and storage costs. To address this issue, spatio-temporal foundation models have emerged, offering a unified framework capable of solving multiple spatio-temporal tasks. These foundation models achieve remarkable success by learning general knowledge with spatio-temporal data or transferring the general capabilities of pre-trained language models. While previous surveys have explored spatio-temporal data and methodologies separately, they have ignored a comprehensive examination of how foundation models are designed, selected, pre-trained, and adapted. As a result, the overall pipeline for spatio-temporal foundation models remains unclear. To bridge this gap, we innovatively provide an up-to-date review of previous spatio-temporal foundation models from the pipeline perspective. The pipeline begins with an introduction to different types of spatio-temporal data, followed by details of data preprocessing and embedding techniques. The pipeline then presents a novel data property taxonomy to divide existing methods according to data sources and dependencies, providing efficient and effective model design and selection for researchers. On this basis, we further illustrate the training objectives of primitive models, as well as the adaptation techniques of transferred models. Overall, our survey provides a clear and structured pipeline to understand the connection between core elements of spatio-temporal foundation models while guiding researchers to get started quickly. Additionally, we introduce emerging opportunities such as multi-objective training in the field of spatio-temporal foundation models.</p></details> | 21 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Decoupled Learning for Spiking Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01117v1)** | 2025-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have gained significant attention for their potential to enable energy-efficient artificial intelligence. However, effective and efficient training of SNNs remains an unresolved challenge. While backpropagation through time (BPTT) achieves high accuracy, it incurs substantial memory overhead. In contrast, biologically plausible local learning methods are more memory-efficient but struggle to match the accuracy of BPTT. To bridge this gap, we propose spatio-temporal decouple learning (STDL), a novel training framework that decouples the spatial and temporal dependencies to achieve both high accuracy and training efficiency for SNNs. Specifically, to achieve spatial decoupling, STDL partitions the network into smaller subnetworks, each of which is trained independently using an auxiliary network. To address the decreased synergy among subnetworks resulting from spatial decoupling, STDL constructs each subnetwork's auxiliary network by selecting the largest subset of layers from its subsequent network layers under a memory constraint. Furthermore, STDL decouples dependencies across time steps to enable efficient online learning. Extensive evaluations on seven static and event-based vision datasets demonstrate that STDL consistently outperforms local learning methods and achieves comparable accuracy to the BPTT method with considerably reduced GPU memory cost. Notably, STDL achieves 4x reduced GPU memory than BPTT on the ImageNet dataset. Therefore, this work opens up a promising avenue for memory-efficient SNN training.

In this paper, we propose a noise-robust real-world VSR framework by incorporating self-supervised learning and Mamba into pre-trained latent diffusion models. To ensure content consistency across adjacent frames, we enhance the diffusion model with a global spatio-temporal attention mechanism using the Video State-Space block with a 3D Selective Scan module, which reinforces coherence at an affordable computational cost. To further reduce artifacts in generated details, we introduce a self-supervised ControlNet that leverages HR features as guidance and employs contrastive learning to extract degradation-insensitive features from LR videos. Finally, a three-stage training strategy based on a mixture of HR-LR videos is proposed to stabilize VSR training. The proposed Self-supervised ControlNet with Spatio-Temporal Continuous Mamba based VSR algorithm achieves superior perceptual quality than state-of-the-arts on real-world VSR benchmark datasets, validating the effectiveness of the proposed model design and training strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 10 figures, accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Fixed Variables: Expanding-variate Time Series Forecasting via Flat Scheme and Spatio-temporal Focal Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15296v2)** | 2025-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate Time Series Forecasting (MTSF) has long been a key research focus. Traditionally, these studies assume a fixed number of variables, but in real-world applications, Cyber-Physical Systems often expand as new sensors are deployed, increasing variables in MTSF. In light of this, we introduce a novel task, Expanding-variate Time Series Forecasting (EVTSF). This task presents unique challenges, specifically (1) handling inconsistent data shapes caused by adding new variables, and (2) addressing imbalanced spatio-temporal learning, where expanding variables have limited observed data due to the necessity for timely operation. To address these challenges, we propose STEV, a flexible spatio-temporal forecasting framework. STEV includes a new Flat Scheme to tackle the inconsistent data shape issue, which extends the graph-based spatio-temporal modeling architecture into 1D space by flattening the 2D samples along the variable dimension, making the model variable-scale-agnostic while still preserving dynamic spatial correlations through a holistic graph. We introduce a novel Spatio-temporal Focal Learning strategy that incorporates a negative filter to resolve potential conflicts between contrastive learning and graph representation, and a focal contrastive loss as its core to guide the framework to focus on optimizing the expanding variables. We benchmark EVTSF performance using three real-world datasets and compare it against three potential solutions employing SOTA MTSF models tailored for EVSTF. Experimental results show that STEV significantly outperforms its competitors, particularly on expanding variables. Notably, STEV, with only 5% of observations from the expanding period, is on par with SOTA MTSF models trained with complete observations. Further exploration of various expanding strategies underscores the generalizability of STEV in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

However, the interpretable spatio-temporal features extraction by soft sensors remains a challenge. In this light, this work introduces a novel method termed spatio-temporal consistent and interpretable model (STCIM). First, temporal and spatial features are captured and aligned by a far topological spatio-temporal consistency extraction block. Then, the features are mapped into an interpretable latent space for further prediction by explicitly giving physical meanings to latent variables. The efficacy of the proposed STCIM is demonstrated through the modeling of two generated datasets and a real-life dataset of coal-fired power plants. The corresponding experiments show: 1) The generalization of STCIM outperforms other methods, especially in different operation situations. 2) The far topological spatio-temporal consistency is vital for feature alignment. 3) The hyper-parameters of physics-informed interpretable latent space loss decide the performance of STCIM.</p></details> |  |

However, accurately forecasting STTS is challenging due to complex dynamic correlations in both time and space dimensions. Existing graph neural networks struggle to balance effectiveness and efficiency in modeling dynamic spatio-temporal relations. To address this problem, we propose the Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Stiefel Graph Neural Network (DST-SGNN) to efficiently process STTS. For DST-SGNN, we first introduce the novel Stiefel Graph Spectral Convolution (SGSC) and Stiefel Graph Fourier Transform (SGFT). The SGFT matrix in SGSC is constrained to lie on the Stiefel manifold, and SGSC can be regarded as a filtered graph spectral convolution. We also propose the Linear Dynamic Graph Optimization on Stiefel Manifold (LDGOSM), which can efficiently learn the SGFT matrix from the dynamic graph and significantly reduce the computational complexity. Finally, we propose a multi-layer SGSC (MSGSC) that efficiently captures complex spatio-temporal correlations. Extensive experiments on seven spatio-temporal datasets show that DST-SGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods while maintaining relatively low computational costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IJCAI 2025</p></details> |

While Graph Attention Networks (GATs) are popular for modeling spatial dependencies, they rely on predefined adjacency structures and dynamic attention scores, introducing inductive biases and computational overhead that can obscure interpretability. We propose InterGAT, a simplified alternative to GAT that replaces masked attention with a fully learnable, symmetric node interaction matrix, capturing latent spatial relationships without relying on fixed graph topologies. Our framework, InterGAT-GRU, which incorporates a GRU-based temporal decoder, outperforms the baseline GAT-GRU in forecasting accuracy, achieving at least a 21% improvement on the SZ-Taxi dataset and a 6% improvement on the Los-Loop dataset across all forecasting horizons (15 to 60 minutes). Additionally, we observed reduction in training time by 60-70% compared to GAT-GRU baseline. Crucially, the learned interaction matrix reveals interpretable structure: it recovers sparse, topology-aware attention patterns that align with community structure. Spectral and clustering analyses show that the model captures both localized and global dynamics, offering insights into the functional topology driving predictions. This highlights how structure learning can simultaneously support prediction, computational efficiency, and topological interpretabil-ity in dynamic graph-based domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 10 figures, workshop</p></details> |

However, real-world scenarios frequently present challenges such as signal anomalies, noise, and distributional shifts. Existing solutions primarily enhance robustness by modifying network architectures or training procedures. Nevertheless, these approaches are computationally intensive and resource-demanding, especially for large-scale applications. In this paper, we explore a novel test-time computing paradigm, namely learning with calibration, ST-TTC, for spatio-temporal forecasting. Through learning with calibration, we aim to capture periodic structural biases arising from non-stationarity during the testing phase and perform real-time bias correction on predictions to improve accuracy. Specifically, we first introduce a spectral-domain calibrator with phase-amplitude modulation to mitigate periodic shift and then propose a flash updating mechanism with a streaming memory queue for efficient test-time computation. ST-TTC effectively bypasses complex training-stage techniques, offering an efficient and generalizable paradigm. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness, universality, flexibility and efficiency of our proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 9 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

It provides a systematic approach to quantifying resource consumption, emissions, and waste, enabling industries, researchers, and policymakers to identify hotspots for sustainability improvements. By providing a comprehensive assessment of systems, from raw material extraction to end-of-life disposal, LCA facilitates the development of environmentally sound strategies, thereby contributing significantly to sustainable engineering and informed decision-making. Despite its strengths and ubiquitous use, life cycle analysis has not been reconciled with the broader literature in model-based systems engineering and analysis, thus hindering its integration into the design of complex systems more generally. This lack of reconciliation poses a significant problem, as it hinders the seamless integration of environmental sustainability into the design and optimization of complex systems. Without alignment between life cycle analysis (LCA) and model-based systems engineering (MBSE), sustainability remains an isolated consideration rather than an inherent part of the system's architecture and design. The original contribution of this paper is twofold. First, the paper reconciles process-based life cycle analysis with the broader literature and vocabulary of model-based systems engineering and hetero-functional graph theory. It ultimately proves that model-based systems engineering and hetero-functional graph theory are a formal generalization of process-based life cycle analysis. Secondly, the paper demonstrates how model-based systems engineering and hetero-functional graph theory may be used to enhance the spatio-temporal resolution of process-based life cycle analysis in a manner that aligns with system design objectives.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |

While spatial super-resolution and spectral super-resolution have been extensively studied, joint spatio-spectral super-resolution remains relatively explored. We propose an end-to-end model-driven framework that explicitly decomposes the joint spatio-spectral super-resolution problem into spatial super-resolution, spectral super-resolution and fusion tasks. Each sub-task is addressed by unfolding a variational-based approach, where the operators involved in the proximal gradient iterative scheme are replaced with tailored learnable modules. In particular, we design an upsampling operator for spatial super-resolution based on classical back-projection algorithms, adapted to handle arbitrary scaling factors. Spectral reconstruction is performed using learnable cluster-based upsampling and downsampling operators. For image fusion, we integrate low-frequency estimation and high-frequency injection modules to combine the spatial and spectral information from spatial super-resolution and spectral super-resolution outputs. Additionally, we introduce an efficient nonlocal post-processing step that leverages image self-similarity by combining a multi-head attention mechanism with residual connections. Extensive evaluations on several datasets and sampling factors demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Experimental results show that our method consistently reduces prediction error online during inference, demonstrating its potential for dynamic, resource-constrained environments.</p></details> | 6 pages |

However, it suffers from limitations in handling out-of-distribution samples without causing performance degradation. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) framework that dynamically adjusts the translation process based on the characteristics of each test sample. Our method introduces a Reconstruction Module to quantify the domain shift and a Dynamic Adaptation Block that selectively modifies the internal features of a pretrained translation model to mitigate the shift without compromising the performance on in-distribution samples that do not require adaptation. We evaluate our approach on two medical image-to-image translation tasks: low-dose CT denoising and T1 to T2 MRI translation, showing consistent improvements over both the baseline translation model without TTA and prior TTA methods. Our analysis highlights the limitations of the state-of-the-art that uniformly apply the adaptation to both out-of-distribution and in-distribution samples, demonstrating that dynamic, sample-specific adjustment offers a promising path to improve model resilience in real-world scenarios.

| **[Rethinking Irregular Time Series Forecasting: A Simple yet Effective Baseline](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11250v2)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The forecasting of irregular multivariate time series (IMTS) is a critical task in domains like healthcare and climate science. However, this task faces two significant hurdles: 1) the inherent non-uniformity and missing data in IMTS complicate the modeling of temporal dynamics, and 2) existing methods often rely on computationally expensive architectures. To address these dual challenges, we introduce APN, a general and efficient forecasting framework. At the core of APN is a novel Time-Aware Patch Aggregation (TAPA) module that introduces an aggregation-based paradigm for adaptive patching, moving beyond the limitations of fixed-span segmentation and interpolation-based methods. TAPA first learns dynamic temporal boundaries to define data-driven segments. Crucially, instead of resampling or interpolating, it directly computes patch representations via a time-aware weighted aggregation of all raw observations, where weights are determined by each observation's temporal relevance to the segment. This approach provides two key advantages: it preserves data fidelity by avoiding the introduction of artificial data points and ensures complete information coverage by design.The resulting regularized and information-rich patch representations enable the use of a lightweight query module for historical context aggregation and a simple MLP for final prediction. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that APN establishes a new state-of-the-art, significantly outperforming existing methods in both prediction accuracy and computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Localized Sparse Principal Component Analysis of Multivariate Time Series in Frequency Domain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08177v2)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Principal component analysis has been a main tool in multivariate analysis for estimating a low dimensional linear subspace that explains most of the variability in the data. However, in high-dimensional regimes, naive estimates of the principal loadings are not consistent and difficult to interpret. In the context of time series, principal component analysis of spectral density matrices can provide valuable, parsimonious information about the behavior of the underlying process, particularly if the principal components are interpretable in that they are sparse in coordinates and localized in frequency bands. In this paper, we introduce a formulation and consistent estimation procedure for interpretable principal component analysis for high-dimensional time series in the frequency domain. An efficient frequency-sequential algorithm is developed to compute sparse-localized estimates of the low-dimensional principal subspaces of the signal process. The method is motivated by and used to understand neurological mechanisms from high-density resting-state EEG in a study of first episode psychosis.</p></details> | 63 pages, 6 figures |

Pinatubo eruption resulted in a massive increase of sulfate aerosols in the atmosphere, absorbing radiation and leading to global changes in surface and stratospheric temperatures. A volcanic eruption of this magnitude serves as a natural analog for stratospheric aerosol injection, a proposed solar radiation modification method to combat a warming climate. The impacts of such an event are multifaceted and region-specific. Our goal is to characterize the multivariate and dynamic nature of the atmospheric impacts following the Mt. Pinatubo eruption. We developed a multivariate space-time dynamic linear model to understand the full extent of the spatially- and temporally-varying impacts. Specifically, spatial variation is modeled using a flexible set of basis functions for which the basis coefficients are allowed to vary in time through a vector autoregressive (VAR) structure. This novel model is caste in a Dynamic Linear Model (DLM) framework and estimated via a customized MCMC approach. We demonstrate how the model quantifies the relationships between key atmospheric parameters prior to and following the Mt. Pinatubo eruption with reanalysis data from MERRA-2 and highlight when such model is advantageous over univariate models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Band Variable-Lag Granger Causality: A Unified Framework for Causal Time Series Inference across Frequencies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00658v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding causal relationships in time series is fundamental to many domains, including neuroscience, economics, and behavioral science. Granger causality is one of the well-known techniques for inferring causality in time series. Typically, Granger causality frameworks have a strong fix-lag assumption between cause and effect, which is often unrealistic in complex systems. While recent work on variable-lag Granger causality (VLGC) addresses this limitation by allowing a cause to influence an effect with different time lags at each time point, it fails to account for the fact that causal interactions may vary not only in time delay but also across frequency bands. For example, in brain signals, alpha-band activity may influence another region with a shorter delay than slower delta-band oscillations. In this work, we formalize Multi-Band Variable-Lag Granger Causality (MB-VLGC) and propose a novel framework that generalizes traditional VLGC by explicitly modeling frequency-dependent causal delays. We provide a formal definition of MB-VLGC, demonstrate its theoretical soundness, and propose an efficient inference pipeline. Extensive experiments across multiple domains demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets, confirming its broad applicability to any type of time series data. Code and datasets are publicly available.</p></details> | First draft |
| **[Un-mixing Test-time Adaptation under Heterogeneous Data Streams](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15173v2)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deploying deep models in real-world scenarios remains challenging due to significant performance drops under distribution shifts between training and deployment environments. Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) has recently emerged as a promising solution, enabling on-the-fly model adaptation without access to source data. However, its effectiveness degrades significantly in the presence of complex, mixed distribution shifts - common in practical settings - where multiple latent domains coexist. Adapting under such intrinsic heterogeneity, especially in unlabeled and online conditions, remains an open and underexplored challenge. In this paper, we study TTA under mixed distribution shifts and move beyond conventional homogeneous adaptation paradigms. By revisiting TTA from a frequency-domain perspective, we observe that distribution heterogeneity often manifests in Fourier space - for instance, high-frequency components tend to carry domain-specific variations. This motivates us to perform domain-aware separation using high-frequency texture cues, making diverse shift patterns more tractable. To this end, we propose FreDA, a novel Frequency-based Decentralized Adaptation framework that decomposes globally heterogeneous data into locally homogeneous components in the frequency domain. It further employs decentralized learning and augmentation strategies to robustly adapt under complex, evolving shifts. Extensive experiments across various environments (corrupted, natural, and medical) demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework over the state-of-the-arts.</p></details> |  |
| **[KFS: KAN based adaptive Frequency Selection learning architecture for long term time series forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00635v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-scale decomposition architectures have emerged as predominant methodologies in time series forecasting. However, real-world time series exhibit noise interference across different scales, while heterogeneous information distribution among frequency components at varying scales leads to suboptimal multi-scale representation. Inspired by Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) and Parseval's theorem, we propose a KAN based adaptive Frequency Selection learning architecture (KFS) to address these challenges. This framework tackles prediction challenges stemming from cross-scale noise interference and complex pattern modeling through its FreK module, which performs energy-distribution-based dominant frequency selection in the spectral domain. Simultaneously, KAN enables sophisticated pattern representation while timestamp embedding alignment synchronizes temporal representations across scales. The feature mixing module then fuses scale-specific patterns with aligned temporal features. Extensive experiments across multiple real-world time series datasets demonstrate that KT achieves state-of-the-art performance as a simple yet effective architecture.</p></details> |  |

To address these limitations, we propose a novel task, Time-series Reasoning for Anomaly (Time-RA) that transforms classical time series anomaly detection from a discriminative into a generative, reasoning-intensive task leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). Also, we introduce the first real-world multimodal benchmark dataset, RATs40K, explicitly annotated for anomaly reasoning, comprising approximately 40,000 samples across 10 real-world domains. Each sample includes numeric time series data, contextual text information, and visual representations, each annotated with fine-grained categories (14 types for univariate anomalies and 6 for multivariate anomalies) and structured explanatory reasoning. We develop a sophisticated annotation framework utilizing ensemble-generated labels refined through GPT-4-driven feedback, ensuring accuracy and interpretability. Extensive benchmarking of LLMs and multimodal LLMs demonstrates the capabilities and limitations of current models, highlighting the critical role of supervised fine-tuning. Our dataset and task pave the way for significant advancements in interpretable time series anomaly detection and reasoning. The code (https://github.com/yyysjz1997/Time-RA) and dataset (https://huggingface.co/datasets/Time-RA/RATs40K) have been fully open-sourced to support and accelerate future research in this area.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review. 19 pages, 8 figures, 12 tables.

In this work, we introduce MCLM, a multilingual math benchmark featuring competition-level problems in 55 languages. We test three test-time scaling methods-Outcome Reward Modeling (ORM), Process Reward Modeling (ORM), and Budget Forcing (BF)-on both Qwen2.5-1.5B Math and MR1-1.5B, a multilingual LLM we trained for extended reasoning. Our experiments show that using Qwen2.5-1.5B Math with ORM achieves a score of 35.8 on MCLM, while BF on MR1-1.5B attains 35.2. Although "thinking LLMs" have recently garnered significant attention, we find that their performance is comparable to traditional scaling methods like best-of-N once constrained to similar levels of inference FLOPs. Moreover, while BF yields a 20-point improvement on English AIME, it provides only a 1.94-point average gain across other languages-a pattern consistent across the other test-time scaling methods we studied-higlighting that test-time scaling may not generalize as effectively to multilingual tasks. To foster further research, we release MCLM, MR1-1.5B, and evaluation results.</p></details> | ACL 2025 (ORAL) |

The challenges of identifying features in time-series data are addressed by employing a continuous wavelet transform to extract spectral features and wavelet coherence analysis is used to compare recorded audio spectrograms to synthetically generated tunes. The synthetic tunes are derived from ABC notation, which is a common symbolic representation for Irish music. Experimental results demonstrate that the wavelet-based method can accurately and efficiently identify recorded tunes. This research study also details the performance of the wavelet coherence model, highlighting its strengths over other methods of time-frequency decomposition. Additionally, we discuss and deploy the model on several applications beyond music, including in EEG signal analysis and financial time series forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Maste...</summary><p>Master's thesis.

Although vision-language models like Contrastive Language Image Pretraining (CLIP) have shown strong capabilities in joint visual-textual reasoning, their effectiveness in capturing temporal progression remains limited. To address this, we propose CLIPTime, a multimodal, multitask framework designed to predict both the developmental stage and the corresponding timestamp of fungal growth from image and text inputs. Built upon the CLIP architecture, our model learns joint visual-textual embeddings and enables time-aware inference without requiring explicit temporal input during testing. To facilitate training and evaluation, we introduce a synthetic fungal growth dataset annotated with aligned timestamps and categorical stage labels. CLIPTime jointly performs classification and regression, predicting discrete growth stages alongside continuous timestamps. We also propose custom evaluation metrics, including temporal accuracy and regression error, to assess the precision of time-aware predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that CLIPTime effectively models biological progression and produces interpretable, temporally grounded outputs, highlighting the potential of vision-language models in real-world biological monitoring applications.</p></details> | 11 pages, 8 figures |
| **[TopoTTA: Topology-Enhanced Test-Time Adaptation for Tubular Structure Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00442v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tubular structure segmentation (TSS) is important for various applications, such as hemodynamic analysis and route navigation. Despite significant progress in TSS, domain shifts remain a major challenge, leading to performance degradation in unseen target domains. Unlike other segmentation tasks, TSS is more sensitive to domain shifts, as changes in topological structures can compromise segmentation integrity, and variations in local features distinguishing foreground from background (e.g., texture and contrast) may further disrupt topological continuity. To address these challenges, we propose Topology-enhanced Test-Time Adaptation (TopoTTA), the first test-time adaptation framework designed specifically for TSS. TopoTTA consists of two stages: Stage 1 adapts models to cross-domain topological discrepancies using the proposed Topological Meta Difference Convolutions (TopoMDCs), which enhance topological representation without altering pre-trained parameters; Stage 2 improves topological continuity by a novel Topology Hard sample Generation (TopoHG) strategy and prediction alignment on hard samples with pseudo-labels in the generated pseudo-break regions. Extensive experiments across four scenarios and ten datasets demonstrate TopoTTA's effectiveness in handling topological distribution shifts, achieving an average improvement of 31.81% in clDice. TopoTTA also serves as a plug-and-play TTA solution for CNN-based TSS models.</p></details> |  |
| **[TOP: Time Optimization Policy for Stable and Accurate Standing Manipulation with Humanoid Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00355v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humanoid robots have the potential capability to perform a diverse range of manipulation tasks, but this is based on a robust and precise standing controller. Existing methods are either ill-suited to precisely control high-dimensional upper-body joints, or difficult to ensure both robustness and accuracy, especially when upper-body motions are fast. This paper proposes a novel time optimization policy (TOP), to train a standing manipulation control model that ensures balance, precision, and time efficiency simultaneously, with the idea of adjusting the time trajectory of upper-body motions but not only strengthening the disturbance resistance of the lower-body. Our approach consists of three parts. Firstly, we utilize motion prior to represent upper-body motions to enhance the coordination ability between the upper and lower-body by training a variational autoencoder (VAE). Then we decouple the whole-body control into an upper-body PD controller for precision and a lower-body RL controller to enhance robust stability. Finally, we train TOP method in conjunction with the decoupled controller and VAE to reduce the balance burden resulting from fast upper-body motions that would destabilize the robot and exceed the capabilities of the lower-body RL policy. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated via both simulation and real world experiments, which demonstrate the superiority on standing manipulation tasks stably and accurately.

We first conducted in-depth semi-structured interviews with 12 users to understand their perceptions of security and privacy landscapes on online medical consultation platforms, as well as their practices, challenges and expectation. Our analysis reveals a critical disconnect between users' desires for anonymity and control, and platform realities that offload the responsibility of ``privacy labor''. To bridge this gap, we present SafeShare, an interaction technique that leverages localized LLM to redact consultations in real-time. SafeShare balances utility and privacy through selectively anonymize private information. A technical evaluation of SafeShare's core PII detection module on 3 dataset demonstrates high efficacy, achieving 89.64\% accuracy with Qwen3-4B on IMCS21 dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Polynomial-Time Constant-Approximation for Fair Sum-of-Radii Clustering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14683v2)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In a seminal work, Chierichetti et al. introduced the $(t,k)$-fair clustering problem: Given a set of red points and a set of blue points in a metric space, a clustering is called fair if the number of red points in each cluster is at most $t$ times and at least $1/t$ times the number of blue points in that cluster. The goal is to compute a fair clustering with at most $k$ clusters that optimizes certain objective function. Considering this problem, they designed a polynomial-time $O(1)$- and $O(t)$-approximation for the $k$-center and the $k$-median objective, respectively. Recently, Carta et al. studied this problem with the sum-of-radii objective and obtained a $(6+\epsilon)$-approximation with running time $O((k\log_{1+\epsilon}(k/\epsilon))^kn^{O(1)})$, i.e., fixed-parameter tractable in $k$. Here $n$ is the input size. In this work, we design the first polynomial-time $O(1)$-approximation for $(t,k)$-fair clustering with the sum-of-radii objective, improving the result of Carta et al. Our result places sum-of-radii in the same group of objectives as $k$-center, that admit polynomial-time $O(1)$-approximations. This result also implies a polynomial-time $O(1)$-approximation for the Euclidean version of the problem, for which an $f(k)\cdot n^{O(1)}$-time $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation was known due to Drexler et al.. Here $f$ is an exponential function of $k$. We are also able to extend our result to any arbitrary $\ell\ge 2$ number of colors when $t=1$. This matches known results for the $k$-center and $k$-median objectives in this case. The significant disparity of sum-of-radii compared to $k$-center and $k$-median presents several complex challenges, all of which we successfully overcome in our work. Our main contribution is a novel cluster-merging-based analysis technique for sum-of-radii that helps us achieve the constant-approximation bounds.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 33rd Annual European Symposium on Algorithms (ESA 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Adapting to the Unknown: Robust Meta-Learning for Zero-Shot Financial Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09664v2)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Financial time series forecasting in zero-shot settings is critical for investment decisions, especially during abrupt market regime shifts or in emerging markets with limited historical data. While Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) approaches show promise, existing meta-task construction strategies often yield suboptimal performance for highly turbulent financial series. To address this, we propose a novel task-construction method that leverages learned embeddings for both meta task and also downstream predictions, enabling effective zero-shot meta-learning. Specifically, we use Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) to softly cluster embeddings, constructing two complementary meta-task types: intra-cluster tasks and inter-cluster tasks. By assigning embeddings to multiple latent regimes probabilistically, GMMs enable richer, more diverse meta-learning. This dual approach ensures the model can quickly adapt to local patterns while simultaneously capturing invariant cross-series features. Furthermore, we enhance inter-cluster generalization through hard task mining, which identifies robust patterns across divergent market regimes. Our method was validated using real-world financial data from high-volatility periods and multiple international markets (including emerging markets). The results demonstrate significant out-performance over existing approaches and stronger generalization in zero-shot scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Active cyber deception is a promising strategy to thwart RW and limiting its propagation by misleading it with false information and revealing its true behaviors. Furthermore, RW often acts as a communication conduit between attackers and defenders, allowing deception to return false data to attackers and deplete their resources. This paper introduces ranDecepter, a novel approach that combines active cyber deception with real-time analysis to enhance defenses against RW attacks. The ranDecepter identifies RW in real-time and isolates it within a deceptive environment, autonomously identifying critical elements in the RW code to create a loop mechanism. By repeatedly restarting the malware and transmitting counterfeit encryption information and secret keys to the attacker, it forces the attacker to store these fabricated details for each victim, thereby depleting their resources. Our comprehensive evaluation of ranDecepter, conducted using 1,134 real-world malware samples and twelve benign applications, demonstrates a remarkable 100% accuracy in RW identification, with no false positives and minimal impact on response times. Furthermore, within 24-hours, ranDecepter generates up to 9,223K entries in the attacker's database using 50 agents, showcasing its potential to undermine attacker resources.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE Conference on Communications and Network Security (CNS) 2025</p></details> |

Training-free conditioning via guidance with off-the-shelf models is a favorable alternative to avoid further fine-tuning on the base model. However, the existing training-free guidance frameworks either have heavy memory requirements or offer sub-optimal control due to rough estimation. These shortcomings limit the applicability to control diffusion models that require intense computation, such as Text-to-Video (T2V) diffusion models. In this work, we propose Taming Inference Time Alignment for Guided Text-to-Video Diffusion Model, so-called TITAN-Guide, which overcomes memory space issues, and provides more optimal control in the guidance process compared to the counterparts. In particular, we develop an efficient method for optimizing diffusion latents without backpropagation from a discriminative guiding model. In particular, we study forward gradient descents for guided diffusion tasks with various options on directional directives. In our experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in efficiently managing memory during latent optimization, while previous methods fall short. Our proposed approach not only minimizes memory requirements but also significantly enhances T2V performance across a range of diffusion guidance benchmarks.

| **[Neural Co-state Projection Regulator: A Model-free Paradigm for Real-time Optimal Control with Input Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00283v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning-based approaches, notably Reinforcement Learning (RL), have shown promise for solving optimal control tasks without explicit system models. However, these approaches are often sample-inefficient, sensitive to reward design and hyperparameters, and prone to poor generalization, especially under input constraints. To address these challenges, we introduce the neural co-state projection regulator (NCPR), a model-free learning-based optimal control framework that is grounded in Pontryagin's Minimum Principle (PMP) and capable of solving quadratic regulator problems in nonlinear control-affine systems with input constraints. In this framework, a neural network (NN) is trained in a self-supervised setting to take the current state of the system as input and predict a finite-horizon trajectory of projected co-states (i.e., the co-state weighted by the system's input gain). Subsequently, only the first element of the NN's prediction is extracted to solve a lightweight quadratic program (QP). This workflow is executed in a feedback control setting, allowing real-time computation of control actions that satisfy both input constraints and first-order optimality conditions. We test the proposed learning-based model-free quadratic regulator on (1) a unicycle model robot reference tracking problem and (2) a pendulum swing-up task. For comparison, reinforcement learning is used on both tasks; and for context, a model-based controller is used in the unicycle model example. Our method demonstrates superior generalizability in terms of both unseen system states and varying input constraints, and also shows improved sampling efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Federated Time Series Generation on Feature and Temporally Misaligned Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21072v2)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distributed time series data presents a challenge for federated learning, as clients often possess different feature sets and have misaligned time steps. Existing federated time series models are limited by the assumption of perfect temporal or feature alignment across clients. In this paper, we propose FedTDD, a novel federated time series diffusion model that jointly learns a synthesizer across clients. At the core of FedTDD is a novel data distillation and aggregation framework that reconciles the differences between clients by imputing the misaligned timesteps and features. In contrast to traditional federated learning, FedTDD learns the correlation across clients' time series through the exchange of local synthetic outputs instead of model parameters. A coordinator iteratively improves a global distiller network by leveraging shared knowledge from clients through the exchange of synthetic data. As the distiller becomes more refined over time, it subsequently enhances the quality of the clients' local feature estimates, allowing each client to then improve its local imputations for missing data using the latest, more accurate distiller. Experimental results on five datasets demonstrate FedTDD's effectiveness compared to centralized training, and the effectiveness of sharing synthetic outputs to transfer knowledge of local time series. Notably, FedTDD achieves 79.4% and 62.8% improvement over local training in Context-FID and Correlational scores.</p></details> |  |
| **[Conditional independence testing with a single realization of a multivariate nonstationary nonlinear time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21647v2)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying relationships among stochastic processes is a core objective in many fields, such as economics. While the standard toolkit for multivariate time series analysis has many advantages, it can be difficult to capture nonlinear dynamics using linear vector autoregressive models. This difficulty has motivated the development of methods for causal discovery and variable selection for nonlinear time series, which routinely employ tests for conditional independence. In this paper, we introduce the first framework for conditional independence testing that works with a single realization of a nonstationary nonlinear process. We also show how our framework can be used to test for independence. The key technical ingredients of our framework are time-varying nonlinear regression, estimation of local long-run covariance matrices of products of error processes, and a distribution-uniform strong Gaussian approximation.</p></details> |  |

A $C^1$ continuous, saturated prescribed-time adjustment (PPTA) function is presented, along with the establishment of a practical prescribed-time stability criterion. Utilizing the time scale transformation technique and the PPTA function, we propose a prescribed-time guidance law that guides the boresight vector from almost any initial orientation in free space to a small neighborhood of the goal orientation within a preassigned time, while avoiding all forbidden zones augmented with safety margins. Subsequently, a prescribed-time disturbance observer (PTDO) is derived to reconstruct the external disturbances. By leveraging barrier and PPTA functions, a PTDO-based reduced-attitude tracking controller is developed, which ensures prescribed-time boresight tracking within a ``safe tube''. By judiciously setting the safety margins, settling times, and safe tube for the guidance and control laws, the proposed IBGC scheme achieves pointing-constrained boresight reorientation within a required task completion time. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed IBGC scheme.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces a novel framework for distributional forecasting of order fulfillment time, leveraging Conformal Predictive Systems and Cross Venn-Abers Predictors -- model-agnostic techniques that provide rigorous coverage or validity guarantees. The proposed machine learning methods integrate granular spatiotemporal features, capturing fulfillment location and carrier performance dynamics to enhance predictive accuracy. Additionally, a cost-sensitive decision rule is developed to convert probabilistic forecasts into reliable point predictions. Experimental evaluation on a large-scale industrial dataset demonstrates that the proposed methods generate competitive distributional forecasts, while machine learning-based point predictions significantly outperform the existing rule-based system -- achieving up to 14% higher prediction accuracy and up to 75% improvement in identifying late deliveries.</p></details> |  |
| **[Partial Floquet Transformation and Model Order Reduction of Linear Time-Periodic Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00221v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-periodic dynamical systems occur commonly both in nature and as engineered systems. Large-scale linear time-periodic dynamical systems, for example, may arise through linearization of a nonlinear system about a given periodic solution (possibly as a consequence of a baseline periodic forcing) with subsequent spatial discretization. The potential need to simulate responses to a wide variety of input profiles (viewed as perturbations off a baseline periodic forcing) creates a potent incentive for effective model reduction strategies applicable to linear time-periodic (LTP) systems. Classical approaches that take into account the underlying time-periodic system structure often utilize the Floquet transform; however, computation of the Floquet transform is typically intractable for large order systems. In this paper, we develop the notion of a partial Floquet transformation connected to selected invariant subspaces of a time-varying differential operator associated with the LTP system. We modify and repurpose the Dominant Pole Algorithm of Rommes to identify effective invariant subspaces useful for model reduction. We discuss the construction of associated partial Floquet transformations and time-varying reduction bases with which to produce effective reduced-order LTP models and illustrate the process on a simple time-periodic system.</p></details> | 21 pages |
| **[The time slot allocation problem in liberalised passenger railway markets: a multi-objective approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12073v2)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The liberalisation of the European passenger railway markets through the European Directive EU 91/440/EEC states a new scenario where different Railway Undertakings compete with each other in a bidding process for time slots. The infrastructure resources are provided by the Infrastructure Manager, who analyses and assesses the bids received, allocating the resources to each Railway Undertaking. Time slot allocation is a fact that drastically influences the market equilibrium. In this paper, we address the time slot allocation problem within the context of a liberalized passenger railway market as a multi-objective model. The Infrastructure Manager is tasked with selecting a point from the Pareto front as the solution to the time slot allocation problem. We propose two criteria for making this selection: the first one allocates time slots to each company according to a set of priorities, while the second one introduces a criterion of fairness in the treatment of companies to incentive competition. The assessment of the impact of these rules on market equilibrium has been conducted on a liberalized high-speed corridor within the Spanish railway network.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages and 6 figures</p></details> |

The paper develops an empirical application to an experiment on intertemporal choice, showing that the use of response times delivers predictive accuracy and matters for the estimation of economically relevant parameters.</p></details> |  |
| **[$\texttt{BATCLIP}$: Bimodal Online Test-Time Adaptation for CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02837v3)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although open-vocabulary classification models like Contrastive Language Image Pretraining (CLIP) have demonstrated strong zero-shot learning capabilities, their robustness to common image corruptions remains poorly understood. Through extensive experiments, we show that zero-shot CLIP lacks robustness to common image corruptions during test-time, necessitating the adaptation of CLIP to unlabeled corrupted images using test-time adaptation (TTA). However, we found that existing TTA methods have severe limitations in adapting CLIP due to their unimodal nature. To address these limitations, we propose $\texttt{BATCLIP}$, a bimodal $\textbf{online}$ TTA method designed to improve CLIP's robustness to common image corruptions. The key insight of our approach is not only to adapt the visual encoders for improving image features but also to strengthen the alignment between image and text features by promoting a stronger association between the image class prototype, computed using pseudo-labels, and the corresponding text feature. We evaluate our approach on benchmark image corruption datasets and achieve state-of-the-art results in online TTA for CLIP. Furthermore, we evaluate our proposed TTA approach on various domain generalization datasets to demonstrate its generalization capabilities.

| **[PATH: A Discrete-sequence Dataset for Evaluating Online Unsupervised Anomaly Detection Approaches for Multivariate Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13951v5)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Benchmarking anomaly detection approaches for multivariate time series is a challenging task due to a lack of high-quality datasets. Current publicly available datasets are too small, not diverse and feature trivial anomalies, which hinders measurable progress in this research area. We propose a solution: a diverse, extensive, and non-trivial dataset generated via state-of-the-art simulation tools that reflects realistic behaviour of an automotive powertrain, including its multivariate, dynamic and variable-state properties. Additionally, our dataset represents a discrete-sequence problem, which remains unaddressed by previously-proposed solutions in literature. To cater for both unsupervised and semi-supervised anomaly detection settings, as well as time series generation and forecasting, we make different versions of the dataset available, where training and test subsets are offered in contaminated and clean versions, depending on the task. We also provide baseline results from a selection of approaches based on deterministic and variational autoencoders, as well as a non-parametric approach. As expected, the baseline experimentation shows that the approaches trained on the semi-supervised version of the dataset outperform their unsupervised counterparts, highlighting a need for approaches more robust to contaminated training data. Furthermore, results show that the threshold used can have a large influence on detection performance, hence more work needs to be invested in methods to find a suitable threshold without the need for labelled data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the Big Data Research journal</p></details> |

Contemporary literature includes some works centered on the task of solving physics problems - a crucial domain of natural language reasoning. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of frontier LLMs in solving physics problems, both mathematical and descriptive. We also employ a plethora of inference-time techniques and agentic frameworks to improve the performance of the models. This includes the verification of proposed solutions in a cumulative fashion by other, smaller LLM agents, and we perform a comparative analysis of the performance that the techniques entail. There are significant improvements when the multi-agent framework is applied to problems that the models initially perform poorly on. Furthermore, we introduce a new evaluation benchmark for physics problems, ${\rm P{\small HYSICS}E{\small VAL}}$, consisting of 19,609 problems sourced from various physics textbooks and their corresponding correct solutions scraped from physics forums and educational websites.

With the increasing proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) and smart manufacturing, time-series data has dramatically increased in both scale and dimensionality. This growth has exposed the limitations of traditional statistical methods in handling the high heterogeneity and complexity of such data. Inspired by the recent success of large language models (LLMs) in multimodal tasks across language and vision domains, we propose a novel unsupervised anomaly detection framework: A Tri-Branch Patch-wise Large Language Model Framework for Time-Series Anomaly Detection (TriP-LLM). TriP-LLM integrates local and global temporal features through a tri-branch design-Patching, Selection, and Global-to encode the input time series into patch-wise tokens, which are then processed by a frozen, pretrained LLM. A lightweight patch-wise decoder reconstructs the input, from which anomaly scores are derived. We evaluate TriP-LLM on several public benchmark datasets using PATE, a recently proposed threshold-free evaluation metric, and conduct all comparisons within a unified open-source framework to ensure fairness. Experimental results show that TriP-LLM consistently outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods across all datasets, demonstrating strong detection capabilities. Furthermore, through extensive ablation studies, we verify the substantial contribution of the LLM to the overall architecture. Compared to LLM-based approaches using Channel Independence (CI) patch processing, TriP-LLM achieves significantly lower memory consumption, making it more suitable for GPU memory-constrained environments. All code and model checkpoints are publicly available on https://github.com/YYZStart/TriP-LLM.git</p></details> | 11 pages, 2 figures |

Existing news summarization methods typically utilizes Large Language Models and Graphical methods on article-based summaries. However, this is not effective since it only considers the textual content of similarly dated articles to understand the gist of the event. To counteract the lack of analysis on the parties involved, it is essential to come up with a novel framework to gauge the importance of stakeholders and the connection of related events through the relevant entities involved. Therefore, we present SUnSET: Synergistic Understanding of Stakeholder, Events and Time for the task of Timeline Summarization (TLS). We leverage powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) to build SET triplets and introduced the use of stakeholder-based ranking to construct a $Relevancy$ metric, which can be extended into general situations. Our experimental results outperform all prior baselines and emerged as the new State-of-the-Art, highlighting the impact of stakeholder information within news article.</p></details> |  |
| **[PatchTraj: Unified Time-Frequency Representation Learning via Dynamic Patches for Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19119v3)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pedestrian trajectory prediction is crucial for autonomous driving and robotics. While existing point-based and grid-based methods expose two main limitations: insufficiently modeling human motion dynamics, as they fail to balance local motion details with long-range spatiotemporal dependencies, and the time representations lack interaction with their frequency components in jointly modeling trajectory sequences. To address these challenges, we propose PatchTraj, a dynamic patch-based framework that integrates time-frequency joint modeling for trajectory prediction. Specifically, we decompose the trajectory into raw time sequences and frequency components, and employ dynamic patch partitioning to perform multi-scale segmentation, capturing hierarchical motion patterns. Each patch undergoes adaptive embedding with scale-aware feature extraction, followed by hierarchical feature aggregation to model both fine-grained and long-range dependencies. The outputs of the two branches are further enhanced via cross-modal attention, facilitating complementary fusion of temporal and spectral cues. The resulting enhanced embeddings exhibit strong expressive power, enabling accurate predictions even when using a vanilla Transformer architecture. Extensive experiments on ETH-UCY, SDD, NBA, and JRDB datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, on the egocentric JRDB dataset, PatchTraj attains significant relative improvements of 26.7% in ADE and 17.4% in FDE, underscoring its substantial potential in embodied intelligence.</p></details> |  |

We introduce the Latent Generative Transformer Augmentation (L-GTA) model, a generative approach using a transformer-based variational recurrent autoencoder. This model uses controlled transformations within the latent space of the model to generate new time series that preserve the intrinsic properties of the original dataset. L-GTA enables the application of diverse transformations, ranging from simple jittering to magnitude warping, and combining these basic transformations to generate more complex synthetic time series datasets. Our evaluation of several real-world datasets demonstrates the ability of L-GTA to produce more reliable, consistent, and controllable augmented data. This translates into significant improvements in predictive accuracy and similarity measures compared to direct transformation methods.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose a distributionally robust risk framework for analyzing cascading failures in multi-agent rendezvous. To capture the complex interactions between network connectivity, system dynamics, and communication delays, we use a time-delayed network model as a benchmark. We introduce a conditional distributionally robust functional to quantify cascading effects between agents, utilizing a bi-variate normal distribution. Our approach yields closed-form risk expressions that reveal the impact of time delay, noise statistics, communication topology, and failure modes on rendezvous risk. The insights derived inform the design of resilient networks that mitigate the risk of cascading failures. We validate our theoretical results through extensive simulations, demonstrating the effectiveness of our framework.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, we formulate a manifold-regularised variant of the $\ell_p$-SVDD method to encourage label smoothness on the underlying manifold to capture structural information for improved detection performance. Drawing on an existing Representer theorem, we then provide an effective optimisation technique for the proposed method and show that it can benefit from the signature kernel to capture time series complexities for anomaly detection. We theoretically study the proposed approach using Rademacher complexities to analyse its generalisation performance and also provide an experimental assessment of the proposed method across various data sets to compare its performance against other methods.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present an approach for scene flow estimation from low-density and noisy point clouds acquired from miniaturized Time of Flight (ToF) sensors distributed on the robot body. The proposed method clusters points from consecutive frames and applies Iterative Closest Point (ICP) to estimate a dense motion flow, with additional steps introduced to mitigate the impact of sensor noise and low-density data points. Specifically, we employ a fitness-based classification to distinguish between stationary and moving points and an inlier removal strategy to refine geometric correspondences. The proposed approach is validated in an experimental setup where 24 ToF are used to estimate the velocity of an object moving at different controlled speeds. Experimental results show that the method consistently approximates the direction of the motion and its magnitude with an error which is in line with sensor noise.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables, 1 algorithm, IEEE RO-MAN 2025 accepted paper</p></details> |

In some situations, these interactions eventually yield a consensus opinion; in others, they can lead to opinion fragmentation and the formation of different opinion groups in the form of ``echo chambers''. Consider a social network of individuals with continuous-valued scalar opinions, and suppose that they can change their opinions when they interact with each other. In many models of the opinion dynamics of individuals in a network, it is common for opinion updates to depend on the mean opinion of interacting individuals. As an alternative, which may be more realistic in some situations, we study an opinion model with an opinion-update rule that depends on the weighted median of the opinions of interacting individuals. Through numerical simulations of our median-update opinion model, we investigate how the final opinion distribution depends on network structure. For configuration-model networks, we also derive a mean-field approximation for the asymptotic dynamics of the opinion distribution when there are infinitely many individuals. We numerically investigate its accuracy for short-time opinion dynamics on various networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 13 figures, Submitted to SIAM Journal on Applied Dynamical Systems.

Sign languages, which rely on visual-spatial patterns of hand gestures & body movements, are the primary mode of communication for deaf & mute communities worldwide. Effective communication is fundamental to human interaction, yet individuals in these communities often face significant barriers due to a scarcity of skilled interpreters & accessible translation technologies. This research specifically addresses these challenges within the Indian context by focusing on Indian Sign Language (ISL). By leveraging machine learning, this study aims to bridge the critical communication gap for the deaf & hard-of-hearing population in India, where technological solutions for ISL are less developed compared to other global sign languages. We propose a robust, real-time ISL detection & translation system built upon a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Our model is trained on a comprehensive ISL dataset & demonstrates exceptional performance, achieving a classification accuracy of 99.95%. This high precision underscores the model's capability to discern the nuanced visual features of different signs. The system's effectiveness is rigorously evaluated using key performance metrics, including accuracy, F1 score, precision & recall, ensuring its reliability for real-world applications. For real-time implementation, the framework integrates MediaPipe for precise hand tracking & motion detection, enabling seamless translation of dynamic gestures. This paper provides a detailed account of the model's architecture, the data preprocessing pipeline & the classification methodology. The research elaborates the model architecture, preprocessing & classification methodologies for enhancing communication in deaf & mute communities.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables.

This work analyzes the influence of hyperparameter adjustment on the accuracy and convergence behavior of seven efficient deep learning architectures: EfficientNetV2-S, ConvNeXt-T, MobileViT v2 (XXS/XS/S), MobileNetV3-L, TinyViT-21M, and RepVGG-A2. All models are trained on the ImageNet-1K dataset under consistent training settings, with an emphasis on real-time practicality. An comprehensive ablation study is undertaken to separate the effect of critical hyperparameters, including learning rate schedules, batch sizes, input resolution, data augmentation, regularization approaches, and optimizer choice. To assess appropriateness for real-time applications, each model is assessed not only in terms of Top-1 and Top-5 classification accuracy, but also in terms of inference time, parameter count, model size, and frames-per-second (FPS) on a GPU-accelerated edge deployment simulation. Results demonstrate that cosine learning rate decay and adjustable batch size may greatly boost both accuracy and convergence speed, while keeping low latency and memory cost. Notably, RepVGG-A2 achieves over 80% Top-1 accuracy with efficient inference performance, offering a compelling balance between accuracy and deployment cost for VGG-style models. The results give practical guidance for constructing resource-efficient deep learning models appropriate for real-time image processing pipelines.

We focus on nodding, which is critical in an attentive listening system, and propose a model that predicts both its timing and type in real time. The proposed model builds on the voice activity projection (VAP) model, which predicts voice activity from both listener and speaker audio. We extend it to prediction of various types of nodding in a continuous and real-time manner unlike conventional models. In addition, the proposed model incorporates multi-task learning with verbal backchannel prediction and pretraining on general dialogue data. In the timing and type prediction task, the effectiveness of multi-task learning was significantly demonstrated. We confirmed that reducing the processing rate enables real-time operation without a substantial drop in accuracy, and integrated the model into an avatar attentive listening system. Subjective evaluations showed that it outperformed the conventional method, which always does nodding in sync with verbal backchannel.

To overcome this, we introduce Meta-learning for Tailored Forecasting using Related Time Series (METAFORS), which generalizes knowledge across systems to enable forecasting in data-limited scenarios. By learning from a library of models trained on longer time series from potentially related systems, METAFORS builds and initializes a model tailored to short time-series data from the system of interest. Using a reservoir computing implementation and testing on simulated chaotic systems, we demonstrate that METAFORS can reliably predict both short-term dynamics and long-term statistics without requiring contextual labels. We see this even when test and related systems exhibit substantially different behaviors, highlighting METAFORS' strengths in data-limited scenarios.</p></details> | 23 pages, 12 figures |

However, this integration also exposes them to serious jailbreak risks, where malicious instructions can be transformed into dangerous physical actions. Existing defense mechanisms suffer from notable drawbacks--including high training costs, significant inference delays, and complex hyperparameter tuning--which limit their practical applicability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel and efficient inference-time defense framework: Concept Enhancement Engineering (CEE). CEE enhances the model's inherent safety mechanisms by directly manipulating its internal representations, requiring neither additional training nor external modules, thereby improving defense efficiency. Furthermore, CEE introduces a rotation-based control mechanism that enables stable and linearly tunable behavioral control of the model. This design eliminates the need for tedious manual tuning and avoids the output degradation issues commonly observed in other representation engineering methods. Extensive experiments across multiple EI safety benchmarks and diverse attack scenarios demonstrate that CEE significantly improves the defense success rates of various multimodal LLMs. It effectively mitigates safety risks while preserving high-quality generation and inference efficiency, offering a promising solution for deploying safer embodied intelligence systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Measuring and Modeling Geometric Structures in Time Series Forecasting via Image Modality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23253v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time Series forecasting is critical in diverse domains such as weather forecasting, financial investment, and traffic management. While traditional numerical metrics like mean squared error (MSE) can quantify point-wise accuracy, they fail to evaluate the geometric structure of time series data, which is essential to understand temporal dynamics. To address this issue, we propose the time series Geometric Structure Index (TGSI), a novel evaluation metric that transforms time series into images to leverage their inherent two-dimensional geometric representations. However, since the image transformation process is non-differentiable, TGSI cannot be directly integrated as a training loss. We further introduce the Shape-Aware Temporal Loss (SATL), a multi-component loss function operating in the time series modality to bridge this gap and enhance structure modeling during training. SATL combines three components: a first-order difference loss that measures structural consistency through the MSE between first-order differences, a frequency domain loss that captures essential periodic patterns using the Fast Fourier Transform while minimizing noise, and a perceptual feature loss that measures geometric structure difference in time-series by aligning temporal features with geometric structure features through a pre-trained temporal feature extractor and time-series image autoencoder. Experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that models trained with SATL achieve superior performance in both MSE and the proposed TGSI metrics compared to baseline methods, without additional computational cost during inference.</p></details> |  |

While deep learning-based detection methods are now widely adopted, they still face two core challenges: first, the inadequate multi-scale feature extraction capabilities of existing networks for diverse targets like cracks and potholes, leading to high miss rates for small-scale damage; and second, the substantial parameter counts and computational demands of mainstream models, which hinder their deployment for efficient, real-time detection in practical applications. To address these issues, this paper proposes a high-precision and lightweight model, YOLO - Road Orthogonal Compact (YOLO-ROC). We designed a Bidirectional Multi-scale Spatial Pyramid Pooling Fast (BMS-SPPF) module to enhance multi-scale feature extraction and implemented a hierarchical channel compression strategy to reduce computational complexity. The BMS-SPPF module leverages a bidirectional spatial-channel attention mechanism to improve the detection of small targets. Concurrently, the channel compression strategy reduces the parameter count from 3.01M to 0.89M and GFLOPs from 8.1 to 2.6. Experiments on the RDD2022_China_Drone dataset demonstrate that YOLO-ROC achieves a mAP50 of 67.6%, surpassing the baseline YOLOv8n by 2.11%. Notably, the mAP50 for the small-target D40 category improved by 16.8%, and the final model size is only 2.0 MB. Furthermore, the model exhibits excellent generalization performance on the RDD2022_China_Motorbike dataset.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods for temporal expression either conflate time with text-based numerical values, add a series of dedicated temporal tokens, or regress time using specialized temporal grounding heads. To address these issues, we introduce DisTime, a lightweight framework designed to enhance temporal comprehension in Video-LLMs. DisTime employs a learnable token to create a continuous temporal embedding space and incorporates a Distribution-based Time Decoder that generates temporal probability distributions, effectively mitigating boundary ambiguities and maintaining temporal continuity. Additionally, the Distribution-based Time Encoder re-encodes timestamps to provide time markers for Video-LLMs. To overcome temporal granularity limitations in existing datasets, we propose an automated annotation paradigm that combines the captioning capabilities of Video-LLMs with the localization expertise of dedicated temporal models. This leads to the creation of InternVid-TG, a substantial dataset with 1.25M temporally grounded events across 179k videos, surpassing ActivityNet-Caption by 55 times. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DisTime achieves state-of-the-art performance across benchmarks in three time-sensitive tasks while maintaining competitive performance in Video QA tasks.

This is true not only for model-based controllers, but also for model-free, real-time control methods such as extremum seeking control (ESC). In this paper, we propose a unicycle-based ESC design applicable to differential wheeled robots that: (1) is very simple design, based on one simple control-affine law, and without state integrators; (2) attenuates oscillations known to persist in ESC designs (i.e., fully stop at the source); and (3) operates in a model-free, real-time setting, tolerating environmental/sensor noise. We provide simulation and real-world robotic experimental results for fixed and moving light source seeking by a differential wheeled robot using our proposed design. Results indicate clear advantages of our proposed design when compared to the literature, including attenuation of undesired oscillations, improved convergence speed, and better handling of noise.</p></details> |  |

This is particularly problematic at cell edges, where overlapping regions force User Equipments (UEs) to increase transmit power, and in directional millimeter wave systems, where beamforming sidelobes can create unexpected interference. The resulting signal degradation disrupts protocol operations, including scheduling and resource allocation, by distorting quality indicators like Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP) and Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), and can compromise critical functions such as channel state reporting and Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request (HARQ) acknowledgments. To address this problem, this article introduces InterfO-RAN, a real-time programmable solution that leverages a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to process In-phase and Quadrature (I/Q) samples in the gNB physical layer, detecting in-band interference with accuracy exceeding 91% in under 650 us. InterfO-RAN represents the first O-RAN dApp accelerated on Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), coexisting with the 5G NR physical layer processing of NVIDIA Aerial.

However, they have been found extremely computationally expensive. One of the reasons is the small time step requirement to resolve the complex microstructure evolution during the rapid solidification process. This paper investigates the possibility of using a class of stabilized time integration algorithms to accelerate such phase field simulations by increasing the time steps. The specific time integration formulation and theoretical analysis on energy stability were developed, based on a phase field model dedicated to simulating rapid solidification in additive manufacturing. The numerical results confirmed that the proposed method can ensure the numerical stability and a decreasing energy requirement for the phase field simulations with at least two orders-of-magnitude larger time steps over conventional explicit methods. 2D and 3D phase field simulations have been conducted with relevant physical and kinetic parameters for 316L stainless steels. This work provides a numerical framework for efficient phase field simulations and open numerous opportunities for large scale phase field modeling.</p></details> |  |

A key innovation of our approach is the transformation of the original equation into a fractional partial-integro differential form that contains only a first-order derivative, which can be accurately approximated using a first-order shifted Gegenbauer differentiation matrix (SGDM), while all other terms in the transformed equation are resolved using highly accurate quadrature rules. The method combines several advanced numerical techniques including the shifted Gegenbauer pseudospectral (SGPS) method, Gegenbauer-based fractional approximation (GBFA), shifted Gegenbauer integration matrix (SGIM), shifted Gegenbauer integration row vector (SGIRV), and SGDM to achieve spectral accuracy. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the HSG-IPS method outperforms existing numerical approaches, achieving significantly lower average absolute errors (AAEs) with computational times as low as 0.04-0.05 seconds. The method's robustness is validated across various fractional orders, showing excellent agreement with analytical solutions. The transformation strategy effectively circumvents the numerical instability associated with direct approximation of high-order derivatives in the original equation, while the use of shifted Gegenbauer (SG) polynomials and barycentric representations ensures numerical stability and efficiency. This work provides a powerful computational framework for modeling wave propagation, dispersion, and nonlinearity in fractional calculus applications.</p></details> |  |

We present XYZ-Drive, a single vision-language model that reads a front-camera frame, a 25m $\times$ 25m overhead map, and the next waypoint, then outputs steering and speed. A lightweight goal-centered cross-attention layer lets waypoint tokens highlight relevant image and map patches, supporting both action and textual explanations, before the fused tokens enter a partially fine-tuned LLaMA-3.2 11B model. On the MD-NEX Outdoor-Driving benchmark XYZ-Drive attains 95% success and 0.80 Success weighted by Path Length (SPL), surpassing PhysNav-DG by 15%. and halving collisions, all while significantly improving efficiency by using only a single branch. Sixteen ablations explain the gains. Removing any modality (vision, waypoint, map) drops success by up to 11%, confirming their complementary roles and rich connections. Replacing goal-centered attention with simple concatenation cuts 3% in performance, showing query-based fusion injects map knowledge more effectively. Keeping the transformer frozen loses 5%, showing the importance of fine-tuning when applying VLMs for specific tasks such as autonomous driving. Coarsening map resolution from 10 cm to 40 cm blurs lane edges and raises crash rate. Overall, these results demonstrate that early, token-level fusion of intent and map layout enables accurate, transparent, real-time driving.</p></details> | 5 pages |

Motivated by a pediatric mental health care (PMHC) program, we are particularly concerned with how the event occurrence depends on the occurrences in the past. We consider a stratified Cox regression model with time-varying coefficients and propose a procedure for estimating the model parameters using the zero-truncated data integrated with population census information. We evaluate the finite-sample performance of the proposed estimator through simulation and establish its asymptotic properties. Data from the PMHC program are used throughout the paper to motivate and to illustrate the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Early Goal-Guided Multi-Scale Fusion for Real-Time Vision-Language Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23042v1)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous vehicles must react in milliseconds while reasoning about road geometry and traffic intent to navigate complex situations. We introduce NovaDrive, a single-branch vision-language architecture that processes front-camera images, HD-map tiles, LiDAR depth, and textual waypoints in a single branch. A lightweight, two-stage cross-attention block first aligns waypoint tokens with the HD map, then refines attention over fine-grained image and depth patches. Coupled with a novel smoothness loss that discourages abrupt steering and speed changes, this design eliminates the need for recurrent memory. We fine-tune the top 15 layers of an 11B LLaMA-3.2 vision-language backbone, enabling real-time inference. On the nuScenes / Waymo subset of the MD-NEX Outdoor benchmark, NovaDrive raises success rate to 84% (+4%), boosts path-efficiency (SPL) to 0.66 (+0.11), and reduces collision frequency from 2.6% to 1.2% (-1.4%) relative to the previous state-of-the-art. Our ablations confirm that waypoint tokens, partial VLM fine-tuning, and the cross-attention fusion each contribute the most to these gains. Beyond safety, NovaDrive's shorter routes (resulting from the novel smoothness loss) translate to lower fuel or battery usage, pointing toward leaner, more easily updated driving stacks. NovaDrive can be extended to other embodied-AI domains as well.</p></details> | 6 pages |
| **[Linking Actor Behavior to Process Performance Over Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23037v1)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding how actor behavior influences process outcomes is a critical aspect of process mining. Traditional approaches often use aggregate and static process data, overlooking the temporal and causal dynamics that arise from individual actor behavior. This limits the ability to accurately capture the complexity of real-world processes, where individual actor behavior and interactions between actors significantly shape performance. In this work, we address this gap by integrating actor behavior analysis with Granger causality to identify correlating links in time series data. We apply this approach to realworld event logs, constructing time series for actor interactions, i.e. continuation, interruption, and handovers, and process outcomes. Using Group Lasso for lag selection, we identify a small but consistently influential set of lags that capture the majority of causal influence, revealing that actor behavior has direct and measurable impacts on process performance, particularly throughput time. These findings demonstrate the potential of actor-centric, time series-based methods for uncovering the temporal dependencies that drive process outcomes, offering a more nuanced understanding of how individual behaviors impact overall process efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at the 5th Workshop on Change, Drift, and Dynamics of Organizational Processes (ProDy), BPM 2025</p></details> |
| **[Adaptive Time-step Training for Enhancing Spike-Based Neural Radiance Fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23033v1)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)-based models have achieved remarkable success in 3D reconstruction and rendering tasks. However, during both training and inference, these models rely heavily on dense point sampling along rays from multiple viewpoints, resulting in a surge in floating-point operations and severely limiting their use in resource-constrained scenarios like edge computing. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), which communicate via binary spikes over discrete time steps, offer a promising alternative due to their energy-efficient nature. Given the inherent variability in scene scale and texture complexity in neural rendering and the prevailing practice of training separate models per scene, we propose a spike-based NeRF framework with a dynamic time step training strategy, termed Pretrain-Adaptive Time-step Adjustment (PATA). This approach automatically explores the trade-off between rendering quality and time step length during training. Consequently, it enables scene-adaptive inference with variable time steps and reduces the additional consumption of computational resources in the inference process. Anchoring to the established Instant-NGP architecture, we evaluate our method across diverse datasets. The experimental results show that PATA can preserve rendering fidelity while reducing inference time steps by 64\% and running power by 61.55\%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Classical Processing of Constant-Depth Time Evolution Circuits in Control Hardware](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12765v2)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Improving quantum algorithms run-time performance involves several strategies such as reducing the quantum gate counts, decreasing the number of measurements, advancement in QPU technology for faster gate operations, or optimizing the classical processing. This work focuses on the latter, specifically reducing classical processing and compilation time via hardware-assisted parameterized circuit execution (PCE) for computing dynamical properties of quantum systems. PCE was previously validated for QCVV protocols, which leverages structural circuit equivalencies. We demonstrate the applicability of this approach to computing dynamical properties of quantum many-body systems using structurally equivalent time evolution circuits, specifically calculating correlation functions of spin models using constant-depth circuits generated via Cartan decomposition. Implementing this for spin-spin correlation functions in Transverse field XY (up to 6-sites) and Heisenberg spin models (up to 3-sites), we observed a run-time reduction of up to 50\% compared to standard compilation methods. This highlights the adaptability of time-evolution circuit with hardware-assisted PCE to potentially mitigate the classical bottlenecks in near-term quantum algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lightweight Online Adaption for Time Series Foundation Model Forecasts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12920v3)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models (FMs) have emerged as a promising approach for time series forecasting. While effective, FMs typically remain fixed during deployment due to the high computational costs of learning them online. Consequently, deployed FMs fail to adapt their forecasts to current data characteristics, despite the availability of online feedback from newly arriving data. This raises the question of whether FM performance can be enhanced by the efficient usage of this feedback. We propose ELF to answer this question. ELF is a lightweight mechanism for the online adaption of FM forecasts in response to online feedback. ELF consists of two parts: a) the ELF-Forecaster which is used to learn the current data distribution; and b) the ELF-Weighter which is used to combine the forecasts of the FM and the ELF-Forecaster. We evaluate the performance of ELF in conjunction with several recent FMs across a suite of standard time series datasets. In all of our experiments we find that using ELF improves performance. This work demonstrates how efficient usage of online feedback can be used to improve FM forecasts.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, Published at ICML 2025</p></details> |

| **[Gaussian On-the-Fly Splatting: A Progressive Framework for Robust Near Real-Time 3DGS Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13086v2)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) achieves high-fidelity rendering with fast real-time performance, but existing methods rely on offline training after full Structure-from-Motion (SfM) processing. In contrast, this work introduces Gaussian on-the-fly Splatting (abbreviated as On-the-Fly GS), a progressive framework enabling near real-time 3DGS optimization during image capture. As each image arrives, its pose and sparse points are updated via On-the-Fly SfM, and newly optimized Gaussians are immediately integrated into the 3DGS field. To achieve this, we propose a progressive Local & Semi-Global optimization to prioritize the new image and its neighbors by their corresponding overlapping relationship, allowing the new image and its overlapping images to get more training. To further stabilize training across previous and new images, an adaptive learning rate schedule balances the iterations and the learning rate. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that our On-the-Fly GS reduces training time significantly, optimizing each new image in seconds with minimal rendering loss, offering one of the first practical steps toward rapid, progressive 3DGS reconstruction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Malleability-Resistant Encrypted Control System with Disturbance Compensation and Real-Time Attack Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22693v1)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study proposes an encrypted PID control system with a disturbance observer (DOB) using a keyed-homomorphic encryption (KHE) scheme, aiming to achieve control performance while providing resistance to malleability-based attacks. The controller integrates a DOB with a PID structure to compensate for modeling uncertainties by estimating and canceling external disturbances. To enhance security, the system is designed to output error symbols when ciphertexts are falsified during decryption or evaluation, enabling real-time detection of malleability-based signal or parameter falsification. To validate the proposed method, we conduct stage positioning control experiments and attack detection tests using an industrial linear stage. The results show that the encrypted DOB-based PID controller outperforms a conventional encrypted PID controller in terms of tracking accuracy. Furthermore, the system successfully detects two types of malleability-based attacks: one that destabilizes the control system, and another that degrades its performance. The primary contributions of this study are: (i) the implementation of a KHE-based encrypted DOB-PID controller, (ii) the improvement of control performance under uncertainties, and (iii) the experimental demonstration of attack detection capabilities in encrypted control systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Local Mixtures of Experts: Essentially Free Test-Time Training via Model Merging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14136v2)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mixture of expert (MoE) models are a promising approach to increasing model capacity without increasing inference cost, and are core components of many state-of-the-art language models. However, current MoE models typically use only few experts due to prohibitive training and inference cost. We propose Test-Time Model Merging (TTMM) which scales the MoE paradigm to an order of magnitude more experts and uses model merging to avoid almost any test-time overhead. We show that TTMM is an approximation of test-time training (TTT), which fine-tunes an expert model for each prediction task, i.e., prompt. TTT has recently been shown to significantly improve language models, but is computationally expensive. We find that performance of TTMM improves with more experts and approaches the performance of TTT. Moreover, we find that with a 1B parameter base model, TTMM is more than 100x faster than TTT at test-time by amortizing the cost of TTT at train-time. Thus, TTMM offers a promising cost-effective approach to scale test-time training.</p></details> |  |

In response to the 2025 VIP Cup challenge tasks - drone detection, tracking, and payload identification - we propose a dual-stream drone monitoring framework. Our approach deploys independent You Only Look Once v11-nano (YOLOv11n) object detectors on parallel infrared (thermal) and visible (RGB) data streams, deliberately avoiding early fusion. This separation allows each model to be specifically optimized for the distinct characteristics of its input modality, addressing the unique challenges posed by small aerial objects in diverse environmental conditions. We customize data preprocessing and augmentation strategies per domain - such as limiting color jitter for IR imagery - and fine-tune training hyperparameters to enhance detection performance under conditions of heavy noise, low light, and motion blur. The resulting lightweight YOLOv11n models demonstrate high accuracy in distinguishing drones from birds and in classifying payload types, all while maintaining real-time performance. This report details the rationale for a dual-modality design, the specialized training pipelines, and the architectural optimizations that collectively enable efficient and accurate drone surveillance across RGB and IR channels.</p></details> |  |

We consider one of the standard models of dynamic networks in which each edge has a discrete timestamp and transition time. Recently there has been a massive interest in analyzing such temporal graphs. Common computational data mining and analysis tasks include the computation of temporal distances, centrality measures, and network statistics like topological overlap, burstiness, or temporal diameter. To fulfill the increasing demand for efficient and easy-to-use implementations of temporal graph algorithms, we introduce the open-source library TGLib, which integrates efficient data structures and algorithms for temporal graph analysis.

This connection implies that $\mathcal{TEL}^\bigcirc$ does not possess the property of ultimate periodicity of models, and further leads to undecidability of query answering in $\mathcal{TEL}^\bigcirc$, closing a question left open since the introduction of $\mathcal{TEL}^\bigcirc$.

| **[LesiOnTime -- Joint Temporal and Clinical Modeling for Small Breast Lesion Segmentation in Longitudinal DCE-MRI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00496v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate segmentation of small lesions in Breast Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) is critical for early cancer detection, especially in high-risk patients. While recent deep learning methods have advanced lesion segmentation, they primarily target large lesions and neglect valuable longitudinal and clinical information routinely used by radiologists. In real-world screening, detecting subtle or emerging lesions requires radiologists to compare across timepoints and consider previous radiology assessments, such as the BI-RADS score. We propose LesiOnTime, a novel 3D segmentation approach that mimics clinical diagnostic workflows by jointly leveraging longitudinal imaging and BIRADS scores. The key components are: (1) a Temporal Prior Attention (TPA) block that dynamically integrates information from previous and current scans; and (2) a BI-RADS Consistency Regularization (BCR) loss that enforces latent space alignment for scans with similar radiological assessments, thus embedding domain knowledge into the training process. Evaluated on a curated in-house longitudinal dataset of high-risk patients with DCE-MRI, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art single-timepoint and longitudinal baselines by 5% in terms of Dice. Ablation studies demonstrate that both TPA and BCR contribute complementary performance gains. These results highlight the importance of incorporating temporal and clinical context for reliable early lesion segmentation in real-world breast cancer screening.

Although previous methods leverage Euclidean representations in RGB or depth domains, such embeddings are inherently limited in capturing hierarchical event structures and spatio-temporal continuity. To address these limitations, we propose HyPCV-Former, a novel hyperbolic spatio-temporal transformer for anomaly detection in 3D point cloud videos. Our approach first extracts per-frame spatial features from point cloud sequences via point cloud extractor, and then embeds them into Lorentzian hyperbolic space, which better captures the latent hierarchical structure of events. To model temporal dynamics, we introduce a hyperbolic multi-head self-attention (HMHA) mechanism that leverages Lorentzian inner products and curvature-aware softmax to learn temporal dependencies under non-Euclidean geometry. Our method performs all feature transformations and anomaly scoring directly within full Lorentzian space rather than via tangent space approximation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HyPCV-Former achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple anomaly categories, with a 7\% improvement on the TIMo dataset and a 5.6\% gain on the DAD dataset compared to benchmarks. The code will be released upon paper acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semantic and Temporal Integration in Latent Diffusion Space for High-Fidelity Video Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00471v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in video super-resolution (VSR) models have demonstrated impressive results in enhancing low-resolution videos. However, due to limitations in adequately controlling the generation process, achieving high fidelity alignment with the low-resolution input while maintaining temporal consistency across frames remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose Semantic and Temporal Guided Video Super-Resolution (SeTe-VSR), a novel approach that incorporates both semantic and temporal-spatio guidance in the latent diffusion space to address these challenges. By incorporating high-level semantic information and integrating spatial and temporal information, our approach achieves a seamless balance between recovering intricate details and ensuring temporal coherence. Our method not only preserves high-reality visual content but also significantly enhances fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SeTe-VSR outperforms existing methods in terms of detail recovery and perceptual quality, highlighting its effectiveness for complex video super-resolution tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Video Forgery Detection with Optical Flow Residuals and Spatial-Temporal Consistency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00397v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of diffusion-based video generation models has led to increasingly realistic synthetic content, presenting new challenges for video forgery detection. Existing methods often struggle to capture fine-grained temporal inconsistencies, particularly in AI-generated videos with high visual fidelity and coherent motion. In this work, we propose a detection framework that leverages spatial-temporal consistency by combining RGB appearance features with optical flow residuals. The model adopts a dual-branch architecture, where one branch analyzes RGB frames to detect appearance-level artifacts, while the other processes flow residuals to reveal subtle motion anomalies caused by imperfect temporal synthesis. By integrating these complementary features, the proposed method effectively detects a wide range of forged videos. Extensive experiments on text-to-video and image-to-video tasks across ten diverse generative models demonstrate the robustness and strong generalization ability of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[STF: Shallow-Level Temporal Feedback to Enhance Spiking Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00387v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) suffer from a great performance gap compared to floating-point Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) due to the binary nature of spike trains. Recent efforts have introduced deep-level feedback loops to transmit high-level semantic information to narrow this gap. However, these designs often span multiple deep layers, resulting in costly feature transformations, higher parameter overhead, increased energy consumption, and longer inference latency. To address this issue, we propose Shallow-level Temporal Feedback (STF), a lightweight plug-and-play module for the encoding layer, which consists of Temporal-Spatial Position Embedding (TSPE) and Temporal Feedback (TF).Extensive experiments show that STF consistently improves performance across various Transformer-based SNN backbones on static datasets, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-1K, under different spike timestep settings. Further analysis reveals that STF enhances the diversity of the spike patterns, which is key to performance gain. Moreover, evaluations on adversarial robustness and temporal sensitivity confirm that STF outperforms direct coding and its variants, highlighting its potential as a new spike encoding scheme for static scenarios. Our code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> | 32 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Spatial-Temporal-Spectral Unified Modeling for Remote Sensing Dense Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12280v3)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of multi-source remote sensing data has propelled the development of deep learning for dense prediction, yet significant challenges in data and task unification persist. Current deep learning architectures for remote sensing are fundamentally rigid. They are engineered for fixed input-output configurations, restricting their adaptability to the heterogeneous spatial, temporal, and spectral dimensions inherent in real-world data. Furthermore, these models neglect the intrinsic correlations among semantic segmentation, binary change detection, and semantic change detection, necessitating the development of distinct models or task-specific decoders. This paradigm is also constrained to a predefined set of output semantic classes, where any change to the classes requires costly retraining. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Spatial-Temporal-Spectral Unified Network (STSUN) for unified modeling. STSUN can adapt to input and output data with arbitrary spatial sizes, temporal lengths, and spectral bands by leveraging their metadata for a unified representation. Moreover, STSUN unifies disparate dense prediction tasks within a single architecture by conditioning the model on trainable task embeddings. Similarly, STSUN facilitates flexible prediction across multiple set of semantic categories by integrating trainable category embeddings as metadata. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets with diverse Spatial-Temporal-Spectral configurations in multiple scenarios demonstrate that a single STSUN model effectively adapts to heterogeneous inputs and outputs, unifying various dense prediction tasks and diverse semantic class predictions. The proposed approach consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting its robustness and generalizability for complex remote sensing applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 6 figures, Code link:https://github.com/walking-shadow/Official_TSSUN</p></details> |
| **[Federated Time Series Generation on Feature and Temporally Misaligned Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21072v2)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distributed time series data presents a challenge for federated learning, as clients often possess different feature sets and have misaligned time steps. Existing federated time series models are limited by the assumption of perfect temporal or feature alignment across clients. In this paper, we propose FedTDD, a novel federated time series diffusion model that jointly learns a synthesizer across clients. At the core of FedTDD is a novel data distillation and aggregation framework that reconciles the differences between clients by imputing the misaligned timesteps and features. In contrast to traditional federated learning, FedTDD learns the correlation across clients' time series through the exchange of local synthetic outputs instead of model parameters. A coordinator iteratively improves a global distiller network by leveraging shared knowledge from clients through the exchange of synthetic data. As the distiller becomes more refined over time, it subsequently enhances the quality of the clients' local feature estimates, allowing each client to then improve its local imputations for missing data using the latest, more accurate distiller. Experimental results on five datasets demonstrate FedTDD's effectiveness compared to centralized training, and the effectiveness of sharing synthetic outputs to transfer knowledge of local time series. Notably, FedTDD achieves 79.4% and 62.8% improvement over local training in Context-FID and Correlational scores.</p></details> |  |
| **[Identifying Unique Spatial-Temporal Bayesian Network without Markov Equivalence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10085v4)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying vanilla Bayesian network to model spatial-temporal causality can be a critical yet challenging task. Different Markovian-equivalent directed acyclic graphs would be identified if the identifiability is not satisfied. To address this issue, Directed Cyclic Graph is proposed to drop the directed acyclic constraint. But it does not always hold, and cannot model dynamical time-series process. Then, Full Time Graph is proposed with introducing high-order time delay. Full Time Graph has no Markov equivalence class by assuming no instantaneous effects. But, it also assumes that the causality is invariant with varying time, that is not always satisfied in the spatio-temporal scenarios. Thus, in this work, a Spatial-Temporal Bayesian Network (STBN) is proposed to theoretically model the spatial-temporal causality from the perspective of information transfer. STBN explains the disappearance of network structure $X\rightarrow Z \rightarrow Y$ and $X\leftarrow Z \leftarrow Y$ by the principle of information path blocking. And finally, the uniqueness of STBN is proved. Based on this, a High-order Causal Entropy (HCE) algorithm is also proposed to uniquely identify STBN under time complexity $\mathcal{O}(n^3\tau_{max})$, where $n$ is the number of variables and $\tau_{max}$ is the maximum time delay. Numerical experiments are conducted with comparison to other baseline algorithms. The results show that HCE algorithm obtains state-of-the-art identification accuracy.

| **[Risk-Aware Autonomous Driving with Linear Temporal Logic Specifications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09769v3)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human drivers naturally balance the risks of different concerns while driving, including traffic rule violations, minor accidents, and fatalities. However, achieving the same behavior in autonomous driving systems remains an open problem. This paper extends a risk metric that has been verified in human-like driving studies to encompass more complex driving scenarios specified by linear temporal logic (LTL) that go beyond just collision risks. This extension incorporates the timing and severity of events into LTL specifications, thereby reflecting a human-like risk awareness. Without sacrificing expressivity for traffic rules, we adopt LTL specifications composed of safety and co-safety formulas, allowing the control synthesis problem to be reformulated as a reachability problem. By leveraging occupation measures, we further formulate a linear programming (LP) problem for this LTL-based risk metric. Consequently, the synthesized policy balances different types of driving risks, including both collision risks and traffic rule violations. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated by three typical traffic scenarios in Carla simulator.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial-Temporal Reinforcement Learning for Network Routing with Non-Markovian Traffic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22174v2)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been widely used for packet routing in communication networks, but traditional RL methods rely on the Markov assumption that the current state contains all necessary information for decision-making. In reality, internet traffic is non-Markovian, and past states do influence routing performance. Moreover, common deep RL approaches use function approximators, such as neural networks, that do not model the spatial structure in network topologies. To address these shortcomings, we design a network environment with non-Markovian traffic and introduce a spatial-temporal RL (STRL) framework for packet routing. Our approach outperforms traditional baselines by more than 19% during training and 7% for inference despite a change in network topology.</p></details> |  |

A valuable approach to studying them requires accurate spatio-temporal information on land surface conditions. One of the most important variables for assessing and understanding these phenomena is Land Surface Temperature (LST), which is derived from satellites and provides essential information about the thermal state of the Earth's surface. However, satellite platforms inherently face a trade-off between spatial and temporal resolutions. To bridge this gap, we propose FuseTen, a novel generative framework that produces daily LST observations at a fine 10 m spatial resolution by fusing spatio-temporal observations derived from Sentinel-2, Landsat 8, and Terra MODIS. FuseTen employs a generative architecture trained using an averaging-based supervision strategy grounded in physical principles. It incorporates attention and normalization modules within the fusion process and uses a PatchGAN discriminator to enforce realism. Experiments across multiple dates show that FuseTen outperforms linear baselines, with an average 32.06% improvement in quantitative metrics and 31.42% in visual fidelity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first non-linear method to generate daily LST estimates at such fine spatial resolution.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in the 2025 International Conference on Machine Intelligence for GeoAnalytics and Remote Sensing (MIGARS)</p></details> |

But while the topic has received significant attention for static networks, the literature on community structure in temporally evolving networks is more scarce. In particular, there are currently no statistical methods available to test for the presence of community structure in a sequence of networks evolving over time. In this work, we propose a simple yet powerful test using e-values, an alternative to p-values that is more flexible in certain ways. Specifically, an e-value framework retains valid testing properties even after combining dependent information, a relevant feature in the context of testing temporal networks. We apply the proposed test to synthetic and real-world networks, demonstrating various features inherited from the e-value formulation and exposing some of the inherent difficulties of testing on temporal networks.</p></details> |  |

Various diffusion models have been proposed to capture the spread of information, yet selecting the most suitable model for a given scenario remains challenging. This article provides a structured guide to making the best choice among diffusion models for influence maximization on temporal networks. We categorize existing models based on their underlying mechanisms and assess their effectiveness in different network settings. We analyze seed selection strategies, highlighting how the inherent properties of influence spread enable the development of efficient algorithms that can find near-optimal sets of influential nodes. By comparing key advancements, challenges, and practical applications, we offer a comprehensive roadmap for researchers and practitioners to navigate the landscape of temporal influence maximization effectively.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches often struggle to balance accuracy and speed, particularly in resource-constrained environments. In this work, we present a unified framework that leverages advanced spatial-temporal modeling techniques for simultaneous action recognition and object tracking. Our approach builds upon recent advances in parallel sequence modeling and introduces a novel hierarchical attention mechanism that adaptively focuses on relevant spatial regions across temporal sequences. We demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks while maintaining real-time inference speeds. Extensive experiments on UCF-101, HMDB-51, and MOT17 datasets show improvements of 3.2% in action recognition accuracy and 2.8% in tracking precision compared to existing methods, with 40% faster inference time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Hazard Early Warning Systems for Agriculture with Featural-Temporal Explanations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22962v1)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Climate extremes present escalating risks to agriculture intensifying the need for reliable multi-hazard early warning systems (EWS). The situation is evolving due to climate change and hence such systems should have the intelligent to continue to learn from recent climate behaviours. However, traditional single-hazard forecasting methods fall short in capturing complex interactions among concurrent climatic events. To address this deficiency, in this paper, we combine sequential deep learning models and advanced Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques to introduce a multi-hazard forecasting framework for agriculture. In our experiments, we utilize meteorological data from four prominent agricultural regions in the United States (between 2010 and 2023) to validate the predictive accuracy of our framework on multiple severe event types, which are extreme cold, floods, frost, hail, heatwaves, and heavy rainfall, with tailored models for each area. The framework uniquely integrates attention mechanisms with TimeSHAP (a recurrent XAI explainer for time series) to provide comprehensive temporal explanations revealing not only which climatic features are influential but precisely when their impacts occur. Our results demonstrate strong predictive accuracy, particularly with the BiLSTM architecture, and highlight the system's capacity to inform nuanced, proactive risk management strategies. This research significantly advances the explainability and applicability of multi-hazard EWS, fostering interdisciplinary trust and effective decision-making process for climate risk management in the agricultural industry.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pre-p...</summary><p>Pre-print v0.8 2025-07-30</p></details> |

Apart from motion semantics preservation, ensuring geometric plausibility and maintaining temporal consistency are also crucial for effective motion retargeting. However, many existing methods prioritize either geometric plausibility or temporal consistency. Neglecting geometric plausibility results in interpenetration while neglecting temporal consistency leads to motion jitter. In this paper, we propose a novel sequence-to-sequence model for seamless Spatial-Temporal aware motion Retargeting (STaR), with penetration and consistency constraints. STaR consists of two modules: (1) a spatial module that incorporates dense shape representation and a novel limb penetration constraint to ensure geometric plausibility while preserving motion semantics, and (2) a temporal module that utilizes a temporal transformer and a novel temporal consistency constraint to predict the entire motion sequence at once while enforcing multi-level trajectory smoothness. The seamless combination of the two modules helps us achieve a good balance between the semantic, geometric, and temporal targets. Extensive experiments on the Mixamo and ScanRet datasets demonstrate that our method produces plausible and coherent motions while significantly reducing interpenetration rates compared with other approaches.

| **[Temporally Consistent Unsupervised Segmentation for Mobile Robot Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22194v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rapid progress in terrain-aware autonomous ground navigation has been driven by advances in supervised semantic segmentation. However, these methods rely on costly data collection and labor-intensive ground truth labeling to train deep models. Furthermore, autonomous systems are increasingly deployed in unrehearsed, unstructured environments where no labeled data exists and semantic categories may be ambiguous or domain-specific. Recent zero-shot approaches to unsupervised segmentation have shown promise in such settings but typically operate on individual frames, lacking temporal consistency-a critical property for robust perception in unstructured environments. To address this gap we introduce Frontier-Seg, a method for temporally consistent unsupervised segmentation of terrain from mobile robot video streams. Frontier-Seg clusters superpixel-level features extracted from foundation model backbones-specifically DINOv2-and enforces temporal consistency across frames to identify persistent terrain boundaries or frontiers without human supervision. We evaluate Frontier-Seg on a diverse set of benchmark datasets-including RUGD and RELLIS-3D-demonstrating its ability to perform unsupervised segmentation across unstructured off-road environments.</p></details> |  |

This allows asking questions about the dynamics of networks, like traffic movement, cause-effect relationships, or the spread of a disease. In this setting, a graph consists of triples annotated with validity intervals, and a query produces pairs of nodes where each pair is associated with a binary relation over time. For instance, such a pair could be two airports, and the temporal relation could map potential departure times to possible arrival times. An open question is how to represent such a relation in a compact form and maintain this property during query evaluation. We investigate four compact representations of answers to a such queries, which are based on alternative ways to encode sets of intervals. We discuss their respective advantages and drawbacks, in terms of conciseness, uniqueness, and computational cost. Notably, the most refined encoding guarantees that query answers over dense time can be finitely represented.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of a paper accepted at the ISWC 2025 conference</p></details> |

Many existing solutions rely on computationally demanding deep learning models, which result in high latency and are unsuitable for embedded robotic devices with limited resources (such as intelligent vehicles/cars) where rapid detection is necessary to prevent accidents. This paper introduces LiteFat, a lightweight spatio-temporal graph learning model designed to detect driver fatigue efficiently while maintaining high accuracy and low computational demands. LiteFat involves converting streaming video data into spatio-temporal graphs (STG) using facial landmark detection, which focuses on key motion patterns and reduces unnecessary data processing. LiteFat uses MobileNet to extract facial features and create a feature matrix for the STG. A lightweight spatio-temporal graph neural network is then employed to identify signs of fatigue with minimal processing and low latency. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that LiteFat performs competitively while significantly decreasing computational complexity and latency as compared to current state-of-the-art methods. This work enables the development of real-time, resource-efficient human fatigue detection systems that can be implemented upon embedded robotic devices.</p></details> | 6 pages, 1 figure |
| **[Multivariate Spatio-temporal Modelling for Completing Cancer Registries and Forecasting Incidence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21714v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cancer data, particularly cancer incidence and mortality, are fundamental to understand the cancer burden, to set targets for cancer control and to evaluate the evolution of the implementation of a cancer control policy. However, the complexity of data collection, classification, validation and processing result in cancer incidence figures often lagging two to three years behind the calendar year. In response, national or regional population-based cancer registries (PBCRs) are increasingly interested in methods for forecasting cancer incidence. However, in many countries there is an additional difficulty in projecting cancer incidence as regional registries are usually not established in the same year and therefore cancer incidence data series between different regions of a country are not harmonised over time. This study addresses the challenge of forecasting cancer incidence with incomplete data at both regional and national levels. To achieve our objective, we propose the use of multivariate spatio-temporal shared component models that jointly model mortality data and available cancer incidence data. The performance of these multivariate models are analyzed using lung cancer incidence data, together with the number of deaths reported in England in the period 2001-2019. Different model predictive measures have been calculated to select the best model.</p></details> | 36 pages |

However, these box annotations require tremendous human effort, limiting the scale and diversity of existing tracking datasets. In this work, we present a novel Self-Supervised Tracking framework named \textbf{{\tracker}}, designed to eliminate the need of box annotations. Specifically, a decoupled spatio-temporal consistency training framework is proposed to learn rich target information across timestamps through global spatial localization and local temporal association. This allows for the simulation of appearance and motion variations of instances in real-world scenarios. Furthermore, an instance contrastive loss is designed to learn instance-level correspondences from a multi-view perspective, offering robust instance supervision without additional labels. This new design paradigm enables {\tracker} to effectively learn generic tracking representations in a self-supervised manner, while reducing reliance on extensive box annotations. Extensive experiments on nine benchmark datasets demonstrate that {\tracker} surpasses \textit{SOTA} self-supervised tracking methods, achieving an improvement of more than 25.3\%, 20.4\%, and 14.8\% in AUC (AO) score on the GOT10K, LaSOT, TrackingNet datasets, respectively.

A relevant problem in CPS design is how to efficiently and automatically check whether a set of STL requirements is logically consistent. This problem reduces to solving the STL satisfiability problem, which is decidable when we assume that our system operates in discrete time steps dictated by an embedded system's clock. This paper introduces a novel tree-shaped, one-pass tableau method for satisfiability checking of discrete-time STL with bounded temporal operators. Originally designed to prove the consistency of a given set of STL requirements, this method has a wide range of applications beyond consistency checking. These include synthesizing example signals that satisfy the given requirements, as well as verifying or refuting the equivalence and implications of STL formulas. Our tableau exploits redundancy arising from large time intervals in STL formulas to speed up satisfiability checking, and can also be employed to check Mission-Time Linear Temporal Logic (MLTL) satisfiability. We compare our tableau with Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) and First-Order Logic encodings from the literature on a benchmark suite, partly collected from the literature, and partly provided by an industrial partner. Our experiments show that, in many cases, our tableau outperforms state-of-the-art encodings.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 8 figures.

In this paper, we propose a novel stagewise trading framework to achieve efficient and stable task-worker matching, explicitly accounting for task diversity (e.g., spatio-temporal limitations) and network dynamics inherent in MCS environments. This framework integrates both futures and spot trading stages. In the former, we introduce the \textbf{f}utures \textbf{t}rading-driven \textbf{s}table \textbf{m}atching and \textbf{p}re-\textbf{p}ath-\textbf{p}lanning mechanism (FT-SMP$^3$), which enables long-term task-worker assignment and pre-planning of workers' trajectories based on historical statistics and risk-aware analysis. In the latter, we develop the \textbf{s}pot \textbf{t}rading-driven \textbf{D}QN-based \textbf{p}ath \textbf{p}lanning and onsite \textbf{w}orker \textbf{r}ecruitment mechanism (ST-DP$^2$WR), which dynamically improves the practical utilities of tasks and workers by supporting real-time recruitment and path adjustment. We rigorously prove that the proposed mechanisms satisfy key economic and algorithmic properties, including stability, individual rationality, competitive equilibrium, and weak Pareto optimality. Extensive experiements further validate the effectiveness of our framework in realistic network settings, demonstrating superior performance in terms of service quality, computational efficiency, and decision-making overhead.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Angular-Temporal Interaction Network for Light Field Object Tracking in Low-Light Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21460v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-quality 4D light field representation with efficient angular feature modeling is crucial for scene perception, as it can provide discriminative spatial-angular cues to identify moving targets. However, recent developments still struggle to deliver reliable angular modeling in the temporal domain, particularly in complex low-light scenes. In this paper, we propose a novel light field epipolar-plane structure image (ESI) representation that explicitly defines the geometric structure within the light field. By capitalizing on the abrupt changes in the angles of light rays within the epipolar plane, this representation can enhance visual expression in low-light scenes and reduce redundancy in high-dimensional light fields. We further propose an angular-temporal interaction network (ATINet) for light field object tracking that learns angular-aware representations from the geometric structural cues and angular-temporal interaction cues of light fields. Furthermore, ATINet can also be optimized in a self-supervised manner to enhance the geometric feature interaction across the temporal domain. Finally, we introduce a large-scale light field low-light dataset for object tracking. Extensive experimentation demonstrates that ATINet achieves state-of-the-art performance in single object tracking. Furthermore, we extend the proposed method to multiple object tracking, which also shows the effectiveness of high-quality light field angular-temporal modeling.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods inadequately utilize temporal information, relying mainly on local temporal interactions between adjacent frames and failing to leverage global sequence information effectively. To address this limitation, we investigate how to effectively aggregate global temporal features from temporal sequences, aiming to achieve occupancy representations that efficiently utilize global temporal information from historical observations. For this purpose, we propose a global temporal aggregation denoising network named GTAD, introducing a global temporal information aggregation framework as a new paradigm for holistic 3D scene understanding. Our method employs an in-model latent denoising network to aggregate local temporal features from the current moment and global temporal features from historical sequences. This approach enables the effective perception of both fine-grained temporal information from adjacent frames and global temporal patterns from historical observations. As a result, it provides a more coherent and comprehensive understanding of the environment. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Occ3D-nuScenes benchmark and ablation studies demonstrate the superiority of our method.</p></details> |  |

While existing object-centric approaches either lack generative capabilities entirely or treat video sequences holistically, thus neglecting explicit object-level structure, our approach explicitly captures temporal dynamics by learning pose invariant object-centric slots and conditioning them on pretrained diffusion models. This design enables high-quality, pixel-level video synthesis with superior temporal coherence, and offers intuitive compositional editing capabilities such as object insertion, deletion, or replacement, maintaining consistent object identities across frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method sets new benchmarks in video generation quality and temporal consistency, outperforming previous object-centric generative methods. Although our segmentation performance closely matches state-of-the-art methods, our approach uniquely integrates this capability with robust generative performance, significantly advancing interactive and controllable video generation and opening new possibilities for advanced content creation, semantic editing, and dynamic scene understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>12+21...</summary><p>12+21 pages, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (TPAMI), currently under review</p></details> |

Lastly, a method interpreting the optimized graph structure is introduced. Experiments on the Building Data Genome Project 2 dataset confirm superior performance over baselines such as XGBoost, SVR, FCNN, GRU, and Naive, highlighting the method's robustness, generalization, and interpretability in capturing meaningful building similarities and spatial relationships.</p></details> |  |

A Contrastive Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00612v2)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal Heterogeneous Networks play a crucial role in capturing the dynamics and heterogeneity inherent in various real-world complex systems, rendering them a noteworthy research avenue for link prediction. However, existing methods fail to capture the fine-grained differential distribution patterns and temporal dynamic characteristics, which we refer to as spatial heterogeneity and temporal heterogeneity. To overcome such limitations, we propose a novel \textbf{C}ontrastive Learning-based \textbf{L}ink \textbf{P}rediction model, \textbf{CLP}, which employs a multi-view hierarchical self-supervised architecture to encode spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Specifically, aiming at spatial heterogeneity, we develop a spatial feature modeling layer to capture the fine-grained topological distribution patterns from node- and edge-level representations, respectively. Furthermore, aiming at temporal heterogeneity, we devise a temporal information modeling layer to perceive the evolutionary dependencies of dynamic graph topologies from time-level representations. Finally, we encode the spatial and temporal distribution heterogeneity from a contrastive learning perspective, enabling a comprehensive self-supervised hierarchical relation modeling for the link prediction task. Extensive experiments conducted on four real-world dynamic heterogeneous network datasets verify that our \mymodel consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art models, demonstrating an average improvement of 10.10\%, 13.44\% in terms of AUC and AP, respectively.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches often struggle to effectively model the intricate interdependencies among spatial, temporal, and contextual variables that govern accident outcomes. In this study, we introduce STARN-GAT, a Multi-Modal Spatio-Temporal Graph Attention Network, which leverages adaptive graph construction and modality-aware attention mechanisms to capture these complex relationships. Unlike conventional methods, STARN-GAT integrates road network topology, temporal traffic patterns, and environmental context within a unified attention-based framework. The model is evaluated on the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) dataset, achieving a Macro F1-score of 85 percent, ROC-AUC of 0.91, and recall of 81 percent for severe incidents. To ensure generalizability within the South Asian context, STARN-GAT is further validated on the ARI-BUET traffic accident dataset, where it attains a Macro F1-score of 0.84, recall of 0.78, and ROC-AUC of 0.89. These results demonstrate the model's effectiveness in identifying high-risk cases and its potential for deployment in real-time, safety-critical traffic management systems. Furthermore, the attention-based architecture enhances interpretability, offering insights into contributing factors and supporting trust in AI-assisted decision-making. Overall, STARN-GAT bridges the gap between advanced graph neural network techniques and practical applications in road safety analytics.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[TIMEST: Temporal Information Motif Estimator Using Sampling Trees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20441v1)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The mining of pattern subgraphs, known as motifs, is a core task in the field of graph mining. Edges in real-world networks often have timestamps, so there is a need for temporal motif mining. A temporal motif is a richer structure that imposes timing constraints on the edges of the motif. Temporal motifs have been used to analyze social networks, financial transactions, and biological networks. Motif counting in temporal graphs is particularly challenging. A graph with millions of edges can have trillions of temporal motifs, since the same edge can occur with multiple timestamps. There is a combinatorial explosion of possibilities, and state-of-the-art algorithms cannot manage motifs with more than four vertices. In this work, we present TIMEST: a general, fast, and accurate estimation algorithm to count temporal motifs of arbitrary sizes in temporal networks. Our approach introduces a temporal spanning tree sampler that leverages weighted sampling to generate substructures of target temporal motifs. This method carefully takes a subset of temporal constraints of the motif that can be jointly and efficiently sampled. TIMEST uses randomized estimation techniques to obtain accurate estimates of motif counts. We give theoretical guarantees on the running time and approximation guarantees of TIMEST. We perform an extensive experimental evaluation and show that TIMEST is both faster and more accurate than previous algorithms. Our CPU implementation exhibits an average speedup of 28x over state-of-the-art GPU implementation of the exact algorithm, and 6x speedup over SOTA approximate algorithms while consistently showcasing less than 5% error in most cases. For example, TIMEST can count the number of instances of a financial fraud temporal motif in four minutes with 0.6% error, while exact methods take more than two days.</p></details> |  |
| **[TADT-CSA: Temporal Advantage Decision Transformer with Contrastive State Abstraction for Generative Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20327v1)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancement of Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs), generative recommendation has shown great potential in enhancing both the accuracy and semantic understanding of modern recommender systems. Compared to LLMs, the Decision Transformer (DT) is a lightweight generative model applied to sequential recommendation tasks. However, DT faces challenges in trajectory stitching, often producing suboptimal trajectories. Moreover, due to the high dimensionality of user states and the vast state space inherent in recommendation scenarios, DT can incur significant computational costs and struggle to learn effective state representations. To overcome these issues, we propose a novel Temporal Advantage Decision Transformer with Contrastive State Abstraction (TADT-CSA) model. Specifically, we combine the conventional Return-To-Go (RTG) signal with a novel temporal advantage (TA) signal that encourages the model to capture both long-term returns and their sequential trend. Furthermore, we integrate a contrastive state abstraction module into the DT framework to learn more effective and expressive state representations. Within this module, we introduce a TA-conditioned State Vector Quantization (TAC-SVQ) strategy, where the TA score guides the state codebooks to incorporate contextual token information. Additionally, a reward prediction network and a contrastive transition prediction (CTP) network are employed to ensure the state codebook preserves both the reward information of the current state and the transition information between adjacent states. Empirical results on both public datasets and an online recommendation system demonstrate the effectiveness of the TADT-CSA model and its superiority over baseline methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Machine Learning Model Integration with Open World Temporal Logic for Process Automation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17776v2)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Machine Learning (ML) have yielded powerful models capable of extracting structured information from diverse and complex data sources. However, a significant challenge lies in translating these perceptual or extractive outputs into actionable, reasoned decisions within complex operational workflows. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel approach that integrates the outputs from various machine learning models directly with the PyReason framework, an open-world temporal logic programming reasoning engine. PyReason's foundation in generalized annotated logic allows for the seamless incorporation of real-valued outputs (e.g., probabilities, confidence scores) from diverse ML models, treating them as truth intervals within its logical framework. Crucially, PyReason provides mechanisms, implemented in Python, to continuously poll ML model outputs, convert them into logical facts, and dynamically recompute the minimal model, ensuring real-tine adaptive decision-making. Furthermore, its native support for temporal reasoning, knowledge graph integration, and fully explainable interface traces enables sophisticated analysis over time-sensitive process data and existing organizational knowledge.

| **[Towards Universal Modal Tracking with Online Dense Temporal Token Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20177v1)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a universal video-level modality-awareness tracking model with online dense temporal token learning (called {\modaltracker}). It is designed to support various tracking tasks, including RGB, RGB+Thermal, RGB+Depth, and RGB+Event, utilizing the same model architecture and parameters. Specifically, our model is designed with three core goals: \textbf{Video-level Sampling}. We expand the model's inputs to a video sequence level, aiming to see a richer video context from an near-global perspective. \textbf{Video-level Association}. Furthermore, we introduce two simple yet effective online dense temporal token association mechanisms to propagate the appearance and motion trajectory information of target via a video stream manner. \textbf{Modality Scalable}. We propose two novel gated perceivers that adaptively learn cross-modal representations via a gated attention mechanism, and subsequently compress them into the same set of model parameters via a one-shot training manner for multi-task inference. This new solution brings the following benefits: (i) The purified token sequences can serve as temporal prompts for the inference in the next video frames, whereby previous information is leveraged to guide future inference. (ii) Unlike multi-modal trackers that require independent training, our one-shot training scheme not only alleviates the training burden, but also improves model representation. Extensive experiments on visible and multi-modal benchmarks show that our {\modaltracker} achieves a new \textit{SOTA} performance. The code will be available at https://github.com/GXNU-ZhongLab/ODTrack.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2401.01686</p></details> |
| **[MATE: Motion-Augmented Temporal Consistency for Event-based Point Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01300v2)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tracking Any Point (TAP) plays a crucial role in motion analysis. Video-based approaches rely on iterative local matching for tracking, but they assume linear motion during the blind time between frames, which leads to point loss under large displacements or nonlinear motion. The high temporal resolution and motion blur-free characteristics of event cameras provide continuous, fine-grained motion information, capturing subtle variations with microsecond precision. This paper presents an event-based framework for tracking any point, which tackles the challenges posed by spatial sparsity and motion sensitivity in events through two tailored modules. Specifically, to resolve ambiguities caused by event sparsity, a motion-guidance module incorporates kinematic vectors into the local matching process. Additionally, a variable motion aware module is integrated to ensure temporally consistent responses that are insensitive to varying velocities, thereby enhancing matching precision. To validate the effectiveness of the approach, two event dataset for tracking any point is constructed by simulation. The method improves the $Survival_{50}$ metric by 17.9% over event-only tracking of any point baseline. Moreover, on standard feature tracking benchmarks, it outperforms all existing methods, even those that combine events and video frames.</p></details> |  |

As supervised models, large motion datasets are necessary to facilitate the learning process; however, since motion is represented with fixed hierarchical skeletons, such datasets are incompatible for skeletons outside the datasets' native configurations. Consequently, the expected availability of a motion dataset for desired skeletons severely hinders the feasibility of learned interpolation in practice. To combat this limitation, we propose Point Cloud-based Motion Representation Learning (PC-MRL), an unsupervised approach to enabling cross-compatibility between skeletons for motion interpolation learning. PC-MRL consists of a skeleton obfuscation strategy using temporal point cloud sampling, and an unsupervised skeleton reconstruction method from point clouds. We devise a temporal point-wise K-nearest neighbors loss for unsupervised learning. Moreover, we propose First-frame Offset Quaternion (FOQ) and Rest Pose Augmentation (RPA) strategies to overcome necessary limitations of our unsupervised point cloud-to-skeletal motion process. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of PC-MRL in motion interpolation for desired skeletons without supervision from native datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in ECCV 2024</p></details> |

Most existing models focus on utilizing updated data, overlooking the transferable, temporal data shift-free information that can be learned from shifting data. We propose the Temporal Invariance of Association theorem, which suggests that given a fixed search space, the relationship between the data and the data in the search space keeps invariant over time. Leveraging this principle, we designed a retrieval-based recommendation system framework that can train a data shift-free relevance network using shifting data, significantly enhancing the predictive performance of the original model in the recommendation system. However, retrieval-based recommendation models face substantial inference time costs when deployed online. To address this, we further designed a distill framework that can distill information from the relevance network into a parameterized module using shifting data. The distilled model can be deployed online alongside the original model, with only a minimal increase in inference time. Extensive experiments on multiple real datasets demonstrate that our framework significantly improves the performance of the original model by utilizing shifting data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Packet-Level DDoS Data Augmentation Using Dual-Stream Temporal-Field Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20115v1)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In response to Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, recent research efforts increasingly rely on Machine Learning (ML)-based solutions, whose effectiveness largely depends on the quality of labeled training datasets. To address the scarcity of such datasets, data augmentation with synthetic traces is often employed. However, current synthetic trace generation methods struggle to capture the complex temporal patterns and spatial distributions exhibited in emerging DDoS attacks. This results in insufficient resemblance to real traces and unsatisfied detection accuracy when applied to ML tasks. In this paper, we propose Dual-Stream Temporal-Field Diffusion (DSTF-Diffusion), a multi-view, multi-stream network traffic generative model based on diffusion models, featuring two main streams: The field stream utilizes spatial mapping to bridge network data characteristics with pre-trained realms of stable diffusion models, effectively translating complex network interactions into formats that stable diffusion can process, while the spatial stream adopts a dynamic temporal modeling approach, meticulously capturing the intrinsic temporal patterns of network traffic. Extensive experiments demonstrate that data generated by our model exhibits higher statistical similarity to originals compared to current state-of-the-art solutions, and enhance performances on a wide range of downstream tasks.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |

Existing state-of-the-art methods, like Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs), achieve high imputation accuracy; however, they suffer from significant computational costs and are notably time-consuming due to their iterative nature. In this work, we propose CoSTI, an innovative adaptation of Consistency Models (CMs) for the MTSI domain. CoSTI employs Consistency Training to achieve comparable imputation quality to DDPMs while drastically reducing inference times, making it more suitable for real-time applications. We evaluate CoSTI across multiple datasets and missing data scenarios, demonstrating up to a 98% reduction in imputation time with performance on par with diffusion-based models. This work bridges the gap between efficiency and accuracy in generative imputation tasks, providing a scalable solution for handling missing data in critical spatio-temporal systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 7 figures, 13 tables</p></details> |
| **[Temporal network analysis via a degree-corrected Cox model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19868v1)** | 2025-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal dynamics, characterised by time-varying degree heterogeneity and homophily effects, are often exhibited in many real-world networks. As observed in an MIT Social Evolution study, the in-degree and out-degree of the nodes show considerable heterogeneity that varies with time. Concurrently, homophily effects, which explain why nodes with similar characteristics are more likely to connect with each other, are also time-dependent. To facilitate the exploration and understanding of these dynamics, we propose a novel degree-corrected Cox model for directed networks, where the way for degree-heterogeneity or homophily effects to change with time is left completely unspecified. Because each node has individual-specific in- and out-degree parameters that vary over time, the number of unknown parameters grows with the number of nodes, leading to a high-dimensional estimation problem. Therefore, it is highly nontrivial to make inference. We develop a local estimating equations approach to estimate the unknown parameters and establish the consistency and asymptotic normality of the proposed estimators in the high-dimensional regime. We further propose test statistics to check whether temporal variation or degree heterogeneity is present in the network and develop a graphically diagnostic method to evaluate goodness-of-fit for dynamic network models. Simulation studies and two real data analyses are provided to assess the finite sample performance of the proposed method and illustrate its practical utility.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper supersedes arxiv article arXiv:2301.04296v1 titled "A degree-corrected Cox model for dynamic networks" by Yuguo Chen, Lianqiang Qu, Jinfeng Xu, Ting Yan, Yunpeng Zhou</p></details> |

However, existing methods often overlook specific body part movements and their timing. In this paper, we address this issue by enriching the textual description with more details. Specifically, we propose the FineMotion dataset, which contains over 442,000 human motion snippets - short segments of human motion sequences - and their corresponding detailed descriptions of human body part movements. Additionally, the dataset includes about 95k detailed paragraphs describing the movements of human body parts of entire motion sequences. Experimental results demonstrate the significance of our dataset on the text-driven finegrained human motion generation task, especially with a remarkable +15.3% improvement in Top-3 accuracy for the MDM model. Notably, we further support a zero-shot pipeline of fine-grained motion editing, which focuses on detailed editing in both spatial and temporal dimensions via text.

At the core of our method is Latest Object Memory (LOM), which robustly tracks and continuously updates the latest states of objects by explicitly modeling their presence in each frame. This enables consistent tracking and accurate identity management across frames, enhancing both performance and reliability through the VIS process. Moreover, we introduce Decoupled Object Association (DOA), a strategy that separately handles newly appearing and already existing objects. By leveraging our memory system, DOA accurately assigns object indices, improving matching accuracy and ensuring stable identity consistency, even in dynamic scenes where objects frequently appear and disappear. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the superiority of our method over traditional approaches, setting a new benchmark in VIS. Notably, our LOMM achieves state-of-the-art AP score of 54.0 on YouTube-VIS 2022, a dataset known for its challenging long videos.

Existing studies for dynamic attention pruning are designed for hardware with massively parallel computation capabilities, such as GPUs or TPUs, and aim at long context lengths (e.g., 64K), making them unsuitable for edge scenarios. We present DeltaLLM, a training-free framework that exploits temporal sparsity in attention patterns to enable efficient LLM inference across both the prefilling and decoding stages, on resource-constrained edge devices. DeltaLLM introduces an accuracy- and memory-aware delta matrix construction strategy that introduces temporal sparsity, and a context-aware hybrid attention mechanism that combines full attention in a local context window with delta approximation outside it to increase accuracy. We evaluate our framework on the edge-device-friendly BitNet-b1.58-2B-4T model and Llama3.2-1B-Instruct model across diverse language tasks. The results show that on BitNet, our framework increases the attention sparsity from 0% to 60% during the prefilling stage with slight accuracy improvement on the WG task, and 0% to 57% across both the prefilling and decoding stages, with even higher F1 score from 29.63 to 30.97 on SQuAD-v2 task. On the Llama model, it can also achieve up to 60% sparsity during the prefilling stage and around 57% across both stages with negligible accuracy drop. These results demonstrate that DeltaLLM offers a promising solution for efficient edge deployment, requiring no fine-tuning and seamlessly integrating with existing inference pipelines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Generalization of Spiking Neural Networks Through Temporal Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19256v3)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have received widespread attention due to their event-driven and low-power characteristics, making them particularly effective for processing event-based neuromorphic data. Recent studies have shown that directly trained SNNs suffer from severe overfitting issues due to the limited scale of neuromorphic datasets and the gradient mismatching problem, which fundamentally constrain their generalization performance. In this paper, we propose a temporal regularization training (TRT) method by introducing a time-dependent regularization mechanism to enforce stronger constraints on early timesteps. We compare the performance of TRT with other state-of-the-art methods performance on datasets including CIFAR10/100, ImageNet100, DVS-CIFAR10, and N-Caltech101. To validate the effectiveness of TRT, we conducted ablation studies and analyses including loss landscape visualization and learning curve analysis, demonstrating that TRT can effectively mitigate overfitting and flatten the training loss landscape, thereby enhancing generalizability. Furthermore, we establish a theoretical interpretation of TRT's temporal regularization mechanism based on the results of Fisher information analysis. We analyze the temporal information dynamics inside SNNs by tracking Fisher information during the TRT training process, revealing the Temporal Information Concentration (TIC) phenomenon, where Fisher information progressively concentrates in early timesteps. The time-decaying regularization mechanism implemented in TRT effectively guides the network to learn robust features in early timesteps with rich information, thereby leading to significant improvements in model generalization.

Existing methods primarily extract features at the fully connected layer but often fail to capture cross-modal similarities effectively. We propose a Cross Spatial Temporal Fusion (CSTF) mechanism that enhances feature representation by integrating scale-invariant keypoints detected independently in both reference and query images. Our approach improves feature matching in two ways: First, by creating correspondence maps that leverage information from multiple image regions simultaneously, and second, by reformulating the similarity matching process as a classification task using SoftMax and Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) layers. This dual approach enables CSTF to maintain sensitivity to distinctive local features while incorporating broader contextual information, resulting in robust matching across diverse remote sensing modalities. To demonstrate the practical utility of improved feature matching, we evaluate CSTF on object detection tasks using the HRSC2016 and DOTA benchmark datasets. Our method achieves state-of-theart performance with an average mAP of 90.99% on HRSC2016 and 90.86% on DOTA, outperforming existing models. The CSTF model maintains computational efficiency with an inference speed of 12.5 FPS. These results validate that our approach to crossmodal feature matching directly enhances downstream remote sensing applications such as object detection.</p></details> |  |

However, obtaining lane-level traffic data has become a critical bottleneck for data-driven models due to limitations in the types and number of sensors and issues with the accuracy of tracking algorithms. To address this, we propose the Fine-grained Road Traffic Inference (FRTI) task, which aims to generate more detailed lane-level traffic information using limited road data, providing a more energy-efficient and cost-effective solution for precise traffic management. This task is abstracted as the first scene of the spatio-temporal graph node generation problem. We designed a two-stage framework--RoadDiff--to solve the FRTI task. solve the FRTI task. This framework leverages the Road-Lane Correlation Autoencoder-Decoder and the Lane Diffusion Module to fully utilize the limited spatio-temporal dependencies and distribution relationships of road data to accurately infer fine-grained lane traffic states. Based on existing research, we designed several baseline models with the potential to solve the FRTI task and conducted extensive experiments on six datasets representing different road conditions to validate the effectiveness of the RoadDiff model in addressing the FRTI task.

The method consists of two phases: $(i)$ learning spatio-temporal motion primitives to encapsulate the inherent robot-specific constraints and $(ii)$ constructing an STL-compliant motion plan from these primitives. Initially, we employ reinforcement learning to construct a library of control policies that perform trajectories described by the motion primitives. Then, we map motion primitives to spatio-temporal characteristics. Subsequently, we present a sampling-based STL-compliant motion planning strategy tailored to meet the STL specification. The proposed model-free approach, which generates feasible STL-compliant motion plans across various environments, is validated on differential-drive and quadruped robots across various STL specifications.

| **[Towards Improving Long-Tail Entity Predictions in Temporal Knowledge Graphs through Global Similarity and Weighted Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18977v1)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG) completion models traditionally assume access to the entire graph during training. This overlooks challenges stemming from the evolving nature of TKGs, such as: (i) the model's requirement to generalize and assimilate new knowledge, and (ii) the task of managing new or unseen entities that often have sparse connections. In this paper, we present an incremental training framework specifically designed for TKGs, aiming to address entities that are either not observed during training or have sparse connections. Our approach combines a model-agnostic enhancement layer with a weighted sampling strategy, that can be augmented to and improve any existing TKG completion method. The enhancement layer leverages a broader, global definition of entity similarity, which moves beyond mere local neighborhood proximity of GNN-based methods. The weighted sampling strategy employed in training accentuates edges linked to infrequently occurring entities. We evaluate our method on two benchmark datasets, and demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing methods in total link prediction, inductive link prediction, and in addressing long-tail entities. Notably, our method achieves a 10\% improvement and a 15\% boost in MRR for these datasets. The results underscore the potential of our approach in mitigating catastrophic forgetting and enhancing the robustness of TKG completion methods, especially in an incremental training context</p></details> |  |

| **[Bridging Sequential Deep Operator Network and Video Diffusion: Residual Refinement of Spatio-Temporal PDE Solutions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06133v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video-diffusion models have recently set the standard in video generation, inpainting, and domain translation thanks to their training stability and high perceptual fidelity. Building on these strengths, we repurpose conditional video diffusion as a physics surrogate for spatio-temporal fields governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). Our two-stage surrogate first applies a Sequential Deep Operator Network (S-DeepONet) to produce a coarse, physics-consistent prior from the prescribed boundary or loading conditions. The prior is then passed to a conditional video diffusion model that learns only the residual: the point-wise difference between the ground truth and the S-DeepONet prediction. By shifting the learning burden from the full solution to its much smaller residual space, diffusion can focus on sharpening high-frequency structures without sacrificing global coherence. The framework is assessed on two disparate benchmarks: (i) vortex-dominated lid-driven cavity flow and (ii) tensile plastic deformation of dogbone specimens. Across these data sets the hybrid surrogate consistently outperforms its single-stage counterpart, cutting the mean relative L2 error from 4.57% to 0.83% for the flow problem and from 4.42% to 2.94% for plasticity, a relative improvements of 81.8% and 33.5% respectively. The hybrid approach not only lowers quantitative errors but also improves visual quality, visibly recovering fine spatial details. These results show that (i) conditioning diffusion on a physics-aware prior enables faithful reconstruction of localized features, (ii) residual learning reduces the problem, accelerating convergence and enhancing accuracy, and (iii) the same architecture transfers seamlessly from incompressible flow to nonlinear elasto-plasticity without problem-specific architectural modifications, highlighting its broad applicability to nonlinear, time-dependent continua.</p></details> |  |
| **[IntentVCNet: Bridging Spatio-Temporal Gaps for Intention-Oriented Controllable Video Captioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18531v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intent-oriented controlled video captioning aims to generate targeted descriptions for specific targets in a video based on customized user intent. Current Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) have gained strong instruction following and visual comprehension capabilities. Although the LVLMs demonstrated proficiency in spatial and temporal understanding respectively, it was not able to perform fine-grained spatial control in time sequences in direct response to instructions. This substantial spatio-temporal gap complicates efforts to achieve fine-grained intention-oriented control in video. Towards this end, we propose a novel IntentVCNet that unifies the temporal and spatial understanding knowledge inherent in LVLMs to bridge the spatio-temporal gap from both prompting and model perspectives. Specifically, we first propose a prompt combination strategy designed to enable LLM to model the implicit relationship between prompts that characterize user intent and video sequences. We then propose a parameter efficient box adapter that augments the object semantic information in the global visual context so that the visual token has a priori information about the user intent. The final experiment proves that the combination of the two strategies can further enhance the LVLM's ability to model spatial details in video sequences, and facilitate the LVLMs to accurately generate controlled intent-oriented captions. Our proposed method achieved state-of-the-art results in several open source LVLMs and was the runner-up in the IntentVC challenge.

This stems from the model learning a non-discriminative mean representation of an action from sparse data, which compromises generalization. We address this by proposing a new paradigm based on multi-prompt ensembles, where a set of diverse, learnable prompts for each action is encouraged to specialize on compositional sub-events. To enforce this specialization, we introduce PLOT-TAL, a framework that leverages Optimal Transport (OT) to find a globally optimal alignment between the prompt ensemble and the video's temporal features. Our method establishes a new state-of-the-art on the challenging few-shot benchmarks of THUMOS'14 and EPIC-Kitchens, without requiring complex meta-learning. The significant performance gains, particularly at high IoU thresholds, validate our hypothesis and demonstrate the superiority of learning distributed, compositional representations for precise temporal localization.</p></details> | Accepted to ICCVWS |
| **[Dynamic mapping from static labels: remote sensing dynamic sample generation with temporal-spectral embedding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02574v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate remote sensing geographic mapping requires timely and representative samples. However, rapid land surface changes often render static samples obsolete within months, making manual sample updates labor-intensive and unsustainable. To address this challenge, we propose TasGen, a two-stage Temporal spectral-aware Automatic Sample Generation method for generating dynamic training samples from single-date static labels without human intervention. Land surface dynamics often manifest as anomalies in temporal-spectral sequences. %These anomalies are multivariate yet unified: temporal, spectral, or joint anomalies stem from different mechanisms and cannot be naively coupled, as this may obscure the nature of changes. Yet, any land surface state corresponds to a coherent temporal-spectral signature, which would be lost if the two dimensions are modeled separately. To effectively capture these dynamics, TasGen first disentangles temporal and spectral features to isolate their individual contributions, and then couples them to model their synergistic interactions. In the first stage, we introduce a hierarchical temporal-spectral variational autoencoder (HTS-VAE) with a dual-dimension embedding to learn low-dimensional latent patterns of normal samples by first disentangling and then jointly embedding temporal and spectral information. This temporal-spectral embedding enables robust anomaly detection by identifying deviations from learned joint patterns. In the second stage, a classifier trained on stable samples relabels change points across time to generate dynamic samples. To not only detect but also explain surface dynamics, we further propose an anomaly interpretation method based on Gibbs sampling, which attributes changes to specific spectral-temporal dimensions.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose a hybrid spatio-temporal modeling framework that combines the interpretability and uncertainty quantification of Bayesian models -- estimated using the INLA-SPDE approach -- with the predictive power and flexibility of Random Forest (RF). Specifically, we introduce two novel algorithms, collectively named INLA-RF, which integrate a statistical spatio-temporal model with RF in an iterative two-stage framework. The first algorithm (INLA-RF1) incorporates RF predictions as an offset in the INLA-SPDE model, while the second (INLA-RF2) uses RF to directly correct selected latent field nodes. Both hybrid strategies enable uncertainty propagation between modeling stages, an aspect often overlooked in existing hybrid approaches. In addition, we propose a Kullback-Leibler divergence-based stopping criterion. We evaluate the predictive performance and uncertainty quantification capabilities of the proposed algorithms through two simulation studies. Results suggest that our hybrid approach enhances spatio-temporal prediction while maintaining interpretability and coherence in uncertainty estimates.</p></details> |  |

In particular, we guide the imitation learning procedures by transferring motions from source to target, effectively bridging the morphological disparities while ensuring the physical feasibility of the target system. In the first stage, we focus on motion retargeting at the kinematic level by generating kinematically feasible whole-body motions from keypoint trajectories. Following this, we refine the motion at the dynamic level by adjusting it in the temporal domain while adhering to physical constraints. This process facilitates policy training via reinforcement learning, enabling precise and robust motion tracking. We demonstrate that our approach successfully transforms noisy motion sources, such as hand-held camera videos, into robot-specific motions that align with the morphology and physical properties of the target robots. Moreover, we demonstrate terrain-aware motion retargeting to perform BackFlip on top of a box. We successfully deployed these skills to four robots with different dimensions and physical properties in the real world through hardware experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 12 figures, videos available at https://taerimyoon.me/Spatio-Temporal-Motion-Retargeting-for-Quadruped-Robots/</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Transformation from Natural Language to Signal Temporal Logic Using LLMs with Diverse External Knowledge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20658v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal Logic (TL), especially Signal Temporal Logic (STL), enables precise formal specification, making it widely used in cyber-physical systems such as autonomous driving and robotics. Automatically transforming NL into STL is an attractive approach to overcome the limitations of manual transformation, which is time-consuming and error-prone. However, due to the lack of datasets, automatic transformation currently faces significant challenges and has not been fully explored. In this paper, we propose an NL-STL dataset named STL-Diversity-Enhanced (STL-DivEn), which comprises 16,000 samples enriched with diverse patterns. To develop the dataset, we first manually create a small-scale seed set of NL-STL pairs. Next, representative examples are identified through clustering and used to guide large language models (LLMs) in generating additional NL-STL pairs. Finally, diversity and accuracy are ensured through rigorous rule-based filters and human validation. Furthermore, we introduce the Knowledge-Guided STL Transformation (KGST) framework, a novel approach for transforming natural language into STL, involving a generate-then-refine process based on external knowledge. Statistical analysis shows that the STL-DivEn dataset exhibits more diversity than the existing NL-STL dataset. Moreover, both metric-based and human evaluations indicate that our KGST approach outperforms baseline models in transformation accuracy on STL-DivEn and DeepSTL datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures, published to ACL 2025</p></details> |
| **[ChronoSelect: Robust Learning with Noisy Labels via Dynamics Temporal Memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18183v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training deep neural networks on real-world datasets is often hampered by the presence of noisy labels, which can be memorized by over-parameterized models, leading to significant degradation in generalization performance. While existing methods for learning with noisy labels (LNL) have made considerable progress, they fundamentally suffer from static snapshot evaluations and fail to leverage the rich temporal dynamics of learning evolution. In this paper, we propose ChronoSelect (chrono denoting its temporal nature), a novel framework featuring an innovative four-stage memory architecture that compresses prediction history into compact temporal distributions. Our unique sliding update mechanism with controlled decay maintains only four dynamic memory units per sample, progressively emphasizing recent patterns while retaining essential historical knowledge. This enables precise three-way sample partitioning into clean, boundary, and noisy subsets through temporal trajectory analysis and dual-branch consistency. Theoretical guarantees prove the mechanism's convergence and stability under noisy conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate ChronoSelect's state-of-the-art performance across synthetic and real-world benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Temporal Abstractions via Variational Homomorphisms in Option-Induced Abstract MDPs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16473v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable reasoning ability through explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, but generating these step-by-step textual explanations is computationally expensive and slow. To overcome this, we aim to develop a framework for efficient, implicit reasoning, where the model "thinks" in a latent space without generating explicit text for every step. We propose that these latent thoughts can be modeled as temporally-extended abstract actions, or options, within a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework. To effectively learn a diverse library of options as latent embeddings, we first introduce the Variational Markovian Option Critic (VMOC), an off-policy algorithm that uses variational inference within the HiT-MDP framework. To provide a rigorous foundation for using these options as an abstract reasoning space, we extend the theory of continuous MDP homomorphisms. This proves that learning a policy in the simplified, abstract latent space, for which VMOC is suited, preserves the optimality of the solution to the original, complex problem. Finally, we propose a cold-start procedure that leverages supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data to distill human reasoning demonstrations into this latent option space, providing a rich initialization for the model's reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves strong performance on complex logical reasoning benchmarks and challenging locomotion tasks, validating our framework as a principled method for learning abstract skills for both language and control.</p></details> |  |

Despite recent progress with large vision-language models (LVLMs) and instruction-tuning, existing approaches often suffer from limited temporal awareness and poor generalization. In this work, we introduce a two-stage training framework that integrates supervised fine-tuning with reinforcement learning (RL) to improve both the accuracy and robustness of VTG models. Our approach first leverages high-quality curated cold start data for SFT initialization, followed by difficulty-controlled RL to further enhance temporal localization and reasoning abilities. Comprehensive experiments on multiple VTG benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing models, particularly in challenging and open-domain scenarios. We conduct an in-depth analysis of training strategies and dataset curation, highlighting the importance of both high-quality cold start data and difficulty-controlled RL. To facilitate further research and industrial adoption, we release all intermediate datasets, models, and code to the community.</p></details> |  |

The generation part of the recipe outputs audios from the input dataset with several critical characteristics, such as longer duration, noisy conditions, and containing multiple speakers, in a controllable fashion. The corresponding detection and localization protocol uses models. We conduct experiments based on self-supervised learning front-end and simple back-end. The results indicate that models trained using data generated with LENS-DF consistently outperform those trained via conventional recipes, demonstrating the effectiveness and usefulness of LENS-DF for robust audio deepfake detection and localization.

| **[Approximating temporal modularity on graphs of small underlying treewidth](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17541v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modularity is a very widely used measure of the level of clustering or community structure in networks. Here we consider a recent generalisation of the definition of modularity to temporal graphs, whose edge-sets change over discrete timesteps; such graphs offer a more realistic model of many real-world networks in which connections between entities (for example, between individuals in a social network) evolve over time. Computing modularity is notoriously difficult: it is NP-hard even to approximate in general, and only admits efficient exact algorithms in very restricted special cases. Our main result is that a multiplicative approximation to temporal modularity can be computed efficiently when the underlying graph has small treewidth. This generalises a similar approximation algorithm for the static case, but requires some substantially new ideas to overcome technical challenges associated with the temporal nature of the problem.</p></details> |  |
| **[STQE: Spatial-Temporal Quality Enhancement for G-PCC Compressed Dynamic Point Clouds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17522v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Very few studies have addressed quality enhancement for compressed dynamic point clouds. In particular, the effective exploitation of spatial-temporal correlations between point cloud frames remains largely unexplored. Addressing this gap, we propose a spatial-temporal attribute quality enhancement (STQE) network that exploits both spatial and temporal correlations to improve the visual quality of G-PCC compressed dynamic point clouds. Our contributions include a recoloring-based motion compensation module that remaps reference attribute information to the current frame geometry to achieve precise inter-frame geometric alignment, a channel-aware temporal attention module that dynamically highlights relevant regions across bidirectional reference frames, a Gaussian-guided neighborhood feature aggregation module that efficiently captures spatial dependencies between geometry and color attributes, and a joint loss function based on the Pearson correlation coefficient, designed to alleviate over-smoothing effects typical of point-wise mean squared error optimization. When applied to the latest G-PCC test model, STQE achieved improvements of 0.855 dB, 0.682 dB, and 0.828 dB in delta PSNR, with Bj{\o}ntegaard Delta rate (BD-rate) reductions of -25.2%, -31.6%, and -32.5% for the Luma, Cb, and Cr components, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[LSDM: LLM-Enhanced Spatio-temporal Diffusion Model for Service-Level Mobile Traffic Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17795v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Service-level mobile traffic prediction for individual users is essential for network efficiency and quality of service enhancement. However, current prediction methods are limited in their adaptability across different urban environments and produce inaccurate results due to the high uncertainty in personal traffic patterns, the lack of detailed environmental context, and the complex dependencies among different network services. These challenges demand advanced modeling techniques that can capture dynamic traffic distributions and rich environmental features. Inspired by the recent success of diffusion models in distribution modeling and Large Language Models (LLMs) in contextual understanding, we propose an LLM-Enhanced Spatio-temporal Diffusion Model (LSDM). LSDM integrates the generative power of diffusion models with the adaptive learning capabilities of transformers, augmented by the ability to capture multimodal environmental information for modeling service-level patterns and dynamics. Extensive evaluations on real-world service-level datasets demonstrate that the model excels in traffic usage predictions, showing outstanding generalization and adaptability. After incorporating contextual information via LLM, the performance improves by at least 2.83% in terms of the coefficient of determination. Compared to models of a similar type, such as CSDI, the root mean squared error can be reduced by at least 8.29%. The code and dataset will be available at: https://github.com/SoftYuaneR/LSDM.</p></details> | 14 pages, 9 figures |
| **[LTLZinc: a Benchmarking Framework for Continual Learning and Neuro-Symbolic Temporal Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17482v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence aims to combine neural architectures with symbolic approaches that can represent knowledge in a human-interpretable formalism. Continual learning concerns with agents that expand their knowledge over time, improving their skills while avoiding to forget previously learned concepts. Most of the existing approaches for neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence are applied to static scenarios only, and the challenging setting where reasoning along the temporal dimension is necessary has been seldom explored. In this work we introduce LTLZinc, a benchmarking framework that can be used to generate datasets covering a variety of different problems, against which neuro-symbolic and continual learning methods can be evaluated along the temporal and constraint-driven dimensions. Our framework generates expressive temporal reasoning and continual learning tasks from a linear temporal logic specification over MiniZinc constraints, and arbitrary image classification datasets. Fine-grained annotations allow multiple neural and neuro-symbolic training settings on the same generated datasets. Experiments on six neuro-symbolic sequence classification and four class-continual learning tasks generated by LTLZinc, demonstrate the challenging nature of temporal learning and reasoning, and highlight limitations of current state-of-the-art methods. We release the LTLZinc generator and ten ready-to-use tasks to the neuro-symbolic and continual learning communities, in the hope of fostering research towards unified temporal learning and reasoning frameworks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Smoothness-Aware Rate-Distortion Optimized 4D Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17336v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) effectively extends the high-speed rendering capabilities of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to represent volumetric videos. However, the large number of Gaussians, substantial temporal redundancies, and especially the absence of an entropy-aware compression framework result in large storage requirements. Consequently, this poses significant challenges for practical deployment, efficient edge-device processing, and data transmission. In this paper, we introduce a novel end-to-end RD-optimized compression framework tailored for 4DGS, aiming to enable flexible, high-fidelity rendering across varied computational platforms. Leveraging Fully Explicit Dynamic Gaussian Splatting (Ex4DGS), one of the state-of-the-art 4DGS methods, as our baseline, we start from the existing 3DGS compression methods for compatibility while effectively addressing additional challenges introduced by the temporal axis. In particular, instead of storing motion trajectories independently per point, we employ a wavelet transform to reflect the real-world smoothness prior, significantly enhancing storage efficiency. This approach yields significantly improved compression ratios and provides a user-controlled balance between compression efficiency and rendering quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving up to 91x compression compared to the original Ex4DGS model while maintaining high visual fidelity. These results highlight the applicability of our framework for real-time dynamic scene rendering in diverse scenarios, from resource-constrained edge devices to high-performance environments.</p></details> | 21 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Temporal Point-Supervised Signal Reconstruction: A Human-Annotation-Free Framework for Weak Moving Target Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17334v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In low-altitude surveillance and early warning systems, detecting weak moving targets remains a significant challenge due to low signal energy, small spatial extent, and complex background clutter. Existing methods struggle with extracting robust features and suffer from the lack of reliable annotations. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Temporal Point-Supervised (TPS) framework that enables high-performance detection of weak targets without any manual annotations.Instead of conventional frame-based detection, our framework reformulates the task as a pixel-wise temporal signal modeling problem, where weak targets manifest as short-duration pulse-like responses. A Temporal Signal Reconstruction Network (TSRNet) is developed under the TPS paradigm to reconstruct these transient signals.TSRNet adopts an encoder-decoder architecture and integrates a Dynamic Multi-Scale Attention (DMSAttention) module to enhance its sensitivity to diverse temporal patterns. Additionally, a graph-based trajectory mining strategy is employed to suppress false alarms and ensure temporal consistency.Extensive experiments on a purpose-built low-SNR dataset demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods while requiring no human annotations. It achieves strong detection performance and operates at over 1000 FPS, underscoring its potential for real-time deployment in practical scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Conflict Detection for Temporal Knowledge Graphs:A Fast Constraint Mining Algorithm and New Benchmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11053v2)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal facts, which are used to describe events that occur during specific time periods, have become a topic of increased interest in the field of knowledge graph (KG) research. In terms of quality management, the introduction of time restrictions brings new challenges to maintaining the temporal consistency of KGs. Previous studies rely on manually enumerated temporal constraints to detect conflicts, which are labor-intensive and may have granularity issues. To address this problem, we start from the common pattern of temporal facts and propose a pattern-based temporal constraint mining method, PaTeCon. Unlike previous studies, PaTeCon uses graph patterns and statistical information relevant to the given KG to automatically generate temporal constraints, without the need for human experts. In this paper, we illustrate how this method can be optimized to achieve significant speed improvement. We also annotate Wikidata and Freebase to build two new benchmarks for conflict detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our pattern-based automatic constraint mining approach is highly effective in generating valuable temporal constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Spatio-Temporal Machine Learning Model for Mortgage Credit Risk: Default Probabilities and Loan Portfolios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02846v2)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel machine learning model for credit risk by combining tree-boosting with a latent spatio-temporal Gaussian process model accounting for frailty correlation. This allows for modeling non-linearities and interactions among predictor variables in a flexible data-driven manner and for accounting for spatio-temporal variation that is not explained by observable predictor variables. We also show how estimation and prediction can be done in a computationally efficient manner. In an application to a large U.S. mortgage credit risk data set, we find that both predictive default probabilities for individual loans and predictive loan portfolio loss distributions obtained with our novel approach are more accurate compared to conventional independent linear hazard models and also linear spatio-temporal models. Using interpretability tools for machine learning models, we find that the likely reasons for this outperformance are strong interaction and non-linear effects in the predictor variables and the presence of spatio-temporal frailty effects.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Temporal Guidance and Iterative Refinement in Audio Source Separation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17297v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial semantic segmentation of sound scenes (S5) involves the accurate identification of active sound classes and the precise separation of their sources from complex acoustic mixtures. Conventional systems rely on a two-stage pipeline - audio tagging followed by label-conditioned source separation - but are often constrained by the absence of fine-grained temporal information critical for effective separation. In this work, we address this limitation by introducing a novel approach for S5 that enhances the synergy between the event detection and source separation stages. Our key contributions are threefold. First, we fine-tune a pre-trained Transformer to detect active sound classes. Second, we utilize a separate instance of this fine-tuned Transformer to perform sound event detection (SED), providing the separation module with detailed, time-varying guidance. Third, we implement an iterative refinement mechanism that progressively enhances separation quality by recursively reusing the separator's output from previous iterations. These advancements lead to significant improvements in both audio tagging and source separation performance, as demonstrated by our system's second-place finish in Task 4 of the DCASE Challenge 2025. Our implementation and model checkpoints are available in our GitHub repository: https://github.com/theMoro/dcase25task4 .</p></details> |  |
| **[Triadic First-Order Logic Queries in Temporal Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17215v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motif counting is a fundamental problem in network analysis, and there is a rich literature of theoretical and applied algorithms for this problem. Given a large input network $G$, a motif $H$ is a small "pattern" graph indicative of special local structure. Motif/pattern mining involves finding all matches of this pattern in the input $G$. The simplest, yet challenging, case of motif counting is when $H$ has three vertices, often called a "triadic" query. Recent work has focused on "temporal graph mining", where the network $G$ has edges with timestamps (and directions) and $H$ has time constraints. Inspired by concepts in logic and database theory, we introduce the study of "thresholded First Order Logic (FOL) Motif Analysis" for massive temporal networks. A typical triadic motif query asks for the existence of three vertices that form a desired temporal pattern. An "FOL" motif query is obtained by having both existential and thresholded universal quantifiers. This allows for query semantics that can mine richer information from networks. A typical triadic query would be "find all triples of vertices $u,v,w$ such that they form a triangle within one hour". A thresholded FOL query can express "find all pairs $u,v$ such that for half of $w$ where $(u,w)$ formed an edge, $(v,w)$ also formed an edge within an hour". We design the first algorithm, FOLTY, for mining thresholded FOL triadic queries. The theoretical running time of FOLTY matches the best known running time for temporal triangle counting in sparse graphs. We give an efficient implementation of FOLTY using specialized temporal data structures. FOLTY has excellent empirical behavior, and can answer triadic FOL queries on graphs with nearly 70M edges is less than hour on commodity hardware. Our work has the potential to start a new research direction in the classic well-studied problem of motif analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamics of temporal influence in polarised networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17177v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In social networks, it is often of interest to identify the most influential users who can successfully spread information to others. This is particularly important for marketing (e.g., targeting influencers for a marketing campaign) and to understand the dynamics of information diffusion (e.g., who is the most central user in the spreading of a certain type of information). However, different opinions often split the audience and make the network polarised. In polarised networks, information becomes soiled within communities in the network, and the most influential user within a network might not be the most influential across all communities. Additionally, influential users and their influence may change over time as users may change their opinion or choose to decrease or halt their engagement on the subject. In this work, we aim to study the temporal dynamics of users' influence in a polarised social network. We compare the stability of influence ranking using temporal centrality measures, while extending them to account for community structure across a number of network evolution behaviours. We show that we can successfully aggregate nodes into influence bands, and how to aggregate centrality scores to analyse the influence of communities over time. A modified version of the temporal independent cascade model and the temporal degree centrality perform the best in this setting, as they are able to reliably isolate nodes into their bands.</p></details> | 35 pages, 16 figures |

It faces a great challenge yet to be addressed - that is, the significant distributional differences among monitoring data from multiple modes make it difficult for the models to extract shared feature representations related to system health conditions. In response to this problem, this paper introduces a novel method called attention-based multiscale temporal fusion network. The multiscale depthwise convolution and gated recurrent unit are employed to extract multiscale contextual local features and long-short-term features. Instance normalization is applied to suppress mode-specific information. Furthermore, a temporal attention mechanism is designed to focus on critical time points with higher cross-mode shared information, thereby enhancing the accuracy of fault diagnosis. The proposed model is applied to Tennessee Eastman process dataset and three-phase flow facility dataset. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior diagnostic performance and maintains a small model size.

While scene graphs are adept at capturing spatial relationships between objects in individual frames, extending these representations to capture dynamic interactions across video sequences remains a significant challenge. To address this, we present TCDSG, Temporally Consistent Dynamic Scene Graphs, an innovative end-to-end framework that detects, tracks, and links subject-object relationships across time, generating action tracklets, temporally consistent sequences of entities and their interactions. Our approach leverages a novel bipartite matching mechanism, enhanced by adaptive decoder queries and feedback loops, ensuring temporal coherence and robust tracking over extended sequences. This method not only establishes a new benchmark by achieving over 60% improvement in temporal recall@k on the Action Genome, OpenPVSG, and MEVA datasets but also pioneers the augmentation of MEVA with persistent object ID annotations for comprehensive tracklet generation. By seamlessly integrating spatial and temporal dynamics, our work sets a new standard in multi-frame video analysis, opening new avenues for high-impact applications in surveillance, autonomous navigation, and beyond.</p></details> |  |
| **[Influence Maximization in Temporal Networks with Persistent and Reactive Behaviors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20936v2)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Influence maximization in temporal social networks presents unique challenges due to the dynamic interactions that evolve over time. Traditional diffusion models often fall short in capturing the real-world complexities of active-inactive transitions among nodes, obscuring the true behavior of influence spread. In dynamic networks, nodes do not simply transition to an active state once; rather, they can oscillate between active and inactive states, with the potential for reactivation and reinforcement over time. This reactivation allows previously influenced nodes to regain influence potency, enhancing their ability to spread influence to others and amplifying the overall diffusion process. Ignoring these transitions can thus conceal the cumulative impact of influence, making it essential to account for them in any effective diffusion model. To address these challenges, we introduce the Continuous Persistent Susceptible-Infected Model with Reinforcement and Re-activation (cpSI-R), which explicitly incorporates active-inactive transitions, capturing the progressive reinforcement that makes nodes more potent spreaders upon reactivation. This model naturally leads to a submodular and monotone objective function, which supports efficient optimization for seed selection in influence maximization tasks. Alongside cpSI-R, we propose an efficient temporal snapshot sampling method, simplifying the analysis of evolving networks. We then adapt the prior algorithms of seed selection to our model and sampling strategy, resulting in reduced computational costs and enhanced seed selection efficiency. Experimental evaluations on diverse datasets demonstrate substantial improvements in performance over baseline methods, underscoring the effectiveness of cpSI-R for real-world temporal networks</p></details> |  |

However, despite extensive benchmarking efforts, it remains unclear whether current Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) effectively capture core temporal patterns such as periodicity, cause-and-effect, and long-range dependencies. In this work, we introduce the Temporal Graph Reasoning Benchmark (T-GRAB), a comprehensive set of synthetic tasks designed to systematically probe the capabilities of TGNNs to reason across time. T-GRAB provides controlled, interpretable tasks that isolate key temporal skills: counting/memorizing periodic repetitions, inferring delayed causal effects, and capturing long-range dependencies over both spatial and temporal dimensions. We evaluate 11 temporal graph learning methods on these tasks, revealing fundamental shortcomings in their ability to generalize temporal patterns. Our findings offer actionable insights into the limitations of current models, highlight challenges hidden by traditional real-world benchmarks, and motivate the development of architectures with stronger temporal reasoning abilities.

| **[Temporally-Constrained Video Reasoning Segmentation and Automated Benchmark Construction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16718v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional approaches to video segmentation are confined to predefined object categories and cannot identify out-of-vocabulary objects, let alone objects that are not identified explicitly but only referred to implicitly in complex text queries. This shortcoming limits the utility for video segmentation in complex and variable scenarios, where a closed set of object categories is difficult to define and where users may not know the exact object category that will appear in the video. Such scenarios can arise in operating room video analysis, where different health systems may use different workflows and instrumentation, requiring flexible solutions for video analysis. Reasoning segmentation (RS) now offers promise towards such a solution, enabling natural language text queries as interaction for identifying object to segment. However, existing video RS formulation assume that target objects remain contextually relevant throughout entire video sequences. This assumption is inadequate for real-world scenarios in which objects of interest appear, disappear or change relevance dynamically based on temporal context, such as surgical instruments that become relevant only during specific procedural phases or anatomical structures that gain importance at particular moments during surgery. Our first contribution is the introduction of temporally-constrained video reasoning segmentation, a novel task formulation that requires models to implicitly infer when target objects become contextually relevant based on text queries that incorporate temporal reasoning. Since manual annotation of temporally-constrained video RS datasets would be expensive and limit scalability, our second contribution is an innovative automated benchmark construction method. Finally, we present TCVideoRSBenchmark, a temporally-constrained video RS dataset containing 52 samples using the videos from the MVOR dataset.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods typically necessitate supervised learning based on human-refined masks in the ventricular myocardium, which become impractical without contrast agents. We introduce a self-supervised framework, namely Codebook-based Temporal-Spatial Learning (CTSL), that learns dynamic, spatiotemporal representations from raw Cine data without requiring segmentation masks. CTSL decouples temporal and spatial features through a multi-view distillation strategy, where the teacher model processes multiple Cine views, and the student model learns from reduced-dimensional Cine-SA sequences. By leveraging codebook-based feature representations and dynamic lesion self-detection through motion cues, CTSL captures intricate temporal dependencies and motion patterns. High-confidence MACE risk predictions are achieved through our model, providing a rapid, non-invasive solution for cardiac risk assessment that outperforms traditional contrast-dependent methods, thereby enabling timely and accessible heart disease diagnosis in clinical settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at MICCAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Multimodal Deviation Perceiving Framework for Weakly-Supervised Temporal Forgery Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16596v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current researches on Deepfake forensics often treat detection as a classification task or temporal forgery localization problem, which are usually restrictive, time-consuming, and challenging to scale for large datasets. To resolve these issues, we present a multimodal deviation perceiving framework for weakly-supervised temporal forgery localization (MDP), which aims to identify temporal partial forged segments using only video-level annotations. The MDP proposes a novel multimodal interaction mechanism (MI) and an extensible deviation perceiving loss to perceive multimodal deviation, which achieves the refined start and end timestamps localization of forged segments. Specifically, MI introduces a temporal property preserving cross-modal attention to measure the relevance between the visual and audio modalities in the probabilistic embedding space. It could identify the inter-modality deviation and construct comprehensive video features for temporal forgery localization. To explore further temporal deviation for weakly-supervised learning, an extensible deviation perceiving loss has been proposed, aiming at enlarging the deviation of adjacent segments of the forged samples and reducing that of genuine samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and achieve comparable results to fully-supervised approaches in several evaluation metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 3 figures,conference</p></details> |

We propose COMPASS, a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework that enables decentralized agents to persistently monitor multiple moving targets efficiently. We model the environment as a graph, where nodes represent spatial locations and edges capture topological proximity, allowing agents to reason over structured layouts and revisit informative regions as needed. Each agent independently selects actions based on a shared spatio-temporal attention network that we design to integrate historical observations and spatial context. We model target dynamics using Gaussian Processes (GPs), which support principled belief updates and enable uncertainty-aware planning. We train COMPASS using centralized value estimation and decentralized policy execution under an adaptive reward setting. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that COMPASS consistently outperforms strong baselines in uncertainty reduction, target coverage, and coordination efficiency across dynamic multi-target scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[GroundFlow: A Plug-in Module for Temporal Reasoning on 3D Point Cloud Sequential Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21188v2)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential grounding in 3D point clouds (SG3D) refers to locating sequences of objects by following text instructions for a daily activity with detailed steps. Current 3D visual grounding (3DVG) methods treat text instructions with multiple steps as a whole, without extracting useful temporal information from each step. However, the instructions in SG3D often contain pronouns such as "it", "here" and "the same" to make language expressions concise. This requires grounding methods to understand the context and retrieve relevant information from previous steps to correctly locate object sequences. Due to the lack of an effective module for collecting related historical information, state-of-the-art 3DVG methods face significant challenges in adapting to the SG3D task. To fill this gap, we propose GroundFlow -- a plug-in module for temporal reasoning on 3D point cloud sequential grounding. Firstly, we demonstrate that integrating GroundFlow improves the task accuracy of 3DVG baseline methods by a large margin (+7.5\% and +10.2\%) in the SG3D benchmark, even outperforming a 3D large language model pre-trained on various datasets. Furthermore, we selectively extract both short-term and long-term step information based on its relevance to the current instruction, enabling GroundFlow to take a comprehensive view of historical information and maintain its temporal understanding advantage as step counts increase. Overall, our work introduces temporal reasoning capabilities to existing 3DVG models and achieves state-of-the-art performance in the SG3D benchmark across five datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reducing GPU Memory Fragmentation via Spatio-Temporal Planning for Efficient Large-Scale Model Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16274v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid scaling of large language models (LLMs) has significantly increased GPU memory pressure, which is further aggravated by training optimization techniques such as virtual pipeline and recomputation that disrupt tensor lifespans and introduce considerable memory fragmentation. Default GPU memory allocators of popular deep learning frameworks like PyTorch use online strategies without knowledge of tensor lifespans, which can waste up to 43\% of memory and cause out-of-memory errors, rendering optimization techniques ineffective or even unusable. To address this, we introduce STWeaver, a GPU memory allocator for deep learning frameworks that reduces fragmentation by exploiting the spatial and temporal regularity in memory allocation behaviors of training workloads. STWeaver introduces a novel paradigm that combines offline planning with online allocation. The offline planning leverages spatio-temporal regularities to generate a near-optimal allocation plan, while the online allocation handles complex and dynamic models such as Mixture-of-Experts (MoE). Built as a pluggable PyTorch allocator, STWeaver reduces fragmentation ratio on average by 79.2\% (up to 100\%) across both dense and sparse models, with negligible overhead. This enables more efficient, high-throughput training configurations and improves performance by up to 32.5\%.</p></details> |  |

Prior efforts have been made on accurate prediction of bike traffics, i.e., demand/pick-up and return/drop-off, to achieve system efficiency. However, bike station-level traffic prediction is difficult because of the spatial-temporal complexity of bike sharing systems. Moreover, such level of prediction over entire bike sharing systems is also challenging due to the large number of bike stations. To fill this gap, we propose BikeMAN, a multi-level spatio-temporal attention neural network to predict station-level bike traffic for entire bike sharing systems. The proposed network consists of an encoder and a decoder with an attention mechanism representing the spatial correlation between features of bike stations in the system and another attention mechanism describing the temporal characteristic of bike station traffic. Through experimental study on over 10 millions trips of bike sharing systems (> 700 stations) of New York City, our network showed high accuracy in predicting the bike station traffic of all stations in the city.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, UrbComp 2024</p></details> |

This study investigates this phenomenon by focusing on temporal cognition in LLMs. Leveraging the similarity judgment task, we find that larger models spontaneously establish a subjective temporal reference point and adhere to the Weber-Fechner law, whereby the perceived distance logarithmically compresses as years recede from this reference point. To uncover the mechanisms behind this behavior, we conducted multiple analyses across neuronal, representational, and informational levels. We first identify a set of temporal-preferential neurons and find that this group exhibits minimal activation at the subjective reference point and implements a logarithmic coding scheme convergently found in biological systems. Probing representations of years reveals a hierarchical construction process, where years evolve from basic numerical values in shallow layers to abstract temporal orientation in deep layers. Finally, using pre-trained embedding models, we found that the training corpus itself possesses an inherent, non-linear temporal structure, which provides the raw material for the model's internal construction. In discussion, we propose an experientialist perspective for understanding these findings, where the LLMs' cognition is viewed as a subjective construction of the external world by its internal representational system. This nuanced perspective implies the potential emergence of alien cognitive frameworks that humans cannot intuitively predict, pointing toward a direction for AI alignment that focuses on guiding internal constructions.

| **[TSkips: Efficiency Through Explicit Temporal Delay Connections in Spiking Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16711v2)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) with their bio-inspired Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons inherently capture temporal information. This makes them well-suited for sequential tasks like processing event-based data from Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS) and event-based speech tasks. Harnessing the temporal capabilities of SNNs requires mitigating vanishing spikes during training, capturing spatio-temporal patterns and enhancing precise spike timing. To address these challenges, we propose TSkips, augmenting SNN architectures with forward and backward skip connections that incorporate explicit temporal delays. These connections capture long-term spatio-temporal dependencies and facilitate better spike flow over long sequences. The introduction of TSkips creates a vast search space of possible configurations, encompassing skip positions and time delay values. To efficiently navigate this search space, this work leverages training-free Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to identify optimal network structures and corresponding delays. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on four event-based datasets: DSEC-flow for optical flow estimation, DVS128 Gesture for hand gesture recognition and Spiking Heidelberg Digits (SHD) and Spiking Speech Commands (SSC) for speech recognition. Our method achieves significant improvements across these datasets: up to 18% reduction in Average Endpoint Error (AEE) on DSEC-flow, 8% increase in classification accuracy on DVS128 Gesture, and up to 8% and 16% higher classification accuracy on SHD and SSC, respectively.</p></details> |  |

However, existing Video LLMs often exhibit limitations in fine-grained temporal reasoning, restricting their ability to precisely attribute responses to specific video moments, especially under constrained supervision. We introduce DaMO, a data-efficient Video LLM explicitly designed for accurate temporal reasoning and multimodal understanding. At its core, the proposed Temporal-aware Fuseformer employs a hierarchical dual-stream architecture that progressively captures temporal dynamics within each modality and effectively fuses complementary visual and audio information. To further enhance computational efficiency, DaMO integrates a global residual that reduces spatial redundancy while preserving essential semantic details. We train DaMO via a structured four-stage progressive training paradigm, incrementally equipping the model with multimodal alignment, semantic grounding, and temporal reasoning capabilities. This work also contributes multiple datasets augmented from existing ones with LLM-generated temporally grounded QA pairs for tasks requiring temporal supervision. Comprehensive experiments on temporal grounding and video QA benchmarks demonstrate that DaMO consistently surpasses prior methods, particularly in tasks demanding precise temporal alignment and reasoning. Our work establishes a promising direction for data-efficient video-language modeling.</p></details> |  |

Current DIR implementations rely on discrete volumetric motion representation, which often leads to compromised accuracy and uncertainty when handling significant anatomical changes and sliding boundaries. This limitation affects the reliability of subsequent contour propagation and dose accumulation procedures, particularly in regions with complex anatomical interfaces such as the lung-chest wall boundary. Given that organ motion is inherently a continuous process in both space and time, we aimed to develop a model that preserves these fundamental properties. Drawing inspiration from fluid mechanics, we propose a novel approach using implicit neural representation (INR) for continuous modeling of patient anatomical motion. This approach ensures spatial and temporal continuity while effectively unifying Eulerian and Lagrangian specifications to enable natural continuous motion modeling and frame interpolation. The integration of these specifications provides a more comprehensive understanding of anatomical deformation patterns. By leveraging the continuous representations, the CPT-DIR method significantly enhances registration and interpolation accuracy, automation, and speed. The method demonstrates superior performance in landmark and contour precision, particularly in challenging anatomical regions, representing a substantial advancement over conventional approaches in deformable image registration. The improved efficiency and accuracy of CPT-DIR make it particularly suitable for real-time adaptive radiotherapy applications.</p></details> |  |

It can estimate spatially accurate and temporally consistent disparities without relying on auxiliary information such as camera poses or optical flow. The strong capability is driven by rich priors from monocular video depth models, which are integrated with convolutional features to produce stable representations. To further enhance performance, key architectural innovations are introduced: all-to-all-pairs correlation, which constructs smooth and robust matching cost volumes, and temporal convex upsampling, which improves temporal coherence. These components collectively ensure robustness, accuracy, and temporal consistency, setting a new standard in video stereo matching. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets both qualitatively and quantitatively in zero-shot settings, as well as strong generalization to real-world indoor and outdoor scenarios.</p></details> | ICCV2025 |

Temporal reasoning, a critical component of natural language understanding, has raised increasing research attention. However, comprehensive testing of Allen's interval relations (e.g., before, after, during) -- a fundamental framework for temporal relationships -- remains underexplored. To fill this gap, we present ChronoSense, a new benchmark for evaluating LLMs' temporal understanding. It includes 16 tasks, focusing on identifying the Allen relation between two temporal events and temporal arithmetic, using both abstract events and real-world data from Wikidata. We assess the performance of seven recent LLMs using this benchmark and the results indicate that models handle Allen relations, even symmetrical ones, quite differently. Moreover, the findings suggest that the models may rely on memorization to answer time-related questions. Overall, the models' low performance highlights the need for improved temporal understanding in LLMs and ChronoSense offers a robust framework for future research in this area.

| **[Temporal Basis Function Models for Closed-Loop Neural Stimulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15274v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Closed-loop neural stimulation provides novel therapies for neurological diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD), but it is not yet clear whether artificial intelligence (AI) techniques can tailor closed-loop stimulation to individual patients or identify new therapies. Progress requires us to address a number of translational issues, including sample efficiency, training time, and minimizing loop latency such that stimulation may be shaped in response to changing brain activity. We propose temporal basis function models (TBFMs) to address these difficulties, and explore this approach in the context of excitatory optogenetic stimulation. We demonstrate the ability of TBF models to provide a single-trial, spatiotemporal forward prediction of the effect of optogenetic stimulation on local field potentials (LFPs) measured in two non-human primates. We further use simulations to demonstrate the use of TBF models for closed-loop stimulation, driving neural activity towards target patterns. The simplicity of TBF models allow them to be sample efficient, rapid to train (2-4min), and low latency (0.2ms) on desktop CPUs. We demonstrate the model on 40 sessions of previously published excitatory optogenetic stimulation data. For each session, the model required 15-20min of data collection to successfully model the remainder of the session. It achieved a prediction accuracy comparable to a baseline nonlinear dynamical systems model that requires hours to train, and superior accuracy to a linear state-space model. In our simulations, it also successfully allowed a closed-loop stimulator to control a neural circuit. Our approach begins to bridge the translational gap between complex AI-based approaches to modeling dynamical systems and the vision of using such forward prediction models to develop novel, clinically useful closed-loop stimulation protocols.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes an attention-based Graph Neural Network framework that captures spatial-temporal dependencies by modeling the food delivery environment as a graph. In this graph, nodes represent urban delivery zones, while edges reflect spatial proximity and inter-regional order flow patterns derived from historical data. The attention mechanism dynamically weighs the influence of neighboring zones, enabling the model to focus on the most contextually relevant areas during prediction. Temporal trends are jointly learned alongside spatial interactions, allowing the model to adapt to evolving demand patterns. Extensive experiments on real-world food delivery datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model in forecasting future order volumes with high accuracy. The framework offers a scalable and adaptive solution to support proactive fleet positioning, resource allocation, and dispatch optimization in urban food delivery operations.</p></details> |  |

This paper investigates the 3-dimensional (3D) trajectory and communication optimization for low-altitude air-ground cooperation systems, where mobile unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) upload data to UAVs. We propose a joint optimization algorithm to maximize the minimal sum-rate of UGVs while ensuring quality of service and navigation constraints. The proposed algorithm integrates a successive convex approximation (SCA)-penalty method for UGV-UAV scheduling, an SCA-based approach for UGV transmit power control, and a novel warm-start particle swarm optimization with cross mutation (WS-PSO-CM). The WS-PSO-CM leverages convex optimization results from a statistical channel model to initialize particle swarm, significantly improving the performance, compared with celebrated PSO-CM. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves a $45.8$\% higher minimal sum-rate compared to the baseline PSO-CM under the same iterations. This gain can be translated to reducing computational time by $46.7$\% of PSO-CM. Furthermore, our simulation results reveal that UAVs dynamically adjust trajectories to avoid interference by buildings, and maintain proximity to UGVs to mitigate path-loss.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages; 6 figures; submit to IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Using a prototype-based nearest-neighbor search (P-NNS), we evaluate the validity of JSON-Bag with JSD on six tabletop games -- \textit{7 Wonders}, \textit{Dominion}, \textit{Sea Salt and Paper}, \textit{Can't Stop}, \textit{Connect4}, \textit{Dots and boxes} -- each over three game trajectory classification tasks: classifying the playing agents, game parameters, or game seeds that were used to generate the trajectories. Our approach outperforms a baseline using hand-crafted features in the majority of tasks. Evaluating on N-shot classification suggests using JSON-Bag prototype to represent game trajectory classes is also sample efficient. Additionally, we demonstrate JSON-Bag ability for automatic feature extraction by treating tokens as individual features to be used in Random Forest to solve the tasks above, which significantly improves accuracy on underperforming tasks. Finally, we show that, across all six games, the JSD between JSON-Bag prototypes of agent classes highly correlates with the distances between agents' policies.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, 6 tables, to be published in IEEE Conference on Games 2025</p></details> |

Longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs) provide a uniquely powerful opportunity for the prediction. However, it is challenging to accurately model the continuous clinical progression of patients underlying the irregularly sampled clinical features and to transparently link the progression to survival outcomes. To address these challenges, we develop TrajSurv, a model that learns continuous latent trajectories from longitudinal EHR data for trustworthy survival prediction. TrajSurv employs a neural controlled differential equation (NCDE) to extract continuous-time latent states from the irregularly sampled data, forming continuous latent trajectories. To ensure the latent trajectories reflect the clinical progression, TrajSurv aligns the latent state space with patient state space through a time-aware contrastive learning approach. To transparently link clinical progression to the survival outcome, TrajSurv uses latent trajectories in a two-step divide-and-conquer interpretation process. First, it explains how the changes in clinical features translate into the latent trajectory's evolution using a learned vector field. Second, it clusters these latent trajectories to identify key clinical progression patterns associated with different survival outcomes. Evaluations on two real-world medical datasets, MIMIC-III and eICU, show TrajSurv's competitive accuracy and superior transparency over existing deep learning methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by MLHC 2025</p></details> |

Inspired by the success of decoder-only models for language modeling, we propose DONUT, a Decoder-Only Network for Unrolling Trajectories. Unlike existing encoder-decoder forecasting models, we encode historical trajectories and predict future trajectories with a single autoregressive model. This allows the model to make iterative predictions in a consistent manner, and ensures that the model is always provided with up-to-date information, thereby enhancing performance. Furthermore, inspired by multi-token prediction for language modeling, we introduce an 'overprediction' strategy that gives the model the auxiliary task of predicting trajectories at longer temporal horizons. This allows the model to better anticipate the future and further improves performance. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our decoder-only approach outperforms the encoder-decoder baseline, and achieves new state-of-the-art results on the Argoverse 2 single-agent motion forecasting benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025.

We present streaming algorithms for two such problems under the Fr\'{e}chet distance $d_F$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ for some constant $d \geq 2$. Consider a polygonal curve $\tau$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ in a stream. We present a streaming algorithm that, for any $\varepsilon\in (0,1)$ and $\delta > 0$, produces a curve $\sigma$ such that $d_F(\sigma,\tau[v_1,v_i])\le (1+\varepsilon)\delta$ and $|\sigma|\le 2\,\mathrm{opt}-2$, where $\tau[v_1,v_i]$ is the prefix in the stream so far, and $\mathrm{opt} = \min\{|\sigma'|: d_F(\sigma',\tau[v_1,v_i])\le \delta\}$. Let $\alpha = 2(d-1){\lfloor d/2 \rfloor}^2 + d$. The working storage is $O(\varepsilon^{-\alpha})$. Each vertex is processed in $O(\varepsilon^{-\alpha}\log\frac{1}{\varepsilon})$ time for $d \in \{2,3\}$ and $O(\varepsilon^{-\alpha})$ time for $d \geq 4$ . Thus, the whole $\tau$ can be simplified in $O(\varepsilon^{-\alpha}|\tau|\log\frac{1}{\varepsilon})$ time. Ignoring polynomial factors in $1/\varepsilon$, this running time is a factor $|\tau|$ faster than the best static algorithm that offers the same guarantees. We present another streaming algorithm that, for any integer $k \geq 2$ and any $\varepsilon \in (0,\frac{1}{17})$, maintains a curve $\sigma$ such that $|\sigma| \leq 2k-2$ and $d_F(\sigma,\tau[v_1,v_i])\le (1+\varepsilon) \cdot \min\{d_F(\sigma',\tau[v_1,v_i]): |\sigma'| \leq k\}$, where $\tau[v_1,v_i]$ is the prefix in the stream so far. The working storage is $O((k\varepsilon^{-1}+\varepsilon^{-(\alpha+1)})\log \frac{1}{\varepsilon})$. Each vertex is processed in $O(k\varepsilon^{-(\alpha+1)}\log^2\frac{1}{\varepsilon})$ time for $d \in \{2,3\}$ and $O(k\varepsilon^{-(\alpha+1)}\log\frac{1}{\varepsilon})$ time for $d \geq 4$.</p></details> | SoCG 2025 |

By embedding structural cues from topometric maps into the denoising process of a conditional diffusion model, the proposed approach enables trajectory generation that naturally adheres to road geometry without relying on explicit constraints. A multimodal conditioning encoder fuses LiDAR observations, historical motion, and route information into a unified bird's-eye-view (BEV) representation. Extensive experiments on the KITTI benchmark demonstrate that TopoDiffuser outperforms state-of-the-art methods, while maintaining strong geometric consistency. Ablation studies further validate the contribution of each input modality, as well as the impact of denoising steps and the number of trajectory samples.

However, the performance of MEC is restricted due to its fixed location and limited service scope. Hence, we investigate an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted MEC system, where multiple UAVs are dispatched and each UAV can simultaneously provide computing service for multiple SDs. To improve the performance of system, we formulated a UAV-based trajectory control and resource allocation multi-objective optimization problem (TCRAMOP) to simultaneously maximize the offloading number of UAVs and minimize total offloading delay and total energy consumption of UAVs by optimizing the flight paths of UAVs as well as the computing resource allocated to served SDs. Then, consider that the solution of TCRAMOP requires continuous decision-making and the system is dynamic, we propose an enhanced deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm, namely, distributed proximal policy optimization with imitation learning (DPPOIL). This algorithm incorporates the generative adversarial imitation learning technique to improve the policy performance. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed DPPOIL and prove that the learned strategy of DPPOIL is better compared with other baseline methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by IEEE GLOBECOM 2025</p></details> |
| **[OmniTraj: Pre-Training on Heterogeneous Data for Adaptive and Zero-Shot Human Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23657v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large-scale pre-training has advanced human trajectory prediction, a critical challenge remains: zero-shot transfer to unseen dataset with varying temporal dynamics. State-of-the-art pre-trained models often require fine-tuning to adapt to new datasets with different frame rates or observation horizons, limiting their scalability and practical utility. In this work, we systematically investigate this limitation and propose a robust solution. We first demonstrate that existing data-aware discrete models struggle when transferred to new scenarios with shifted temporal setups. We then isolate the temporal generalization from dataset shift, revealing that a simple, explicit conditioning mechanism for temporal metadata is a highly effective solution. Based on this insight, we present OmniTraj, a Transformer-based model pre-trained on a large-scale, heterogeneous dataset. Our experiments show that explicitly conditioning on the frame rate enables OmniTraj to achieve state-of-the-art zero-shot transfer performance, reducing prediction error by over 70\% in challenging cross-setup scenarios. After fine-tuning, OmniTraj achieves state-of-the-art results on four datasets, including NBA, JTA, WorldPose, and ETH-UCY.

| **[PatchTraj: Unified Time-Frequency Representation Learning via Dynamic Patches for Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19119v3)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pedestrian trajectory prediction is crucial for autonomous driving and robotics. While existing point-based and grid-based methods expose two main limitations: insufficiently modeling human motion dynamics, as they fail to balance local motion details with long-range spatiotemporal dependencies, and the time representations lack interaction with their frequency components in jointly modeling trajectory sequences. To address these challenges, we propose PatchTraj, a dynamic patch-based framework that integrates time-frequency joint modeling for trajectory prediction. Specifically, we decompose the trajectory into raw time sequences and frequency components, and employ dynamic patch partitioning to perform multi-scale segmentation, capturing hierarchical motion patterns. Each patch undergoes adaptive embedding with scale-aware feature extraction, followed by hierarchical feature aggregation to model both fine-grained and long-range dependencies. The outputs of the two branches are further enhanced via cross-modal attention, facilitating complementary fusion of temporal and spectral cues. The resulting enhanced embeddings exhibit strong expressive power, enabling accurate predictions even when using a vanilla Transformer architecture. Extensive experiments on ETH-UCY, SDD, NBA, and JRDB datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, on the egocentric JRDB dataset, PatchTraj attains significant relative improvements of 26.7% in ADE and 17.4% in FDE, underscoring its substantial potential in embodied intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Out-of-Distribution Detection in Medical Imaging via Diffusion Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23411v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In medical imaging, unsupervised out-of-distribution (OOD) detection offers an attractive approach for identifying pathological cases with extremely low incidence rates. In contrast to supervised methods, OOD-based approaches function without labels and are inherently robust to data imbalances. Current generative approaches often rely on likelihood estimation or reconstruction error, but these methods can be computationally expensive, unreliable, and require retraining if the inlier data changes. These limitations hinder their ability to distinguish nominal from anomalous inputs efficiently, consistently, and robustly. We propose a reconstruction-free OOD detection method that leverages the forward diffusion trajectories of a Stein score-based denoising diffusion model (SBDDM). By capturing trajectory curvature via the estimated Stein score, our approach enables accurate anomaly scoring with only five diffusion steps. A single SBDDM pre-trained on a large, semantically aligned medical dataset generalizes effectively across multiple Near-OOD and Far-OOD benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance while drastically reducing computational cost during inference. Compared to existing methods, SBDDM achieves a relative improvement of up to 10.43% and 18.10% for Near-OOD and Far-OOD detection, making it a practical building block for real-time, reliable computer-aided diagnosis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Uncertainty for Safe Utilization of Machine Learning in Medical Imaging, MICCAI 2025</p></details> |

The world model that can foresee the outcome of the trajectory has been used to evaluate the autonomous driving system. However, existing world models predominantly emphasize the trajectory of the ego vehicle and leave other vehicles uncontrollable. This limitation hinders their ability to realistically simulate the interaction between the ego vehicle and the driving scenario. In this paper, we propose a driving World Model named EOT-WM, unifying Ego-Other vehicle Trajectories in videos for driving simulation. Specifically, it remains a challenge to match multiple trajectories in the BEV space with each vehicle in the video to control the video generation. We first project ego-other vehicle trajectories in the BEV space into the image coordinate for vehicle-trajectory match via pixel positions. Then, trajectory videos are encoded by the Spatial-Temporal Variational Auto Encoder to align with driving video latents spatially and temporally in the unified visual space. A trajectory-injected diffusion Transformer is further designed to denoise the noisy video latents for video generation with the guidance of ego-other vehicle trajectories. In addition, we propose a metric based on control latent similarity to evaluate the controllability of trajectories. Extensive experiments are conducted on the nuScenes dataset, and the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 30% in FID and 55% in FVD. The model can also predict unseen driving scenes with self-produced trajectories.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |

Trajectories: Foundations and Guarantees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23280v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work establishes a crucial step toward advancing data-driven trajectory-based methods for stochastic systems with unknown mathematical dynamics. In contrast to scenario-based approaches that rely on independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) trajectories, this work develops a data-driven framework where each trajectory is gathered over a finite horizon and exhibits temporal dependence-referred to as a non-i.i.d. trajectory. To ensure safety of dynamical systems using such trajectories, the current body of literature primarily considers dynamics subject to unknown-but-bounded disturbances, which facilitates robust analysis. While promising, such bounds may be violated in practice and the resulting worst-case robust analysis tends to be overly conservative. To overcome these fundamental challenges, this paper considers stochastic systems with unknown mathematical dynamics, influenced by process noise with unknown distributions. In the proposed framework, data is collected from stochastic systems under multiple realizations within a finite-horizon experiment, where each realization generates a non-i.i.d. trajectory. Leveraging the concept of stochastic control barrier certificates constructed from data, this work quantifies probabilistic safety guarantees with a certified confidence level. To achieve this, the proposed conditions are formulated as sum-of-squares (SOS) optimization problems, relying solely on empirical average of the collected trajectories and statistical features of the process noise. The efficacy of the approach has been validated on three stochastic benchmarks with both unknown models and noise distributions. In one case study, it is shown that while no safety controller exists for the robust analysis of the system under bounded disturbances, the proposed stochastic framework offers a safety controller with guaranteed probabilistic satisfaction.</p></details> |  |

Yet, existing models often fail to fully leverage the visual cues that humans subconsciously communicate when navigating the space. In this work, we study the benefits of predicting human trajectories using human body poses instead of solely their Cartesian space locations in time. We propose `Social-pose', an attention-based pose encoder that effectively captures the poses of all humans in a scene and their social relations. Our method can be integrated into various trajectory prediction architectures. We have conducted extensive experiments on state-of-the-art models (based on LSTM, GAN, MLP, and Transformer), and showed improvements over all of them on synthetic (Joint Track Auto) and real (Human3.6M, Pedestrians and Cyclists in Road Traffic, and JRDB) datasets. We also explored the advantages of using 2D versus 3D poses, as well as the effect of noisy poses and the application of our pose-based predictor in robot navigation scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems (T-ITS)</p></details> |

Prior works addressed this by modifying model architectures, such as using hypernetworks. In contrast, we propose refining the training process to unlock each model's potential without altering its structure. We introduce Generative Active Learning for Trajectory prediction (GALTraj), the first method to successfully deploy generative active learning into trajectory prediction. It actively identifies rare tail samples where the model fails and augments these samples with a controllable diffusion model during training. In our framework, generating scenarios that are diverse, realistic, and preserve tail-case characteristics is paramount. Accordingly, we design a tail-aware generation method that applies tailored diffusion guidance to generate trajectories that both capture rare behaviors and respect traffic rules. Unlike prior simulation methods focused solely on scenario diversity, GALTraj is the first to show how simulator-driven augmentation benefits long-tail learning in trajectory prediction. Experiments on multiple trajectory datasets (WOMD, Argoverse2) with popular backbones (QCNet, MTR) confirm that our method significantly boosts performance on tail samples and also enhances accuracy on head samples.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV 2025</p></details> |

In this context, constrained diversity optimization has emerged as a powerful reinforcement learning (RL) framework to train a diverse set of agents in parallel. However, existing constrained-diversity RL methods often under-explore in complex tasks such as robotic manipulation, leading to a lack in policy diversity. To improve diversity optimization in RL, we therefore propose a curriculum that first explores at the trajectory level before learning step-based policies. In our empirical evaluation, we provide novel insights into the shortcoming of skill-based diversity optimization, and demonstrate empirically that our curriculum improves the diversity of the learned skills.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted into the Inductive Biases in Reinforcement Learning Workshop at RLC 2025</p></details> |

Although traditional polynomial-based planners offer computational efficiency and smooth trajectory generation, they require expert knowledge to tune multiple parameters to adjust this trade-off. Moreover, even with careful tuning, the resulting adjustment may fail to achieve the desired trade-off. Similarly, although reinforcement learning-based planners are adaptable in unknown environments, they do not explicitly address the safety-efficiency trade-off. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a Decision Transformer-based trajectory planner that leverages a single parameter, Return-to-Go (RTG), as a \emph{temperature parameter} to dynamically adjust the safety-efficiency trade-off. In our framework, since RTG intuitively measures the safety and efficiency of a trajectory, RTG tuning does not require expert knowledge. We validate our approach using Gazebo simulations in both structured grid and unstructured random environments. The experimental results demonstrate that our planner can dynamically adjust the safety-efficiency trade-off by simply tuning the RTG parameter. Furthermore, our planner outperforms existing baseline methods across various RTG settings, generating safer trajectories when tuned for safety and more efficient trajectories when tuned for efficiency. Real-world experiments further confirm the reliability and practicality of our proposed planner.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) 2025.

| **[Safety Evaluation of Motion Plans Using Trajectory Predictors as Forward Reachable Set Estimators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22389v1)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advent of end-to-end autonomy stacks - often lacking interpretable intermediate modules - has placed an increased burden on ensuring that the final output, i.e., the motion plan, is safe in order to validate the safety of the entire stack. This requires a safety monitor that is both complete (able to detect all unsafe plans) and sound (does not flag safe plans). In this work, we propose a principled safety monitor that leverages modern multi-modal trajectory predictors to approximate forward reachable sets (FRS) of surrounding agents. By formulating a convex program, we efficiently extract these data-driven FRSs directly from the predicted state distributions, conditioned on scene context such as lane topology and agent history. To ensure completeness, we leverage conformal prediction to calibrate the FRS and guarantee coverage of ground-truth trajectories with high probability. To preserve soundness in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios or under predictor failure, we introduce a Bayesian filter that dynamically adjusts the FRS conservativeness based on the predictor's observed performance. We then assess the safety of the ego vehicle's motion plan by checking for intersections with these calibrated FRSs, ensuring the plan remains collision-free under plausible future behaviors of others. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset show our approach significantly improves soundness while maintaining completeness, offering a practical and reliable safety monitor for learned autonomy stacks.</p></details> |  |

Leveraging the spatial information encoded in 3DGS, this work proposes FOCI (Field Overlap Collision Integral), an algorithm that is able to optimize trajectories directly on the Gaussians themselves. FOCI leverages a novel and interpretable collision formulation for 3DGS using the notion of the overlap integral between Gaussians. Contrary to other approaches, which represent the robot with conservative bounding boxes that underestimate the traversability of the environment, we propose to represent the environment and the robot as Gaussian Splats. This not only has desirable computational properties, but also allows for orientation-aware planning, allowing the robot to pass through very tight and narrow spaces. We extensively test our algorithm in both synthetic and real Gaussian Splats, showcasing that collision-free trajectories for the ANYmal legged robot that can be computed in a few seconds, even with hundreds of thousands of Gaussians making up the environment.

However, current automated methods are limited to establishing cell developmental trajectories within individual samples, necessitating biologists to manually link cells across samples to construct complete cross-sample evolutionary trajectories that consider cellular spatial dynamics. This process demands substantial human effort due to the complex spatial correspondence between each pair of samples. To address this challenge, we first proposed a GNN-based model to predict cross-sample cell developmental trajectories. We then developed TrajLens, a visual analytics system that supports biologists in exploring and refining the cell developmental trajectories based on predicted links. Specifically, we designed the visualization that integrates features on cell distribution and developmental direction across multiple samples, providing an overview of the spatial evolutionary patterns of cell populations along trajectories. Additionally, we included contour maps superimposed on the original cell distribution data, enabling biologists to explore them intuitively. To demonstrate our system's performance, we conducted quantitative evaluations of our model with two case studies and expert interviews to validate its usefulness and effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accept by IEEE VIS'25</p></details> |

Despite initial progress, these agents still face challenges when handling complex real-world tasks. These challenges arise from a lack of knowledge about real-life mobile applications in LLM-based agents, which may lead to ineffective task planning and even cause hallucinations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel LLM-based agent framework called MapAgent that leverages memory constructed from historical trajectories to augment current task planning. Specifically, we first propose a trajectory-based memory mechanism that transforms task execution trajectories into a reusable and structured page-memory database. Each page within a trajectory is extracted as a compact yet comprehensive snapshot, capturing both its UI layout and functional context. Secondly, we introduce a coarse-to-fine task planning approach that retrieves relevant pages from the memory database based on similarity and injects them into the LLM planner to compensate for potential deficiencies in understanding real-world app scenarios, thereby achieving more informed and context-aware task planning. Finally, planned tasks are transformed into executable actions through a task executor supported by a dual-LLM architecture, ensuring effective tracking of task progress. Experimental results in real-world scenarios demonstrate that MapAgent achieves superior performance to existing methods. The code will be open-sourced to support further research.</p></details> |  |
| **[RISEE: A Highly Interactive Naturalistic Driving Trajectories Dataset with Human Subjective Risk Perception and Eye-tracking Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19490v2)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the research and development (R&D) and verification and validation (V&V) phases of autonomous driving decision-making and planning systems, it is necessary to integrate human factors to achieve decision-making and evaluation that align with human cognition. However, most existing datasets primarily focus on vehicle motion states and trajectories, neglecting human-related information. In addition, current naturalistic driving datasets lack sufficient safety-critical scenarios while simulated datasets suffer from low authenticity. To address these issues, this paper constructs the Risk-Informed Subjective Evaluation and Eye-tracking (RISEE) dataset which specifically contains human subjective evaluations and eye-tracking data apart from regular naturalistic driving trajectories. By leveraging the complementary advantages of drone-based (high realism and extensive scenario coverage) and simulation-based (high safety and reproducibility) data collection methods, we first conduct drone-based traffic video recording at a highway ramp merging area. After that, the manually selected highly interactive scenarios are reconstructed in simulation software, and drivers' first-person view (FPV) videos are generated, which are then viewed and evaluated by recruited participants. During the video viewing process, participants' eye-tracking data is collected. After data processing and filtering, 3567 valid subjective risk ratings from 101 participants across 179 scenarios are retained, along with 2045 qualified eye-tracking data segments. The collected data and examples of the generated FPV videos are available in our website.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint accepted by ITSC 2025</p></details> |

Drawing on 4 million X posts over six months, we combine a user- and topic-centric approach to study how shifts in toxicity manifest as topical shifts. Our topic discovery method, which leverages instruction-based embeddings and recursive HDBSCAN, uncovers 157 fine-grained subtopics within the U.S. immigration discourse. We focus on users in four groups: (1) those with increasing toxicity, (2) those with decreasing toxicity, and two reference groups with no significant toxicity trend but matched toxicity levels. Treating each posting history as a trajectory through a five-dimensional topic space, we compare average group trajectories using permutational MANOVA. Our findings show that users with increasing toxicity drift toward alarmist, fear-based frames, whereas those with decreasing toxicity pivot toward legal and policy-focused themes. Both patterns diverge statistically significantly from their reference groups. This pipeline, which combines hierarchical topic discovery with trajectory analysis, offers a replicable method for studying dynamic conversations around social issues at scale.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the preprint of a paper accepted at ICWSM 2026</p></details> |
| **[DiffOG: Differentiable Policy Trajectory Optimization with Generalizability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13807v4)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imitation learning-based visuomotor policies excel at manipulation tasks but often produce suboptimal action trajectories compared to model-based methods. Directly mapping camera data to actions via neural networks can result in jerky motions and difficulties in meeting critical constraints, compromising safety and robustness in real-world deployment. For tasks that require high robustness or strict adherence to constraints, ensuring trajectory quality is crucial. However, the lack of interpretability in neural networks makes it challenging to generate constraint-compliant actions in a controlled manner. This paper introduces differentiable policy trajectory optimization with generalizability (DiffOG), a learning-based trajectory optimization framework designed to enhance visuomotor policies. By leveraging the proposed differentiable formulation of trajectory optimization with transformer, DiffOG seamlessly integrates policies with a generalizable optimization layer. DiffOG refines action trajectories to be smoother and more constraint-compliant while maintaining alignment with the original demonstration distribution, thus avoiding degradation in policy performance. We evaluated DiffOG across 11 simulated tasks and 2 real-world tasks. The results demonstrate that DiffOG significantly enhances the trajectory quality of visuomotor policies while having minimal impact on policy performance, outperforming trajectory processing baselines such as greedy constraint clipping and penalty-based trajectory optimization. Furthermore, DiffOG achieves superior performance compared to existing constrained visuomotor policy.

Current approaches rely on flat apertures, which limit trajectory flexibility due to inherent geometric constraints. To overcome such restrictions, we propose adopting curved apertures as a more versatile alternative for beam shaping. We introduce a novel formulation for wave trajectory engineering compatible with arbitrarily shaped apertures. Theoretical and numerical analyses demonstrate that curved apertures offer improved control over wave propagation, are more resilient to phase control constraints, and achieve higher power density across a wider portion of the desired beam trajectory than flat apertures.</p></details> |  |

Upon this, trajectory-controllable video generation has emerged to enable precise object motion control through explicitly defined spatial paths. However, existing methods struggle with complex object movements and multi-object motion control, resulting in imprecise trajectory adherence, poor object consistency, and compromised visual quality. Furthermore, these methods only support trajectory control in a single format, limiting their applicability in diverse scenarios. Additionally, there is no publicly available dataset or benchmark specifically tailored for trajectory-controllable video generation, hindering robust training and systematic evaluation. To address these challenges, we introduce MagicMotion, a novel image-to-video generation framework that enables trajectory control through three levels of conditions from dense to sparse: masks, bounding boxes, and sparse boxes. Given an input image and trajectories, MagicMotion seamlessly animates objects along defined trajectories while maintaining object consistency and visual quality. Furthermore, we present MagicData, a large-scale trajectory-controlled video dataset, along with an automated pipeline for annotation and filtering. We also introduce MagicBench, a comprehensive benchmark that assesses both video quality and trajectory control accuracy across different numbers of objects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MagicMotion outperforms previous methods across various metrics.

While existing W2SG studies focus on simple tasks like binary classification, we extend this paradigm to complex interactive decision-making environments. Specifically, we fine-tune a strong model with trajectories of intermediate actions generated by a weak model. Motivated by the human learning process, we propose to generalize not only success knowledge but also failure experience so that the strong model can learn from failed trajectories accumulated by weak models. To effectively and efficiently elicit the potential of strong agents, we further construct ``trajectory trees," a hierarchical representation that organizes weak model-generated action trajectories, coupled with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to optimize the strong model. Through theoretical analysis, we provide formal guarantees for the effectiveness of our method in improving W2SG performance. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate substantial improvements in reasoning and decision-making capabilities across diverse task domains, validating the scalability and robustness of our proposed framework.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a novel framework for wafer defect root cause analysis, called Partial Trajectory Regression (PTR). The proposed framework is carefully designed to address the limitations of conventional vector-based regression models, particularly in handling variable-length processing routes that span a large number of heterogeneous physical processes. To compute the attribution score of each process given a detected high defect density on a specific wafer, we propose a new algorithm that compares two counterfactual outcomes derived from partial process trajectories. This is enabled by new representation learning methods, proc2vec and route2vec.

While the lack of exact latent inversion is a core advantage of these methods, it often results in unstable editing trajectories and poor source consistency. To address this limitation, we propose {\em FlowAlign}, a novel inversion-free flow-based framework for consistent image editing with optimal control-based trajectory control. Specifically, FlowAlign introduces source similarity at the terminal point as a regularization term to promote smoother and more consistent trajectories during the editing process. Notably, our terminal point regularization is shown to explicitly balance semantic alignment with the edit prompt and structural consistency with the source image along the trajectory. Furthermore, FlowAlign naturally supports reverse editing by simply reversing the ODE trajectory, highliting the reversible and consistent nature of the transformation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlowAlign outperforms existing methods in both source preservation and editing controllability.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods are hampered by the sparse rewards given the underlying Markov Decision Process. This inefficiency limits the exploration of the vast symbolic search space and destabilizes the training process. To address this, Trajectory-level Reward Shaping (TLRS), a novel reward shaping method, is proposed. TLRS provides dense, intermediate rewards by measuring the subsequence-level similarity between partially generated expressions and a set of expert-designed formulas. Furthermore, a reward centering mechanism is introduced to reduce training variance. Extensive experiments on six major Chinese and U.S. stock indices show that TLRS significantly improves the predictive power of mined factors, boosting the Rank Information Coefficient by 9.29% over existing potential-based shaping algorithms. Notably, TLRS achieves a major leap in computational efficiency by reducing its time complexity with respect to the feature dimension from linear to constant, which is a significant improvement over distance-based baselines.</p></details> |  |

However, current deep learning models often lack trustworthiness as their predictions can be physically infeasible and illogical to humans. To make predictions more trustworthy, recent research has incorporated prior knowledge, like the social force model for modeling interactions and kinematic models for physical realism. However, these approaches focus on priors that suit either vehicles or pedestrians and do not generalize to traffic with mixed agent classes. We propose incorporating interaction and kinematic priors of all agent classes--vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists with class-specific interaction layers to capture agent behavioral differences. To improve the interpretability of the agent interactions, we introduce DG-SFM, a rule-based interaction importance score that guides the interaction layer. To ensure physically feasible predictions, we proposed suitable kinematic models for all agent classes with a novel pedestrian kinematic model. We benchmark our approach on the Argoverse 2 dataset, using the state-of-the-art transformer HPTR as our baseline. Experiments demonstrate that our method improves interaction interpretability, revealing a correlation between incorrect predictions and divergence from our interaction prior. Even though incorporating the kinematic models causes a slight decrease in accuracy, they eliminate infeasible trajectories found in the dataset and the baseline model. Thus, our approach fosters trust in trajectory prediction as its interaction reasoning is interpretable, and its predictions adhere to physics.</p></details> | <details><summary>First...</summary><p>First and Second authors contributed equally; Accepted in the 36th IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV 2025) for oral presentation; Winner of the best paper award</p></details> |

However, uncertainties introduced by inherent driving behaviors -- such as acceleration, deceleration, and left and right maneuvers -- pose significant challenges for reliable trajectory prediction. We introduce a Maneuver-Intention-Aware Transformer (MIAT) architecture, which integrates a maneuver intention awareness control mechanism with spatiotemporal interaction modeling to enhance long-horizon trajectory predictions. We systematically investigate the impact of varying awareness of maneuver intention on both short- and long-horizon trajectory predictions. Evaluated on the real-world NGSIM dataset and benchmarked against various transformer- and LSTM-based methods, our approach achieves an improvement of up to 4.7% in short-horizon predictions and a 1.6% in long-horizon predictions compared to other intention-aware benchmark methods. Moreover, by leveraging intention awareness control mechanism, MIAT realizes an 11.1% performance boost in long-horizon predictions, with a modest drop in short-horizon performance.

In this paper, we present a novel hybrid approach that integrates learning-based with physics-based constraints to address the multi-modality inherent in trajectory prediction. Our method employs a variational Bayesian mixture model to effectively capture the diverse range of potential future behaviors, moving beyond traditional unimodal assumptions. Unlike prior approaches that predominantly treat trajectory prediction as a data-driven regression task, our framework incorporates physical realism through sector-specific boundary conditions and Model Predictive Control (MPC)-based smoothing. These constraints ensure that predicted trajectories are not only data-consistent but also physically plausible, adhering to kinematic and dynamic principles. Furthermore, our method produces interpretable and diverse trajectory predictions, enabling enhanced downstream decision-making and planning in autonomous driving systems. We evaluate our approach on two benchmark datasets, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods. Comprehensive ablation studies validate the contributions of each component and highlight their synergistic impact on prediction accuracy and reliability. By balancing data-driven insights with physics-informed constraints, our approach offers a robust and scalable solution for navigating the uncertainties of real-world urban environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[R-Stitch: Dynamic Trajectory Stitching for Efficient Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17307v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning enhances the problem-solving capabilities of large language models by encouraging step-by-step intermediate reasoning during inference. While effective, CoT introduces substantial computational overhead due to its reliance on autoregressive decoding over long token sequences. Existing acceleration strategies either reduce sequence length through early stopping or compressive reward designs, or improve decoding speed via speculative decoding with smaller models. However, speculative decoding suffers from limited speedup when the agreement between small and large models is low, and fails to exploit the potential advantages of small models in producing concise intermediate reasoning. In this paper, we present R-Stitch, a token-level, confidence-based hybrid decoding framework that accelerates CoT inference by switching between a small language model (SLM) and a large language model (LLM) along the reasoning trajectory. R-Stitch uses the SLM to generate tokens by default and delegates to the LLM only when the SLM's confidence falls below a threshold. This design avoids full-sequence rollback and selectively invokes the LLM on uncertain steps, preserving both efficiency and answer quality. R-Stitch is model-agnostic, training-free, and compatible with standard decoding pipelines.

However, the reliability of these online-generated maps remains uncertain. While incorporating map uncertainty into downstream trajectory prediction tasks has shown potential for performance improvements, current strategies provide limited insights into the specific scenarios where this uncertainty is beneficial. In this work, we first analyze the driving scenarios in which mapping uncertainty has the greatest positive impact on trajectory prediction and identify a critical, previously overlooked factor: the agent's kinematic state. Building on these insights, we propose a novel Proprioceptive Scenario Gating that adaptively integrates map uncertainty into trajectory prediction based on forecasts of the ego vehicle's future kinematics. This lightweight, self-supervised approach enhances the synergy between online mapping and trajectory prediction, providing interpretability around where uncertainty is advantageous and outperforming previous integration methods. Additionally, we introduce a Covariance-based Map Uncertainty approach that better aligns with map geometry, further improving trajectory prediction. Extensive ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of our approach, achieving up to 23.6% improvement in mapless trajectory prediction performance over the state-of-the-art method using the real-world nuScenes driving dataset.

During the flight phases, where the ground reaction forces are not available for regulation, the limb swinging trajectories are significant for the stability of the next stance phase. Due to the conservation of angular momentum, improper leg and arm swinging results in highly tilted and unsustainable body configurations at the next stance phase landing. In such cases, the robotic system fails to maintain locomotion independent of the stability of the center of mass trajectories. This problem is more apparent for fast and high flight time trajectories. This paper proposes a real-time nonlinear limb trajectory optimization problem for humanoid running. The optimization problem is tested on two different humanoid robot models, and the generated trajectories are verified using a running algorithm for both robots in a simulation environment.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication at the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), Atlanta 2025.

Especially predicting the future states of other traffic participants imposes a non-trivial challenge. Current SotA-models already show promising results when trained on real datasets (e.g. Argoverse2, NuScenes). Problems arise when these models are deployed to new/unseen areas. Typically, performance drops significantly, indicating that the models lack generalization. In this work, we introduce a new Graph Neural Network (GNN) that utilizes a heterogeneous graph consisting of traffic participants and vectorized road network. Latter, is used to classify goals, i.e. endpoints of the predicted trajectories, in a multi-staged approach, leading to a better generalization to unseen scenarios. We show the effectiveness of the goal selection process via cross-dataset evaluation, i.e. training on Argoverse2 and evaluating on NuScenes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted on IEEE ITSC 2025</p></details> |
| **[In-Trajectory Inverse Reinforcement Learning: Learn Incrementally Before An Ongoing Trajectory Terminates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15612v7)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) aims to learn a reward function and a corresponding policy that best fit the demonstrated trajectories of an expert. However, current IRL works cannot learn incrementally from an ongoing trajectory because they have to wait to collect at least one complete trajectory to learn. To bridge the gap, this paper considers the problem of learning a reward function and a corresponding policy while observing the initial state-action pair of an ongoing trajectory and keeping updating the learned reward and policy when new state-action pairs of the ongoing trajectory are observed. We formulate this problem as an online bi-level optimization problem where the upper level dynamically adjusts the learned reward according to the newly observed state-action pairs with the help of a meta-regularization term, and the lower level learns the corresponding policy. We propose a novel algorithm to solve this problem and guarantee that the algorithm achieves sub-linear local regret $O(\sqrt{T}+\log T+\sqrt{T}\log T)$. If the reward function is linear, we prove that the proposed algorithm achieves sub-linear regret $O(\log T)$. Experiments are used to validate the proposed algorithm.</p></details> |  |

By explicitly conditioning on surrounding vehicles and road geometry, Ctx2TrajGen generates interaction-aware trajectories aligned with real-world context.

In order to ensure that construction robots can perform tasks efficiently and accurately in complex construction environments, traditional single-objective trajectory optimization methods are difficult to meet the complex requirements of the changing construction environment. Therefore, we propose a multi-objective trajectory optimization for the robotic arm used in the curtain wall installation. First, we design a robotic arm for curtain wall installation, integrating serial, parallel, and folding arm elements, while considering its physical properties and motion characteristics. In addition, this paper proposes an NSGA-III-FO algorithm (NSGA-III with Focused Operator, NSGA-III-FO) that incorporates a focus operator screening mechanism to accelerate the convergence of the algorithm towards the Pareto front, thereby effectively balancing the multi-objective constraints of construction robots. The proposed algorithm is tested against NSGA-III, MOEA/D, and MSOPS-II in ten consecutive trials on the DTLZ3 and WFG3 test functions, showing significantly better convergence efficiency than the other algorithms. Finally, we conduct two sets of experiments on the designed robotic arm platform, which confirm the efficiency and practicality of the NSGA-III-FO algorithm in solving multi-objective trajectory planning problems for curtain wall installation tasks.</p></details> |  |

To tackle this challenge, our study innovatively draws inspiration from the mechanics of human upper limb movements during weight lifting, proposing a bio-inspired trajectory planning framework that incorporates human energy conversion principles. By collecting motion trajectories and electromyography (EMG) signals during dumbbell curls, we construct an anthropomorphic trajectory planning that integrates human force exertion patterns and energy consumption patterns. Utilizing the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm, we achieve dynamic load distribution for robotic arm trajectory planning based on human-like movement features. In practical application, these bio-inspired movement characteristics are applied to curtain wall installation tasks, validating the correctness and superiority of our trajectory planning method. Simulation results demonstrate a 48.4% reduction in energy consumption through intelligent conversion between kinetic and potential energy. This approach provides new insights and theoretical support for optimizing energy use in curtain wall installation robots during actual handling tasks.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose the GFM-Planner, a perception-aware trajectory planning framework based on the geometric feature metric, which enhances LiDAR localization accuracy by guiding the robot to avoid degraded areas. First, we derive the Geometric Feature Metric (GFM) from the fundamental LiDAR localization problem. Next, we design a 2D grid-based Metric Encoding Map (MEM) to efficiently store GFM values across the environment. A constant-time decoding algorithm is further proposed to retrieve GFM values for arbitrary poses from the MEM. Finally, we develop a perception-aware trajectory planning algorithm that improves LiDAR localization capabilities by guiding the robot in selecting trajectories through feature-rich areas. Both simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that our approach enables the robot to actively select trajectories that significantly enhance LiDAR localization accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IROS 2025</p></details> |

The model applies the Adaboost algorithm to divide multiple weak learners, and each submodel utilizes CNN to extract spatial features, LSTM to capture temporal features, and attention mechanism to capture global features comprehensively. The strong learner model, combined with multiple sub-models, then optimizes the hyperparameters of the prediction model through the natural selection behavior pattern simulated by SO. In this study, based on the real ADS-B data from Xi'an to Tianjin, the comparison experiments and ablation studies of multiple optimizers are carried out, and a comprehensive test and evaluation analysis is carried out. The results show that SO-CLA-adaboost outperforms traditional optimizers such as particle swarm, whale, and gray wolf in handling large-scale high-dimensional trajectory data. In addition, introducing the full-strategy collaborative improvement SO algorithm improves the model's prediction accuracy by 39.89%.</p></details> | in Chinese language |
| **[Generalized Consistency Trajectory Models for Image Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12510v4)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models (DMs) excel in unconditional generation, as well as on applications such as image editing and restoration. The success of DMs lies in the iterative nature of diffusion: diffusion breaks down the complex process of mapping noise to data into a sequence of simple denoising tasks. Moreover, we are able to exert fine-grained control over the generation process by injecting guidance terms into each denoising step. However, the iterative process is also computationally intensive, often taking from tens up to thousands of function evaluations. Although consistency trajectory models (CTMs) enable traversal between any time points along the probability flow ODE (PFODE) and score inference with a single function evaluation, CTMs only allow translation from Gaussian noise to data. This work aims to unlock the full potential of CTMs by proposing generalized CTMs (GCTMs), which translate between arbitrary distributions via ODEs. We discuss the design space of GCTMs and demonstrate their efficacy in various image manipulation tasks such as image-to-image translation, restoration, and editing.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 (poster) |

Here, we propose a researcher population pyramids framework for tracking global demographic and gender trajectories using publication data. This framework provides a timely snapshot of historical and present demographics and gender balance, revealing three contrasting research systems: Emerging systems (e.g., Arab countries) exhibit high researcher inflows with widening gender gaps in cumulative productivity; Mature systems (e.g., the United States) show modest inflows with narrowing gender gaps; and Rigid systems (e.g., Japan) lag in both. Furthermore, by simulating future scenarios, the framework makes potential trajectories visible. If 2023 demographic patterns persist, Arab countries' systems could resemble mature or even rigid ones by 2050. Our framework provides a robust diagnostic tool for policymakers worldwide to foster sustainable talent pipelines and gender equality in academia.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 5 figures, 1 table, and SI</p></details> |

Functional connectivity can be represented by correlation matrices computed over time, where each matrix captures the Pearson correlation between the mean fMRI signals of different regions within a sliding window. We introduce several Log-Euclidean Riemannian framework for constructing smooth approximations of functional brain connectivity trajectories. Representing dynamic functional connectivity as time series of full-rank correlation matrices, we leverage recent theoretical Log-Euclidean diffeomorphisms to map these trajectories in practice into Euclidean spaces where polynomial regression becomes feasible. Pulling back the regressed curve ensures that each estimated point remains a valid correlation matrix, enabling a smooth, interpretable, and geometrically consistent approximation of the original brain connectivity dynamics. Experiments on fMRI-derived connectivity trajectories demonstrate the geometric consistency and computational efficiency of our approach.</p></details> |  |

Due to the restrictions on sensing capabilities in the underwater scenario, the AUV is limited to collecting only bearing measurements to the target. A framework called GBT is proposed with integration of online learning and planning. First, a Gaussian process learning method is proposed for the AUV to handle unknown target motion, wherein pseudo linear transformation of bearing measurements is introduced to address nonlinearity of bearings. A probabilistic bearing-data-dependent bound on tracking error is then rigorously established. Based on it, optimal desired bearings that can reduce tracking uncertainty are obtained analytically. Finally, the trajectory optimization problem is formulated and transformed into an easily solved one with parametric transformation. Numerical examples and comparison with existing methods verify the feasibility and superior performance of our proposed framework.</p></details> |  |

Chest X-rays (CXRs) are a vital diagnostic tool, providing insights into clinical trajectories, but their irregular acquisition limits their utility. Existing tools for CXR interpretation are constrained by cross-sectional analysis, failing to capture temporal dynamics. To address this, we introduce CXR-TFT, a novel multi-modal framework that integrates temporally sparse CXR imaging and radiology reports with high-frequency clinical data, such as vital signs, laboratory values, and respiratory flow sheets, to predict the trajectory of CXR findings in critically ill patients. CXR-TFT leverages latent embeddings from a vision encoder that are temporally aligned with hourly clinical data through interpolation. A transformer model is then trained to predict CXR embeddings at each hour, conditioned on previous embeddings and clinical measurements. In a retrospective study of 20,000 ICU patients, CXR-TFT demonstrated high accuracy in forecasting abnormal CXR findings up to 12 hours before they became radiographically evident. This predictive capability in clinical data holds significant potential for enhancing the management of time-sensitive conditions like acute respiratory distress syndrome, where early intervention is crucial and diagnoses are often delayed. By providing distinctive temporal resolution in prognostic CXR analysis, CXR-TFT offers actionable 'whole patient' insights that can directly improve clinical outcomes.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Re...</summary><p>In Review for MICCAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Consistency Trajectory Matching for One-Step Generative Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20349v4)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current diffusion-based super-resolution (SR) approaches achieve commendable performance at the cost of high inference overhead. Therefore, distillation techniques are utilized to accelerate the multi-step teacher model into one-step student model. Nevertheless, these methods significantly raise training costs and constrain the performance of the student model by the teacher model. To overcome these tough challenges, we propose Consistency Trajectory Matching for Super-Resolution (CTMSR), a distillation-free strategy that is able to generate photo-realistic SR results in one step. Concretely, we first formulate a Probability Flow Ordinary Differential Equation (PF-ODE) trajectory to establish a deterministic mapping from low-resolution (LR) images with noise to high-resolution (HR) images. Then we apply the Consistency Training (CT) strategy to directly learn the mapping in one step, eliminating the necessity of pre-trained diffusion model. To further enhance the performance and better leverage the ground-truth during the training process, we aim to align the distribution of SR results more closely with that of the natural images. To this end, we propose to minimize the discrepancy between their respective PF-ODE trajectories from the LR image distribution by our meticulously designed Distribution Trajectory Matching (DTM) loss, resulting in improved realism of our recovered HR images. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods can attain comparable or even superior capabilities on both synthetic and real datasets while maintaining minimal inference latency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |

Traditional Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) methods, while effective for offline planning, often struggle with premature convergence and latency in real-time scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose PE-PSO, an enhanced PSO-based online trajectory planner. The method introduces a persistent exploration mechanism to preserve swarm diversity and an entropy-based parameter adjustment strategy to dynamically adapt optimization behavior. UAV trajectories are modeled using B-spline curves, which ensure path smoothness while reducing optimization complexity. To extend this capability to UAV swarms, we develop a multi-agent framework that combines genetic algorithm (GA)-based task allocation with distributed PE-PSO, supporting scalable and coordinated trajectory generation. The distributed architecture allows for parallel computation and decentralized control, enabling effective cooperation among agents while maintaining real-time performance. Comprehensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms conventional PSO and other swarm-based planners across several metrics, including trajectory quality, energy efficiency, obstacle avoidance, and computation time. These results confirm the effectiveness and applicability of PE-PSO in real-time multi-UAV operations under complex environmental conditions.</p></details> | 8 papers,7 figures |

Real-world scenarios frequently present challenges such as occlusions and incomplete scene observations, which can compromise predictive accuracy. Thus, traditional video-based methods often struggle due to limited temporal and spatial perspectives. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative. Having been trained on a large text corpus describing human behaviors, LLMs likely encode plausible sequences of human actions in a home environment. However, LLMs, trained primarily on text data, lack inherent spatial awareness and real-time environmental perception. They struggle with understanding physical constraints and spatial geometry. Therefore, to be effective in a real-world spatial scenario, we propose a multimodal prediction framework that enhances LLM-based action prediction by integrating physical constraints derived from human trajectories. Our experiments demonstrate that combining LLM predictions with trajectory data significantly improves overall prediction performance. This enhancement is particularly notable in situations where the LLM receives limited scene information, highlighting the complementary nature of linguistic knowledge and physical constraints in understanding and anticipating human behavior.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IROS 2025</p></details> |

By analyzing user-generated trajectories, we identify key human behavioral features and incorporate them in a controller that mimics these behaviors. The performance of this human-inspired controller is evaluated against a baseline optimal-control-based agent, demonstrating the importance of specific control features for achieving human-like interaction.

| **[STF: Spatial Temporal Fusion for Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18149v2)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is a challenging task that aims to predict the future trajectory of vehicles or pedestrians over a short time horizon based on their historical positions. The main reason is that the trajectory is a kind of complex data, including spatial and temporal information, which is crucial for accurate prediction. Intuitively, the more information the model can capture, the more precise the future trajectory can be predicted. However, previous works based on deep learning methods processed spatial and temporal information separately, leading to inadequate spatial information capture, which means they failed to capture the complete spatial information. Therefore, it is of significance to capture information more fully and effectively on vehicle interactions. In this study, we introduced an integrated 3D graph that incorporates both spatial and temporal edges. Based on this, we proposed the integrated 3D graph, which considers the cross-time interaction information. In specific, we design a Spatial-Temporal Fusion (STF) model including Multi-layer perceptions (MLP) and Graph Attention (GAT) to capture the spatial and temporal information historical trajectories simultaneously on the 3D graph. Our experiment on the ApolloScape Trajectory Datasets shows that the proposed STF outperforms several baseline methods, especially on the long-time-horizon trajectory prediction.</p></details> | 6 pages, 6 figures |

However, existing trajectory optimization methods show weakness when dealing with large-scale long trajectories. Recent advances in parallel computing have accelerated optimization in some fields, but how to efficiently solve trajectory optimization via parallelism remains an open question. In this paper, we propose a novel trajectory optimization framework based on the Consensus Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (CADMM) algorithm, which decomposes the trajectory into multiple segments and solves the subproblems in parallel. The proposed framework reduces the time complexity to O(1) per iteration to the number of segments, compared to O(N) of the state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches. Furthermore, we introduce a closed-form solution that integrates convex linear and quadratic constraints to speed up the optimization, and we also present numerical solutions for general inequality constraints. A series of simulations and experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms the SOTA approach in terms of efficiency and smoothness. Especially for a large-scale trajectory, with one hundred segments, achieving over a tenfold speedup. To fully explore the potential of our algorithm on modern parallel computing architectures, we deploy our framework on a GPU and show high performance with thousands of segments.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, submitted to RA-L</p></details> |
| **[Reinforced Imitative Trajectory Planning for Urban Automated Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15607v2)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) faces challenges in trajectory planning for urban automated driving due to the poor convergence of RL and the difficulty in designing reward functions. Consequently, few RL-based trajectory planning methods can achieve performance comparable to that of imitation learning-based methods. The convergence problem is alleviated by combining RL with supervised learning. However, most existing approaches only reason one step ahead and lack the capability to plan for multiple future steps. Besides, although inverse reinforcement learning holds promise for solving the reward function design issue, existing methods for automated driving impose a linear structure assumption on reward functions, making them difficult to apply to urban automated driving. In light of these challenges, this paper proposes a novel RL-based trajectory planning method that integrates RL with imitation learning to enable multi-step planning. Furthermore, a transformer-based Bayesian reward function is developed, providing effective reward signals for RL in urban scenarios. Moreover, a hybrid-driven trajectory planning framework is proposed to enhance safety and interpretability. The proposed methods were validated on the large-scale real-world urban automated driving nuPlan dataset. Evaluated using closed-loop metrics, the results demonstrated that the proposed method significantly outperformed the baseline employing the identical policy model structure and achieved competitive performance compared to the state-of-the-art method.

| **[InSyn: Modeling Complex Interactions for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13397v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate pedestrian trajectory prediction is crucial for intelligent applications, yet it remains highly challenging due to the complexity of interactions among pedestrians. Previous methods have primarily relied on relative positions to model pedestrian interactions; however, they tend to overlook specific interaction patterns such as paired walking or conflicting behaviors, limiting the prediction accuracy in crowded scenarios. To address this issue, we propose InSyn (Interaction-Synchronization Network), a novel Transformer-based model that explicitly captures diverse interaction patterns (e.g., walking in sync or conflicting) while effectively modeling direction-sensitive social behaviors. Additionally, we introduce a training strategy termed Seq-Start of Seq (SSOS), designed to alleviate the common issue of initial-step divergence in numerical time-series prediction. Experiments on the ETH and UCY datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms recent baselines significantly, especially in high-density scenarios. Furthermore, the SSOS strategy proves effective in improving sequential prediction performance, reducing the initial-step prediction error by approximately 6.58%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fast and Scalable Game-Theoretic Trajectory Planning with Intentional Uncertainties](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12174v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory planning involving multi-agent interactions has been a long-standing challenge in the field of robotics, primarily burdened by the inherent yet intricate interactions among agents. While game-theoretic methods are widely acknowledged for their effectiveness in managing multi-agent interactions, significant impediments persist when it comes to accommodating the intentional uncertainties of agents. In the context of intentional uncertainties, the heavy computational burdens associated with existing game-theoretic methods are induced, leading to inefficiencies and poor scalability. In this paper, we propose a novel game-theoretic interactive trajectory planning method to effectively address the intentional uncertainties of agents, and it demonstrates both high efficiency and enhanced scalability. As the underpinning basis, we model the interactions between agents under intentional uncertainties as a general Bayesian game, and we show that its agent-form equivalence can be represented as a potential game under certain minor assumptions. The existence and attainability of the optimal interactive trajectories are illustrated, as the corresponding Bayesian Nash equilibrium can be attained by optimizing a unified optimization problem. Additionally, we present a distributed algorithm based on the dual consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) tailored to the parallel solving of the problem, thereby significantly improving the scalability. The attendant outcomes from simulations and experiments demonstrate that the proposed method is effective across a range of scenarios characterized by general forms of intentional uncertainties. Its scalability surpasses that of existing centralized and decentralized baselines, allowing for real-time interactive trajectory planning in uncertain game settings.</p></details> |  |

In contrast to most existing data-driven approaches that directly predict future trajectories, we rethink this task from a planning perspective, advocating a "First Reasoning, Then Forecasting" strategy that explicitly incorporates behavior intentions as spatial guidance for trajectory prediction. To achieve this, we introduce an interpretable, reward-driven intention reasoner grounded in a novel query-centric Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) scheme. Our method first encodes traffic agents and scene elements into a unified vectorized representation, then aggregates contextual features through a query-centric paradigm. This enables the derivation of a reward distribution, a compact yet informative representation of the target agent's behavior within the given scene context via IRL. Guided by this reward heuristic, we perform policy rollouts to reason about multiple plausible intentions, providing valuable priors for subsequent trajectory generation. Finally, we develop a hierarchical DETR-like decoder integrated with bidirectional selective state space models to produce accurate future trajectories along with their associated probabilities. Extensive experiments on the large-scale Argoverse and nuScenes motion forecasting datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances trajectory prediction confidence, achieving highly competitive performance relative to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[Schrödinger Bridge Consistency Trajectory Models for Speech Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11925v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speech enhancement (SE) utilizing diffusion models is a promising technology that improves speech quality in noisy speech data. Furthermore, the Schr\"odinger bridge (SB) has recently been used in diffusion-based SE to improve speech quality by resolving a mismatch between the endpoint of the forward process and the starting point of the reverse process. However, the SB still exhibits slow inference owing to the necessity of a large number of function evaluations (NFE) for inference to obtain high-quality results. While Consistency Models (CMs) address this issue by employing consistency training that uses distillation from pretrained models in the field of image generation, it does not improve generation quality when the number of steps increases. As a solution to this problem, Consistency Trajectory Models (CTMs) not only accelerate inference speed but also maintain a favorable trade-off between quality and speed. Furthermore, SoundCTM demonstrates the applicability of CTM techniques to the field of sound generation. In this paper, we present Schr\"odinger bridge Consistency Trajectory Models (SBCTM) by applying the CTM's technique to the Schr\"odinger bridge for SE. Additionally, we introduce a novel auxiliary loss, including a perceptual loss, into the original CTM's training framework. As a result, SBCTM achieves an approximately 16x improvement in the real-time factor (RTF) compared to the conventional Schr\"odinger bridge for SE. Furthermore, the favorable trade-off between quality and speed in SBCTM allows for time-efficient inference by limiting multi-step refinement to cases where 1-step inference is insufficient.

| **[Predicting Delayed Trajectories Using Network Features: A Study on the Dutch Railway Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11776v1)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Dutch railway network is one of the busiest in the world, with delays being a prominent concern for the principal passenger railway operator NS. This research addresses a gap in delay prediction studies within the Dutch railway network by employing an XGBoost Classifier with a focus on topological features. Current research predominantly emphasizes short-term predictions and neglects the broader network-wide patterns essential for mitigating ripple effects. This research implements and improves an existing methodology, originally designed to forecast the evolution of the fast-changing US air network, to predict delays in the Dutch Railways. By integrating Node Centrality Measures and comparing multiple classifiers like RandomForest, DecisionTree, GradientBoosting, AdaBoost, and LogisticRegression, the goal is to predict delayed trajectories. However, the results reveal limited performance, especially in non-simultaneous testing scenarios, suggesting the necessity for more context-specific adaptations. Regardless, this research contributes to the understanding of transportation network evaluation and proposes future directions for developing more robust predictive models for delays.</p></details> |  |
| **[LF: Online Multi-Robot Path Planning Meets Optimal Trajectory Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11464v1)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a multi-robot control paradigm to solve point-to-point navigation tasks for a team of holonomic robots with access to the full environment information. The framework invokes two processes asynchronously at high frequency: (i) a centralized, discrete, and full-horizon planner for computing collision- and deadlock-free paths rapidly, leveraging recent advances in multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF), and (ii) dynamics-aware, robot-wise optimal trajectory controllers that ensure all robots independently follow their assigned paths reliably. This hierarchical shift in planning representation from (i) discrete and coupled to (ii) continuous and decoupled domains enables the framework to maintain long-term scalable motion synthesis. As an instantiation of this idea, we present LF, which combines a fast state-of-the-art MAPF solver (LaCAM), and a robust feedback control stack (Freyja) for executing agile robot maneuvers. LF provides a robust and versatile mechanism for lifelong multi-robot navigation even under asynchronous and partial goal updates, and adapts to dynamic workspaces simply by quick replanning. We present various multirotor and ground robot demonstrations, including the deployment of 15 real multirotors with random, consecutive target updates while a person walks through the operational workspace.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages; under review for IEEE Robotics & Automation - Letters (RA-L)</p></details> |

While many imputation methods have been proposed for spatiotemporal data, they are not well-suited for multi-agent sports scenarios where player movements are highly dynamic and inter-agent interactions continuously evolve. To address these challenges, we propose MIDAS (Multi-agent Imputer with Derivative-Accumulating Self-ensemble), a framework that imputes multi-agent trajectories with high accuracy and physical plausibility. It jointly predicts positions, velocities, and accelerations through a Set Transformer-based neural network and generates alternative estimates by recursively accumulating predicted velocity and acceleration values. These predictions are then combined using a learnable weighted ensemble to produce final imputed trajectories. Experiments on three sports datasets demonstrate that MIDAS significantly outperforms existing baselines in both positional accuracy and physical plausibility. Lastly, we showcase use cases of MIDAS, such as approximating total distance and pass success probability, to highlight its applicability to practical downstream tasks that require complete tracking data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ECML/PKDD 2025</p></details> |

However, expert-provided instructions are limited in quantity, while synthesized annotations often lack quality, making them insufficient for large-scale research. To address this, we propose NavComposer, a novel framework for automatically generating high-quality navigation instructions. NavComposer explicitly decomposes semantic entities such as actions, scenes, and objects, and recomposes them into natural language instructions. Its modular architecture allows flexible integration of state-of-the-art techniques, while the explicit use of semantic entities enhances both the richness and accuracy of instructions. Moreover, it operates in a data-agnostic manner, supporting adaptation to diverse navigation trajectories without domain-specific training. Complementing NavComposer, we introduce NavInstrCritic, a comprehensive annotation-free evaluation system that assesses navigation instructions on three dimensions: contrastive matching, semantic consistency, and linguistic diversity. NavInstrCritic provides a holistic evaluation of instruction quality, addressing limitations of traditional metrics that rely heavily on expert annotations. By decoupling instruction generation and evaluation from specific navigation agents, our method enables more scalable and generalizable research. Extensive experiments provide direct and practical evidence for the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> |  |

While existing methods primarily focus on modeling observed motion patterns and interactions with other vehicles, they often neglect the potential risks posed by the uncertain or aggressive behaviors of surrounding vehicles. In this paper, we propose a novel spatial-temporal risk-attentive trajectory prediction framework that incorporates a risk potential field to assess perceived risks arising from behaviors of nearby vehicles. The framework leverages a spatial-temporal encoder and a risk-attentive feature fusion decoder to embed the risk potential field into the extracted spatial-temporal feature representations for trajectory prediction. A risk-scaled loss function is further designed to improve the prediction accuracy of high-risk scenarios, such as short relative spacing. Experiments on the widely used NGSIM and HighD datasets demonstrate that our method reduces average prediction errors by 4.8% and 31.2% respectively compared to state-of-the-art approaches, especially in high-risk scenarios. The proposed framework provides interpretable, risk-aware predictions, contributing to more robust decision-making for autonomous driving systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, accepted at ITSC 2025</p></details> |
| **[Learning Flexible Forward Trajectories for Masked Molecular Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16790v3)** | 2025-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have achieved notable progress in modeling discrete data, while their potential in molecular generation remains underexplored. In this work, we explore their potential and introduce the surprising result that naively applying standards MDMs severely degrades the performance. We identify the critical cause of this issue as a state-clashing problem-where the forward diffusion of distinct molecules collapse into a common state, resulting in a mixture of reconstruction targets that cannot be learned using typical reverse diffusion process with unimodal predictions. To mitigate this, we propose Masked Element-wise Learnable Diffusion (MELD) that orchestrates per-element corruption trajectories to avoid collision between distinct molecular graphs. This is achieved through a parameterized noise scheduling network that assigns distinct corruption rates to individual graph elements, i.e., atoms and bonds. Extensive experiments on diverse molecular benchmarks reveal that MELD markedly enhances overall generation quality compared to element-agnostic noise scheduling, increasing the chemical validity of vanilla MDMs on ZINC250K from 15% to 93%, Furthermore, it achieves state-of-the-art property alignment in conditional generation tasks.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods for detecting driving trajectories typically rely on map-matching the path using Global Positioning System (GPS) data, which is susceptible to GPS data outage. This paper introduces CAN-Trace, a novel privacy attack mechanism that leverages Controller Area Network (CAN) messages to uncover driving trajectories, posing a significant risk to drivers' long-term privacy. A new trajectory reconstruction algorithm is proposed to transform the CAN messages, specifically vehicle speed and accelerator pedal position, into weighted graphs accommodating various driving statuses. CAN-Trace identifies driving trajectories using graph-matching algorithms applied to the created graphs in comparison to road networks. We also design a new metric to evaluate matched candidates, which allows for potential data gaps and matching inaccuracies. Empirical validation under various real-world conditions, encompassing different vehicles and driving regions, demonstrates the efficacy of CAN-Trace: it achieves an attack success rate of up to 90.59% in the urban region, and 99.41% in the suburban region.</p></details> |  |

While prior work applying diffusion models to planning has demonstrated strong performance, it often suffers from high computational costs due to iterative sampling procedures. CTP supports fast, single-step trajectory generation without significant degradation in policy quality. We evaluate CTP on the D4RL benchmark and show that it consistently outperforms existing diffusion-based planning methods in long-horizon, goal-conditioned tasks. Notably, CTP achieves higher normalized returns while using significantly fewer denoising steps. In particular, CTP achieves comparable performance with over $120\times$ speedup in inference time, demonstrating its practicality and effectiveness for high-performance, low-latency offline planning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unified Linear Parametric Map Modeling and Perception-aware Trajectory Planning for Mobile Robotics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09340v1)** | 2025-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous navigation in mobile robots, reliant on perception and planning, faces major hurdles in large-scale, complex environments. These include heavy computational burdens for mapping, sensor occlusion failures for UAVs, and traversal challenges on irregular terrain for UGVs, all compounded by a lack of perception-aware strategies. To address these challenges, we introduce Random Mapping and Random Projection (RMRP). This method constructs a lightweight linear parametric map by first mapping data to a high-dimensional space, followed by a sparse random projection for dimensionality reduction. Our novel Residual Energy Preservation Theorem provides theoretical guarantees for this process, ensuring critical geometric properties are preserved. Based on this map, we propose the RPATR (Robust Perception-Aware Trajectory Planner) framework. For UAVs, our method unifies grid and Euclidean Signed Distance Field (ESDF) maps. The front-end uses an analytical occupancy gradient to refine initial paths for safety and smoothness, while the back-end uses a closed-form ESDF for trajectory optimization. Leveraging the trained RMRP model's generalization, the planner predicts unobserved areas for proactive navigation. For UGVs, the model characterizes terrain and provides closed-form gradients, enabling online planning to circumvent large holes. Validated in diverse scenarios, our framework demonstrates superior mapping performance in time, memory, and accuracy, and enables computationally efficient, safe navigation for high-speed UAVs and UGVs. The code will be released to foster community collaboration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Robotics (TRO) in July 2025</p></details> |
| **[Shortening the Trajectories: Identity-Aware Gaussian Approximation for Efficient 3D Molecular Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09043v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gaussian-based Probabilistic Generative Models (GPGMs) generate data by reversing a stochastic process that progressively corrupts samples with Gaussian noise. While these models have achieved state-of-the-art performance across diverse domains, their practical deployment remains constrained by the high computational cost of long generative trajectories, which often involve hundreds to thousands of steps during training and sampling. In this work, we introduce a theoretically grounded and empirically validated framework that improves generation efficiency without sacrificing training granularity or inference fidelity. Our key insight is that for certain data modalities, the noising process causes data to rapidly lose its identity and converge toward a Gaussian distribution. We analytically identify a characteristic step at which the data has acquired sufficient Gaussianity, and then replace the remaining generation trajectory with a closed-form Gaussian approximation. Unlike existing acceleration techniques that coarsening the trajectories by skipping steps, our method preserves the full resolution of learning dynamics while avoiding redundant stochastic perturbations between `Gaussian-like' distributions. Empirical results across multiple data modalities demonstrate substantial improvements in both sample quality and computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[GoalNet: Goal Areas Oriented Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19002v2)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting the future trajectories of pedestrians on the road is an important task for autonomous driving. The pedestrian trajectory prediction is affected by scene paths, pedestrian's intentions and decision-making, which is a multi-modal problem. Most recent studies use past trajectories to predict a variety of potential future trajectory distributions, which do not account for the scene context and pedestrian targets. Instead of predicting the future trajectory directly, we propose to use scene context and observed trajectory to predict the goal points first, and then reuse the goal points to predict the future trajectories. By leveraging the information from scene context and observed trajectory, the uncertainty can be limited to a few target areas, which represent the "goals" of the pedestrians. In this paper, we propose GoalNet, a new trajectory prediction neural network based on the goal areas of a pedestrian. Our network can predict both pedestrian's trajectories and bounding boxes. The overall model is efficient and modular, and its outputs can be changed according to the usage scenario. Experimental results show that GoalNet significantly improves the previous state-of-the-art performance by 48.7% on the JAAD and 40.8% on the PIE dataset.</p></details> |  |

| **[Boundary-Guided Trajectory Prediction for Road Aware and Physically Feasible Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06740v2)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of surrounding road users' trajectories is essential for safe and efficient autonomous driving. While deep learning models have improved performance, challenges remain in preventing off-road predictions and ensuring kinematic feasibility. Existing methods incorporate road-awareness modules and enforce kinematic constraints but lack plausibility guarantees and often introduce trade-offs in complexity and flexibility. This paper proposes a novel framework that formulates trajectory prediction as a constrained regression guided by permissible driving directions and their boundaries. Using the agent's current state and an HD map, our approach defines the valid boundaries and ensures on-road predictions by training the network to learn superimposed paths between left and right boundary polylines. To guarantee feasibility, the model predicts acceleration profiles that determine the vehicle's travel distance along these paths while adhering to kinematic constraints. We evaluate our approach on the Argoverse-2 dataset against the HPTR baseline. Our approach shows a slight decrease in benchmark metrics compared to HPTR but notably improves final displacement error and eliminates infeasible trajectories. Moreover, the proposed approach has superior generalization to less prevalent maneuvers and unseen out-of-distribution scenarios, reducing the off-road rate under adversarial attacks from 66% to just 1%. These results highlight the effectiveness of our approach in generating feasible and robust predictions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in the 36th IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV 2025)</p></details> |
| **[T-GVC: Trajectory-Guided Generative Video Coding at Ultra-Low Bitrates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07633v2)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in video generation techniques have given rise to an emerging paradigm of generative video coding, aiming to achieve semantically accurate reconstructions in Ultra-Low Bitrate (ULB) scenarios by leveraging strong generative priors. However, most existing methods are limited by domain specificity (e.g., facial or human videos) or an excessive dependence on high-level text guidance, which often fails to capture motion details and results in unrealistic reconstructions. To address these challenges, we propose a Trajectory-Guided Generative Video Coding framework (dubbed T-GVC). T-GVC employs a semantic-aware sparse motion sampling pipeline to effectively bridge low-level motion tracking with high-level semantic understanding by extracting pixel-wise motion as sparse trajectory points based on their semantic importance, not only significantly reducing the bitrate but also preserving critical temporal semantic information. In addition, by incorporating trajectory-aligned loss constraints into diffusion processes, we introduce a training-free latent space guidance mechanism to ensure physically plausible motion patterns without sacrificing the inherent capabilities of generative models. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms both traditional codecs and state-of-the-art end-to-end video compression methods under ULB conditions. Furthermore, additional experiments confirm that our approach achieves more precise motion control than existing text-guided methods, paving the way for a novel direction of generative video coding guided by geometric motion modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Offline Trajectory Optimization for Offline Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10393v2)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn policies without online explorations. To enlarge the training data, model-based offline RL learns a dynamics model which is utilized as a virtual environment to generate simulation data and enhance policy learning. However, existing data augmentation methods for offline RL suffer from (i) trivial improvement from short-horizon simulation; and (ii) the lack of evaluation and correction for generated data, leading to low-qualified augmentation. In this paper, we propose offline trajectory optimization for offline reinforcement learning (OTTO). The key motivation is to conduct long-horizon simulation and then utilize model uncertainty to evaluate and correct the augmented data. Specifically, we propose an ensemble of Transformers, a.k.a. World Transformers, to predict environment state dynamics and the reward function. Three strategies are proposed to use World Transformers to generate long-horizon trajectory simulation by perturbing the actions in the offline data. Then, an uncertainty-based World Evaluator is introduced to firstly evaluate the confidence of the generated trajectories and then perform the correction for low-confidence data. Finally, we jointly use the original data with the corrected augmentation data to train an offline RL algorithm. OTTO serves as a plug-in module and can be integrated with existing model-free offline RL methods. Experiments on various benchmarks show that OTTO can effectively improve the performance of representative offline RL algorithms, including in complex environments with sparse rewards like AntMaze.

This paper investigates the 3-dimensional (3D) trajectory and communication optimization for low-altitude air-ground cooperation systems, where mobile unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) upload data to UAVs. We propose a joint optimization algorithm to maximize the minimal sum-rate of UGVs while ensuring quality of service and navigation constraints. The proposed algorithm integrates a successive convex approximation (SCA)-penalty method for UGV-UAV scheduling, an SCA-based approach for UGV transmit power control, and a novel warm-start particle swarm optimization with cross mutation (WS-PSO-CM). The WS-PSO-CM leverages convex optimization results from a statistical channel model to initialize particle swarm, significantly improving the performance, compared with celebrated PSO-CM. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves a $45.8$\% higher minimal sum-rate compared to the baseline PSO-CM under the same iterations. This gain can be translated to reducing computational time by $46.7$\% of PSO-CM. Furthermore, our simulation results reveal that UAVs dynamically adjust trajectories to avoid interference by buildings, and maintain proximity to UGVs to mitigate path-loss.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages; 6 figures; submit to IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Using a prototype-based nearest-neighbor search (P-NNS), we evaluate the validity of JSON-Bag with JSD on six tabletop games -- \textit{7 Wonders}, \textit{Dominion}, \textit{Sea Salt and Paper}, \textit{Can't Stop}, \textit{Connect4}, \textit{Dots and boxes} -- each over three game trajectory classification tasks: classifying the playing agents, game parameters, or game seeds that were used to generate the trajectories. Our approach outperforms a baseline using hand-crafted features in the majority of tasks. Evaluating on N-shot classification suggests using JSON-Bag prototype to represent game trajectory classes is also sample efficient. Additionally, we demonstrate JSON-Bag ability for automatic feature extraction by treating tokens as individual features to be used in Random Forest to solve the tasks above, which significantly improves accuracy on underperforming tasks. Finally, we show that, across all six games, the JSD between JSON-Bag prototypes of agent classes highly correlates with the distances between agents' policies.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, 6 tables, to be published in IEEE Conference on Games 2025</p></details> |

Longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs) provide a uniquely powerful opportunity for the prediction. However, it is challenging to accurately model the continuous clinical progression of patients underlying the irregularly sampled clinical features and to transparently link the progression to survival outcomes. To address these challenges, we develop TrajSurv, a model that learns continuous latent trajectories from longitudinal EHR data for trustworthy survival prediction. TrajSurv employs a neural controlled differential equation (NCDE) to extract continuous-time latent states from the irregularly sampled data, forming continuous latent trajectories. To ensure the latent trajectories reflect the clinical progression, TrajSurv aligns the latent state space with patient state space through a time-aware contrastive learning approach. To transparently link clinical progression to the survival outcome, TrajSurv uses latent trajectories in a two-step divide-and-conquer interpretation process. First, it explains how the changes in clinical features translate into the latent trajectory's evolution using a learned vector field. Second, it clusters these latent trajectories to identify key clinical progression patterns associated with different survival outcomes. Evaluations on two real-world medical datasets, MIMIC-III and eICU, show TrajSurv's competitive accuracy and superior transparency over existing deep learning methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by MLHC 2025</p></details> |

Inspired by the success of decoder-only models for language modeling, we propose DONUT, a Decoder-Only Network for Unrolling Trajectories. Unlike existing encoder-decoder forecasting models, we encode historical trajectories and predict future trajectories with a single autoregressive model. This allows the model to make iterative predictions in a consistent manner, and ensures that the model is always provided with up-to-date information, thereby enhancing performance. Furthermore, inspired by multi-token prediction for language modeling, we introduce an 'overprediction' strategy that gives the model the auxiliary task of predicting trajectories at longer temporal horizons. This allows the model to better anticipate the future and further improves performance. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our decoder-only approach outperforms the encoder-decoder baseline, and achieves new state-of-the-art results on the Argoverse 2 single-agent motion forecasting benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025.

We present streaming algorithms for two such problems under the Fr\'{e}chet distance $d_F$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ for some constant $d \geq 2$. Consider a polygonal curve $\tau$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ in a stream. We present a streaming algorithm that, for any $\varepsilon\in (0,1)$ and $\delta > 0$, produces a curve $\sigma$ such that $d_F(\sigma,\tau[v_1,v_i])\le (1+\varepsilon)\delta$ and $|\sigma|\le 2\,\mathrm{opt}-2$, where $\tau[v_1,v_i]$ is the prefix in the stream so far, and $\mathrm{opt} = \min\{|\sigma'|: d_F(\sigma',\tau[v_1,v_i])\le \delta\}$. Let $\alpha = 2(d-1){\lfloor d/2 \rfloor}^2 + d$. The working storage is $O(\varepsilon^{-\alpha})$. Each vertex is processed in $O(\varepsilon^{-\alpha}\log\frac{1}{\varepsilon})$ time for $d \in \{2,3\}$ and $O(\varepsilon^{-\alpha})$ time for $d \geq 4$ . Thus, the whole $\tau$ can be simplified in $O(\varepsilon^{-\alpha}|\tau|\log\frac{1}{\varepsilon})$ time. Ignoring polynomial factors in $1/\varepsilon$, this running time is a factor $|\tau|$ faster than the best static algorithm that offers the same guarantees. We present another streaming algorithm that, for any integer $k \geq 2$ and any $\varepsilon \in (0,\frac{1}{17})$, maintains a curve $\sigma$ such that $|\sigma| \leq 2k-2$ and $d_F(\sigma,\tau[v_1,v_i])\le (1+\varepsilon) \cdot \min\{d_F(\sigma',\tau[v_1,v_i]): |\sigma'| \leq k\}$, where $\tau[v_1,v_i]$ is the prefix in the stream so far. The working storage is $O((k\varepsilon^{-1}+\varepsilon^{-(\alpha+1)})\log \frac{1}{\varepsilon})$. Each vertex is processed in $O(k\varepsilon^{-(\alpha+1)}\log^2\frac{1}{\varepsilon})$ time for $d \in \{2,3\}$ and $O(k\varepsilon^{-(\alpha+1)}\log\frac{1}{\varepsilon})$ time for $d \geq 4$.</p></details> | SoCG 2025 |

By embedding structural cues from topometric maps into the denoising process of a conditional diffusion model, the proposed approach enables trajectory generation that naturally adheres to road geometry without relying on explicit constraints. A multimodal conditioning encoder fuses LiDAR observations, historical motion, and route information into a unified bird's-eye-view (BEV) representation. Extensive experiments on the KITTI benchmark demonstrate that TopoDiffuser outperforms state-of-the-art methods, while maintaining strong geometric consistency. Ablation studies further validate the contribution of each input modality, as well as the impact of denoising steps and the number of trajectory samples.

However, the performance of MEC is restricted due to its fixed location and limited service scope. Hence, we investigate an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted MEC system, where multiple UAVs are dispatched and each UAV can simultaneously provide computing service for multiple SDs. To improve the performance of system, we formulated a UAV-based trajectory control and resource allocation multi-objective optimization problem (TCRAMOP) to simultaneously maximize the offloading number of UAVs and minimize total offloading delay and total energy consumption of UAVs by optimizing the flight paths of UAVs as well as the computing resource allocated to served SDs. Then, consider that the solution of TCRAMOP requires continuous decision-making and the system is dynamic, we propose an enhanced deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm, namely, distributed proximal policy optimization with imitation learning (DPPOIL). This algorithm incorporates the generative adversarial imitation learning technique to improve the policy performance. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed DPPOIL and prove that the learned strategy of DPPOIL is better compared with other baseline methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by IEEE GLOBECOM 2025</p></details> |
| **[OmniTraj: Pre-Training on Heterogeneous Data for Adaptive and Zero-Shot Human Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23657v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large-scale pre-training has advanced human trajectory prediction, a critical challenge remains: zero-shot transfer to unseen dataset with varying temporal dynamics. State-of-the-art pre-trained models often require fine-tuning to adapt to new datasets with different frame rates or observation horizons, limiting their scalability and practical utility. In this work, we systematically investigate this limitation and propose a robust solution. We first demonstrate that existing data-aware discrete models struggle when transferred to new scenarios with shifted temporal setups. We then isolate the temporal generalization from dataset shift, revealing that a simple, explicit conditioning mechanism for temporal metadata is a highly effective solution. Based on this insight, we present OmniTraj, a Transformer-based model pre-trained on a large-scale, heterogeneous dataset. Our experiments show that explicitly conditioning on the frame rate enables OmniTraj to achieve state-of-the-art zero-shot transfer performance, reducing prediction error by over 70\% in challenging cross-setup scenarios. After fine-tuning, OmniTraj achieves state-of-the-art results on four datasets, including NBA, JTA, WorldPose, and ETH-UCY.

While existing point-based and grid-based methods expose two main limitations: insufficiently modeling human motion dynamics, as they fail to balance local motion details with long-range spatiotemporal dependencies, and the time representations lack interaction with their frequency components in jointly modeling trajectory sequences. To address these challenges, we propose PatchTraj, a dynamic patch-based framework that integrates time-frequency joint modeling for trajectory prediction. Specifically, we decompose the trajectory into raw time sequences and frequency components, and employ dynamic patch partitioning to perform multi-scale segmentation, capturing hierarchical motion patterns. Each patch undergoes adaptive embedding with scale-aware feature extraction, followed by hierarchical feature aggregation to model both fine-grained and long-range dependencies. The outputs of the two branches are further enhanced via cross-modal attention, facilitating complementary fusion of temporal and spectral cues. The resulting enhanced embeddings exhibit strong expressive power, enabling accurate predictions even when using a vanilla Transformer architecture. Extensive experiments on ETH-UCY, SDD, NBA, and JRDB datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, on the egocentric JRDB dataset, PatchTraj attains significant relative improvements of 26.7% in ADE and 17.4% in FDE, underscoring its substantial potential in embodied intelligence.</p></details> |  |

In contrast to supervised methods, OOD-based approaches function without labels and are inherently robust to data imbalances. Current generative approaches often rely on likelihood estimation or reconstruction error, but these methods can be computationally expensive, unreliable, and require retraining if the inlier data changes. These limitations hinder their ability to distinguish nominal from anomalous inputs efficiently, consistently, and robustly. We propose a reconstruction-free OOD detection method that leverages the forward diffusion trajectories of a Stein score-based denoising diffusion model (SBDDM). By capturing trajectory curvature via the estimated Stein score, our approach enables accurate anomaly scoring with only five diffusion steps. A single SBDDM pre-trained on a large, semantically aligned medical dataset generalizes effectively across multiple Near-OOD and Far-OOD benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance while drastically reducing computational cost during inference. Compared to existing methods, SBDDM achieves a relative improvement of up to 10.43% and 18.10% for Near-OOD and Far-OOD detection, making it a practical building block for real-time, reliable computer-aided diagnosis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Uncertainty for Safe Utilization of Machine Learning in Medical Imaging, MICCAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Other Vehicle Trajectories Are Also Needed: A Driving World Model Unifies Ego-Other Vehicle Trajectories in Video Latent Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09215v3)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advanced end-to-end autonomous driving systems predict other vehicles' motions and plan ego vehicle's trajectory. The world model that can foresee the outcome of the trajectory has been used to evaluate the autonomous driving system. However, existing world models predominantly emphasize the trajectory of the ego vehicle and leave other vehicles uncontrollable. This limitation hinders their ability to realistically simulate the interaction between the ego vehicle and the driving scenario. In this paper, we propose a driving World Model named EOT-WM, unifying Ego-Other vehicle Trajectories in videos for driving simulation. Specifically, it remains a challenge to match multiple trajectories in the BEV space with each vehicle in the video to control the video generation. We first project ego-other vehicle trajectories in the BEV space into the image coordinate for vehicle-trajectory match via pixel positions. Then, trajectory videos are encoded by the Spatial-Temporal Variational Auto Encoder to align with driving video latents spatially and temporally in the unified visual space. A trajectory-injected diffusion Transformer is further designed to denoise the noisy video latents for video generation with the guidance of ego-other vehicle trajectories. In addition, we propose a metric based on control latent similarity to evaluate the controllability of trajectories. Extensive experiments are conducted on the nuScenes dataset, and the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 30% in FID and 55% in FVD. The model can also predict unseen driving scenes with self-produced trajectories.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Data-Driven Stochastic Control via Non-i.i.d. Trajectories: Foundations and Guarantees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23280v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work establishes a crucial step toward advancing data-driven trajectory-based methods for stochastic systems with unknown mathematical dynamics. In contrast to scenario-based approaches that rely on independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) trajectories, this work develops a data-driven framework where each trajectory is gathered over a finite horizon and exhibits temporal dependence-referred to as a non-i.i.d. trajectory. To ensure safety of dynamical systems using such trajectories, the current body of literature primarily considers dynamics subject to unknown-but-bounded disturbances, which facilitates robust analysis. While promising, such bounds may be violated in practice and the resulting worst-case robust analysis tends to be overly conservative. To overcome these fundamental challenges, this paper considers stochastic systems with unknown mathematical dynamics, influenced by process noise with unknown distributions. In the proposed framework, data is collected from stochastic systems under multiple realizations within a finite-horizon experiment, where each realization generates a non-i.i.d. trajectory. Leveraging the concept of stochastic control barrier certificates constructed from data, this work quantifies probabilistic safety guarantees with a certified confidence level. To achieve this, the proposed conditions are formulated as sum-of-squares (SOS) optimization problems, relying solely on empirical average of the collected trajectories and statistical features of the process noise. The efficacy of the approach has been validated on three stochastic benchmarks with both unknown models and noise distributions. In one case study, it is shown that while no safety controller exists for the robust analysis of the system under bounded disturbances, the proposed stochastic framework offers a safety controller with guaranteed probabilistic satisfaction.</p></details> |  |

Yet, existing models often fail to fully leverage the visual cues that humans subconsciously communicate when navigating the space. In this work, we study the benefits of predicting human trajectories using human body poses instead of solely their Cartesian space locations in time. We propose `Social-pose', an attention-based pose encoder that effectively captures the poses of all humans in a scene and their social relations. Our method can be integrated into various trajectory prediction architectures. We have conducted extensive experiments on state-of-the-art models (based on LSTM, GAN, MLP, and Transformer), and showed improvements over all of them on synthetic (Joint Track Auto) and real (Human3.6M, Pedestrians and Cyclists in Road Traffic, and JRDB) datasets. We also explored the advantages of using 2D versus 3D poses, as well as the effect of noisy poses and the application of our pose-based predictor in robot navigation scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems (T-ITS)</p></details> |
| **[Generative Active Learning for Long-tail Trajectory Prediction via Controllable Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22615v1)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While data-driven trajectory prediction has enhanced the reliability of autonomous driving systems, it still struggles with rarely observed long-tail scenarios. Prior works addressed this by modifying model architectures, such as using hypernetworks. In contrast, we propose refining the training process to unlock each model's potential without altering its structure. We introduce Generative Active Learning for Trajectory prediction (GALTraj), the first method to successfully deploy generative active learning into trajectory prediction. It actively identifies rare tail samples where the model fails and augments these samples with a controllable diffusion model during training. In our framework, generating scenarios that are diverse, realistic, and preserve tail-case characteristics is paramount. Accordingly, we design a tail-aware generation method that applies tailored diffusion guidance to generate trajectories that both capture rare behaviors and respect traffic rules. Unlike prior simulation methods focused solely on scenario diversity, GALTraj is the first to show how simulator-driven augmentation benefits long-tail learning in trajectory prediction. Experiments on multiple trajectory datasets (WOMD, Argoverse2) with popular backbones (QCNet, MTR) confirm that our method significantly boosts performance on tail samples and also enhances accuracy on head samples.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV 2025</p></details> |

In this context, constrained diversity optimization has emerged as a powerful reinforcement learning (RL) framework to train a diverse set of agents in parallel. However, existing constrained-diversity RL methods often under-explore in complex tasks such as robotic manipulation, leading to a lack in policy diversity. To improve diversity optimization in RL, we therefore propose a curriculum that first explores at the trajectory level before learning step-based policies. In our empirical evaluation, we provide novel insights into the shortcoming of skill-based diversity optimization, and demonstrate empirically that our curriculum improves the diversity of the learned skills.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted into the Inductive Biases in Reinforcement Learning Workshop at RLC 2025</p></details> |
| **[Decision Transformer-Based Drone Trajectory Planning with Dynamic Safety-Efficiency Trade-Offs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21506v2)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A drone trajectory planner should be able to dynamically adjust the safety-efficiency trade-off according to varying mission requirements in unknown environments. Although traditional polynomial-based planners offer computational efficiency and smooth trajectory generation, they require expert knowledge to tune multiple parameters to adjust this trade-off. Moreover, even with careful tuning, the resulting adjustment may fail to achieve the desired trade-off. Similarly, although reinforcement learning-based planners are adaptable in unknown environments, they do not explicitly address the safety-efficiency trade-off. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a Decision Transformer-based trajectory planner that leverages a single parameter, Return-to-Go (RTG), as a \emph{temperature parameter} to dynamically adjust the safety-efficiency trade-off. In our framework, since RTG intuitively measures the safety and efficiency of a trajectory, RTG tuning does not require expert knowledge. We validate our approach using Gazebo simulations in both structured grid and unstructured random environments. The experimental results demonstrate that our planner can dynamically adjust the safety-efficiency trade-off by simply tuning the RTG parameter. Furthermore, our planner outperforms existing baseline methods across various RTG settings, generating safer trajectories when tuned for safety and more efficient trajectories when tuned for efficiency. Real-world experiments further confirm the reliability and practicality of our proposed planner.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) 2025.

| **[Safety Evaluation of Motion Plans Using Trajectory Predictors as Forward Reachable Set Estimators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22389v1)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advent of end-to-end autonomy stacks - often lacking interpretable intermediate modules - has placed an increased burden on ensuring that the final output, i.e., the motion plan, is safe in order to validate the safety of the entire stack. This requires a safety monitor that is both complete (able to detect all unsafe plans) and sound (does not flag safe plans). In this work, we propose a principled safety monitor that leverages modern multi-modal trajectory predictors to approximate forward reachable sets (FRS) of surrounding agents. By formulating a convex program, we efficiently extract these data-driven FRSs directly from the predicted state distributions, conditioned on scene context such as lane topology and agent history. To ensure completeness, we leverage conformal prediction to calibrate the FRS and guarantee coverage of ground-truth trajectories with high probability. To preserve soundness in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios or under predictor failure, we introduce a Bayesian filter that dynamically adjusts the FRS conservativeness based on the predictor's observed performance. We then assess the safety of the ego vehicle's motion plan by checking for intersections with these calibrated FRSs, ensuring the plan remains collision-free under plausible future behaviors of others. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset show our approach significantly improves soundness while maintaining completeness, offering a practical and reliable safety monitor for learned autonomy stacks.</p></details> |  |

Leveraging the spatial information encoded in 3DGS, this work proposes FOCI (Field Overlap Collision Integral), an algorithm that is able to optimize trajectories directly on the Gaussians themselves. FOCI leverages a novel and interpretable collision formulation for 3DGS using the notion of the overlap integral between Gaussians. Contrary to other approaches, which represent the robot with conservative bounding boxes that underestimate the traversability of the environment, we propose to represent the environment and the robot as Gaussian Splats. This not only has desirable computational properties, but also allows for orientation-aware planning, allowing the robot to pass through very tight and narrow spaces. We extensively test our algorithm in both synthetic and real Gaussian Splats, showcasing that collision-free trajectories for the ANYmal legged robot that can be computed in a few seconds, even with hundreds of thousands of Gaussians making up the environment.

However, current automated methods are limited to establishing cell developmental trajectories within individual samples, necessitating biologists to manually link cells across samples to construct complete cross-sample evolutionary trajectories that consider cellular spatial dynamics. This process demands substantial human effort due to the complex spatial correspondence between each pair of samples. To address this challenge, we first proposed a GNN-based model to predict cross-sample cell developmental trajectories. We then developed TrajLens, a visual analytics system that supports biologists in exploring and refining the cell developmental trajectories based on predicted links. Specifically, we designed the visualization that integrates features on cell distribution and developmental direction across multiple samples, providing an overview of the spatial evolutionary patterns of cell populations along trajectories. Additionally, we included contour maps superimposed on the original cell distribution data, enabling biologists to explore them intuitively. To demonstrate our system's performance, we conducted quantitative evaluations of our model with two case studies and expert interviews to validate its usefulness and effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accept by IEEE VIS'25</p></details> |

Despite initial progress, these agents still face challenges when handling complex real-world tasks. These challenges arise from a lack of knowledge about real-life mobile applications in LLM-based agents, which may lead to ineffective task planning and even cause hallucinations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel LLM-based agent framework called MapAgent that leverages memory constructed from historical trajectories to augment current task planning. Specifically, we first propose a trajectory-based memory mechanism that transforms task execution trajectories into a reusable and structured page-memory database. Each page within a trajectory is extracted as a compact yet comprehensive snapshot, capturing both its UI layout and functional context. Secondly, we introduce a coarse-to-fine task planning approach that retrieves relevant pages from the memory database based on similarity and injects them into the LLM planner to compensate for potential deficiencies in understanding real-world app scenarios, thereby achieving more informed and context-aware task planning. Finally, planned tasks are transformed into executable actions through a task executor supported by a dual-LLM architecture, ensuring effective tracking of task progress. Experimental results in real-world scenarios demonstrate that MapAgent achieves superior performance to existing methods. The code will be open-sourced to support further research.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing datasets primarily focus on vehicle motion states and trajectories, neglecting human-related information. In addition, current naturalistic driving datasets lack sufficient safety-critical scenarios while simulated datasets suffer from low authenticity. To address these issues, this paper constructs the Risk-Informed Subjective Evaluation and Eye-tracking (RISEE) dataset which specifically contains human subjective evaluations and eye-tracking data apart from regular naturalistic driving trajectories. By leveraging the complementary advantages of drone-based (high realism and extensive scenario coverage) and simulation-based (high safety and reproducibility) data collection methods, we first conduct drone-based traffic video recording at a highway ramp merging area. After that, the manually selected highly interactive scenarios are reconstructed in simulation software, and drivers' first-person view (FPV) videos are generated, which are then viewed and evaluated by recruited participants. During the video viewing process, participants' eye-tracking data is collected. After data processing and filtering, 3567 valid subjective risk ratings from 101 participants across 179 scenarios are retained, along with 2045 qualified eye-tracking data segments.

Drawing on 4 million X posts over six months, we combine a user- and topic-centric approach to study how shifts in toxicity manifest as topical shifts. Our topic discovery method, which leverages instruction-based embeddings and recursive HDBSCAN, uncovers 157 fine-grained subtopics within the U.S. immigration discourse. We focus on users in four groups: (1) those with increasing toxicity, (2) those with decreasing toxicity, and two reference groups with no significant toxicity trend but matched toxicity levels. Treating each posting history as a trajectory through a five-dimensional topic space, we compare average group trajectories using permutational MANOVA. Our findings show that users with increasing toxicity drift toward alarmist, fear-based frames, whereas those with decreasing toxicity pivot toward legal and policy-focused themes. Both patterns diverge statistically significantly from their reference groups. This pipeline, which combines hierarchical topic discovery with trajectory analysis, offers a replicable method for studying dynamic conversations around social issues at scale.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the preprint of a paper accepted at ICWSM 2026</p></details> |

Directly mapping camera data to actions via neural networks can result in jerky motions and difficulties in meeting critical constraints, compromising safety and robustness in real-world deployment. For tasks that require high robustness or strict adherence to constraints, ensuring trajectory quality is crucial. However, the lack of interpretability in neural networks makes it challenging to generate constraint-compliant actions in a controlled manner. This paper introduces differentiable policy trajectory optimization with generalizability (DiffOG), a learning-based trajectory optimization framework designed to enhance visuomotor policies. By leveraging the proposed differentiable formulation of trajectory optimization with transformer, DiffOG seamlessly integrates policies with a generalizable optimization layer. DiffOG refines action trajectories to be smoother and more constraint-compliant while maintaining alignment with the original demonstration distribution, thus avoiding degradation in policy performance. We evaluated DiffOG across 11 simulated tasks and 2 real-world tasks. The results demonstrate that DiffOG significantly enhances the trajectory quality of visuomotor policies while having minimal impact on policy performance, outperforming trajectory processing baselines such as greedy constraint clipping and penalty-based trajectory optimization. Furthermore, DiffOG achieves superior performance compared to existing constrained visuomotor policy.

Current approaches rely on flat apertures, which limit trajectory flexibility due to inherent geometric constraints. To overcome such restrictions, we propose adopting curved apertures as a more versatile alternative for beam shaping.

Upon this, trajectory-controllable video generation has emerged to enable precise object motion control through explicitly defined spatial paths. However, existing methods struggle with complex object movements and multi-object motion control, resulting in imprecise trajectory adherence, poor object consistency, and compromised visual quality. Furthermore, these methods only support trajectory control in a single format, limiting their applicability in diverse scenarios. Additionally, there is no publicly available dataset or benchmark specifically tailored for trajectory-controllable video generation, hindering robust training and systematic evaluation. To address these challenges, we introduce MagicMotion, a novel image-to-video generation framework that enables trajectory control through three levels of conditions from dense to sparse: masks, bounding boxes, and sparse boxes. Given an input image and trajectories, MagicMotion seamlessly animates objects along defined trajectories while maintaining object consistency and visual quality. Furthermore, we present MagicData, a large-scale trajectory-controlled video dataset, along with an automated pipeline for annotation and filtering. We also introduce MagicBench, a comprehensive benchmark that assesses both video quality and trajectory control accuracy across different numbers of objects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MagicMotion outperforms previous methods across various metrics.

While existing W2SG studies focus on simple tasks like binary classification, we extend this paradigm to complex interactive decision-making environments. Specifically, we fine-tune a strong model with trajectories of intermediate actions generated by a weak model. Motivated by the human learning process, we propose to generalize not only success knowledge but also failure experience so that the strong model can learn from failed trajectories accumulated by weak models. To effectively and efficiently elicit the potential of strong agents, we further construct ``trajectory trees," a hierarchical representation that organizes weak model-generated action trajectories, coupled with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to optimize the strong model. Through theoretical analysis, we provide formal guarantees for the effectiveness of our method in improving W2SG performance. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate substantial improvements in reasoning and decision-making capabilities across diverse task domains, validating the scalability and robustness of our proposed framework.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a novel framework for wafer defect root cause analysis, called Partial Trajectory Regression (PTR). The proposed framework is carefully designed to address the limitations of conventional vector-based regression models, particularly in handling variable-length processing routes that span a large number of heterogeneous physical processes. To compute the attribution score of each process given a detected high defect density on a specific wafer, we propose a new algorithm that compares two counterfactual outcomes derived from partial process trajectories. This is enabled by new representation learning methods, proc2vec and route2vec.

While the lack of exact latent inversion is a core advantage of these methods, it often results in unstable editing trajectories and poor source consistency. To address this limitation, we propose {\em FlowAlign}, a novel inversion-free flow-based framework for consistent image editing with optimal control-based trajectory control. Specifically, FlowAlign introduces source similarity at the terminal point as a regularization term to promote smoother and more consistent trajectories during the editing process. Notably, our terminal point regularization is shown to explicitly balance semantic alignment with the edit prompt and structural consistency with the source image along the trajectory. Furthermore, FlowAlign naturally supports reverse editing by simply reversing the ODE trajectory, highliting the reversible and consistent nature of the transformation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlowAlign outperforms existing methods in both source preservation and editing controllability.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods are hampered by the sparse rewards given the underlying Markov Decision Process. This inefficiency limits the exploration of the vast symbolic search space and destabilizes the training process. To address this, Trajectory-level Reward Shaping (TLRS), a novel reward shaping method, is proposed. TLRS provides dense, intermediate rewards by measuring the subsequence-level similarity between partially generated expressions and a set of expert-designed formulas. Furthermore, a reward centering mechanism is introduced to reduce training variance. Extensive experiments on six major Chinese and U.S. stock indices show that TLRS significantly improves the predictive power of mined factors, boosting the Rank Information Coefficient by 9.29% over existing potential-based shaping algorithms. Notably, TLRS achieves a major leap in computational efficiency by reducing its time complexity with respect to the feature dimension from linear to constant, which is a significant improvement over distance-based baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[TPK: Trustworthy Trajectory Prediction Integrating Prior Knowledge For Interpretability and Kinematic Feasibility](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06743v3)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is crucial for autonomous driving, enabling vehicles to navigate safely by anticipating the movements of surrounding road users. However, current deep learning models often lack trustworthiness as their predictions can be physically infeasible and illogical to humans. To make predictions more trustworthy, recent research has incorporated prior knowledge, like the social force model for modeling interactions and kinematic models for physical realism. However, these approaches focus on priors that suit either vehicles or pedestrians and do not generalize to traffic with mixed agent classes. We propose incorporating interaction and kinematic priors of all agent classes--vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists with class-specific interaction layers to capture agent behavioral differences. To improve the interpretability of the agent interactions, we introduce DG-SFM, a rule-based interaction importance score that guides the interaction layer. To ensure physically feasible predictions, we proposed suitable kinematic models for all agent classes with a novel pedestrian kinematic model. We benchmark our approach on the Argoverse 2 dataset, using the state-of-the-art transformer HPTR as our baseline. Experiments demonstrate that our method improves interaction interpretability, revealing a correlation between incorrect predictions and divergence from our interaction prior. Even though incorporating the kinematic models causes a slight decrease in accuracy, they eliminate infeasible trajectories found in the dataset and the baseline model. Thus, our approach fosters trust in trajectory prediction as its interaction reasoning is interpretable, and its predictions adhere to physics.</p></details> | <details><summary>First...</summary><p>First and Second authors contributed equally; Accepted in the 36th IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV 2025) for oral presentation; Winner of the best paper award</p></details> |

However, uncertainties introduced by inherent driving behaviors -- such as acceleration, deceleration, and left and right maneuvers -- pose significant challenges for reliable trajectory prediction. We introduce a Maneuver-Intention-Aware Transformer (MIAT) architecture, which integrates a maneuver intention awareness control mechanism with spatiotemporal interaction modeling to enhance long-horizon trajectory predictions. We systematically investigate the impact of varying awareness of maneuver intention on both short- and long-horizon trajectory predictions. Evaluated on the real-world NGSIM dataset and benchmarked against various transformer- and LSTM-based methods, our approach achieves an improvement of up to 4.7% in short-horizon predictions and a 1.6% in long-horizon predictions compared to other intention-aware benchmark methods. Moreover, by leveraging intention awareness control mechanism, MIAT realizes an 11.1% performance boost in long-horizon predictions, with a modest drop in short-horizon performance.

In this paper, we present a novel hybrid approach that integrates learning-based with physics-based constraints to address the multi-modality inherent in trajectory prediction. Our method employs a variational Bayesian mixture model to effectively capture the diverse range of potential future behaviors, moving beyond traditional unimodal assumptions. Unlike prior approaches that predominantly treat trajectory prediction as a data-driven regression task, our framework incorporates physical realism through sector-specific boundary conditions and Model Predictive Control (MPC)-based smoothing. These constraints ensure that predicted trajectories are not only data-consistent but also physically plausible, adhering to kinematic and dynamic principles. Furthermore, our method produces interpretable and diverse trajectory predictions, enabling enhanced downstream decision-making and planning in autonomous driving systems. We evaluate our approach on two benchmark datasets, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods. Comprehensive ablation studies validate the contributions of each component and highlight their synergistic impact on prediction accuracy and reliability. By balancing data-driven insights with physics-informed constraints, our approach offers a robust and scalable solution for navigating the uncertainties of real-world urban environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[R-Stitch: Dynamic Trajectory Stitching for Efficient Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17307v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning enhances the problem-solving capabilities of large language models by encouraging step-by-step intermediate reasoning during inference. While effective, CoT introduces substantial computational overhead due to its reliance on autoregressive decoding over long token sequences. Existing acceleration strategies either reduce sequence length through early stopping or compressive reward designs, or improve decoding speed via speculative decoding with smaller models. However, speculative decoding suffers from limited speedup when the agreement between small and large models is low, and fails to exploit the potential advantages of small models in producing concise intermediate reasoning. In this paper, we present R-Stitch, a token-level, confidence-based hybrid decoding framework that accelerates CoT inference by switching between a small language model (SLM) and a large language model (LLM) along the reasoning trajectory. R-Stitch uses the SLM to generate tokens by default and delegates to the LLM only when the SLM's confidence falls below a threshold. This design avoids full-sequence rollback and selectively invokes the LLM on uncertain steps, preserving both efficiency and answer quality. R-Stitch is model-agnostic, training-free, and compatible with standard decoding pipelines. Experiments on math reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that R-Stitch achieves up to 85\% reduction in inference latency with negligible accuracy drop, highlighting its practical effectiveness in accelerating CoT reasoning.</p></details> |  |

However, the reliability of these online-generated maps remains uncertain. While incorporating map uncertainty into downstream trajectory prediction tasks has shown potential for performance improvements, current strategies provide limited insights into the specific scenarios where this uncertainty is beneficial. In this work, we first analyze the driving scenarios in which mapping uncertainty has the greatest positive impact on trajectory prediction and identify a critical, previously overlooked factor: the agent's kinematic state. Building on these insights, we propose a novel Proprioceptive Scenario Gating that adaptively integrates map uncertainty into trajectory prediction based on forecasts of the ego vehicle's future kinematics. This lightweight, self-supervised approach enhances the synergy between online mapping and trajectory prediction, providing interpretability around where uncertainty is advantageous and outperforming previous integration methods. Additionally, we introduce a Covariance-based Map Uncertainty approach that better aligns with map geometry, further improving trajectory prediction. Extensive ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of our approach, achieving up to 23.6% improvement in mapless trajectory prediction performance over the state-of-the-art method using the real-world nuScenes driving dataset.

During the flight phases, where the ground reaction forces are not available for regulation, the limb swinging trajectories are significant for the stability of the next stance phase. Due to the conservation of angular momentum, improper leg and arm swinging results in highly tilted and unsustainable body configurations at the next stance phase landing. In such cases, the robotic system fails to maintain locomotion independent of the stability of the center of mass trajectories. This problem is more apparent for fast and high flight time trajectories. This paper proposes a real-time nonlinear limb trajectory optimization problem for humanoid running. The optimization problem is tested on two different humanoid robot models, and the generated trajectories are verified using a running algorithm for both robots in a simulation environment.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication at the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), Atlanta 2025.

Especially predicting the future states of other traffic participants imposes a non-trivial challenge. Current SotA-models already show promising results when trained on real datasets (e.g. Argoverse2, NuScenes). Problems arise when these models are deployed to new/unseen areas. Typically, performance drops significantly, indicating that the models lack generalization. In this work, we introduce a new Graph Neural Network (GNN) that utilizes a heterogeneous graph consisting of traffic participants and vectorized road network. Latter, is used to classify goals, i.e. endpoints of the predicted trajectories, in a multi-staged approach, leading to a better generalization to unseen scenarios. We show the effectiveness of the goal selection process via cross-dataset evaluation, i.e. training on Argoverse2 and evaluating on NuScenes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted on IEEE ITSC 2025</p></details> |
| **[In-Trajectory Inverse Reinforcement Learning: Learn Incrementally Before An Ongoing Trajectory Terminates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15612v7)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) aims to learn a reward function and a corresponding policy that best fit the demonstrated trajectories of an expert. However, current IRL works cannot learn incrementally from an ongoing trajectory because they have to wait to collect at least one complete trajectory to learn. To bridge the gap, this paper considers the problem of learning a reward function and a corresponding policy while observing the initial state-action pair of an ongoing trajectory and keeping updating the learned reward and policy when new state-action pairs of the ongoing trajectory are observed. We formulate this problem as an online bi-level optimization problem where the upper level dynamically adjusts the learned reward according to the newly observed state-action pairs with the help of a meta-regularization term, and the lower level learns the corresponding policy. We propose a novel algorithm to solve this problem and guarantee that the algorithm achieves sub-linear local regret $O(\sqrt{T}+\log T+\sqrt{T}\log T)$. If the reward function is linear, we prove that the proposed algorithm achieves sub-linear regret $O(\log T)$. Experiments are used to validate the proposed algorithm.</p></details> |  |

We propose Ctx2TrajGen, a context-aware trajectory generation framework that synthesizes realistic urban driving behaviors using GAIL. Leveraging PPO and WGAN-GP, our model addresses nonlinear interdependencies and training instability inherent in microscopic settings. By explicitly conditioning on surrounding vehicles and road geometry, Ctx2TrajGen generates interaction-aware trajectories aligned with real-world context. Experiments on the drone-captured DRIFT dataset demonstrate superior performance over existing methods in terms of realism, behavioral diversity, and contextual fidelity, offering a robust solution to data scarcity and domain shift without simulation.</p></details> |  |

In order to ensure that construction robots can perform tasks efficiently and accurately in complex construction environments, traditional single-objective trajectory optimization methods are difficult to meet the complex requirements of the changing construction environment. Therefore, we propose a multi-objective trajectory optimization for the robotic arm used in the curtain wall installation. First, we design a robotic arm for curtain wall installation, integrating serial, parallel, and folding arm elements, while considering its physical properties and motion characteristics. In addition, this paper proposes an NSGA-III-FO algorithm (NSGA-III with Focused Operator, NSGA-III-FO) that incorporates a focus operator screening mechanism to accelerate the convergence of the algorithm towards the Pareto front, thereby effectively balancing the multi-objective constraints of construction robots. The proposed algorithm is tested against NSGA-III, MOEA/D, and MSOPS-II in ten consecutive trials on the DTLZ3 and WFG3 test functions, showing significantly better convergence efficiency than the other algorithms. Finally, we conduct two sets of experiments on the designed robotic arm platform, which confirm the efficiency and practicality of the NSGA-III-FO algorithm in solving multi-objective trajectory planning problems for curtain wall installation tasks.</p></details> |  |

To tackle this challenge, our study innovatively draws inspiration from the mechanics of human upper limb movements during weight lifting, proposing a bio-inspired trajectory planning framework that incorporates human energy conversion principles. By collecting motion trajectories and electromyography (EMG) signals during dumbbell curls, we construct an anthropomorphic trajectory planning that integrates human force exertion patterns and energy consumption patterns. Utilizing the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm, we achieve dynamic load distribution for robotic arm trajectory planning based on human-like movement features. In practical application, these bio-inspired movement characteristics are applied to curtain wall installation tasks, validating the correctness and superiority of our trajectory planning method. Simulation results demonstrate a 48.4% reduction in energy consumption through intelligent conversion between kinetic and potential energy. This approach provides new insights and theoretical support for optimizing energy use in curtain wall installation robots during actual handling tasks.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose the GFM-Planner, a perception-aware trajectory planning framework based on the geometric feature metric, which enhances LiDAR localization accuracy by guiding the robot to avoid degraded areas. First, we derive the Geometric Feature Metric (GFM) from the fundamental LiDAR localization problem. Next, we design a 2D grid-based Metric Encoding Map (MEM) to efficiently store GFM values across the environment. A constant-time decoding algorithm is further proposed to retrieve GFM values for arbitrary poses from the MEM. Finally, we develop a perception-aware trajectory planning algorithm that improves LiDAR localization capabilities by guiding the robot in selecting trajectories through feature-rich areas. Both simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that our approach enables the robot to actively select trajectories that significantly enhance LiDAR localization accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IROS 2025</p></details> |

The model applies the Adaboost algorithm to divide multiple weak learners, and each submodel utilizes CNN to extract spatial features, LSTM to capture temporal features, and attention mechanism to capture global features comprehensively. The strong learner model, combined with multiple sub-models, then optimizes the hyperparameters of the prediction model through the natural selection behavior pattern simulated by SO. In this study, based on the real ADS-B data from Xi'an to Tianjin, the comparison experiments and ablation studies of multiple optimizers are carried out, and a comprehensive test and evaluation analysis is carried out. The results show that SO-CLA-adaboost outperforms traditional optimizers such as particle swarm, whale, and gray wolf in handling large-scale high-dimensional trajectory data. In addition, introducing the full-strategy collaborative improvement SO algorithm improves the model's prediction accuracy by 39.89%.</p></details> | in Chinese language |
| **[Generalized Consistency Trajectory Models for Image Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12510v4)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models (DMs) excel in unconditional generation, as well as on applications such as image editing and restoration. The success of DMs lies in the iterative nature of diffusion: diffusion breaks down the complex process of mapping noise to data into a sequence of simple denoising tasks. Moreover, we are able to exert fine-grained control over the generation process by injecting guidance terms into each denoising step. However, the iterative process is also computationally intensive, often taking from tens up to thousands of function evaluations. Although consistency trajectory models (CTMs) enable traversal between any time points along the probability flow ODE (PFODE) and score inference with a single function evaluation, CTMs only allow translation from Gaussian noise to data. This work aims to unlock the full potential of CTMs by proposing generalized CTMs (GCTMs), which translate between arbitrary distributions via ODEs. We discuss the design space of GCTMs and demonstrate their efficacy in various image manipulation tasks such as image-to-image translation, restoration, and editing.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 (poster) |

Here, we propose a researcher population pyramids framework for tracking global demographic and gender trajectories using publication data. This framework provides a timely snapshot of historical and present demographics and gender balance, revealing three contrasting research systems: Emerging systems (e.g., Arab countries) exhibit high researcher inflows with widening gender gaps in cumulative productivity; Mature systems (e.g., the United States) show modest inflows with narrowing gender gaps; and Rigid systems (e.g., Japan) lag in both. Furthermore, by simulating future scenarios, the framework makes potential trajectories visible. If 2023 demographic patterns persist, Arab countries' systems could resemble mature or even rigid ones by 2050. Our framework provides a robust diagnostic tool for policymakers worldwide to foster sustainable talent pipelines and gender equality in academia.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 5 figures, 1 table, and SI</p></details> |

Functional connectivity can be represented by correlation matrices computed over time, where each matrix captures the Pearson correlation between the mean fMRI signals of different regions within a sliding window. We introduce several Log-Euclidean Riemannian framework for constructing smooth approximations of functional brain connectivity trajectories. Representing dynamic functional connectivity as time series of full-rank correlation matrices, we leverage recent theoretical Log-Euclidean diffeomorphisms to map these trajectories in practice into Euclidean spaces where polynomial regression becomes feasible. Pulling back the regressed curve ensures that each estimated point remains a valid correlation matrix, enabling a smooth, interpretable, and geometrically consistent approximation of the original brain connectivity dynamics. Experiments on fMRI-derived connectivity trajectories demonstrate the geometric consistency and computational efficiency of our approach.</p></details> |  |

Due to the restrictions on sensing capabilities in the underwater scenario, the AUV is limited to collecting only bearing measurements to the target. A framework called GBT is proposed with integration of online learning and planning. First, a Gaussian process learning method is proposed for the AUV to handle unknown target motion, wherein pseudo linear transformation of bearing measurements is introduced to address nonlinearity of bearings. A probabilistic bearing-data-dependent bound on tracking error is then rigorously established. Based on it, optimal desired bearings that can reduce tracking uncertainty are obtained analytically. Finally, the trajectory optimization problem is formulated and transformed into an easily solved one with parametric transformation. Numerical examples and comparison with existing methods verify the feasibility and superior performance of our proposed framework.</p></details> |  |

Chest X-rays (CXRs) are a vital diagnostic tool, providing insights into clinical trajectories, but their irregular acquisition limits their utility. Existing tools for CXR interpretation are constrained by cross-sectional analysis, failing to capture temporal dynamics. To address this, we introduce CXR-TFT, a novel multi-modal framework that integrates temporally sparse CXR imaging and radiology reports with high-frequency clinical data, such as vital signs, laboratory values, and respiratory flow sheets, to predict the trajectory of CXR findings in critically ill patients. CXR-TFT leverages latent embeddings from a vision encoder that are temporally aligned with hourly clinical data through interpolation. A transformer model is then trained to predict CXR embeddings at each hour, conditioned on previous embeddings and clinical measurements. In a retrospective study of 20,000 ICU patients, CXR-TFT demonstrated high accuracy in forecasting abnormal CXR findings up to 12 hours before they became radiographically evident. This predictive capability in clinical data holds significant potential for enhancing the management of time-sensitive conditions like acute respiratory distress syndrome, where early intervention is crucial and diagnoses are often delayed. By providing distinctive temporal resolution in prognostic CXR analysis, CXR-TFT offers actionable 'whole patient' insights that can directly improve clinical outcomes.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Re...</summary><p>In Review for MICCAI 2025</p></details> |

Therefore, distillation techniques are utilized to accelerate the multi-step teacher model into one-step student model. Nevertheless, these methods significantly raise training costs and constrain the performance of the student model by the teacher model. To overcome these tough challenges, we propose Consistency Trajectory Matching for Super-Resolution (CTMSR), a distillation-free strategy that is able to generate photo-realistic SR results in one step. Concretely, we first formulate a Probability Flow Ordinary Differential Equation (PF-ODE) trajectory to establish a deterministic mapping from low-resolution (LR) images with noise to high-resolution (HR) images. Then we apply the Consistency Training (CT) strategy to directly learn the mapping in one step, eliminating the necessity of pre-trained diffusion model. To further enhance the performance and better leverage the ground-truth during the training process, we aim to align the distribution of SR results more closely with that of the natural images. To this end, we propose to minimize the discrepancy between their respective PF-ODE trajectories from the LR image distribution by our meticulously designed Distribution Trajectory Matching (DTM) loss, resulting in improved realism of our recovered HR images. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods can attain comparable or even superior capabilities on both synthetic and real datasets while maintaining minimal inference latency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |

Traditional Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) methods, while effective for offline planning, often struggle with premature convergence and latency in real-time scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose PE-PSO, an enhanced PSO-based online trajectory planner. The method introduces a persistent exploration mechanism to preserve swarm diversity and an entropy-based parameter adjustment strategy to dynamically adapt optimization behavior. UAV trajectories are modeled using B-spline curves, which ensure path smoothness while reducing optimization complexity. To extend this capability to UAV swarms, we develop a multi-agent framework that combines genetic algorithm (GA)-based task allocation with distributed PE-PSO, supporting scalable and coordinated trajectory generation. The distributed architecture allows for parallel computation and decentralized control, enabling effective cooperation among agents while maintaining real-time performance. Comprehensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms conventional PSO and other swarm-based planners across several metrics, including trajectory quality, energy efficiency, obstacle avoidance, and computation time. These results confirm the effectiveness and applicability of PE-PSO in real-time multi-UAV operations under complex environmental conditions.</p></details> | 8 papers,7 figures |

Real-world scenarios frequently present challenges such as occlusions and incomplete scene observations, which can compromise predictive accuracy. Thus, traditional video-based methods often struggle due to limited temporal and spatial perspectives. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative. Having been trained on a large text corpus describing human behaviors, LLMs likely encode plausible sequences of human actions in a home environment. However, LLMs, trained primarily on text data, lack inherent spatial awareness and real-time environmental perception. They struggle with understanding physical constraints and spatial geometry. Therefore, to be effective in a real-world spatial scenario, we propose a multimodal prediction framework that enhances LLM-based action prediction by integrating physical constraints derived from human trajectories. Our experiments demonstrate that combining LLM predictions with trajectory data significantly improves overall prediction performance. This enhancement is particularly notable in situations where the LLM receives limited scene information, highlighting the complementary nature of linguistic knowledge and physical constraints in understanding and anticipating human behavior.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IROS 2025</p></details> |

| **[STF: Spatial Temporal Fusion for Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18149v2)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is a challenging task that aims to predict the future trajectory of vehicles or pedestrians over a short time horizon based on their historical positions. The main reason is that the trajectory is a kind of complex data, including spatial and temporal information, which is crucial for accurate prediction. Intuitively, the more information the model can capture, the more precise the future trajectory can be predicted. However, previous works based on deep learning methods processed spatial and temporal information separately, leading to inadequate spatial information capture, which means they failed to capture the complete spatial information. Therefore, it is of significance to capture information more fully and effectively on vehicle interactions. In this study, we introduced an integrated 3D graph that incorporates both spatial and temporal edges. Based on this, we proposed the integrated 3D graph, which considers the cross-time interaction information. In specific, we design a Spatial-Temporal Fusion (STF) model including Multi-layer perceptions (MLP) and Graph Attention (GAT) to capture the spatial and temporal information historical trajectories simultaneously on the 3D graph. Our experiment on the ApolloScape Trajectory Datasets shows that the proposed STF outperforms several baseline methods, especially on the long-time-horizon trajectory prediction.</p></details> | 6 pages, 6 figures |

However, existing trajectory optimization methods show weakness when dealing with large-scale long trajectories. Recent advances in parallel computing have accelerated optimization in some fields, but how to efficiently solve trajectory optimization via parallelism remains an open question. In this paper, we propose a novel trajectory optimization framework based on the Consensus Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (CADMM) algorithm, which decomposes the trajectory into multiple segments and solves the subproblems in parallel. The proposed framework reduces the time complexity to O(1) per iteration to the number of segments, compared to O(N) of the state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches. Furthermore, we introduce a closed-form solution that integrates convex linear and quadratic constraints to speed up the optimization, and we also present numerical solutions for general inequality constraints. A series of simulations and experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms the SOTA approach in terms of efficiency and smoothness. Especially for a large-scale trajectory, with one hundred segments, achieving over a tenfold speedup.

Consequently, few RL-based trajectory planning methods can achieve performance comparable to that of imitation learning-based methods. The convergence problem is alleviated by combining RL with supervised learning. However, most existing approaches only reason one step ahead and lack the capability to plan for multiple future steps. Besides, although inverse reinforcement learning holds promise for solving the reward function design issue, existing methods for automated driving impose a linear structure assumption on reward functions, making them difficult to apply to urban automated driving. In light of these challenges, this paper proposes a novel RL-based trajectory planning method that integrates RL with imitation learning to enable multi-step planning. Furthermore, a transformer-based Bayesian reward function is developed, providing effective reward signals for RL in urban scenarios. Moreover, a hybrid-driven trajectory planning framework is proposed to enhance safety and interpretability. The proposed methods were validated on the large-scale real-world urban automated driving nuPlan dataset. Evaluated using closed-loop metrics, the results demonstrated that the proposed method significantly outperformed the baseline employing the identical policy model structure and achieved competitive performance compared to the state-of-the-art method.

| **[InSyn: Modeling Complex Interactions for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13397v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate pedestrian trajectory prediction is crucial for intelligent applications, yet it remains highly challenging due to the complexity of interactions among pedestrians. Previous methods have primarily relied on relative positions to model pedestrian interactions; however, they tend to overlook specific interaction patterns such as paired walking or conflicting behaviors, limiting the prediction accuracy in crowded scenarios. To address this issue, we propose InSyn (Interaction-Synchronization Network), a novel Transformer-based model that explicitly captures diverse interaction patterns (e.g., walking in sync or conflicting) while effectively modeling direction-sensitive social behaviors. Additionally, we introduce a training strategy termed Seq-Start of Seq (SSOS), designed to alleviate the common issue of initial-step divergence in numerical time-series prediction. Experiments on the ETH and UCY datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms recent baselines significantly, especially in high-density scenarios. Furthermore, the SSOS strategy proves effective in improving sequential prediction performance, reducing the initial-step prediction error by approximately 6.58%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fast and Scalable Game-Theoretic Trajectory Planning with Intentional Uncertainties](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12174v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory planning involving multi-agent interactions has been a long-standing challenge in the field of robotics, primarily burdened by the inherent yet intricate interactions among agents. While game-theoretic methods are widely acknowledged for their effectiveness in managing multi-agent interactions, significant impediments persist when it comes to accommodating the intentional uncertainties of agents. In the context of intentional uncertainties, the heavy computational burdens associated with existing game-theoretic methods are induced, leading to inefficiencies and poor scalability. In this paper, we propose a novel game-theoretic interactive trajectory planning method to effectively address the intentional uncertainties of agents, and it demonstrates both high efficiency and enhanced scalability. As the underpinning basis, we model the interactions between agents under intentional uncertainties as a general Bayesian game, and we show that its agent-form equivalence can be represented as a potential game under certain minor assumptions. The existence and attainability of the optimal interactive trajectories are illustrated, as the corresponding Bayesian Nash equilibrium can be attained by optimizing a unified optimization problem. Additionally, we present a distributed algorithm based on the dual consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) tailored to the parallel solving of the problem, thereby significantly improving the scalability. The attendant outcomes from simulations and experiments demonstrate that the proposed method is effective across a range of scenarios characterized by general forms of intentional uncertainties. Its scalability surpasses that of existing centralized and decentralized baselines, allowing for real-time interactive trajectory planning in uncertain game settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Foresight in Motion: Reinforcing Trajectory Prediction with Reward Heuristics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12083v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motion forecasting for on-road traffic agents presents both a significant challenge and a critical necessity for ensuring safety in autonomous driving systems. In contrast to most existing data-driven approaches that directly predict future trajectories, we rethink this task from a planning perspective, advocating a "First Reasoning, Then Forecasting" strategy that explicitly incorporates behavior intentions as spatial guidance for trajectory prediction. To achieve this, we introduce an interpretable, reward-driven intention reasoner grounded in a novel query-centric Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) scheme. Our method first encodes traffic agents and scene elements into a unified vectorized representation, then aggregates contextual features through a query-centric paradigm. This enables the derivation of a reward distribution, a compact yet informative representation of the target agent's behavior within the given scene context via IRL. Guided by this reward heuristic, we perform policy rollouts to reason about multiple plausible intentions, providing valuable priors for subsequent trajectory generation. Finally, we develop a hierarchical DETR-like decoder integrated with bidirectional selective state space models to produce accurate future trajectories along with their associated probabilities. Extensive experiments on the large-scale Argoverse and nuScenes motion forecasting datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances trajectory prediction confidence, achieving highly competitive performance relative to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[Schrödinger Bridge Consistency Trajectory Models for Speech Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11925v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speech enhancement (SE) utilizing diffusion models is a promising technology that improves speech quality in noisy speech data. Furthermore, the Schr\"odinger bridge (SB) has recently been used in diffusion-based SE to improve speech quality by resolving a mismatch between the endpoint of the forward process and the starting point of the reverse process. However, the SB still exhibits slow inference owing to the necessity of a large number of function evaluations (NFE) for inference to obtain high-quality results. While Consistency Models (CMs) address this issue by employing consistency training that uses distillation from pretrained models in the field of image generation, it does not improve generation quality when the number of steps increases. As a solution to this problem, Consistency Trajectory Models (CTMs) not only accelerate inference speed but also maintain a favorable trade-off between quality and speed. Furthermore, SoundCTM demonstrates the applicability of CTM techniques to the field of sound generation. In this paper, we present Schr\"odinger bridge Consistency Trajectory Models (SBCTM) by applying the CTM's technique to the Schr\"odinger bridge for SE. Additionally, we introduce a novel auxiliary loss, including a perceptual loss, into the original CTM's training framework. As a result, SBCTM achieves an approximately 16x improvement in the real-time factor (RTF) compared to the conventional Schr\"odinger bridge for SE. Furthermore, the favorable trade-off between quality and speed in SBCTM allows for time-efficient inference by limiting multi-step refinement to cases where 1-step inference is insufficient. Our code, pretrained models, and audio samples are available at https://github.com/sony/sbctm/.</p></details> |  |

This research addresses a gap in delay prediction studies within the Dutch railway network by employing an XGBoost Classifier with a focus on topological features. Current research predominantly emphasizes short-term predictions and neglects the broader network-wide patterns essential for mitigating ripple effects. This research implements and improves an existing methodology, originally designed to forecast the evolution of the fast-changing US air network, to predict delays in the Dutch Railways. By integrating Node Centrality Measures and comparing multiple classifiers like RandomForest, DecisionTree, GradientBoosting, AdaBoost, and LogisticRegression, the goal is to predict delayed trajectories. However, the results reveal limited performance, especially in non-simultaneous testing scenarios, suggesting the necessity for more context-specific adaptations. Regardless, this research contributes to the understanding of transportation network evaluation and proposes future directions for developing more robust predictive models for delays.</p></details> |  |
| **[LF: Online Multi-Robot Path Planning Meets Optimal Trajectory Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11464v1)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a multi-robot control paradigm to solve point-to-point navigation tasks for a team of holonomic robots with access to the full environment information. The framework invokes two processes asynchronously at high frequency: (i) a centralized, discrete, and full-horizon planner for computing collision- and deadlock-free paths rapidly, leveraging recent advances in multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF), and (ii) dynamics-aware, robot-wise optimal trajectory controllers that ensure all robots independently follow their assigned paths reliably. This hierarchical shift in planning representation from (i) discrete and coupled to (ii) continuous and decoupled domains enables the framework to maintain long-term scalable motion synthesis. As an instantiation of this idea, we present LF, which combines a fast state-of-the-art MAPF solver (LaCAM), and a robust feedback control stack (Freyja) for executing agile robot maneuvers. LF provides a robust and versatile mechanism for lifelong multi-robot navigation even under asynchronous and partial goal updates, and adapts to dynamic workspaces simply by quick replanning. We present various multirotor and ground robot demonstrations, including the deployment of 15 real multirotors with random, consecutive target updates while a person walks through the operational workspace.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages; under review for IEEE Robotics & Automation - Letters (RA-L)</p></details> |
| **[Trajectory Imputation in Multi-Agent Sports with Derivative-Accumulating Self-Ensemble](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10878v4)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent trajectory data collected from domains such as team sports often suffer from missing values due to various factors. While many imputation methods have been proposed for spatiotemporal data, they are not well-suited for multi-agent sports scenarios where player movements are highly dynamic and inter-agent interactions continuously evolve. To address these challenges, we propose MIDAS (Multi-agent Imputer with Derivative-Accumulating Self-ensemble), a framework that imputes multi-agent trajectories with high accuracy and physical plausibility. It jointly predicts positions, velocities, and accelerations through a Set Transformer-based neural network and generates alternative estimates by recursively accumulating predicted velocity and acceleration values. These predictions are then combined using a learnable weighted ensemble to produce final imputed trajectories. Experiments on three sports datasets demonstrate that MIDAS significantly outperforms existing baselines in both positional accuracy and physical plausibility. Lastly, we showcase use cases of MIDAS, such as approximating total distance and pass success probability, to highlight its applicability to practical downstream tasks that require complete tracking data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ECML/PKDD 2025</p></details> |

However, expert-provided instructions are limited in quantity, while synthesized annotations often lack quality, making them insufficient for large-scale research. To address this, we propose NavComposer, a novel framework for automatically generating high-quality navigation instructions. NavComposer explicitly decomposes semantic entities such as actions, scenes, and objects, and recomposes them into natural language instructions. Its modular architecture allows flexible integration of state-of-the-art techniques, while the explicit use of semantic entities enhances both the richness and accuracy of instructions. Moreover, it operates in a data-agnostic manner, supporting adaptation to diverse navigation trajectories without domain-specific training. Complementing NavComposer, we introduce NavInstrCritic, a comprehensive annotation-free evaluation system that assesses navigation instructions on three dimensions: contrastive matching, semantic consistency, and linguistic diversity. NavInstrCritic provides a holistic evaluation of instruction quality, addressing limitations of traditional metrics that rely heavily on expert annotations. By decoupling instruction generation and evaluation from specific navigation agents, our method enables more scalable and generalizable research. Extensive experiments provide direct and practical evidence for the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> |  |

While existing methods primarily focus on modeling observed motion patterns and interactions with other vehicles, they often neglect the potential risks posed by the uncertain or aggressive behaviors of surrounding vehicles. In this paper, we propose a novel spatial-temporal risk-attentive trajectory prediction framework that incorporates a risk potential field to assess perceived risks arising from behaviors of nearby vehicles. The framework leverages a spatial-temporal encoder and a risk-attentive feature fusion decoder to embed the risk potential field into the extracted spatial-temporal feature representations for trajectory prediction. A risk-scaled loss function is further designed to improve the prediction accuracy of high-risk scenarios, such as short relative spacing. Experiments on the widely used NGSIM and HighD datasets demonstrate that our method reduces average prediction errors by 4.8% and 31.2% respectively compared to state-of-the-art approaches, especially in high-risk scenarios. The proposed framework provides interpretable, risk-aware predictions, contributing to more robust decision-making for autonomous driving systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, accepted at ITSC 2025</p></details> |
| **[Learning Flexible Forward Trajectories for Masked Molecular Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16790v3)** | 2025-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have achieved notable progress in modeling discrete data, while their potential in molecular generation remains underexplored. In this work, we explore their potential and introduce the surprising result that naively applying standards MDMs severely degrades the performance. We identify the critical cause of this issue as a state-clashing problem-where the forward diffusion of distinct molecules collapse into a common state, resulting in a mixture of reconstruction targets that cannot be learned using typical reverse diffusion process with unimodal predictions. To mitigate this, we propose Masked Element-wise Learnable Diffusion (MELD) that orchestrates per-element corruption trajectories to avoid collision between distinct molecular graphs. This is achieved through a parameterized noise scheduling network that assigns distinct corruption rates to individual graph elements, i.e., atoms and bonds. Extensive experiments on diverse molecular benchmarks reveal that MELD markedly enhances overall generation quality compared to element-agnostic noise scheduling, increasing the chemical validity of vanilla MDMs on ZINC250K from 15% to 93%, Furthermore, it achieves state-of-the-art property alignment in conditional generation tasks.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods for detecting driving trajectories typically rely on map-matching the path using Global Positioning System (GPS) data, which is susceptible to GPS data outage. This paper introduces CAN-Trace, a novel privacy attack mechanism that leverages Controller Area Network (CAN) messages to uncover driving trajectories, posing a significant risk to drivers' long-term privacy. A new trajectory reconstruction algorithm is proposed to transform the CAN messages, specifically vehicle speed and accelerator pedal position, into weighted graphs accommodating various driving statuses. CAN-Trace identifies driving trajectories using graph-matching algorithms applied to the created graphs in comparison to road networks. We also design a new metric to evaluate matched candidates, which allows for potential data gaps and matching inaccuracies. Empirical validation under various real-world conditions, encompassing different vehicles and driving regions, demonstrates the efficacy of CAN-Trace: it achieves an attack success rate of up to 90.59% in the urban region, and 99.41% in the suburban region.</p></details> |  |

While prior work applying diffusion models to planning has demonstrated strong performance, it often suffers from high computational costs due to iterative sampling procedures. CTP supports fast, single-step trajectory generation without significant degradation in policy quality. We evaluate CTP on the D4RL benchmark and show that it consistently outperforms existing diffusion-based planning methods in long-horizon, goal-conditioned tasks. Notably, CTP achieves higher normalized returns while using significantly fewer denoising steps. In particular, CTP achieves comparable performance with over $120\times$ speedup in inference time, demonstrating its practicality and effectiveness for high-performance, low-latency offline planning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unified Linear Parametric Map Modeling and Perception-aware Trajectory Planning for Mobile Robotics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09340v1)** | 2025-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous navigation in mobile robots, reliant on perception and planning, faces major hurdles in large-scale, complex environments. These include heavy computational burdens for mapping, sensor occlusion failures for UAVs, and traversal challenges on irregular terrain for UGVs, all compounded by a lack of perception-aware strategies. To address these challenges, we introduce Random Mapping and Random Projection (RMRP). This method constructs a lightweight linear parametric map by first mapping data to a high-dimensional space, followed by a sparse random projection for dimensionality reduction. Our novel Residual Energy Preservation Theorem provides theoretical guarantees for this process, ensuring critical geometric properties are preserved. Based on this map, we propose the RPATR (Robust Perception-Aware Trajectory Planner) framework. For UAVs, our method unifies grid and Euclidean Signed Distance Field (ESDF) maps. The front-end uses an analytical occupancy gradient to refine initial paths for safety and smoothness, while the back-end uses a closed-form ESDF for trajectory optimization. Leveraging the trained RMRP model's generalization, the planner predicts unobserved areas for proactive navigation. For UGVs, the model characterizes terrain and provides closed-form gradients, enabling online planning to circumvent large holes. Validated in diverse scenarios, our framework demonstrates superior mapping performance in time, memory, and accuracy, and enables computationally efficient, safe navigation for high-speed UAVs and UGVs. The code will be released to foster community collaboration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Robotics (TRO) in July 2025</p></details> |
| **[Shortening the Trajectories: Identity-Aware Gaussian Approximation for Efficient 3D Molecular Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09043v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gaussian-based Probabilistic Generative Models (GPGMs) generate data by reversing a stochastic process that progressively corrupts samples with Gaussian noise. While these models have achieved state-of-the-art performance across diverse domains, their practical deployment remains constrained by the high computational cost of long generative trajectories, which often involve hundreds to thousands of steps during training and sampling. In this work, we introduce a theoretically grounded and empirically validated framework that improves generation efficiency without sacrificing training granularity or inference fidelity. Our key insight is that for certain data modalities, the noising process causes data to rapidly lose its identity and converge toward a Gaussian distribution. We analytically identify a characteristic step at which the data has acquired sufficient Gaussianity, and then replace the remaining generation trajectory with a closed-form Gaussian approximation. Unlike existing acceleration techniques that coarsening the trajectories by skipping steps, our method preserves the full resolution of learning dynamics while avoiding redundant stochastic perturbations between `Gaussian-like' distributions. Empirical results across multiple data modalities demonstrate substantial improvements in both sample quality and computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[GoalNet: Goal Areas Oriented Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19002v2)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting the future trajectories of pedestrians on the road is an important task for autonomous driving. The pedestrian trajectory prediction is affected by scene paths, pedestrian's intentions and decision-making, which is a multi-modal problem. Most recent studies use past trajectories to predict a variety of potential future trajectory distributions, which do not account for the scene context and pedestrian targets. Instead of predicting the future trajectory directly, we propose to use scene context and observed trajectory to predict the goal points first, and then reuse the goal points to predict the future trajectories. By leveraging the information from scene context and observed trajectory, the uncertainty can be limited to a few target areas, which represent the "goals" of the pedestrians. In this paper, we propose GoalNet, a new trajectory prediction neural network based on the goal areas of a pedestrian. Our network can predict both pedestrian's trajectories and bounding boxes. The overall model is efficient and modular, and its outputs can be changed according to the usage scenario. Experimental results show that GoalNet significantly improves the previous state-of-the-art performance by 48.7% on the JAAD and 40.8% on the PIE dataset.</p></details> |  |

| **[Boundary-Guided Trajectory Prediction for Road Aware and Physically Feasible Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06740v2)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of surrounding road users' trajectories is essential for safe and efficient autonomous driving. While deep learning models have improved performance, challenges remain in preventing off-road predictions and ensuring kinematic feasibility. Existing methods incorporate road-awareness modules and enforce kinematic constraints but lack plausibility guarantees and often introduce trade-offs in complexity and flexibility. This paper proposes a novel framework that formulates trajectory prediction as a constrained regression guided by permissible driving directions and their boundaries. Using the agent's current state and an HD map, our approach defines the valid boundaries and ensures on-road predictions by training the network to learn superimposed paths between left and right boundary polylines. To guarantee feasibility, the model predicts acceleration profiles that determine the vehicle's travel distance along these paths while adhering to kinematic constraints. We evaluate our approach on the Argoverse-2 dataset against the HPTR baseline. Our approach shows a slight decrease in benchmark metrics compared to HPTR but notably improves final displacement error and eliminates infeasible trajectories. Moreover, the proposed approach has superior generalization to less prevalent maneuvers and unseen out-of-distribution scenarios, reducing the off-road rate under adversarial attacks from 66% to just 1%. These results highlight the effectiveness of our approach in generating feasible and robust predictions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in the 36th IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV 2025)</p></details> |

However, most existing methods are limited by domain specificity (e.g., facial or human videos) or an excessive dependence on high-level text guidance, which often fails to capture motion details and results in unrealistic reconstructions. To address these challenges, we propose a Trajectory-Guided Generative Video Coding framework (dubbed T-GVC). T-GVC employs a semantic-aware sparse motion sampling pipeline to effectively bridge low-level motion tracking with high-level semantic understanding by extracting pixel-wise motion as sparse trajectory points based on their semantic importance, not only significantly reducing the bitrate but also preserving critical temporal semantic information. In addition, by incorporating trajectory-aligned loss constraints into diffusion processes, we introduce a training-free latent space guidance mechanism to ensure physically plausible motion patterns without sacrificing the inherent capabilities of generative models. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms both traditional codecs and state-of-the-art end-to-end video compression methods under ULB conditions. Furthermore, additional experiments confirm that our approach achieves more precise motion control than existing text-guided methods, paving the way for a novel direction of generative video coding guided by geometric motion modeling.</p></details> |  |

To enlarge the training data, model-based offline RL learns a dynamics model which is utilized as a virtual environment to generate simulation data and enhance policy learning. However, existing data augmentation methods for offline RL suffer from (i) trivial improvement from short-horizon simulation; and (ii) the lack of evaluation and correction for generated data, leading to low-qualified augmentation. In this paper, we propose offline trajectory optimization for offline reinforcement learning (OTTO). The key motivation is to conduct long-horizon simulation and then utilize model uncertainty to evaluate and correct the augmented data. Specifically, we propose an ensemble of Transformers, a.k.a. World Transformers, to predict environment state dynamics and the reward function. Three strategies are proposed to use World Transformers to generate long-horizon trajectory simulation by perturbing the actions in the offline data. Then, an uncertainty-based World Evaluator is introduced to firstly evaluate the confidence of the generated trajectories and then perform the correction for low-confidence data. Finally, we jointly use the original data with the corrected augmentation data to train an offline RL algorithm. OTTO serves as a plug-in module and can be integrated with existing model-free offline RL methods. Experiments on various benchmarks show that OTTO can effectively improve the performance of representative offline RL algorithms, including in complex environments with sparse rewards like AntMaze.

However, the practical application of DLLMs is hindered by a critical architectural constraint: the need for a statically predefined generation length. This static length allocation leads to a problematic trade-off: insufficient lengths cripple performance on complex tasks, while excessive lengths incur significant computational overhead and sometimes result in performance degradation. While the inference framework is rigid, we observe that the model itself possesses internal signals that correlate with the optimal response length for a given task. To bridge this gap, we leverage these latent signals and introduce DAEDAL, a novel training-free denoising strategy that enables Dynamic Adaptive Length Expansion for Diffusion Large Language Models. DAEDAL operates in two phases: 1) Before the denoising process, DAEDAL starts from a short initial length and iteratively expands it to a coarse task-appropriate length, guided by a sequence completion metric. 2) During the denoising process, DAEDAL dynamically intervenes by pinpointing and expanding insufficient generation regions through mask token insertion, ensuring the final output is fully developed. Extensive experiments on DLLMs demonstrate that DAEDAL achieves performance comparable, and in some cases superior, to meticulously tuned fixed-length baselines, while simultaneously enhancing computational efficiency by achieving a higher effective token ratio. By resolving the static length constraint, DAEDAL unlocks new potential for DLLMs, bridging a critical gap with their Autoregressive counterparts and paving the way for more efficient and capable generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at https://github.com/Li-Jinsong/DAEDAL</p></details> |

A key step in Bellman dynamic programming algorithms is the policy evaluation, which becomes computationally demanding in infinite-horizon settings such as average-reward or discounted-reward formulations. In the context of Markov chains, aggregation and disaggregation techniques have for a long time been used to reduce complexity by exploiting structural decompositions. In this work, we extend these principles to a structured class of MDPs. We define the Single-Input Superstate Decomposable Markov Decision Process (SISDMDP), which combines Chiu's single-input decomposition with Robertazzi's single-cycle recurrence property. When a policy induces this structure, the resulting transition graph can be decomposed into interacting components with centralized recurrence. We develop an exact and efficient policy evaluation method based on this structure. This yields a scalable solution applicable to both average and discounted reward MDPs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint article submitted to ValueTools2025</p></details> |

Pronoun usage, especially concerning gender-neutral and neopronouns, remains a key challenge for responsible AI. Prior work, such as the MISGENDERED benchmark, revealed significant limitations in earlier LLMs' handling of inclusive pronouns, but was constrained to outdated models and limited evaluations. In this study, we introduce MISGENDERED+, an extended and updated benchmark for evaluating LLMs' pronoun fidelity. We benchmark five representative LLMs, GPT-4o, Claude 4, DeepSeek-V3, Qwen Turbo, and Qwen2.5, across zero-shot, few-shot, and gender identity inference. Our results show notable improvements compared with previous studies, especially in binary and gender-neutral pronoun accuracy. However, accuracy on neopronouns and reverse inference tasks remains inconsistent, underscoring persistent gaps in identity-sensitive reasoning. We discuss implications, model-specific observations, and avenues for future inclusive AI research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agentic large language models improve retrieval-based radiology question answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00743v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clinical decision-making in radiology increasingly benefits from artificial intelligence (AI), particularly through large language models (LLMs). However, traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems for radiology question answering (QA) typically rely on single-step retrieval, limiting their ability to handle complex clinical reasoning tasks. Here we propose an agentic RAG framework enabling LLMs to autonomously decompose radiology questions, iteratively retrieve targeted clinical evidence from Radiopaedia, and dynamically synthesize evidence-based responses. We evaluated 24 LLMs spanning diverse architectures, parameter scales (0.5B to >670B), and training paradigms (general-purpose, reasoning-optimized, clinically fine-tuned), using 104 expert-curated radiology questions from previously established RSNA-RadioQA and ExtendedQA datasets. Agentic retrieval significantly improved mean diagnostic accuracy over zero-shot prompting (73% vs. 64%; P<0.001) and conventional online RAG (73% vs. 68%; P<0.001). The greatest gains occurred in mid-sized models (e.g., Mistral Large improved from 72% to 81%) and small-scale models (e.g., Qwen 2.5-7B improved from 55% to 71%), while very large models (>200B parameters) demonstrated minimal changes (<2% improvement). Additionally, agentic retrieval reduced hallucinations (mean 9.4%) and retrieved clinically relevant context in 46% of cases, substantially aiding factual grounding. Even clinically fine-tuned models exhibited meaningful improvements (e.g., MedGemma-27B improved from 71% to 81%), indicating complementary roles of retrieval and fine-tuning. These results highlight the potential of agentic frameworks to enhance factuality and diagnostic accuracy in radiology QA, particularly among mid-sized LLMs, warranting future studies to validate their clinical utility.</p></details> |  |

Their ability to assume roles and personalities based on predefined character biographies has positioned them as cost-effective substitutes for human participants in social science research. This paper explores the validity of such persona-based agents in representing human populations; we recreate the HEXACO personality inventory experiment by surveying 310 GPT-4 powered agents, conducting factor analysis on their responses, and comparing these results to the original findings presented by Ashton, Lee, & Goldberg in 2004. Our results found 1) a coherent and reliable personality structure was recoverable from the agents' responses demonstrating partial alignment to the HEXACO framework. 2) the derived personality dimensions were consistent and reliable within GPT-4, when coupled with a sufficiently curated population, and 3) cross-model analysis revealed variability in personality profiling, suggesting model-specific biases and limitations. We discuss the practical considerations and challenges encountered during the experiment. This study contributes to the ongoing discourse on the potential benefits and limitations of using generative agents in social science research and provides useful guidance on designing consistent and representative agent personas to maximise coverage and representation of human personality traits.</p></details> | 26 pages, 14 figures |

To address this gap, we conduct the first systematic study of hallucinations in multi-image MLLMs and propose MIHBench, a benchmark specifically tailored for evaluating object-related hallucinations across multiple images. MIHBench comprises three core tasks: Multi-Image Object Existence Hallucination, Multi-Image Object Count Hallucination, and Object Identity Consistency Hallucination, targeting semantic understanding across object existence, quantity reasoning, and cross-view identity consistency. Through extensive evaluation, we identify key factors associated with the occurrence of multi-image hallucinations, including: a progressive relationship between the number of image inputs and the likelihood of hallucination occurrences; a strong correlation between single-image hallucination tendencies and those observed in multi-image contexts; and the influence of same-object image ratios and the positional placement of negative samples within image sequences on the occurrence of object identity consistency hallucination. To address these challenges, we propose a Dynamic Attention Balancing mechanism that adjusts inter-image attention distributions while preserving the overall visual attention proportion. Experiments across multiple state-of-the-art MLLMs demonstrate that our method effectively reduces hallucination occurrences and enhances semantic integration and reasoning stability in multi-image scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACM M...</summary><p>ACM MM25 has accepted this paper</p></details> |

While existing methods have demonstrated the promise of large-scale pretrained models for image dehazing, their architecture-specific designs hinder adaptability across diverse scenarios with different accuracy and efficiency requirements. In this work, we systematically investigate the generalization capability of pretrained depth representations-learned from millions of diverse images-for image dehazing. Our empirical analysis reveals that the learned deep depth features maintain remarkable consistency across varying haze levels. Building on this insight, we propose a plug-and-play RGB-D fusion module that seamlessly integrates with diverse dehazing architectures.

While comprehensive benchmarks exist for assessing LLM performance in English, there remains a significant gap in evaluation resources for other languages. Moreover, because most LLMs are trained primarily on data rooted in European and American cultures, they often lack familiarity with non-Western cultural contexts. To address this limitation, our study focuses on the Persian language and Iranian culture. We introduce 19 new evaluation datasets specifically designed to assess LLMs on topics such as Iranian law, Persian grammar, Persian idioms, and university entrance exams. Using these datasets, we benchmarked 41 prominent LLMs, aiming to bridge the existing cultural and linguistic evaluation gap in the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

However, most existing models are task-specific and lack generalization across patient populations. Inspired by the autoregressive paradigm of large language models, we introduce CGM-LSM, a Transformer decoder-based Large Sensor Model (LSM) pretrained on 1.6 million CGM records from patients with different diabetes types, ages, and genders. We model patients as sequences of glucose time steps to learn latent knowledge embedded in CGM data and apply it to the prediction of glucose readings for a 2-hour horizon. Compared with prior methods, CGM-LSM significantly improves prediction accuracy and robustness: a 48.51% reduction in root mean square error in one-hour horizon forecasting and consistent zero-shot prediction performance across held-out patient groups. We analyze model performance variations across patient subgroups and prediction scenarios and outline key opportunities and challenges for advancing CGM foundation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting Adversarial Patch Defenses on Object Detectors: Unified Evaluation, Large-Scale Dataset, and New Insights](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00649v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing reliable defenses against patch attacks on object detectors has attracted increasing interest. However, we identify that existing defense evaluations lack a unified and comprehensive framework, resulting in inconsistent and incomplete assessments of current methods. To address this issue, we revisit 11 representative defenses and present the first patch defense benchmark, involving 2 attack goals, 13 patch attacks, 11 object detectors, and 4 diverse metrics. This leads to the large-scale adversarial patch dataset with 94 types of patches and 94,000 images. Our comprehensive analyses reveal new insights: (1) The difficulty in defending against naturalistic patches lies in the data distribution, rather than the commonly believed high frequencies. Our new dataset with diverse patch distributions can be used to improve existing defenses by 15.09% AP@0.5. (2) The average precision of the attacked object, rather than the commonly pursued patch detection accuracy, shows high consistency with defense performance. (3) Adaptive attacks can substantially bypass existing defenses, and defenses with complex/stochastic models or universal patch properties are relatively robust. We hope that our analyses will serve as guidance on properly evaluating patch attacks/defenses and advancing their design. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/Gandolfczjh/APDE, where we will keep integrating new attacks/defenses.</p></details> |  |
| **[MCeT: Behavioral Model Correctness Evaluation using Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00630v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Behavioral model diagrams, e.g., sequence diagrams, are an essential form of documentation that are typically designed by system engineers from requirements documentation, either fully manually or assisted by design tools. With the growing use of Large Language Models (LLM) as AI modeling assistants, more automation will be involved in generating diagrams. This necessitates the advancement of automatic model correctness evaluation tools. Such a tool can be used to evaluate both manually and AI automatically generated models; to provide feedback to system engineers, and enable AI assistants to self-evaluate and self-enhance their generated models. In this paper, we propose MCeT, the first fully automated tool to evaluate the correctness of a behavioral model, sequence diagrams in particular, against its corresponding requirements text and produce a list of issues that the model has. We utilize LLMs for the correctness evaluation tasks as they have shown outstanding natural language understanding ability. However, we show that directly asking an LLM to compare a diagram to requirements finds less than 35% of issues that experienced engineers can find. We propose to supplement the direct check with a fine-grained, multi-perspective approach; we split the diagram into atomic, non-divisible interactions, and split the requirements text into atomic, self-contained items. We compare the diagram with atomic requirements and each diagram-atom with the requirements. We also propose a self-consistency checking approach that combines perspectives to mitigate LLM hallucinated issues. Our combined approach improves upon the precision of the direct approach from 0.58 to 0.81 in a dataset of real requirements. Moreover, the approach finds 90% more issues that the experienced engineers found than the direct approach, and reports an average of 6 new issues per diagram.</p></details> | MODELS 2025 |
| **[A Context-Aware Dual-Metric Framework for Confidence Estimation in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00600v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate confidence estimation is essential for trustworthy large language models (LLMs) systems, as it empowers the user to determine when to trust outputs and enables reliable deployment in safety-critical applications. Current confidence estimation methods for LLMs neglect the relevance between responses and contextual information, a crucial factor in output quality evaluation, particularly in scenarios where background knowledge is provided. To bridge this gap, we propose CRUX (Context-aware entropy Reduction and Unified consistency eXamination), the first framework that integrates context faithfulness and consistency for confidence estimation via two novel metrics. First, contextual entropy reduction represents data uncertainty with the information gain through contrastive sampling with and without context. Second, unified consistency examination captures potential model uncertainty through the global consistency of the generated answers with and without context. Experiments across three benchmark datasets (CoQA, SQuAD, QuAC) and two domain-specific datasets (BioASQ, EduQG) demonstrate CRUX's effectiveness, achieving the highest AUROC than existing baselines.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in LVMs have facilitated their integration into Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios, offering superior generalization and adaptability for vision-assisted network optimization. In this paper, we first investigate the functionalities and core architectures of LVMs, highlighting their capabilities across classification, segmentation, generation, and multimodal visual processing. We then explore a variety of LVM applications in wireless communications, covering representative tasks across the physical layer, network layer, and application layer. Furthermore, given the substantial model size of LVMs and the challenges of model retraining in wireless domains, we propose a progressive fine-tuning framework that incrementally adapts pretrained LVMs for joint optimization of multiple IoT tasks. A case study in low-altitude economy networks (LAENets) demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed framework over conventional CNNs in joint beamforming and positioning tasks for Internet of drones, underscoring a promising direction for integrating LVMs into intelligent wireless systems.</p></details> | 7 pages, 6 figures |

An important example is the Zig-Zag process of [Ann. Stats. 47 (2019) 1288 - 1320] where clever sub-sampling has been shown to produce an essentially independent sample at a cost that does not scale with the size of the data. However, sub-sampling also leads to slower convergence and poor mixing of the process, a behaviour which questions the promised scalability of the algorithm. We provide a large sample scaling analysis of the Zig-Zag process and its sub-sampling versions in settings of parametric Bayesian inference. In the transient phase of the algorithm, we show that the Zig-Zag trajectories are well approximated by the solution to a system of ODEs. These ODEs possess a drift in the direction of decreasing KL-divergence between the assumed model and the true distribution and are explicitly characterized in the paper. In the stationary phase, we give weak convergence results for different versions of the Zig-Zag process. Based on our results, we estimate that for large data sets of size n, using suitable control variates with sub-sampling in Zig-Zag, the algorithm costs O(1) to obtain an essentially independent sample; a computational speed-up of O(n) over the canonical version of Zig-Zag and other traditional MCMC methods</p></details> | <details><summary>50 pa...</summary><p>50 pages, 7 figues, 1 table</p></details> |

It is an important problem in intelligent transportation systems, with a plethora of methods been proposed. Existing efforts mainly focus on capturing and utilizing spatio-temporal dependencies to predict future traffic flows. Though promising, they fall short in adapting to test-time environmental changes of traffic conditions. To tackle this challenge, we propose to introduce large language models (LLMs) to help traffic flow forecasting and design a novel method named Large Language Model Enhanced Traffic Flow Predictor (LEAF). LEAF adopts two branches, capturing different spatio-temporal relations using graph and hypergraph structures respectively. The two branches are first pre-trained individually, and during test-time, they yield different predictions. Based on these predictions, a large language model is used to select the most likely result. Then, a ranking loss is applied as the learning objective to enhance the prediction ability of the two branches. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed LEAF.</p></details> | Accepted by ACL 2025 |

Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) improves model generalization for both Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers by encouraging convergence to locally flat minima. However, the connection between sharpness and generalization has not been fully explored for LoRA due to the lack of tools to either empirically seek flat minima or develop theoretical methods. In this work, we propose Flat-LoRA and its efficient version i.e., EFlat-LoRA, to seek flat minima for LoRA. Concretely, we theoretically demonstrate that perturbations in the full parameter space can be transferred to the low-rank subspace. This approach eliminates the potential interference introduced by perturbations across multiple matrices in the low-rank subspace. Our extensive experiments on large language models and vision-language models demonstrate that EFlat-LoRA achieves optimize efficiency comparable to that of LoRA while simultaneously attaining comparable or even better performance. For example, on the GLUE dataset with RoBERTa-large, EFlat-LoRA outperforms LoRA and full fine-tuning by 1.0% and 0.5% on average, respectively. On vision-language models e.g., Qwen-VL-Chat shows performance improvements of 1.5% and 1.0% on SQA and VizWiz datasets, respectively. These empirical results also verify that the generalization of LoRA is closely related to sharpness, which is omitted by previous methods.</p></details> |  |

While automatic sign spotting holds great promise for enabling frame-level supervision at scale, it grapples with challenges such as vocabulary inflexibility and ambiguity inherent in continuous sign streams. Hence, we introduce a novel, training-free framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) to significantly enhance sign spotting quality. Our approach extracts global spatio-temporal and hand shape features, which are then matched against a large-scale sign dictionary using dynamic time warping and cosine similarity. This dictionary-based matching inherently offers superior vocabulary flexibility without requiring model retraining. To mitigate noise and ambiguity from the matching process, an LLM performs context-aware gloss disambiguation via beam search, notably without fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world sign language datasets demonstrate our method's superior accuracy and sentence fluency compared to traditional approaches, highlighting the potential of LLMs in advancing sign spotting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in the international conference on Intelligent Virtual Agents (IVA Adjunct)</p></details> |

This paper revisits the problem of packing calls across Media Processor (MP) servers that host the calls within individual datacenters (DCs). We show that the algorithm used in Teams -- a large scale conferencing service as well as other state-of-art algorithms are prone to placing calls resulting in some of the MPs becoming hot (high CPU utilization) that leads to degraded performance and/or elevated hosting costs. The problem arises from disregarding the variability in CPU usage among calls, influenced by differences in participant numbers and media types (audio/video), compounded by bursty call arrivals. To tackle this, we propose Tetris, a multi-step framework which (a) optimizes initial call assignments by leveraging historical data and (b) periodically migrates calls from hot MPs using linear optimization, aiming to minimize hot MP usage. Evaluation based on a 24-hour trace of over 10 million calls in one DC shows that Tetris reduces participant numbers on hot MPs by at least 2.5X.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Type Annotation in Python Using Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00422v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Type annotations in Python enhance maintainability and error detection. However, generating these annotations manually is error prone and requires extra effort. Traditional automation approaches like static analysis, machine learning, and deep learning struggle with limited type vocabularies, behavioral over approximation, and reliance on large labeled datasets. In this work, we explore the use of LLMs for generating type annotations in Python. We develop a generate check repair pipeline: the LLM proposes annotations guided by a Concrete Syntax Tree representation, a static type checker (Mypy) verifies them, and any errors are fed back for iterative refinement. We evaluate four LLM variants: GPT 4oMini, GPT 4.1mini (general-purpose), and O3Mini, O4Mini (reasoning optimized), on 6000 code snippets from the ManyTypes4Py benchmark. We first measure the proportion of code snippets annotated by LLMs for which MyPy reported no errors (i.e., consistent results): GPT 4oMini achieved consistency on 65.9% of cases (34.1% inconsistent), while GPT 4.1mini, O3Mini, and O4Mini each reached approximately 88.6% consistency (around 11.4% failures). To measure annotation quality, we then compute exact-match and base-type match accuracies over all 6000 snippets: GPT 4.1mini and O3Mini perform the best, achieving up to 70.5% exact match and 79.1% base type accuracy, requiring under one repair iteration on average. Our results demonstrate that general-purpose and reasoning optimized LLMs, without any task specific fine tuning or additional training can be effective in generating consistent type annotations.They perform competitively with traditional deep learning techniques which require large labeled dataset for training. While our work focuses on Python, the pipeline can be extended to other optionally typed imperative languages like Ruby</p></details> | Under Review |

Recent alternatives that explore various self-reward signals exhibit the eliciting potential of LLM reasoning, but suffer from the non-negligible collapse issue. Inspired by the success of self-supervised learning, we propose \textit{Co-Reward}, a novel RL framework that leverages contrastive agreement across semantically analogical questions as a reward basis. Specifically, we construct a similar question for each training sample (without labels) and synthesize their individual surrogate labels through a simple rollout voting, and then the reward is constructed by cross-referring the labels of each question pair to enforce the internal reasoning consistency across analogical inputs. Intuitively, such a self-supervised reward-shaping mechanism increases the difficulty of learning collapse into a trivial solution, and promotes stable reasoning elicitation and improvement through expanding the input sample variants. Empirically, Co-Reward achieves superior performance compared to other self-reward baselines on multiple reasoning benchmarks and LLM series, and reaches or even surpasses ground-truth (GT) labeled reward, with improvements of up to $+6.8\%$ on MATH500 over GT reward on Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/tmlr-group/Co-Reward.</p></details> |  |

This paper provides a critical analysis of benchmark effectiveness, examining mainstream prominent LLM benchmarks using results from diverse models. We first propose Pseudo-Siamese Network for Item Response Theory (PSN-IRT), an enhanced Item Response Theory framework that incorporates a rich set of item parameters within an IRT-grounded architecture. PSN-IRT can be utilized for accurate and reliable estimations of item characteristics and model abilities. Based on PSN-IRT, we conduct extensive analysis on 11 LLM benchmarks comprising 41,871 items, revealing significant and varied shortcomings in their measurement quality. Furthermore, we demonstrate that leveraging PSN-IRT is able to construct smaller benchmarks while maintaining stronger alignment with human preference.</p></details> |  |

Evaluating and analyzing their logical reasoning abilities has therefore become essential. However, existing datasets and benchmarks are often limited to overly simplistic, unnatural, or contextually constrained examples. In response to the growing demand, we introduce SmartyPat-Bench, a challenging, naturally expressed, and systematically labeled benchmark derived from real-world high-quality Reddit posts containing subtle logical fallacies. Unlike existing datasets and benchmarks, it provides more detailed annotations of logical fallacies and features more diverse data. To further scale up the study and address the limitations of manual data collection and labeling - such as fallacy-type imbalance and labor-intensive annotation - we introduce SmartyPat, an automated framework powered by logic programming-based oracles. SmartyPat utilizes Prolog rules to systematically generate logically fallacious statements, which are then refined into fluent natural-language sentences by LLMs, ensuring precise fallacy representation. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that SmartyPat produces fallacies comparable in subtlety and quality to human-generated content and significantly outperforms baseline methods. Finally, experiments reveal nuanced insights into LLM capabilities, highlighting that while excessive reasoning steps hinder fallacy detection accuracy, structured reasoning enhances fallacy categorization performance.</p></details> |  |

Despite their scalability advantages, existing approaches often incorporate anchor structures in a heuristic or task-agnostic manner, either through post-hoc graph construction or as auxiliary components for message passing. Such designs overlook the core structural demands of anchor-based clustering, neglecting key optimization principles. To bridge this gap, we revisit the underlying optimization problem of large-scale anchor-based multi-view clustering and unfold its iterative solution into a novel deep network architecture, termed LargeMvC-Net. The proposed model decomposes the anchor-based clustering process into three modules: RepresentModule, NoiseModule, and AnchorModule, corresponding to representation learning, noise suppression, and anchor indicator estimation. Each module is derived by unfolding a step of the original optimization procedure into a dedicated network component, providing structural clarity and optimization traceability. In addition, an unsupervised reconstruction loss aligns each view with the anchor-induced latent space, encouraging consistent clustering structures across views. Extensive experiments on several large-scale multi-view benchmarks show that LargeMvC-Net consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both effectiveness and scalability.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |

Existing privacy controls are often static and coarse-grained, failing to accommodate the dynamic and socially nuanced nature of home environments. This paper investigates the viability of using Large Language Models (LLMs) as the core of a dynamic and adaptive privacy policy engine. We propose a conceptual framework where visual data is classified using a multi-dimensional schema that considers data sensitivity, spatial context, and social presence. An LLM then reasons over this contextual information to enforce fine-grained privacy rules, such as selective object obfuscation, in real-time. Through a comparative evaluation of state-of-the-art Vision Language Models (including GPT-4o and the Qwen-VL series) in simulated home settings , our findings show the feasibility of this approach. The LLM-based engine achieved a top machine-evaluated appropriateness score of 3.99 out of 5, and the policies generated by the models received a top human-evaluated score of 4.00 out of 5.</p></details> |  |

However, the rapid pace of their deployment has outpaced a comprehensive understanding of their internal mechanisms and a delineation of their capabilities and limitations. A desired attribute of an intelligent system is its ability to recognize the scope of its own knowledge. To investigate whether LLMs embody this characteristic, we develop a benchmark designed to challenge these models to enumerate all information they possess on specific topics. This benchmark evaluates whether the models recall excessive, insufficient, or the precise amount of information, thereby indicating their awareness of their own knowledge. Our findings reveal that all tested LLMs, given sufficient scale, demonstrate an understanding of how much they know about specific topics. While different architectures exhibit varying rates of this capability's emergence, the results suggest that awareness of knowledge may be a generalizable attribute of LLMs. Further research is needed to confirm this potential and fully elucidate the underlying mechanisms.</p></details> | <details><summary>ublis...</summary><p>ublished as a long paper at the 2024 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP).

Specifically, it takes in 32 input images at a resolution of 960x540 and produces the Gaussian reconstruction in just 1 second on a single A100 GPU. To handle the long sequence of 250K tokens brought by the large input size, Long-LRM features a mixture of the recent Mamba2 blocks and the classical transformer blocks, enhanced by a light-weight token merging module and Gaussian pruning steps that balance between quality and efficiency. We evaluate Long-LRM on the large-scale DL3DV benchmark and Tanks&Temples, demonstrating reconstruction quality comparable to the optimization-based methods while achieving an 800x speedup w.r.t. the optimization-based approaches and an input size at least 60x larger than the previous feed-forward approaches. We conduct extensive ablation studies on our model design choices for both rendering quality and computation efficiency. We also explore Long-LRM's compatibility with other Gaussian variants such as 2D GS, which enhances Long-LRM's ability in geometry reconstruction.

However, their diagnostic reliability in complex clinical scenarios remains limited. This study aims to enhance LLMs' diagnostic accuracy and clinical reasoning ability. Method: We propose an Etiology-Aware Attention Steering Framework to integrate structured clinical reasoning into LLM-based diagnosis. Specifically, we first construct Clinical Reasoning Scaffolding (CRS) based on authoritative clinical guidelines for three representative acute abdominal emergencies: acute appendicitis, acute pancreatitis, and acute cholecystitis. Next, we develop the Etiology-Aware Head Identification algorithm to pinpoint attention heads crucial for the model's etiology reasoning. To ensure reliable clinical reasoning alignment, we introduce the Reasoning-Guided Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning that embeds etiological reasoning cues into input representations and steers the selected Etiology-Aware Heads toward critical information through a Reasoning-Guided Loss function. Result: On the Consistent Diagnosis Cohort, our framework improves average diagnostic accuracy by 15.65% and boosts the average Reasoning Focus Score by 31.6% over baselines. External validation on the Discrepant Diagnosis Cohort further confirms its effectiveness in enhancing diagnostic accuracy. Further assessments via Reasoning Attention Frequency indicate that our models exhibit enhanced reliability when faced with real-world complex scenarios. Conclusion: This study presents a practical and effective approach to enhance clinical reasoning in LLM-based diagnosis. By aligning model attention with structured CRS, the proposed framework offers a promising paradigm for building more interpretable and reliable AI diagnostic systems in complex clinical settings.</p></details> | 23 pages, 8 figures |

To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{HumaniBench}, a novel benchmark of 32,000 real-world image-question pairs and an evaluation suite. Labels are generated via an AI-assisted pipeline and validated by experts. HumaniBench assesses LMMs across seven key alignment principles: fairness, ethics, empathy, inclusivity, reasoning, robustness, and multilinguality, through diverse open-ended and closed-ended VQA tasks. Grounded in AI ethics and real-world needs, these principles provide a holistic lens for societal impact. Benchmarking results on different LMM shows that proprietary models generally lead in reasoning, fairness, and multilinguality, while open-source models excel in robustness and grounding. Most models struggle to balance accuracy with ethical and inclusive behavior. Techniques like Chain-of-Thought prompting and test-time scaling improve alignment. As the first benchmark tailored for HC alignment, HumaniBench offers a rigorous testbed to diagnose limitations, and promote responsible LMM development. All data and code are publicly available for reproducibility. Keywords: HumaniBench, vision-language models, responsible AI benchmark, AI alignment evaluation, AI ethics assessment, fairness in AI models, visual question answering (VQA) benchmark, image captioning evaluation, visual grounding tasks, trustworthy AI models, Chain-of-Thought prompting, test-time scaling, ethical AI development tools.</p></details> |  |

However, compared with traditional wireless networks, LAWNs face unique security challenges due to low-altitude operations, frequent mobility and reliance on unlicensed spectrum, making it more vulnerable to some malicious attacks. In this paper, we investigate some large artificial intelligence model (LAM)-enabled solutions for secure communications in LAWNs. Specifically, we first explore the amplified security risks and important limitations of traditional AI methods in LAWNs. Then, we introduce the basic concepts of LAMs and delve into the role of LAMs in addressing these challenges. To demonstrate the practical benefits of LAMs for secure communications in LAWNs, we propose a novel LAM-based optimization framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate enhanced state features on top of handcrafted representations, and to design intrinsic rewards accordingly, thereby improving reinforcement learning performance for secure communication tasks. Through a typical case study, simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Finally, we outline future directions for integrating LAMs into secure LAWN applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been submitted to IEEE Communications Magazine for consideration</p></details> |

With the rise of large language models (LLMs), there is a growing interest in using LLMs for graph model generation. Nevertheless, LLM-based graph model generation typically produces partially correct models that suffer from three main issues: (1) syntax violations: the generated model may not adhere to the syntax defined by its metamodel, (2) constraint inconsistencies: the structure of the model might not conform to some domain-specific constraints, and (3) inaccuracy: due to the inherent uncertainty in LLMs, the models can include inaccurate, hallucinated elements. While the first issue is often addressed through techniques such as constraint decoding or filtering, the latter two remain largely unaddressed. Motivated by recent self-consistency approaches in LLMs, we propose a novel abstraction-concretization framework that enhances the consistency and quality of generated graph models by considering multiple outputs from an LLM. Our approach first constructs a probabilistic partial model that aggregates all candidate outputs and then refines this partial model into the most appropriate concrete model that satisfies all constraints. We evaluate our framework on several popular open-source and closed-source LLMs using diverse datasets for model generation tasks. The results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves both the consistency and quality of the generated graph models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ACM / IEEE 28th International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems (MODELS 2025)</p></details> |
| **[A Survey on Post-training of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06072v3)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has fundamentally transformed natural language processing, making them indispensable across domains ranging from conversational systems to scientific exploration. However, their pre-trained architectures often reveal limitations in specialized contexts, including restricted reasoning capacities, ethical uncertainties, and suboptimal domain-specific performance. These challenges necessitate advanced post-training language models (PoLMs) to address these shortcomings, such as OpenAI-o1/o3 and DeepSeek-R1 (collectively known as Large Reasoning Models, or LRMs). This paper presents the first comprehensive survey of PoLMs, systematically tracing their evolution across five core paradigms: Fine-tuning, which enhances task-specific accuracy; Alignment, which ensures ethical coherence and alignment with human preferences; Reasoning, which advances multi-step inference despite challenges in reward design; Efficiency, which optimizes resource utilization amidst increasing complexity; Integration and Adaptation, which extend capabilities across diverse modalities while addressing coherence issues. Charting progress from ChatGPT's alignment strategies to DeepSeek-R1's innovative reasoning advancements, we illustrate how PoLMs leverage datasets to mitigate biases, deepen reasoning capabilities, and enhance domain adaptability. Our contributions include a pioneering synthesis of PoLM evolution, a structured taxonomy categorizing techniques and datasets, and a strategic agenda emphasizing the role of LRMs in improving reasoning proficiency and domain flexibility. As the first survey of its scope, this work consolidates recent PoLM advancements and establishes a rigorous intellectual framework for future research, fostering the development of LLMs that excel in precision, ethical robustness, and versatility across scientific and societal applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>87 pa...</summary><p>87 pages, 21 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |
| **[Leveraging Large Language Model for Information Retrieval-based Bug Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00253v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Information Retrieval-based Bug Localization aims to identify buggy source files for a given bug report. While existing approaches -- ranging from vector space models to deep learning models -- have shown potential in this domain, their effectiveness is often limited by the vocabulary mismatch between bug reports and source code. To address this issue, we propose a novel Large Language Model (LLM) based bug localization approach, called GenLoc. Given a bug report, GenLoc leverages an LLM equipped with code-exploration functions to iteratively analyze the code base and identify potential buggy files. To gather better context, GenLoc may optionally retrieve semantically relevant files using vector embeddings. GenLoc has been evaluated on over 9,000 real-world bug reports from six large-scale Java projects. Experimental results show that GenLoc outperforms five state-of-the-art bug localization techniques across multiple metrics, achieving an average improvement of more than 60\% in Accuracy@1.</p></details> |  |

In this context, the Iterative Rational Krylov Algorithm (\IRKA) is a well established method for computing an optimal projection space of fixed dimension $r$, when the system has small or medium dimensions. However, for large problems the performance of \IRKA\ is not satisfactory. In this paper, we introduce a new rational Krylov subspace projection method with conveniently selected shifts, that can effectively handle large-scale problems. The projection subspace is generated sequentially, and the \IRKA\ procedure is employed on the projected problem to produce a new optimal rational space of dimension $r$ for the reduced problem, and the associated shifts. The latter are then injected to expand the projection space. Truncation of older information of the generated space is performed to limit memory requirements. Numerical experiments on benchmark problems illustrate the effectiveness of the new method.</p></details> |  |

While extrinsics in such arrays are fixed due to the physical setup, intrinsics often vary across sessions due to factors like lens adjustments or temperature changes. In this paper, we propose a dense-feature-driven multi-frame calibration method that refines intrinsics directly from scene data, eliminating the necessity for additional calibration captures. Our approach enhances traditional Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pipelines by introducing an extrinsics regularization term to progressively align estimated extrinsics with ground-truth values, a dense feature reprojection term to reduce keypoint errors by minimizing reprojection loss in the feature space, and an intrinsics variance term for joint optimization across multiple frames. Experiments on the Multiface dataset show that our method achieves nearly the same precision as dedicated calibration processes, and significantly enhances intrinsics and 3D reconstruction accuracy. Fully compatible with existing SfM pipelines, our method provides an efficient and practical plug-and-play solution for large-scale camera setups.

Despite challenges like biases and hallucinations, these Artificial Intelligence (AI) models excel in tasks, such as content creation, translation, and code generation. Fine-tuning and novel architectures, such as Mixture of Experts (MoE), address these issues. Over the past two years, numerous open-source foundational and fine-tuned models have been introduced, complicating the selection of the optimal LLM for researchers and companies regarding licensing and hardware requirements. To navigate the rapidly evolving LLM landscape and facilitate LLM selection, we present a comparative list of foundational and domain-specific models, focusing on features, such as release year, licensing, and hardware requirements. This list is published on GitLab and will be continuously updated.</p></details> |  |

This minimizer may be non-unique. We study strong laws of large numbers for sets of generalized Fr\'echet means. Following generalizations are considered: the minimizers of $\mathbb E[d(Y, q)^\alpha]$ for $\alpha > 0$, the minimizers of $\mathbb E[H(d(Y, q))]$ for integrals $H$ of non-decreasing functions, and the minimizers of $\mathbb E[\mathfrak c(Y, q)]$ for a quite unrestricted class of cost functions $\mathfrak c$. We show convergence of empirical versions of these sets in outer limit and in one-sided Hausdorff distance. The derived results require only minimal assumptions.</p></details> |  |

How will seeing AI-generated ideas affect human ideas? We conducted an experiment (800+ participants, 40+ countries) where participants viewed creative ideas that were from ChatGPT or prior experimental participants and then brainstormed their own idea. We varied the number of AI-generated examples (none, low, or high exposure) and if the examples were labeled as 'AI' (disclosure). Our dynamic experiment design -- ideas from prior participants in an experimental condition are used as stimuli for future participants in the same experimental condition -- speaks to the interdependent process of cultural creation: creative ideas are built upon prior ideas. Hence, we capture the compounding effects of having LLMs 'in the culture loop'. We find that high AI exposure (but not low AI exposure) did not affect the creativity of individual ideas but did increase the average amount and rate of change of collective idea diversity. AI made ideas different, not better. There were no main effects of disclosure. We also found that self-reported creative people were less influenced by knowing an idea was from AI and that participants may knowingly adopt AI ideas when the task is difficult. Our findings suggest that introducing AI ideas may increase collective diversity but not individual creativity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ACM Collective Intelligence 2025.

However, current studies suffer from the problem of lacking reasoning-based large-scale affordance prediction data, leading to considerable concern about open-world effectiveness. To address this limitation, we build a large-scale grasping-oriented affordance segmentation benchmark with human-like instructions, named RAGNet. It contains 273k images, 180 categories, and 26k reasoning instructions. The images cover diverse embodied data domains, such as wild, robot, ego-centric, and even simulation data. They are carefully annotated with an affordance map, while the difficulty of language instructions is largely increased by removing their category name and only providing functional descriptions. Furthermore, we propose a comprehensive affordance-based grasping framework, named AffordanceNet, which consists of a VLM pre-trained on our massive affordance data and a grasping network that conditions an affordance map to grasp the target. Extensive experiments on affordance segmentation benchmarks and real-robot manipulation tasks show that our model has a powerful open-world generalization ability.

With the increasing proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) and smart manufacturing, time-series data has dramatically increased in both scale and dimensionality. This growth has exposed the limitations of traditional statistical methods in handling the high heterogeneity and complexity of such data. Inspired by the recent success of large language models (LLMs) in multimodal tasks across language and vision domains, we propose a novel unsupervised anomaly detection framework: A Tri-Branch Patch-wise Large Language Model Framework for Time-Series Anomaly Detection (TriP-LLM). TriP-LLM integrates local and global temporal features through a tri-branch design-Patching, Selection, and Global-to encode the input time series into patch-wise tokens, which are then processed by a frozen, pretrained LLM. A lightweight patch-wise decoder reconstructs the input, from which anomaly scores are derived. We evaluate TriP-LLM on several public benchmark datasets using PATE, a recently proposed threshold-free evaluation metric, and conduct all comparisons within a unified open-source framework to ensure fairness. Experimental results show that TriP-LLM consistently outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods across all datasets, demonstrating strong detection capabilities. Furthermore, through extensive ablation studies, we verify the substantial contribution of the LLM to the overall architecture. Compared to LLM-based approaches using Channel Independence (CI) patch processing, TriP-LLM achieves significantly lower memory consumption, making it more suitable for GPU memory-constrained environments. All code and model checkpoints are publicly available on https://github.com/YYZStart/TriP-LLM.git</p></details> | 11 pages, 2 figures |

However, the high reported accuracy of these advanced models on popular datasets, reliance on purely numerical evaluation and potential benchmark leakage, often masks their true reasoning shortcomings. To address this, we propose leveraging the inherent rigor and methodological complexity of mathematical proofs as a diagnostic tool to expose these hidden failures. Specifically, we introduce the RFMDataset (Reveal Failure Modes), a collection of 200 diverse mathematical proof problems, and thoroughly evaluate advanced models' performance on it. Our in-depth analysis of their failures uncovers 10 fine-grained error types, which shows fundamental limitations in current large reasoning models: 1) large reasoning models grapple profoundly with mathematical proofs, with some generating entirely correct proofs for less than 20% of problems and failing even on basic ones; 2) models exhibit a diverse spectrum of reasoning failures, prominently demonstrating the lack of guarantees for the correctness and rigor of single-step reasoning; and 3) models show hallucination and incompleteness during the reasoning process. Our findings reveal that models' self-reflection is insufficient to resolve the current logical dilemmas, necessitating formalized and fine-grained logical training.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we describe our experience in using Large Language Models towards automating the code review process in Ericsson. We describe the development of a lightweight tool using LLMs and static program analysis.

A Quantitative Evaluation of various Large Language Models on Word Sense Disambiguation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18337v4)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ambiguous words are often found in modern digital communications. Lexical ambiguity challenges traditional Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) methods, due to limited data. Consequently, the efficiency of translation, information retrieval, and question-answering systems is hindered by these limitations. This study investigates the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve WSD using a novel approach combining a systematic prompt augmentation mechanism with a knowledge base (KB) consisting of different sense interpretations. The proposed method incorporates a human-in-loop approach for prompt augmentation where prompt is supported by Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging, synonyms of ambiguous words, aspect-based sense filtering and few-shot prompting to guide the LLM. By utilizing a few-shot Chain of Thought (COT) prompting-based approach, this work demonstrates a substantial improvement in performance. The evaluation was conducted using FEWS test data and sense tags.

Nonetheless, FedLLMs remain vulnerable to model poisoning attacks. This article first reviews recent advancements in model poisoning techniques and existing defense mechanisms for FedLLMs, underscoring critical limitations, especially when dealing with non-IID textual data distributions. Current defense strategies predominantly employ distance or similarity-based outlier detection mechanisms, relying on the assumption that malicious updates markedly differ from benign statistical patterns. However, this assumption becomes inadequate against adaptive adversaries targeting billion-parameter LLMs. The article further investigates graph representation-based model poisoning (GRMP), an emerging attack paradigm that exploits higher-order correlations among benign client gradients to craft malicious updates indistinguishable from legitimate ones. GRMP can effectively circumvent advanced defense systems, causing substantial degradation in model accuracy and overall performance. Moreover, the article outlines a forward-looking research roadmap that emphasizes the necessity of graph-aware secure aggregation methods, specialized vulnerability metrics tailored for FedLLMs, and evaluation frameworks to enhance the robustness of federated language model deployments.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures (Submitted to IEEE Communication Magazine)</p></details> |

These complexities are difficult to address through traditional teaching methods, which often struggle to provide scalable, personalized feedback, especially in large classes. We introduce DUET (Diagrammatic UML & ER Tutor), a prototype of an LLM-based tool, which converts a reference diagram and a student-submitted diagram into a textual representation and provides structured feedback based on the differences. It uses a multi-stage LLM pipeline to compare diagrams and generate reflective feedback. Furthermore, the tool enables analytical insights for educators, aiming to foster self-directed learning and inform instructional strategies. We evaluated DUET through semi-structured interviews with six participants, including two educators and four teaching assistants. They identified strengths such as accessibility, scalability, and learning support alongside limitations, including reliability and potential misuse. Participants also suggested potential improvements, such as bulk upload functionality and interactive clarification features. DUET presents a promising direction for integrating LLMs into modeling education and offers a foundation for future classroom integration and empirical evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Learn...</summary><p>Learnersourcing: Student-generated Content @ Scale Workshop at L@S 2025</p></details> |

However, applying LLMs to long document reranking remains computationally expensive and may be ineffective. Moreover, the internal behavior of LLMs during document relevance judgment is still underexplored. In this paper, we begin with an in-depth analysis of decoder-only LLM attention patterns and find that several attention heads consistently align with relevance signals, yet this alignment deteriorates as irrelevant content increases. Motivated by this observation, we revisit and extend the block selection paradigm, introducing KeyB2, a scalable reranking framework that combines block pre-selection with powerful decoder-only LLMs. KeyB2 generalizes the selection stage to support BM25, cross-encoder, and bi-encoder, and adapts LLM to compute fine-grained relevance scores. We further introduce a new bi-encoder strategy that performs strongly and efficiently. Extensive experiments on TREC DL 2019/2023 document task, Robust04, and MLDR-zh demonstrate that KeyB2 outperforms baselines including RankLLaMA, RankLLaMA-MaxP/AvgP, and KeyB, achieving new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on TREC DL 2019 document reranking task. In addition, KeyB2 reduces reranking latency compared with RankLLaMA by over 83% and memory usage by over 74%, positioning it as a practical and effective solution for long document ranking with LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, we formulate a manifold-regularised variant of the $\ell_p$-SVDD method to encourage label smoothness on the underlying manifold to capture structural information for improved detection performance. Drawing on an existing Representer theorem, we then provide an effective optimisation technique for the proposed method and show that it can benefit from the signature kernel to capture time series complexities for anomaly detection. We theoretically study the proposed approach using Rademacher complexities to analyse its generalisation performance and also provide an experimental assessment of the proposed method across various data sets to compare its performance against other methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Pragmatic Mind of Machines: Tracing the Emergence of Pragmatic Competence in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18497v2)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated emerging capabilities in social intelligence tasks, including implicature resolution and theory-of-mind reasoning, both of which require substantial pragmatic understanding. However, how LLMs acquire this pragmatic competence throughout the training process remains poorly understood. In this work, we introduce ALTPRAG, a dataset grounded in the pragmatic concept of alternatives, to evaluate whether LLMs at different training stages can accurately infer nuanced speaker intentions. Each instance pairs two equally plausible yet pragmatically divergent continuations and requires the model to (i) infer the speaker's intended meaning and (ii) explain when and why a speaker would choose one utterance over its alternative, thus directly probing pragmatic competence through contrastive reasoning. We systematically evaluate 22 LLMs across 3 key training stages: after pre-training, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and preference optimization, to examine the development of pragmatic competence. Our results show that even base models exhibit notable sensitivity to pragmatic cues, which improves consistently with increases in model and data scale. Additionally, SFT and RLHF contribute further gains, particularly in cognitive-pragmatic scenarios. These findings highlight pragmatic competence as an emergent and compositional property of LLM training and offer new insights for aligning models with human communicative norms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Policy Learning from Large Vision-Language Model Feedback without Reward Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23391v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline reinforcement learning (RL) provides a powerful framework for training robotic agents using pre-collected, suboptimal datasets, eliminating the need for costly, time-consuming, and potentially hazardous online interactions. This is particularly useful in safety-critical real-world applications, where online data collection is expensive and impractical. However, existing offline RL algorithms typically require reward labeled data, which introduces an additional bottleneck: reward function design is itself costly, labor-intensive, and requires significant domain expertise. In this paper, we introduce PLARE, a novel approach that leverages large vision-language models (VLMs) to provide guidance signals for agent training. Instead of relying on manually designed reward functions, PLARE queries a VLM for preference labels on pairs of visual trajectory segments based on a language task description. The policy is then trained directly from these preference labels using a supervised contrastive preference learning objective, bypassing the need to learn explicit reward models. Through extensive experiments on robotic manipulation tasks from the MetaWorld, PLARE achieves performance on par with or surpassing existing state-of-the-art VLM-based reward generation methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of PLARE in real-world manipulation tasks with a physical robot, further validating its practical applicability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IROS 2025</p></details> |

Targeting this problem, we introduce Visual Number Benchmark (VisNumBench) to evaluate the number sense abilities of MLLMs across a wide range of visual numerical tasks. VisNumBench consists of about 1,900 multiple-choice question-answer pairs derived from both synthetic and real-world visual data, covering seven visual numerical attributes and four types of visual numerical estimation tasks. Our experiments on VisNumBench led to the following key findings: (i) The 17 MLLMs we tested, including open-source models such as Qwen2.5-VL and InternVL2.5, as well as proprietary models like GPT-4o and Gemini 2.0 Flash, perform significantly below human levels in number sense-related tasks. (ii) Multimodal mathematical models and multimodal chain-of-thought (CoT) models did not exhibit significant improvements in number sense abilities. (iii) Stronger MLLMs with larger parameter sizes and broader general abilities demonstrate modest gains in number sense abilities. We believe VisNumBench will serve as a valuable resource for the research community, encouraging further advancements in enhancing MLLMs' number sense abilities.

Recent efforts from natural language processing (NLP) have shown the effectiveness of layer pruning, offering a plausible training-free compression solution. However, due to the modality divergence between vision and language, it is unclear whether these NLP techniques are still effective in LVLMs. In this paper, we empirically prove that directly applying these layer pruning methods to LVLMs is ineffective. Through extensive experiments, we find that non-essential vision-language (VL) tokens and inter-layer feature gaps pose critical challenges to pruning layers in LVLMs. Based on these insights, we propose a novel framework Short-LVLM (SVL) that can utilize important VL tokens and mitigate the layer-wise feature gaps. Notably, Short-LVLM not only achieves a superior trade-off between performance and efficiency but also exhibits several potential advantages, i.e., training-free, model-agnostic, and highly compatible. The code for this work is publicly available at https://github.com/ASGO-MM/Short-LVLM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted By ACM MM 25</p></details> |
| **[Mitigating Hallucination of Large Vision-Language Models via Dynamic Logits Calibration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21509v2)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated significant advancements in multimodal understanding, yet they are frequently hampered by hallucination-the generation of text that contradicts visual input. Existing training-free decoding strategies exhibit critical limitations, including the use of static constraints that do not adapt to semantic drift during generation, inefficiency stemming from the need for multiple forward passes, and degradation of detail due to overly rigid intervention rules. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces Dynamic Logits Calibration (DLC), a novel training-free decoding framework designed to dynamically align text generation with visual evidence at inference time. At the decoding phase, DLC step-wise employs CLIP to assess the semantic alignment between the input image and the generated text sequence. Then, the Relative Visual Advantage (RVA) of candidate tokens is evaluated against a dynamically updated contextual baseline, adaptively adjusting output logits to favor tokens that are visually grounded. Furthermore, an adaptive weighting mechanism, informed by a real-time context alignment score, carefully balances the visual guidance while ensuring the overall quality of the textual output. Extensive experiments conducted across diverse benchmarks and various LVLM architectures (such as LLaVA, InstructBLIP, and MiniGPT-4) demonstrate that DLC significantly reduces hallucinations, outperforming current methods while maintaining high inference efficiency by avoiding multiple forward passes. Overall, we present an effective and efficient decoding-time solution to mitigate hallucinations, thereby enhancing the reliability of LVLMs for more practices. Code will be released on Github.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pruning All-Rounder: Rethinking and Improving Inference Efficiency for Large Vision Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06458v2)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved impressive results, their high computational costs pose a significant barrier to wide application. To enhance inference efficiency, most existing approaches can be categorized as parameter-dependent or token-dependent strategies to reduce computational demands. However, parameter-dependent methods require retraining LVLMs to recover performance while token-dependent strategies struggle to consistently select the most relevant tokens. In this paper, we systematically analyze the above challenges and provide a series of valuable insights for inference acceleration. Based on these findings, we propose a novel framework, the Pruning All-Rounder (PAR). Different from previous works, PAR develops a meta-router to adaptively organize pruning flows across both tokens and layers. With a self-supervised learning manner, our method achieves a superior balance between performance and efficiency. Notably, PAR is highly flexible, offering multiple pruning versions to address a range of acceleration scenarios. The code for this work is publicly available at https://github.com/ASGO-MM/Pruning-All-Rounder.</p></details> | Accepted by ICCV 25 |

We present our latest Hindi-English bi-lingual LLM \textbf{Mantra-14B} with ~3\% average improvement in benchmark scores over both languages, outperforming models twice its size. Using a curated dataset composed of English and Hindi instruction data of 485K samples, we instruction tuned models such as Qwen-2.5-14B-Instruct and Phi-4 to improve performance over both English and Hindi. Our experiments encompassing seven different LLMs of varying parameter sizes and over 140 training attempts with varying English-Hindi training data ratios demonstrated that it is possible to significantly improve multilingual performance without compromising native performance. Further, our approach avoids resource-intensive techniques like vocabulary expansion or architectural modifications, thus keeping the model size small. Our results indicate that modest fine-tuning with culturally and locally informed data can bridge performance gaps without incurring significant computational overhead. We release our training code, datasets, and models under mit and apache licenses to aid further research towards under-represented and low-resource languages.</p></details> | 24 pages, 18 figures |

Our benchmark, Continual-MEGA, includes a large and diverse dataset that significantly expands existing evaluation settings by combining carefully curated existing datasets with our newly proposed dataset, ContinualAD. In addition to standard continual learning with expanded quantity, we propose a novel scenario that measures zero-shot generalization to unseen classes, those not observed during continual adaptation. This setting poses a new problem setting that continual adaptation also enhances zero-shot performance. We also present a unified baseline algorithm that improves robustness in few-shot detection and maintains strong generalization. Through extensive evaluations, we report three key findings: (1) existing methods show substantial room for improvement, particularly in pixel-level defect localization; (2) our proposed method consistently outperforms prior approaches; and (3) the newly introduced ContinualAD dataset enhances the performance of strong anomaly detection models. We release the benchmark and code in https://github.com/Continual-Mega/Continual-Mega.</p></details> |  |

But conventional approaches rely on outcome-only rewards that provide sparse feedback, resulting in inefficient optimization process. In this work, we investigate the function of process reward models (PRMs) to accelerate the RL training for LRMs. We propose a novel intrinsic signal-driven generative process evaluation mechanism operating at the thought level to address major bottlenecks in RL-based training. Specifically, instead of requiring PRMs to know how to solve problems, our method uses intrinsic signals in solutions to judge stepwise correctness and aggregate contiguous correct/incorrect steps into coherent 'thought' units. This structured, thought-level rewards enable more reliable credit assignment by reducing ambiguity in step segmentation and alleviating reward hacking. We further introduce a capability-adaptive reward mechanism that dynamically balances exploration and exploitation based on the LRM's current proficiency, guiding learning without stifling creative trial-and-error. These innovations are integrated into a new off-policy RL algorithm, TP-GRPO, which extends grouped proximal optimization with process-based rewards and improves training efficiency. Experiments on 1.5B and 7B parameter LRMs demonstrate that our method achieves higher problem-solving accuracy with significantly fewer training samples than outcome-only reward baselines. The results validate that well-structured process rewards can substantially accelerate LRM optimization in math reasoning tasks.

However, they continue to suffer from significant hallucination issues, including object, attribute, and relational hallucinations. To accurately detect these hallucinations, we investigated the variations in cross-modal attention patterns between hallucination and non-hallucination states. Leveraging these distinctions, we developed a lightweight detector capable of identifying hallucinations. Our proposed method, Detecting Hallucinations by Cross-modal Attention Patterns (DHCP), is straightforward and does not require additional LVLM training or extra LVLM inference steps. Experimental results show that DHCP achieves remarkable performance in hallucination detection. By offering novel insights into the identification and analysis of hallucinations in LVLMs, DHCP contributes to advancing the reliability and trustworthiness of these models.

However, their tendency to generate lengthy chain-of-thought sequences leads to substantial memory overhead during inference. We observe that LRMs frequently produce highly similar intermediate reasoning steps, which correspond to similar KV cache states across layers. Motivated by this observation, we propose MemShare, a novel KV cache management approach that effectively reduces memory overhead. MemShare employs a collaborative filtering algorithm to efficiently identify reusable KV cache blocks and enables zero copy cache reuse to significantly reduce memory overhead, improve throughput while maintaining accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that MemShare delivers up to 84.79\% improvement in throughput while maintaining better accuracy compared to existing KV cache management methods.</p></details> | 11 pages, 7 figures |

Recent work leverages multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to improve retrieval, especially for long or complex query-candidate pairs. However, we observe that the naive application of MLLMs, i.e., retrieval based on candidate likelihood, introduces candidate prior bias, favoring candidates with inherently higher priors over those more relevant to the query. To this end, we propose a novel retrieval framework, Bidirectional Likelihood Estimation with MLLM (BLiM), which leverages both query and candidate likelihoods by training the model to generate text from a given video as well as video features from a given text. Furthermore, we introduce Candidate Prior Normalization (CPN), a simple yet effective training-free score calibration module designed to mitigate candidate prior bias in candidate likelihood. On four Text-Video Retrieval benchmarks, our BLiM equipped with CPN outperforms previous state-of-the-art models by 6.4 R@1 on average, effectively alleviating candidate prior bias and emphasizing query-candidate relevance. Our in-depth analysis across various multi-modal tasks beyond retrieval highlights the broad applicability of CPN which enhances visual understanding by reducing reliance on textual priors.

Leveraging the intrinsic importance differences among experts, recent research has explored expert-level compression techniques to improve the efficiency of MoE LLMs. However, existing approaches often rely on empirical criteria to identify critical experts, lacking a deeper exploration and understanding of the heterogeneous importance of experts. In this study, we present the first discovery and investigation of a distinct subset of experts that play a crucial role in the underlying mechanisms during the model's forward inference. These experts are prevalent in open-source MoE LLMs, and despite their limited number, pruning them leads to a significant decline in model performance (e.g., pruning three causes Qwen3-30B-A3B to produce repetitive and uninformative outputs). We refer to these experts as Super Experts (SEs). Our comprehensive analysis provides progressively deeper insights into SEs. (i) SEs are characterized by rare but extreme activation outliers in the output of the down_proj, which give rise to massive activations in the hidden states between decoder layers. Moreover, the distribution of SEs remains model-specific and is unaffected by post-training processes. (ii) By pruning SEs, we assess their significance across a variety of tasks, revealing their considerable impact on the model's overall performance, particularly in mathematical reasoning. (iii) We further enhance our understanding of the influence of SEs compression. Our findings confirm that MoE LLMs rely on SEs to induce attention sinks, which are crucial for the distribution of attention scores but are significantly disrupted by SE pruning.

In particular, directly generating explicit 3D representations, such as 3D Gaussian splatting, has attracted significant attention due to its fast and high-quality rendering, as well as numerous applications. However, many state-of-the-art methods, primarily based on transformer architectures, suffer from severe scalability issues because they rely on full attention across image tokens from multiple input views, resulting in prohibitive computational costs as the number of views or image resolution increases. Toward a scalable and efficient feed-forward 3D reconstruction, we introduce an iterative Large 3D Reconstruction Model (iLRM) that generates 3D Gaussian representations through an iterative refinement mechanism, guided by three core principles: (1) decoupling the scene representation from input-view images to enable compact 3D representations; (2) decomposing fully-attentional multi-view interactions into a two-stage attention scheme to reduce computational costs; and (3) injecting high-resolution information at every layer to achieve high-fidelity reconstruction. Experimental results on widely used datasets, such as RE10K and DL3DV, demonstrate that iLRM outperforms existing methods in both reconstruction quality and speed. Notably, iLRM exhibits superior scalability, delivering significantly higher reconstruction quality under comparable computational cost by efficiently leveraging a larger number of input views.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://gynjn.github.io/iLRM/</p></details> |

However, existing code generation benchmarks primarily assess the functional correctness of code generated by LLMs in single-turn interactions. They offer limited insight into LLMs' abilities to generate code that strictly follows users' instructions in multi-turn interaction scenarios. In this paper, we introduce CodeIF-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating the instruction-following capabilities of LLMs in interactive code generation. Specifically, CodeIF-Bench incorporates nine types of verifiable instructions aligned with the real-world software development requirements, which can be independently and objectively validated through specified test cases, facilitating the evaluation of instruction-following capability in multi-turn interactions. In both \textit{Static Conversation} and \textit{Dynamic Conversation} settings, we evaluate the performance of 7 state-of-the-art LLMs and summarize the important factors influencing the instruction-following ability of LLMs in multi-turn interactions, as well as potential directions for improvement.</p></details> |  |

Existing evaluation methods suffer from issues such as data contamination, black-box operation, and subjective preference. These issues make it difficult to evaluate the LLMs' true capabilities comprehensively. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel benchmark-free evaluation paradigm, LLM-Crowdsourced. It utilizes LLMs to generate questions, answer independently, and evaluate mutually. This method integrates four key evaluation criteria: dynamic, transparent, objective, and professional, which existing evaluation methods cannot satisfy simultaneously. Experiments on eight mainstream LLMs across mathematics and programming verify the advantages of our method in distinguishing LLM performance. Furthermore, our study reveals several novel findings that are difficult for traditional methods to detect, including but not limited to: (1) Gemini demonstrates the highest original and professional question-design capabilities among others; (2) Some LLMs exhibit ''memorization-based answering'' by misrecognizing questions as familiar ones with a similar structure; (3) LLM evaluation results demonstrate high consistency (robustness).</p></details> |  |

Our study suggests a concerning reality: Large Language Models (LLMs) fail to represent diverse cultural moral frameworks despite their linguistic capabilities. We expose significant gaps between AI-generated and human moral intuitions by applying the Moral Foundations Questionnaire across 19 cultural contexts. Comparing multiple state-of-the-art LLMs' origins against human baseline data, we find these models systematically homogenize moral diversity. Surprisingly, increased model size doesn't consistently improve cultural representation fidelity. Our findings challenge the growing use of LLMs as synthetic populations in social science research and highlight a fundamental limitation in current AI alignment approaches. Without data-driven alignment beyond prompting, these systems cannot capture the nuanced, culturally-specific moral intuitions. Our results call for more grounded alignment objectives and evaluation metrics to ensure AI systems represent diverse human values rather than flattening the moral landscape.</p></details> | <details><summary>15pag...</summary><p>15pages, 1 figure, 2 tables</p></details> |

Existing methods for temporal expression either conflate time with text-based numerical values, add a series of dedicated temporal tokens, or regress time using specialized temporal grounding heads. To address these issues, we introduce DisTime, a lightweight framework designed to enhance temporal comprehension in Video-LLMs. DisTime employs a learnable token to create a continuous temporal embedding space and incorporates a Distribution-based Time Decoder that generates temporal probability distributions, effectively mitigating boundary ambiguities and maintaining temporal continuity. Additionally, the Distribution-based Time Encoder re-encodes timestamps to provide time markers for Video-LLMs. To overcome temporal granularity limitations in existing datasets, we propose an automated annotation paradigm that combines the captioning capabilities of Video-LLMs with the localization expertise of dedicated temporal models. This leads to the creation of InternVid-TG, a substantial dataset with 1.25M temporally grounded events across 179k videos, surpassing ActivityNet-Caption by 55 times. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DisTime achieves state-of-the-art performance across benchmarks in three time-sensitive tasks while maintaining competitive performance in Video QA tasks.

These systems often involve complex processes with unknown governing rules, observed by sensor-based time series. To aid decision-making in industrial and engineering contexts, data-driven predictive models are used to forecast spatiotemporal dynamics of urban systems. Current models such as graph neural networks have shown promise but face a trade-off between efficacy and efficiency due to computational demands. Hence, their applications in large-scale networks still require further efforts. This paper addresses this trade-off challenge by drawing inspiration from physical laws to inform essential model designs that align with fundamental principles and avoid architectural redundancy. By understanding both micro- and macro-processes, we present a principled interpretable neural diffusion scheme based on Transformer-like structures whose attention layers are induced by low-dimensional embeddings. The proposed scalable spatiotemporal Transformer (ScaleSTF), with linear complexity, is validated on large-scale urban systems including traffic flow, solar power, and smart meters, showing state-of-the-art performance and remarkable scalability. Our results constitute a fresh perspective on the dynamics prediction in large-scale urban networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics</p></details> |

ChatVis employs chain-of-thought prompt simplification, retrieval-augmented prompt generation using a vector database of documentation and code examples, and error checking with iterative prompt feedback to correct errors until a visualization is produced. An integral part of our approach is a benchmark suite of canonical visualization tasks, ParaView regression tests, and scientific use cases that includes comprehensive evaluation metrics.

Despite growing recognition of bias in LLMs, prompt engineering strategies specifically addressing Arab and Muslim representation remain understudied. This mixed-methods systematic review examines such techniques, offering evidence-based guidance for researchers and practitioners. Following PRISMA guidelines and Kitchenham's systematic review methodology, we analyzed 8 empirical studies published between 2021-2024 investigating bias mitigation strategies. Our findings reveal five primary prompt engineering approaches: cultural prompting, affective priming, self-debiasing techniques, structured multi-step pipelines, and parameter-optimized continuous prompts. Although all approaches show potential for reducing bias, effectiveness varied substantially across studies and bias types. Evidence suggests that certain bias types may be more resistant to prompt-based mitigation than others. Structured multi-step pipelines demonstrated the highest overall effectiveness, achieving up to 87.7% reduction in bias, though they require greater technical expertise. Cultural prompting offers broader accessibility with substantial effectiveness. These results underscore the accessibility of prompt engineering for mitigating cultural bias without requiring access to model parameters. The limited number of studies identified highlights a significant research gap in this critical area. Future research should focus on developing culturally adaptive prompting techniques, creating Arab and Muslim-specific evaluation resources, and integrating prompt engineering with complementary debiasing methods to address deeper stereotypes while maintaining model utility.</p></details> | <details><summary>Resea...</summary><p>Research is incomplete</p></details> |

While automatic configuration frameworks have been developed, they rely on manually constrained search spaces and yield limited performance gains. This work introduces a novel paradigm which effectively optimizes complex SAT solvers via Large Language Models (LLMs), and a tool called AutoModSAT is developed. Three fundamental challenges are addressed in order to achieve superior performance: (1) LLM-friendly solver: Systematic guidelines are proposed for developing a modularized solver to meet LLMs' compatibility, emphasizing code simplification, information share and bug reduction; (2) Automatic prompt optimization: An unsupervised automatic prompt optimization method is introduced to advance the diversity of LLMs' output; (3) Efficient search strategy: We design a presearch strategy and an EA evolutionary algorithm for the final efficient and effective discovery of heuristics. Extensive experiments across a wide range of datasets demonstrate that AutoModSAT achieves 50% performance improvement over the baseline solver and achieves 30% superiority against the state-of-the-art (SOTA) solvers. Moreover, AutoModSAT attains a 20% speedup on average compared to parameter-tuned alternatives of the SOTA solvers, showcasing the enhanced capability in handling complex problem instances. This work bridges the gap between AI-driven heuristics discovery and mission-critical system optimization, and provides both methodological advancements and empirically validated results for next-generation complex solver development.</p></details> |  |

However, research in applied history suggests that people have difficulty finding appropriate analogies. And previous studies in the AI community have also overlooked historical analogies. To fill this gap, in this paper, we focus on the historical analogy acquisition task, which aims to acquire analogous historical events for a given event. We explore retrieval and generation methods for acquiring historical analogies based on different large language models (LLMs). Furthermore, we propose a self-reflection method to mitigate hallucinations and stereotypes when LLMs generate historical analogies. Through human evaluations and our specially designed automatic multi-dimensional assessment, we find that LLMs generally have a good potential for historical analogies. And the performance of the models can be further improved by using our self-reflection method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2025 (Outstanding Paper Award)</p></details> |

However, due to the inherently lengthy nature of long-text data, existing LCU benchmarks for LLMs often result in prohibitively high evaluation costs, like testing time and inference expenses. Through extensive experimentation, we discover that existing LCU benchmarks exhibit significant redundancy, which means the inefficiency in evaluation. In this paper, we propose a concise data compression method tailored for long-text data with sparse information characteristics. By pruning the well-known LCU benchmark LongBench, we create MiniLongBench. This benchmark includes only 237 test samples across six major task categories and 21 distinct tasks. Through empirical analysis of over 60 LLMs, MiniLongBench achieves an average evaluation cost reduced to only 4.5% of the original while maintaining an average rank correlation coefficient of 0.97 with LongBench results. Therefore, our MiniLongBench, as a low-cost benchmark, holds great potential to substantially drive future research into the LCU capabilities of LLMs. See https://github.com/MilkThink-Lab/MiniLongBench for our code, data and tutorial.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACL'25 main track</p></details> |

Their token-level representations capture rich, human-aligned semantics. However, pooling these vectors into a text embedding discards crucial information. Nevertheless, many non-generative downstream tasks, such as clustering, classification, or retrieval, still depend on accurate and controllable sentence- or document-level embeddings. We explore several adaptation strategies for pre-trained, decoder-only LLMs: (i) various aggregation techniques for token embeddings, (ii) task-specific prompt engineering, and (iii) text-level augmentation via contrastive fine-tuning. Combining these components yields state-of-the-art performance on the English clustering track of the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB). An analysis of the attention map further shows that fine-tuning shifts focus from prompt tokens to semantically relevant words, indicating more effective compression of meaning into the final hidden state. Our experiments demonstrate that LLMs can be effectively adapted as text embedding models through a combination of prompt engineering and resource-efficient contrastive fine-tuning on synthetically generated positive pairs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Ultra-Low-Bit Quantization of Large Language Models Through Saliency-Aware Partial Retraining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13932v3)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing use of large language models has raised environmental and economic concerns about their intensity of resource usage during inference. Serving these models to each user requires substantial energy and water for cooling. Model compression techniques like quantization can shrink large language models and make them more resource efficient at the cost of potential performance degradation. Quantization methods compress model size through replacing their high-precision parameters by quantized values of lower precision. Among existing methods, the ApiQ method achieves superior accuracy preservation at minimal memory and time overhead. We investigate two ideas to extend performance in ultra-low-bit quantization beyond ApiQ's level. First, we look into combining existing quantization-aware training techniques with ApiQ's partial training. We show that this does not outperform the baseline ApiQ method with limited training data and frozen weights. This leads to two key insights: (1) The substantial representational capacity that is gained through full retraining is unlikely to be feasible through partial training. (2) This gain may depend on using a large and diverse dataset in quantization-aware training. Second, through a novel approach informed by the two insights, we propose an ultra-low-bit quantization method that builds upon ApiQ and extends its performance without the need for full retraining. This publicly available method relies on a saliency-aware regularization term that prioritizes preserving the most impactful parameters during quantization. Our experiments on LLaMA 7B and 13B benchmarks demonstrate that our method reduces the ApiQ's accuracy degradation by 10.85% and 7.54% respectively. A Python implementation of the proposed quantization method is publicly available on GitHub https://github.com/TokuyuSou/ULB-SAPR.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a post-peer-review accepted manuscript from the proceedings of the 22nd International Conference on Modeling Decisions for Artificial Intelligence (MDAI'25).

With very large monitoring databases becoming expensive to explore, the use of AI and Generative AI can help reduce costs of managing these datasets. This paper explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to revolutionize network monitoring management by addressing the limitations of query finding and pattern analysis. We leverage LLMs to enhance anomaly detection, automate root-cause analysis, and automate incident analysis to build a well-monitored network management team using AI. Through a real-world example of developing our own OFCNetLLM, based on the open-source LLM model, we demonstrate practical applications of OFCnetLLM in the OFC conference network. Our model is developed as a multi-agent approach and is still evolving, and we present early results here.</p></details> |  |

Compared to approaches predicated on GUI metadata, which are platform-dependent and vulnerable to implementation variations, vision-based approaches offer broader applicability. In this vision-based paradigm, the GUI instruction grounding, which maps user instruction to the location of corresponding element on the given screenshot, remains a critical challenge, particularly due to limited public training dataset and resource-intensive manual instruction data annotation. In this paper, we delve into unexplored challenges in this task including element-to-screen ratio, unbalanced element type, and implicit instruction. To address these challenges, we introduce a large-scale data synthesis pipeline UI-E2I-Synth for generating varying complex instruction datasets using GPT-4o instead of human annotators. Furthermore, we propose a new GUI instruction grounding benchmark UI-I2E-Bench, which is designed to address the limitations of existing benchmarks by incorporating diverse annotation aspects. Our model, trained on the synthesized data, achieves superior performance in GUI instruction grounding, demonstrating the advancements of proposed data synthesis pipeline. The proposed benchmark, accompanied by extensive analyses, provides practical insights for future research in GUI grounding. We will release corresponding artifacts at https://microsoft.github.io/FIVE-UI-Evol/ .</p></details> |  |

However, the rapid development of this field has resulted in a fragmented research landscape, with diverse studies that are difficult to compare due to differences in, e.g., system designs and dataset usage. This fragmentation makes it difficult to obtain a clear overview of the state-of-the-art or compare and categorize studies meaningfully. In this work, we present a comprehensive systematic literature review (SLR) of LLM-based software vulnerability detection. We analyze 227 studies published between January 2020 and June 2025, categorizing them by task formulation, input representation, system architecture, and adaptation techniques. Further, we analyze the datasets used, including their characteristics, vulnerability coverage, and diversity. We present a fine-grained taxonomy of vulnerability detection approaches, identify key limitations, and outline actionable future research opportunities. By providing a structured overview of the field, this review improves transparency and serves as a practical guide for researchers and practitioners aiming to conduct more comparable and reproducible research. We publicly release all artifacts and maintain a living repository of LLM-based software vulnerability detection studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages + 17 pages references, 6 tables, 10 figures</p></details> |

Segmenting these structures from large-scale 3D microscopy images is challenging, limiting clinical insights especially for microglia, immune-associated cells involved in neurodegenerative diseases. Existing segmentation methods mainly focus on cell bodies, struggle with overlapping structures, perform poorly on noisy images, require hyperparameter tuning for each new dataset, or rely on tedious semi-automated approaches. We introduce trAIce3D, a deep-learning architecture designed for precise microglia segmentation, capturing both somas and branches. It employs a two-stage approach: first, a 3D U-Net with vision transformers in the encoder detects somas using a sliding-window technique to cover the entire image. Then, the same architecture, enhanced with cross-attention blocks in skip connections, refines each soma and its branches by using soma coordinates as a prompt and a 3D window around the target cell as input. Training occurs in two phases: self-supervised Soma Segmentation, followed by prompt-based Branch Segmentation, leveraging pre-trained weights from the first phase. Trained and evaluated on a dataset of 41,230 microglial cells, trAIce3D significantly improves segmentation accuracy and generalization, enabling scalable analysis of complex cellular morphologies. While optimized for microglia, its architecture can extend to other intricate cell types, such as neurons and astrocytes, broadening its impact on neurobiological research.</p></details> | 10 pages, 2 figures |

While prior research has shown that LLMs often exhibit measurable political biases--frequently skewing toward liberal or progressive positions--key gaps remain. Most existing studies evaluate only a narrow set of models and languages, leaving open questions about the generalizability of political biases across architectures, scales, and multilingual settings. Moreover, few works examine whether these biases can be actively controlled. In this work, we address these gaps through a large-scale study of political orientation in modern open-source instruction-tuned LLMs. We evaluate seven models, including LLaMA-3.1, Qwen-3, and Aya-Expanse, across 14 languages using the Political Compass Test with 11 semantically equivalent paraphrases per statement to ensure robust measurement. Our results reveal that larger models consistently shift toward libertarian-left positions, with significant variations across languages and model families. To test the manipulability of political stances, we utilize a simple center-of-mass activation intervention technique and show that it reliably steers model responses toward alternative ideological positions across multiple languages. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/d-gurgurov/Political-Ideologies-LLMs.</p></details> | pre-print |

In particular, LLM performance in Arabic lags behind, due to data scarcity, linguistic diversity of Arabic and its dialects, morphological complexity, etc. Progress is further hindered by the quality of Arabic benchmarks, which typically rely on static, publicly available data, lack comprehensive task coverage, or do not provide dedicated platforms with blind test sets. This makes it challenging to measure actual progress and to mitigate data contamination. Here, we aim to bridge these gaps. In particular, we introduce BALSAM, a comprehensive, community-driven benchmark aimed at advancing Arabic LLM development and evaluation. It includes 78 NLP tasks from 14 broad categories, with 52K examples divided into 37K test and 15K development, and a centralized, transparent platform for blind evaluation. We envision BALSAM as a unifying platform that sets standards and promotes collaborative research to advance Arabic LLM capabilities.</p></details> |  |

This dataset, collected in various photorealistic simulation environments includes multiple RGB stereo cameras for 360-degree coverage, along with depth, optical flow, stereo disparity, LiDAR point clouds, ground truth poses, semantic segmented images, and occupancy maps with semantic labels. Data is collected using an integrated automatic pipeline, which generates trajectories mimicking the motion patterns of various ground robot platforms, including wheeled and legged robots.

However, existing tools tend to generate patches that satisfy test cases without fixing the underlying bug, those are known as overfitting patches. To address this issue, Automated Patch Correctness Assessment (APCA) attempts to identify overfitting patches generated by APR tools. It can be solved as a static approach, meaning that no additional information is needed beyond the original and fixed code snippets. Current static techniques often struggle with reliability, flexibility and transparency. To address these issues, we introduce RePaCA, a novel static APCA technique that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) specialized in thinking tasks. Our model is prompted with both buggy and fixed code snippets and guided to generate a Chain of Thought that analyses code differences, reasons about how the patch addresses the root cause, and ultimately provides a binary classification: correct or overfitting. To enhance these reasoning capabilities for the APCA task specifically, the LLM is finetuned using Reinforcement Learning with the Group Relative Policy Optimization algorithm. When evaluated on a standard Defects4J-derived test, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, with 83.1% accuracy and an 84.8% F1-score. Furthermore, our model demonstrates superior generalization capabilities when trained on different datasets, outperforming the leading technique. This reasoning capability also provides enhanced explainability for the patch assessment. These findings underscore the considerable promise of finetuned, reasoning LLMs to advance static APCA by enhancing accuracy, generalization, and explainability.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce aLLoyM, a fine-tuned LLM specifically trained on alloy compositions, temperatures, and their corresponding phase information. To develop aLLoyM, we curated question-and-answer (Q&A) pairs for binary and ternary phase diagrams using the open-source Computational Phase Diagram Database (CPDDB) and assessments based on CALPHAD (CALculation of PHAse Diagrams). We fine-tuned Mistral, an open-source pre-trained LLM, for two distinct Q&A formats: multiple-choice and short-answer. Benchmark evaluations demonstrate that fine-tuning substantially enhances performance on multiple-choice phase diagram questions. Moreover, the short-answer model of aLLoyM exhibits the ability to generate novel phase diagrams from its components alone, underscoring its potential to accelerate the discovery of previously unexplored materials systems. To promote further research and adoption, we have publicly released the short-answer fine-tuned version of aLLoyM, along with the complete benchmarking Q&A dataset, on Hugging Face.</p></details> | 24 pages, 6 figures |

However, the local discrepancy with well-validated census statistics and the propagated model uncertainties remain a challenge in such coarse-to-fine-grained mapping problems, specifically constrained by weak and conditional label supervision. Therefore, we present Deep Conditional Census-Constrained Clustering (DeepC4), a novel deep learning-based spatial disaggregation approach that incorporates local census statistics as cluster-level constraints while considering multiple conditional label relationships in a joint multitask learning of the patterns of satellite imagery. To demonstrate, compared to GEM and METEOR, we enhanced the quality of Rwandan maps of urban morphology, specifically building exposure and physical vulnerability, at the third-level administrative unit from the 2022 census.

The emergence of Vietnamese LLMs (ViLLMs) highlights lightweight open-source models as a practical choice for their accuracy, efficiency, and privacy benefits. However, domain-specific evaluations remain limited, and the absence of benchmark datasets reflecting real customer interactions makes it difficult for enterprises to select suitable models for support applications. To address this gap, we introduce the Customer Support Conversations Dataset (CSConDa), a curated benchmark of over 9,000 QA pairs drawn from real interactions with human advisors at a large Vietnamese software company. Covering diverse topics such as pricing, product availability, and technical troubleshooting, CSConDa provides a representative basis for evaluating ViLLMs in practical scenarios. We further present a comprehensive evaluation framework, benchmarking 11 lightweight open-source ViLLMs on CSConDa with both automatic metrics and syntactic analysis to reveal model strengths, weaknesses, and linguistic patterns. This study offers insights into model behavior, explains performance differences, and identifies key areas for improvement, supporting the development of next-generation ViLLMs. By establishing a robust benchmark and systematic evaluation, our work enables informed model selection for customer service QA and advances research on Vietnamese LLMs. The dataset is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/ura-hcmut/Vietnamese-Customer-Support-QA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review at ICCCI 2025</p></details> |

However, their implementation in this critical field faces three primary challenges: the inability to effectively process the extensive length and multilingual nature of patient records for accurate temporal analysis; a heightened risk of clinical hallucination, as conventional grounding techniques such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) do not adequately incorporate process-oriented clinical guidelines; and unreliable evaluation metrics that hinder the validation of AI systems in oncology. To address these issues, we propose CliCARE, a framework for Grounding Large Language Models in Clinical Guidelines for Decision Support over Longitudinal Cancer Electronic Health Records. The framework operates by transforming unstructured, longitudinal EHRs into patient-specific Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) to capture long-range dependencies, and then grounding the decision support process by aligning these real-world patient trajectories with a normative guideline knowledge graph. This approach provides oncologists with evidence-grounded decision support by generating a high-fidelity clinical summary and an actionable recommendation. We validated our framework using large-scale, longitudinal data from a private Chinese cancer dataset and the public English MIMIC-IV dataset. In these diverse settings, CliCARE significantly outperforms strong baselines, including leading long-context LLMs and Knowledge Graph-enhanced RAG methods. The clinical validity of our results is supported by a robust evaluation protocol, which demonstrates a high correlation with assessments made by expert oncologists.</p></details> |  |

We revisit these experiments in order to add nuance to the claim. First, we show that while LLMs indeed perform poorly in a zero-shot setting, even tuning a small subset of parameters for input encoding can enable near-perfect performance. However, we also show that this finetuning does not necessarily transfer across datasets. We take this collection of empirical results as an invitation to (re-)open the discussion of what it means to be an "abstract reasoner", and why it matters whether LLMs fit the bill.</p></details> | <details><summary>CONLL...</summary><p>CONLL 2025.

| **[The wall confronting large language models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19703v2)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We show that the scaling laws which determine the performance of large language models (LLMs) severely limit their ability to improve the uncertainty of their predictions. As a result, raising their reliability to meet the standards of scientific inquiry is intractable by any reasonable measure. We argue that the very mechanism which fuels much of the learning power of LLMs, namely the ability to generate non-Gaussian output distributions from Gaussian input ones, might well be at the roots of their propensity to produce error pileup, ensuing information catastrophes and degenerative AI behaviour. This tension between learning and accuracy is a likely candidate mechanism underlying the observed low values of the scaling components. It is substantially compounded by the deluge of spurious correlations pointed out by Calude and Longo which rapidly increase in any data set merely as a function of its size, regardless of its nature. The fact that a degenerative AI pathway is a very probable feature of the LLM landscape does not mean that it must inevitably arise in all future AI research. Its avoidance, which we also discuss in this paper, necessitates putting a much higher premium on insight and understanding of the structural characteristics of the problems being investigated.</p></details> |  |

As the foundation vision encoder, CLIP in turn serves as the cornerstone for most large vision-language models (LVLMs). This interdependence naturally raises an interesting question: Can we reciprocally leverage LVLMs to enhance the quality of image-text pair data, thereby opening the possibility of a self-reinforcing cycle for continuous improvement? In this work, we take a significant step toward this vision by introducing an LVLM-driven data refinement pipeline. Our framework leverages LVLMs to process images and their raw alt-text, generating four complementary textual formulas: long positive descriptions, long negative descriptions, short positive tags, and short negative tags. Applying this pipeline to the curated DFN-Large dataset yields VLM-150M, a refined dataset enriched with multi-grained annotations. Based on this dataset, we further propose a training paradigm that extends conventional contrastive learning by incorporating negative descriptions and short tags as additional supervised signals. The resulting model, namely HQ-CLIP, demonstrates remarkable improvements across diverse benchmarks. Within a comparable training data scale, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot classification, cross-modal retrieval, and fine-grained visual understanding tasks. In retrieval benchmarks, HQ-CLIP even surpasses standard CLIP models trained on the DFN-2B dataset, which contains 10$\times$ more training data than ours.

Current design methods are based on simple analytical models that idealize the soil movement as a traveling sinusoidal wave, neglecting both the system inertia and the relative displacement at the soil-structure interface. However, this assumption may not be valid for buried large diameter pipelines and tunnels requiring accurate dynamic analysis. To analyse the dynamic response of a buried straight beam subjected to transverse TGD, this study introduces a new semi-analytical model based on the Timoshenko beam on Winkler foundation theory. The closed-form analytical solution revealed that the vibration spectrum is divided in four parts, separated by three transition frequencies. Across each transition frequency, the oscillatory characteristics of the vibration modes change, significantly affecting the dynamic response of the system. To verify the validity of the proposed model, this work analyses the case study of a buried steel water pipeline of varying lengths and operating conditions, subjected to transverse TGD. Comparison of the obtained analytical solutions with the finite element analysis results showed excellent agreement between the two approaches. The frequency response analysis revealed dynamic amplification of the soil-structure interaction for forcing frequencies near the system's fundamental frequency. These may fall within the range of dominant frequencies characterizing seismic waves, requiring accurate dynamic analysis. The proposed methodology provides a robust analytical framework for evaluating the primary factors impacting the dynamic behavior of buried beams, giving a deeper understanding of the system response under various sources of ground vibration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Key w...</summary><p>Key words: buried Timoshenko beam, semi-analytical model, dynamic amplification, transient ground deformation (TGD), modal analysis</p></details> |

However, the fairness implications of this new paradigm remain largely unexplored. We present the first investigation of fairness in tabular ICL, evaluating three recently proposed foundation models -- TabPFNv2, TabICL, and TabDPT -- on multiple benchmark datasets. To mitigate biases, we explore three pre-processing fairness-enhancing methods: correlation removal (decorrelating input features from the sensitive attribute), group-balanced sample selection (ensuring equal representation of protected groups in context examples), and uncertainty-based sample selection (prioritizing context examples with high sensitive-attribute prediction uncertainty). Our experiments show that the uncertainty-based strategy consistently improves group fairness metrics (e.g., demographic parity, equalized odds, and equal opportunity) with minimal impact on predictive accuracy.

Unlike traditional approaches that rely on domain-specific or untrained priors, FMPlug smartly leverages two simple but powerful insights: the similarity between observed and desired objects and the Gaussianity of generative flows. By introducing a time-adaptive warm-up strategy and sharp Gaussianity regularization, FMPlug unlocks the true potential of domain-agnostic foundation models. Our method beats state-of-the-art methods that use foundation FM priors by significant margins, on image super-resolution and Gaussian deblurring.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing models are task-specific and lack generalization across patient populations. Inspired by the autoregressive paradigm of large language models, we introduce CGM-LSM, a Transformer decoder-based Large Sensor Model (LSM) pretrained on 1.6 million CGM records from patients with different diabetes types, ages, and genders. We model patients as sequences of glucose time steps to learn latent knowledge embedded in CGM data and apply it to the prediction of glucose readings for a 2-hour horizon. Compared with prior methods, CGM-LSM significantly improves prediction accuracy and robustness: a 48.51% reduction in root mean square error in one-hour horizon forecasting and consistent zero-shot prediction performance across held-out patient groups. We analyze model performance variations across patient subgroups and prediction scenarios and outline key opportunities and challenges for advancing CGM foundation models.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in LVMs have facilitated their integration into Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios, offering superior generalization and adaptability for vision-assisted network optimization. In this paper, we first investigate the functionalities and core architectures of LVMs, highlighting their capabilities across classification, segmentation, generation, and multimodal visual processing. We then explore a variety of LVM applications in wireless communications, covering representative tasks across the physical layer, network layer, and application layer. Furthermore, given the substantial model size of LVMs and the challenges of model retraining in wireless domains, we propose a progressive fine-tuning framework that incrementally adapts pretrained LVMs for joint optimization of multiple IoT tasks. A case study in low-altitude economy networks (LAENets) demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed framework over conventional CNNs in joint beamforming and positioning tasks for Internet of drones, underscoring a promising direction for integrating LVMs into intelligent wireless systems.</p></details> | 7 pages, 6 figures |

To address this issue, we propose a definition of interpretability that is general, simple, and subsumes existing informal notions within the interpretable AI community. We show that our definition is actionable, as it directly reveals the foundational properties, underlying assumptions, principles, data structures, and architectural features necessary for designing interpretable models. Building on this, we propose a general blueprint for designing interpretable models and introduce the first open-sourced library with native support for interpretable data structures and processes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards a unified framework for programming paradigms: A systematic review of classification formalisms and methodological foundations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00534v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of multi-paradigm languages challenges traditional classification methods, leading to practical software engineering issues like interoperability defects. This systematic literature review (SLR) maps the formal foundations of programming paradigms. Our objective is twofold: (1) to assess the state of the art of classification formalisms and their limitations, and (2) to identify the conceptual primitives and mathematical frameworks for a more powerful, reconstructive approach. Based on a synthesis of 74 primary studies, we find that existing taxonomies lack conceptual granularity, a unified formal basis, and struggle with hybrid languages. In response, our analysis reveals a strong convergence toward a compositional reconstruction of paradigms. This approach identifies a minimal set of orthogonal, atomic primitives and leverages mathematical frameworks, predominantly Type theory, Category theory and Unifying Theories of Programming (UTP), to formally guarantee their compositional properties. We conclude that the literature reflects a significant intellectual shift away from classification towards these promising formal, reconstructive frameworks. This review provides a map of this evolution and proposes a research agenda for their unification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint submitted to the Journal of Object Technology on July 29, 2025.

However, such reasoning abilities remain underexplored and notably absent in vision foundation models, including representation models like the DINO series. In this work, we propose \textbf{DINO-R1}, the first such attempt to incentivize visual in-context reasoning capabilities of vision foundation models using reinforcement learning. Specifically, DINO-R1 introduces \textbf{Group Relative Query Optimization (GRQO)}, a novel reinforcement-style training strategy explicitly designed for query-based representation models, which computes query-level rewards based on group-normalized alignment quality. We also apply KL-regularization to stabilize the objectness distribution to reduce the training instability. This joint optimization enables dense and expressive supervision across queries while mitigating overfitting and distributional drift. Building upon Grounding-DINO, we train a series of DINO-R1 family models that integrate a visual prompt encoder and a visual-guided query selection mechanism. Extensive experiments on COCO, LVIS, and ODinW demonstrate that DINO-R1 significantly outperforms supervised fine-tuning baselines, achieving strong generalization in both open-vocabulary and closed-set visual prompting scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, current agent systems are either closed-source or heavily reliant on a variety of paid APIs and proprietary tools, limiting accessibility and reproducibility for the research community. In this work, we present \textbf{Cognitive Kernel-Pro}, a fully open-source and (to the maximum extent) free multi-module agent framework designed to democratize the development and evaluation of advanced AI agents. Within Cognitive Kernel-Pro, we systematically investigate the curation of high-quality training data for Agent Foundation Models, focusing on the construction of queries, trajectories, and verifiable answers across four key domains: web, file, code, and general reasoning. Furthermore, we explore novel strategies for agent test-time reflection and voting to enhance agent robustness and performance. We evaluate Cognitive Kernel-Pro on GAIA, achieving state-of-the-art results among open-source and free agents. Notably, our 8B-parameter open-source model surpasses previous leading systems such as WebDancer and WebSailor, establishing a new performance standard for accessible, high-capability AI agents.

While most prior work has constrained inputs to fixed sensors, a new class of any-sensor foundation models able to process arbitrary sensors has recently emerged. Contributing to this line of work, we propose Panopticon, an any-sensor foundation model built on the DINOv2 framework. We extend DINOv2 by (1) treating images of the same geolocation across sensors as natural augmentations, (2) subsampling channels to diversify spectral input, and (3) adding a cross attention over channels as a flexible patch embedding mechanism. By encoding the wavelength and modes of optical and synthetic aperture radar sensors, respectively, Panopticon can effectively process any combination of arbitrary channels. In extensive evaluations, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on GEO-Bench, especially on the widely-used Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 sensors, while out-competing other any-sensor models, as well as domain adapted fixed-sensor models on unique sensor configurations. Panopticon enables immediate generalization to both existing and future satellite platforms, advancing sensor-agnostic EO.</p></details> | <details><summary>First...</summary><p>First two authors contributed equally.

Predicting spatial gene expression (biomarkers) from routine histopathology images offers a practical alternative, yet current vision foundation models (VFMs) in pathology based on Vision Transformer (ViT) backbones perform below clinical standards. Given that VFMs are already trained on millions of diverse whole slide images, we hypothesize that architectural innovations beyond ViTs may better capture the low-frequency, subtle morphological patterns correlating with molecular phenotypes. By demonstrating that state space models initialized with negative real eigenvalues exhibit strong low-frequency bias, we introduce $MV_{Hybrid}$, a hybrid backbone architecture combining state space models (SSMs) with ViT. We compare five other different backbone architectures for pathology VFMs, all pretrained on identical colorectal cancer datasets using the DINOv2 self-supervised learning method. We evaluate all pretrained models using both random split and leave-one-study-out (LOSO) settings of the same biomarker dataset. In LOSO evaluation, $MV_{Hybrid}$ achieves 57% higher correlation than the best-performing ViT and shows 43% smaller performance degradation compared to random split in gene expression prediction, demonstrating superior performance and robustness, respectively. Furthermore, $MV_{Hybrid}$ shows equal or better downstream performance in classification, patch retrieval, and survival prediction tasks compared to that of ViT, showing its promise as a next-generation pathology VFM backbone.

In this paper, we assume an FM has to be fine-tuned with noisy data and present a two-stage framework to ensure robust classification in the presence of label noise without model retraining. Recent work has shown that simple k-nearest neighbor (kNN) approaches using an embedding derived from an FM can achieve good performance even in the presence of severe label noise. Our work is motivated by the fact that these methods make use of local geometry. In this paper, following a similar two-stage procedure, reliability estimation followed by reliability-weighted inference, we show that improved performance can be achieved by introducing geometry information. For a given instance, our proposed inference uses a local neighborhood of training data, obtained using the non-negative kernel (NNK) neighborhood construction. We propose several methods for reliability estimation that can rely less on distance and local neighborhood as the label noise increases. Our evaluation on CIFAR-10 and DermaMNIST shows that our methods improve robustness across various noise conditions, surpassing standard K-NN approaches and recent adaptive-neighborhood baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 figures, under review at CAMSAP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Towards a Unified Copernicus Foundation Model for Earth Vision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11849v3)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advances in Earth observation (EO) foundation models have unlocked the potential of big satellite data to learn generic representations from space, benefiting a wide range of downstream applications crucial to our planet. However, most existing efforts remain limited to fixed spectral sensors, focus solely on the Earth's surface, and overlook valuable metadata beyond imagery. In this work, we take a step towards next-generation EO foundation models with three key components: 1) Copernicus-Pretrain, a massive-scale pretraining dataset that integrates 18.7M aligned images from all major Copernicus Sentinel missions, spanning from the Earth's surface to its atmosphere; 2) Copernicus-FM, a unified foundation model capable of processing any spectral or non-spectral sensor modality using extended dynamic hypernetworks and flexible metadata encoding; and 3) Copernicus-Bench, a systematic evaluation benchmark with 15 hierarchical downstream tasks ranging from preprocessing to specialized applications for each Sentinel mission. Our dataset, model, and benchmark greatly improve the scalability, versatility, and multimodal adaptability of EO foundation models, while also creating new opportunities to connect EO, weather, and climate research.

| **[Learning to Align and Refine: A Foundation-to-Diffusion Framework for Occlusion-Robust Two-Hand Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17788v2)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Two-hand reconstruction from monocular images faces persistent challenges due to complex and dynamic hand postures and occlusions, causing significant difficulty in achieving plausible interaction alignment. Existing approaches struggle with such alignment issues, often resulting in misalignment and penetration artifacts. To tackle this, we propose a dual-stage Foundation-to-Diffusion framework that precisely align 2D prior guidance from vision foundation models and diffusion-based generative 3D interaction refinement to achieve occlusion-robust two-hand reconstruction. First, we introduce a lightweight fusion alignment encoder that aligns fused multimodal 2D priors like key points, segmentation maps, and depth cues from vision foundation models during training. This provides robust structured guidance, further enabling efficient inference without heavy foundation model encoders at test time while maintaining high reconstruction accuracy. Second, we implement a two-hand diffusion model explicitly trained to convert interpenetrated 3D poses into plausible, penetration-free counterparts. Through collision gradient-guided denoising, the model rectifies artifacts while preserving natural spatial relationships between hands. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on InterHand2.6M, HIC, and FreiHAND datasets, significantly advancing occlusion handling and interaction robustness. Our code will be publicly released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vector-Quantized Vision Foundation Models for Object-Centric Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20263v4)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Perceiving visual scenes as objects and background--like humans do--Object-Centric Learning (OCL) aggregates image or video feature maps into object-level feature vectors, termed \textit{slots}. OCL's self-supervision of reconstructing the input from these aggregated slots struggles with complex object textures, thus Vision Foundation Model (VFM) representations are used as the aggregation input and reconstruction target. However, existing methods leverage VFM representations in diverse ways and often fail to fully exploit their potential. In response, we propose a clean architecture--Vector-Quantized VFMs for OCL (VQ-VFM-OCL, or VVO)--that unifies mainstream OCL methods. The key to our unification is simple yet effective, just shared quantizing the same VFM representation as the reconstruction target. Through mathematical modeling and statistical verification, we further analyze why VFM representations facilitate OCL aggregation and how their shared quantization as reconstruction targets strengthens OCL supervision. Experiments show that across different VFMs, aggregators and decoders, our VVO consistently outperforms baselines in object discovery and recognition, as well as downstream visual prediction and reasoning. The implementation and model checkpoints are available on https://github.com/Genera1Z/VQ-VFM-OCL.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM 2025</p></details> |

However, direct downloading of these models for fine-tuning on the ground is impeded by privacy concerns and limited bandwidth. Satellite federated learning (FL) offers a solution by enabling model fine-tuning directly on-board satellites and aggregating model updates without data downloading. Nevertheless, for large foundation models, the computational capacity of satellites is insufficient to support effective on-board fine-tuning in traditional satellite FL frameworks. To address these challenges, we propose a satellite-ground collaborative federated fine-tuning framework. The key of the framework lies in how to reasonably decompose and allocate model components to alleviate insufficient on-board computation capabilities. During fine-tuning, satellites exchange intermediate results with ground stations or other satellites for forward propagation and back propagation, which brings communication challenges due to the special communication topology of space transmission networks, such as intermittent satellite-ground communication, short duration of satellite-ground communication windows, and unstable inter-orbit inter-satellite links (ISLs). To reduce transmission delays, we further introduce tailored communication strategies that integrate both communication and computing resources. Specifically, we propose a parallel intra-orbit communication strategy, a topology-aware satellite-ground communication strategy, and a latency-minimalization inter-orbit communication strategy to reduce space communication costs. Simulation results demonstrate significant reductions in training time with improvements of approximately 33%.</p></details> |  |
| **[H2Tune: Federated Foundation Model Fine-Tuning with Hybrid Heterogeneity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22633v2)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Different from existing federated fine-tuning (FFT) methods for foundation models, hybrid heterogeneous federated fine-tuning (HHFFT) is an under-explored scenario where clients exhibit double heterogeneity in model architectures and downstream tasks. This hybrid heterogeneity introduces two significant challenges: 1) heterogeneous matrix aggregation, where clients adopt different large-scale foundation models based on their task requirements and resource limitations, leading to dimensional mismatches during LoRA parameter aggregation; and 2) multi-task knowledge interference, where local shared parameters, trained with both task-shared and task-specific knowledge, cannot ensure only task-shared knowledge is transferred between clients. To address these challenges, we propose H2Tune, a federated foundation model fine-tuning with hybrid heterogeneity. Our framework H2Tune consists of three key components: (i) sparsified triple matrix decomposition to align hidden dimensions across clients through constructing rank-consistent middle matrices, with adaptive sparsification based on client resources; (ii) relation-guided matrix layer alignment to handle heterogeneous layer structures and representation capabilities; and (iii) alternating task-knowledge disentanglement mechanism to decouple shared and specific knowledge of local model parameters through alternating optimization. Theoretical analysis proves a convergence rate of O(1/\sqrt{T}). Extensive experiments show our method achieves up to 15.4% accuracy improvement compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/H2Tune-1407.</p></details> |  |

Foundation Models (FMs) can help improve forecasting of renewable generation and demand because FMs can rapidly process complex, high-dimensional time-series data. This review paper focuses on FMs in the realm of renewable energy forecasting, primarily focusing on wind and solar. We present an overview of the architectures, pretraining strategies, finetuning methods, and types of data used in the context of renewable energy forecasting. We emphasize the role of models that are trained at a large scale, domain specific Transformer architectures, where attention is paid to spatial temporal correlations, the embedding of domain knowledge, and also the brief and intermittent nature of renewable generation. We assess recent FM based advancements in forecast accuracy such as reconciling predictions over multiple time scales and quantifying uncertainty in renewable energy forecasting. We also review existing challenges and areas of improvement in long-term and multivariate time series forecasting. In this survey, a distinction between theory and practice is established regarding the use of FMs in the clean energy forecasting domain. Additionally, it critically assesses the strengths and weaknesses of FMs while advancing future research direction in this new and exciting area of forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is currently under review at the journal</p></details> |

Advances in computing, data availability, and self-supervised learning (SSL) have paved the way for slide-level foundation models (SLFMs) that can improve prediction tasks in low-data regimes. However, current methods under-utilize shared information between tasks and modalities. To overcome this challenge, we propose ModalTune, a novel fine-tuning framework which introduces the Modal Adapter to integrate new modalities without modifying SLFM weights. Additionally, we use large-language models (LLMs) to encode labels as text, capturing semantic relationships across multiple tasks and cancer types in a single training recipe. ModalTune achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results against both uni-modal and multi-modal models across four cancer types, jointly improving survival and cancer subtype prediction while remaining competitive in pan-cancer settings. Additionally, we show ModalTune is generalizable to two out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets. To our knowledge, this is the first unified fine-tuning framework for multi-modal, multi-task, and pan-cancer modeling in digital pathology.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Foundation Model for Material Fracture Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23077v1)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately predicting when and how materials fail is critical to designing safe, reliable structures, mechanical systems, and engineered components that operate under stress. Yet, fracture behavior remains difficult to model across the diversity of materials, geometries, and loading conditions in real-world applications. While machine learning (ML) methods show promise, most models are trained on narrow datasets, lack robustness, and struggle to generalize. Meanwhile, physics-based simulators offer high-fidelity predictions but are fragmented across specialized methods and require substantial high-performance computing resources to explore the input space. To address these limitations, we present a data-driven foundation model for fracture prediction, a transformer-based architecture that operates across simulators, a wide range of materials (including plastic-bonded explosives, steel, aluminum, shale, and tungsten), and diverse loading conditions. The model supports both structured and unstructured meshes, combining them with large language model embeddings of textual input decks specifying material properties, boundary conditions, and solver settings. This multimodal input design enables flexible adaptation across simulation scenarios without changes to the model architecture. The trained model can be fine-tuned with minimal data on diverse downstream tasks, including time-to-failure estimation, modeling fracture evolution, and adapting to combined finite-discrete element method simulations. It also generalizes to unseen materials such as titanium and concrete, requiring as few as a single sample, dramatically reducing data needs compared to standard ML. Our results show that fracture prediction can be unified under a single model architecture, offering a scalable, extensible alternative to simulator-specific workflows.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lightweight Online Adaption for Time Series Foundation Model Forecasts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12920v3)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models (FMs) have emerged as a promising approach for time series forecasting. While effective, FMs typically remain fixed during deployment due to the high computational costs of learning them online. Consequently, deployed FMs fail to adapt their forecasts to current data characteristics, despite the availability of online feedback from newly arriving data. This raises the question of whether FM performance can be enhanced by the efficient usage of this feedback. We propose ELF to answer this question. ELF is a lightweight mechanism for the online adaption of FM forecasts in response to online feedback. ELF consists of two parts: a) the ELF-Forecaster which is used to learn the current data distribution; and b) the ELF-Weighter which is used to combine the forecasts of the FM and the ELF-Forecaster. We evaluate the performance of ELF in conjunction with several recent FMs across a suite of standard time series datasets. In all of our experiments we find that using ELF improves performance. This work demonstrates how efficient usage of online feedback can be used to improve FM forecasts.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, Published at ICML 2025</p></details> |

We revisit diffusion models, not as generators, but as universal perceptual templates for OOD detection. This research explores the use of score-based generative models as foundational tools for semantic anomaly detection across unseen datasets. Specifically, we leverage the denoising trajectories of Denoising Diffusion Models (DDMs) as a rich source of texture and semantic information. By analyzing Stein score errors, amplified through the Structural Similarity Index Metric (SSIM), we introduce a novel method for identifying anomalous samples without requiring re-training on each target dataset. Our approach improves over state-of-the-art and relies on training a single model on one dataset -- CelebA -- which we find to be an effective base distribution, even outperforming more commonly used datasets like ImageNet in several settings. Experimental results show near-perfect performance on some benchmarks, with notable headroom on others, highlighting both the strength and future potential of generative foundation models in anomaly detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the workshop of Anomaly Detection with Foundation Models, ICCV 2025</p></details> |

To recover faithful spatio-temporal content from corrupted inputs, bitstream-corrupted video recovery has recently emerged as a challenging and understudied task. However, existing methods require time-consuming and labor-intensive annotation of corrupted regions for each corrupted video frame, resulting in a large workload in practice. In addition, high-quality recovery remains difficult as part of the local residual information in corrupted frames may mislead feature completion and successive content recovery. In this paper, we propose the first blind bitstream-corrupted video recovery framework that integrates visual foundation models with a recovery model, which is adapted to different types of corruption and bitstream-level prompts. Within the framework, the proposed Detect Any Corruption (DAC) model leverages the rich priors of the visual foundation model while incorporating bitstream and corruption knowledge to enhance corruption localization and blind recovery. Additionally, we introduce a novel Corruption-aware Feature Completion (CFC) module, which adaptively processes residual contributions based on high-level corruption understanding. With VFM-guided hierarchical feature augmentation and high-level coordination in a mixture-of-residual-experts (MoRE) structure, our method suppresses artifacts and enhances informative residuals. Comprehensive evaluations show that the proposed method achieves outstanding performance in bitstream-corrupted video recovery without requiring a manually labeled mask sequence. The demonstrated effectiveness will help to realize improved user experience, wider application scenarios, and more reliable multimedia communication and storage systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, accepted by ACMMM 2025</p></details> |

We evaluate three widely used segmentation models (SAM, SAM2, MedSAM) across eleven MSK MRI datasets spanning the knee, hip, spine, shoulder, and thigh. Our framework assesses both zero-shot and finetuned performance, with attention to segmentation accuracy, generalizability across imaging protocols, and reliability of derived quantitative biomarkers. Finetuned models showed consistent agreement with expert measurements for biomarkers including cartilage thickness, disc height, muscle volume, and compositional T1rho/T2 values. Automated prompting through the AutoLabel system enabled scalable segmentation, with moderate trade-offs in accuracy. As proof of concept, we applied the validated system to (i) a three-stage knee MRI triage cascade and (ii) a longitudinal landmark model that predicts total knee replacement and incident osteoarthritis. The framework offers a transparent method for benchmarking segmentation tools and connecting model performance to clinical imaging priorities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code repository: https://github.com/gabbieHoyer/AutoMedLabel; Supplementary data and tables: https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.29633207.

| **[Foundation Models for Demand Forecasting via Dual-Strategy Ensembling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22053v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate demand forecasting is critical for supply chain optimization, yet remains difficult in practice due to hierarchical complexity, domain shifts, and evolving external factors. While recent foundation models offer strong potential for time series forecasting, they often suffer from architectural rigidity and limited robustness under distributional change. In this paper, we propose a unified ensemble framework that enhances the performance of foundation models for sales forecasting in real-world supply chains. Our method combines two complementary strategies: (1) Hierarchical Ensemble (HE), which partitions training and inference by semantic levels (e.g., store, category, department) to capture localized patterns; and (2) Architectural Ensemble (AE), which integrates predictions from diverse model backbones to mitigate bias and improve stability. We conduct extensive experiments on the M5 benchmark and three external sales datasets, covering both in-domain and zero-shot forecasting. Results show that our approach consistently outperforms strong baselines, improves accuracy across hierarchical levels, and provides a simple yet effective mechanism for boosting generalization in complex forecasting environments.</p></details> |  |

However, these models trained solely on offline data, often lack the capacity to reason about the consequences of their actions or adapt through counterfactual understanding. They thus face significant limitations in the real-world urban navigation where interactive and safe behaviors, such as avoiding obstacles and moving pedestrians, are critical. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the Seeing-to-Experiencing framework to scale the capability of navigation foundation models with reinforcement learning. S2E combines the strengths of pre-training on videos and post-training through RL. It maintains the generalizability acquired from large-scale real-world videos while enhancing its interactivity through RL in simulation environments. Specifically, we introduce two innovations: an Anchor-Guided Distribution Matching strategy, which stabilizes learning and models diverse motion patterns through anchor-based supervision; and a Residual-Attention Module, which obtains reactive behaviors from simulation environments without erasing the model's pretrained knowledge. Moreover, we establish a comprehensive end-to-end evaluation benchmark, NavBench-GS, built on photorealistic 3DGS reconstructions of real-world scenes that incorporate physical interactions. It can systematically assess the generalizability and safety of navigation foundation models. Extensive experiments show that S2E mitigates the diminishing returns often seen when scaling with offline data alone. We perform a thorough analysis of the benefits of Reinforcement Learning compared to Supervised Fine-Tuning in the context of post-training for robot learning. Our findings emphasize the crucial role of integrating interactive online experiences to effectively scale foundation models in Robotics.</p></details> |  |

The first stage employs a 3D masked autoencoder (MAE) to perform self-supervised representation learning from large-scale unlabeled volumetric data, enabling the visual encoder to capture rich anatomical and contextual features. In the second stage, contrastive learning is introduced to align visual and textual representations, facilitating cross-modal understanding. To support the pre-training, we collect 16641 real clinical CT scans, supplemented by 114k publicly available data. Meanwhile, we standardize free-text radiology reports into unified templates and construct the pathology vectors according to diagnostic attributes, based on which the soft-label matrix is generated to supervise the contrastive learning process. On the other hand, to comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness of Cardiac-CLIP, we collect 6,722 real-clinical data from 12 independent institutions, along with the open-source data to construct the evaluation dataset. Specifically, Cardiac-CLIP is comprehensively evaluated across multiple tasks, including cardiovascular abnormality classification, information retrieval and clinical analysis. Experimental results demonstrate that Cardiac-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance across various downstream tasks in both internal and external data. Particularly, Cardiac-CLIP exhibits great effectiveness in supporting complex clinical tasks such as the prospective prediction of acute coronary syndrome, which is notoriously difficult in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Meanwhile, conventional GSR models often lack generalization ability, falling short in recognizing unseen and rare situations. In this paper, we exploit transferring knowledge from a teacher MLLM to a small GSR model to enhance its generalization and zero-shot abilities, thereby introducing the task of Open-vocabulary Grounded Situation Recognition (Ov-GSR). To achieve this, we propose Multimodal Interactive Prompt Distillation (MIPD), a novel framework that distills enriched multimodal knowledge from the foundation model, enabling the student Ov-GSR model to recognize unseen situations and be better aware of rare situations. Specifically, the MIPD framework first leverages the LLM-based Judgmental Rationales Generator (JRG) to construct positive and negative glimpse and gaze rationales enriched with contextual semantic information. The proposed scene-aware and instance-perception prompts are then introduced to align rationales with visual information from the MLLM teacher via the Negative-Guided Multimodal Prompting Alignment (NMPA) module, effectively capturing holistic and perceptual multimodal knowledge. Finally, the aligned multimodal knowledge is distilled into the student Ov-GSR model, providing a stronger foundation for generalization that enhances situation understanding, bridges the gap between seen and unseen scenarios, and mitigates prediction bias in rare cases. We evaluate MIPD on the refined Ov-SWiG dataset, achieving superior performance on seen, rare, and unseen situations, and further demonstrate improved unseen detection on the HICO-DET dataset.</p></details> |  |

Deep Learning (DL) has been at the center of modern CPath, and while it delivers unprecedented performance, it is also known that DL may be affected by irrelevant details, such as those introduced during scanning by different commercially available scanners. This may lead to scanner bias, where the model outputs for the same tissue acquired by different scanners may vary. In turn, it hinders the trust of clinicians in CPath-based tools and their deployment in real-world clinical practices. Recent pathology Foundation Models (FMs) promise to provide better domain generalization capabilities. In this paper, we benchmark FMs using a multi-scanner dataset and show that FMs still suffer from scanner bias. Following this observation, we propose ScanGen, a contrastive loss function applied during task-specific fine-tuning that mitigates scanner bias, thereby enhancing the models' robustness to scanner variations. Our approach is applied to the Multiple Instance Learning task of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) mutation prediction from H\&E-stained WSIs in lung cancer. We observe that ScanGen notably enhances the ability to generalize across scanners, while retaining or improving the performance of EGFR mutation prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted (Oral) in MedAGI 2025 International Workshop at MICCAI Conference</p></details> |

To bridge this gap, Superb AI introduces ZERO, an industry-ready vision foundation model that leverages multi-modal prompting (textual and visual) for generalization without retraining. Trained on a compact yet representative 0.9 million annotated samples from a proprietary billion-scale industrial dataset, ZERO demonstrates competitive performance on academic benchmarks like LVIS-Val and significantly outperforms existing models across 37 diverse industrial datasets. Furthermore, ZERO achieved 2nd place in the CVPR 2025 Object Instance Detection Challenge and 4th place in the Foundational Few-shot Object Detection Challenge, highlighting its practical deployability and generalizability with minimal adaptation and limited data.

However, its effectiveness can be compromised by noise or unavailability of one or more leads of the standard 12-lead recordings, resulting in diagnostic errors or uncertainty. To address these challenges, we propose TolerantECG, a foundation model for ECG signals that is robust to noise and capable of functioning with arbitrary subsets of the standard 12-lead ECG. TolerantECG training combines contrastive and self-supervised learning frameworks to jointly learn ECG signal representations alongside their corresponding knowledge-retrieval-based text report descriptions and corrupted or lead-missing signals. Comprehensive benchmarking results demonstrate that TolerantECG consistently ranks as the best or second-best performer across various ECG signal conditions and class levels in the PTB-XL dataset, and achieves the highest performance on the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ACM MM 2025</p></details> |

To guarantee robust scalability, we establish a predictive scaling law and reveal the progressive emergence of structural understanding via loss perspective, culminating in a strong 1.7-billion model. Building on this foundation, we devise a multiple sequence alignment (MSA)-based in-context learning strategy to unify protein design into a general framework, where AMix-1 recognizes deep evolutionary signals among MSAs and consistently generates structurally and functionally coherent proteins. This framework enables the successful design of a dramatically improved AmeR variant with an up to $50\times$ activity increase over its wild type. Pushing the boundaries of protein engineering, we further empower AMix-1 with an evolutionary test-time scaling algorithm for in silico directed evolution that delivers substantial, scalable performance gains as verification budgets are intensified, laying the groundwork for next-generation lab-in-the-loop protein design.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Brain Foundation Model Meets Cauchy-Schwarz Divergence: A New Framework for Cross-Subject Motor Imagery Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21037v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decoding motor imagery (MI) electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, a key non-invasive brain-computer interface (BCI) paradigm for controlling external systems, has been significantly advanced by deep learning. However, MI-EEG decoding remains challenging due to substantial inter-subject variability and limited labeled target data, which necessitate costly calibration for new users. Many existing multi-source domain adaptation (MSDA) methods indiscriminately incorporate all available source domains, disregarding the large inter-subject differences in EEG signals, which leads to negative transfer and excessive computational costs. Moreover, while many approaches focus on feature distribution alignment, they often neglect the explicit dependence between features and decision-level outputs, limiting their ability to preserve discriminative structures. To address these gaps, we propose a novel MSDA framework that leverages a pretrained large Brain Foundation Model (BFM) for dynamic and informed source subject selection, ensuring only relevant sources contribute to adaptation. Furthermore, we employ Cauchy-Schwarz (CS) and Conditional CS (CCS) divergences to jointly perform feature-level and decision-level alignment, enhancing domain invariance while maintaining class discriminability. Extensive evaluations on two benchmark MI-EEG datasets demonstrate that our framework outperforms a broad range of state-of-the-art baselines. Additional experiments with a large source pool validate the scalability and efficiency of BFM-guided selection, which significantly reduces training time without sacrificing performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

They feature several advantages over traditional pipelines: among others, the ability to consolidate multiple tasks in a single model, the option to leverage knowledge from other modalities, and the readily-available interaction with human users. Naturally, these promises have created substantial excitement in the audio community, and have led to a wave of early attempts to build new, general-purpose foundation models for audio. In the present contribution, we give an overview of computational audio analysis as it transitions from traditional pipelines towards auditory foundation models. Our work highlights the key operating principles that underpin those models, and showcases how they can accommodate multiple tasks that the audio community previously tackled separately.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication to the Proceedings of the IEEE</p></details> |

Recent advancements in foundation models, particularly Vision Language Models (VLMs), have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in visual and linguistic reasoning for VIL tasks. Despite this progress, existing approaches primarily utilize these models for learning high-level plans from human demonstrations, relying on pre-defined motion primitives for executing physical interactions, which remains a major bottleneck for robotic systems. In this work, we present FMimic, a novel paradigm that harnesses foundation models to directly learn generalizable skills at even fine-grained action levels, using only a limited number of human videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our FMimic delivers strong performance with a single human video, and significantly outperforms all other methods with five videos. Furthermore, our method exhibits significant improvements of over 39% and 29% in RLBench multi-task experiments and real-world manipulation tasks, respectively, and exceeds baselines by more than 34% in high-precision tasks and 47% in long-horizon tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted to International Journal of Robotics Research(IJRR)</p></details> |

Most RGBT tasks follow a case-by-case research paradigm, relying on manually customized models to learn task-oriented representations. Nevertheless, this paradigm is inherently constrained by artificial inductive bias, modality bias, and data bottleneck. To address these limitations, we make the initial attempt to build a Generalized RGBT MultiSpectral foundation model (M-SpecGene), which aims to learn modality-invariant representations from large-scale broad data in a self-supervised manner. M-SpecGene provides new insights into multispectral fusion and integrates prior case-by-case studies into a unified paradigm. Considering the unique characteristic of information imbalance in RGBT data, we introduce the Cross-Modality Structural Sparsity (CMSS) metric to quantify the information density across two modalities. Then we develop the GMM-CMSS progressive masking strategy to facilitate a flexible, easy-to-hard, and object-centric pre-training process. Comprehensive experiments validate M-SpecGene's generalizability across eleven datasets for four RGBT downstream tasks.

However, capturing a substantial number of corresponding images related to alcohol consumption, drug use, and sleep deprivation to create a dataset for training an AI model presents a significant challenge. Typically, a large quantity of images is required to effectively implement a deep learning approach. Currently, training downstream models with a huge number of images based on foundational models provides a real opportunity to enhance this area, thanks to the generalisation capabilities of self-supervised models. This work examines the application of deep learning and foundational models in predicting fitness for duty, which is defined as the subject condition related to determining the alertness for work.</p></details> |  |

Recent EEG foundation models aim to learn generalized representations across diverse BCI paradigms. However, these approaches overlook fundamental paradigm-specific neurophysiological distinctions, limiting their generalization ability. Importantly, in practical BCI deployments, the specific paradigm such as motor imagery (MI) for stroke rehabilitation or assistive robotics, is generally determined prior to data acquisition. This paper proposes MIRepNet, the first EEG foundation model tailored for the MI paradigm. MIRepNet comprises a high-quality EEG preprocessing pipeline incorporating a neurophysiologically-informed channel template, adaptable to EEG headsets with arbitrary electrode configurations. Furthermore, we introduce a hybrid pretraining strategy that combines self-supervised masked token reconstruction and supervised MI classification, facilitating rapid adaptation and accurate decoding on novel downstream MI tasks with fewer than 30 trials per class. Extensive evaluations across five public MI datasets demonstrated that MIRepNet consistently achieved state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming both specialized and generalized EEG models.

| **[Foundation Models Knowledge Distillation For Battery Capacity Degradation Forecast](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08151v3)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate estimation of lithium-ion battery capacity degradation is critical for enhancing the reliability and safety of battery operations. Traditional expert models, tailored to specific scenarios, provide isolated estimations. With the rapid advancement of data-driven techniques, a series of general-purpose time-series foundation models have been developed. However, foundation models specifically designed for battery capacity degradation remain largely unexplored. To enable zero-shot generalization in battery degradation prediction using large model technology, this study proposes a degradation-aware fine-tuning strategy for time-series foundation models. We apply this strategy to fine-tune the Timer model on approximately 10 GB of open-source battery charge discharge data. Validation on our released CycleLife-SJTUIE dataset demonstrates that the fine-tuned Battery-Timer possesses strong zero-shot generalization capability in capacity degradation forecasting. To address the computational challenges of deploying large models, we further propose a knowledge distillation framework that transfers the knowledge of pre-trained foundation models into compact expert models. Distillation results across several state-of-the-art time-series expert models confirm that foundation model knowledge significantly improves the multi-condition generalization of expert models.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in foundation models have demonstrated remarkable performance in remote sensing and climate sciences, and therefore offer new opportunities for agricultural monitoring.

In this work, we quantitatively evaluate existing foundational models to assess their effectivity for a representative set of agricultural tasks. From an agricultural domain perspective, we describe a requirements framework for an ideal agricultural foundation model (CropFM). We then survey and compare existing general-purpose foundational models in this framework and empirically evaluate two exemplary of them in three representative agriculture specific tasks.

In robotic grasping, CoG deviation often leads to postural instability, where existing keypoint-based or affordance-driven methods exhibit limitations. We constructed a dataset of 790 images featuring unevenly distributed objects with keypoint annotations for CoG localization. A vision-driven framework based on foundation models was developed to achieve CoG-aware grasping. Experimental evaluations across real-world scenarios demonstrate that our method achieves a 49\% higher success rate compared to conventional keypoint-based approaches and an 11\% improvement over state-of-the-art affordance-driven methods. The system exhibits strong generalization with a 76\% CoG localization accuracy on unseen objects, providing a novel solution for precise and stable grasping tasks.</p></details> |  |

Traditional sequence models struggle to capture long-range dependencies and biological features inherent in DNA. In this work, we propose TrinityDNA, a novel DNA foundational model designed to address these challenges. The model integrates biologically informed components, including Groove Fusion for capturing DNA's structural features and Gated Reverse Complement (GRC) to handle the inherent symmetry of DNA sequences. Additionally, we introduce a multi-scale attention mechanism that allows the model to attend to varying levels of sequence dependencies, and an evolutionary training strategy that progressively adapts the model to both prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes. TrinityDNA provides a more accurate and efficient approach to genomic sequence modeling, offering significant improvements in gene function prediction, regulatory mechanism discovery, and other genomics applications. Our model bridges the gap between machine learning techniques and biological insights, paving the way for more effective analysis of genomic data. Additionally, we introduced a new DNA long-sequence CDS annotation benchmark to make evaluations more comprehensive and oriented toward practical applications.</p></details> |  |

However, training such a model requires high-quality, local datasets at the deployment site, which are often difficult to collect. We propose a transformer-based foundation model for mMIMO precoding that seeks to minimize the energy consumption of the transmitter while dynamically adapting to per-user rate requirements. At equal energy consumption, zero-shot deployment of the proposed foundation model significantly outperforms zero forcing, and approaches weighted minimum mean squared error performance with 8x less complexity. To address model adaptation in data-scarce settings, we introduce a data augmentation method that finds training samples similar to the target distribution by computing the cosine similarity between the outputs of the pre-trained feature extractor. Our work enables the implementation of DL-based solutions in practice by addressing challenges of data availability and training complexity. Moreover, the ability to dynamically configure per-user rate requirements can be leveraged by higher level resource allocation and scheduling algorithms for greater control over energy efficiency, spectral efficiency and fairness.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures.

We investigate whether foundation models, trained on a large number and variety of objects, can perform object segmentation without fine-tuning on specific images containing everyday objects, but in highly cluttered visual scenes. The ''in the wild'' context is driven by the target application of vision guided upper limb neuroprostheses. We propose a method for generating prompts based on gaze fixations to guide the Segment Anything Model (SAM) in our segmentation scenario, and fine-tune it on egocentric visual data. Evaluation results of our approach show an improvement of the IoU segmentation quality metric by up to 0.51 points on real-world challenging data of Grasping-in-the-Wild corpus which is made available on the RoboFlow Platform (https://universe.roboflow.com/iwrist/grasping-in-the-wild)</p></details> |  |

The framework addresses the complexities of legal compliance and fundamental rights protection by itegrating definitional balancing and defeasible reasoning. Definitional balancing employs proportionality analysis to resolve conflicts between competing rights, while defeasible reasoning accommodates the dynamic nature of legal decision-making. Our approach stresses the need for an analysis of AI deployment scenarios and for identifying potential legal violations and multi-layered impacts on fundamental rights. On the basis of this analysis, we provide philosophical foundations for a logical account of AI risk analysis. In particular, we consider the basic building blocks for conceptually grasping the interaction between AI deployment scenarios and fundamental rights, incorporating in defeasible reasoning definitional balancing and arguments about the contextual promotion or demotion of rights. This layered approach allows for more operative models of assessment of both high-risk AI systems and General Purpose AI (GPAI) systems, emphasizing the broader applicability of the latter. Future work aims to develop a formal model and effective algorithms to enhance AI risk assessment, bridging theoretical insights with practical applications to support responsible AI governance.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 1 figure.

Since their internal structures are not directly observable, robots must adaptively explore and refine actions to generate successful manipulation trajectories. While existing works have attempted cross-category generalization in adaptive articulated object manipulation, two major challenges persist: (1) the geometric diversity of real-world articulated objects complicates visual perception and understanding, and (2) variations in object functions and mechanisms hinder the development of a unified adaptive manipulation strategy. To address these challenges, we propose AdaRPG, a novel framework that leverages foundation models to extract object parts, which exhibit greater local geometric similarity than entire objects, thereby enhancing visual affordance generalization for functional primitive skills. To support this, we construct a part-level affordance annotation dataset to train the affordance model. Additionally, AdaRPG utilizes the common knowledge embedded in foundation models to reason about complex mechanisms and generate high-level control codes that invoke primitive skill functions based on part affordance inference. Simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate AdaRPG's strong generalization ability across novel articulated object categories.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |

In this paper, we introduce Pulse-PPG, the first open-source PPG foundation model trained exclusively on raw PPG data collected over a 100-day field study with 120 participants. Existing PPG foundation models are either open-source but trained on clinical data or closed-source, limiting their applicability in real-world settings. We evaluate Pulse-PPG across multiple datasets and downstream tasks, comparing its performance against a state-of-the-art foundation model trained on clinical data. Our results demonstrate that Pulse-PPG, trained on uncurated field data, exhibits superior generalization across clinical and mobile health applications in both lab and field settings. This suggests that exposure to real-world variability enables the model to learn fine-grained representations, making it more adaptable across tasks. Furthermore, pre-training on field data surprisingly outperforms its pre-training on clinical data in many tasks, reinforcing the importance of training on real-world, diverse datasets. To encourage further advancements in robust foundation models leveraging field data, we plan to release Pulse-PPG, providing researchers with a powerful resource for developing more generalizable PPG-based models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Saha ...</summary><p>Saha and Xu are co-first authors</p></details> |

The inability of supervised EEG encoders to learn robust EEG patterns and their over-reliance on expensive signal annotations have sparked a transition towards general-purpose self-supervised EEG encoders, i.e., EEG foundation models (EEG-FMs), for robust and scalable EEG feature extraction. However, the real-world readiness of early EEG-FMs and the rubric for long-term research progress remain unclear. A systematic and comprehensive review of first-generation EEG-FMs is therefore necessary to understand the current state-of-the-art and identify key directions for future EEG-FMs. To that end, this study reviews 10 early EEG-FMs and presents a critical synthesis of their methodology, empirical findings, and outstanding research gaps. We find that most EEG-FMs adopt a sequence-based modeling scheme that relies on transformer-based backbones and the reconstruction of masked sequences for self-supervision. However, model evaluations remain heterogeneous and largely limited, making it challenging to assess their practical off-the-shelf utility. In addition to adopting standardized and realistic evaluations, future work should demonstrate more substantial scaling effects and make principled and trustworthy choices throughout the EEG representation learning pipeline. We believe that developing benchmarks, software tools, technical methodologies, and applications in collaboration with domain experts may further advance the translational utility and real-world adoption of EEG-FMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables (main + supplement)</p></details> |

Building foundational models for ST can significantly enhance the analysis of vast and complex data sources, unlocking new perspectives on the intricacies of biological tissues. However, modeling ST data is inherently challenging due to the need to extract multi-scale information from tissue slices containing vast numbers of cells. This process requires integrating macro-scale tissue morphology, micro-scale cellular microenvironment, and gene-scale gene expression profile. To address this challenge, we propose SToFM, a multi-scale Spatial Transcriptomics Foundation Model. SToFM first performs multi-scale information extraction on each ST slice, to construct a set of ST sub-slices that aggregate macro-, micro- and gene-scale information. Then an SE(2) Transformer is used to obtain high-quality cell representations from the sub-slices. Additionally, we construct \textbf{SToCorpus-88M}, the largest high-resolution spatial transcriptomics corpus for pretraining. SToFM achieves outstanding performance on a variety of downstream tasks, such as tissue region semantic segmentation and cell type annotation, demonstrating its comprehensive understanding of ST data through capturing and integrating multi-scale information.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accpe...</summary><p>Accpeted by ICML 2025</p></details> |

However, existing generalist time series foundation models struggle to handle medical time series data due to their inherent challenges, including irregular intervals, heterogeneous sampling rates, and frequent missing values. To address these challenges, we introduce MIRA, a unified foundation model specifically designed for medical time series forecasting. MIRA incorporates a Continuous-Time Rotary Positional Encoding that enables fine-grained modeling of variable time intervals, a frequency-specific mixture-of-experts layer that routes computation across latent frequency regimes to further promote temporal specialization, and a Continuous Dynamics Extrapolation Block based on Neural ODE that models the continuous trajectory of latent states, enabling accurate forecasting at arbitrary target timestamps. Pretrained on a large-scale and diverse medical corpus comprising over 454 billion time points collect from publicly available datasets, MIRA achieves reductions in forecasting errors by an average of 10% and 7% in out-of-distribution and in-distribution scenarios, respectively, when compared to other zero-shot and fine-tuned baselines. We also introduce a comprehensive benchmark spanning multiple downstream clinical tasks, establishing a foundation for future research in medical time series modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Well Does GPT-4o Understand Vision? Evaluating Multimodal Foundation Models on Standard Computer Vision Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01955v2)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal foundation models, such as GPT-4o, have recently made remarkable progress, but it is not clear where exactly these models stand in terms of understanding vision. In this paper, we benchmark the performance of popular multimodal foundation models (GPT-4o, o4-mini, Gemini 1.5 Pro and Gemini 2.0 Flash, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Qwen2-VL, Llama 3.2) on standard computer vision tasks (semantic segmentation, object detection, image classification, depth and surface normal prediction) using established datasets (e.g., COCO, ImageNet and its variants, etc). The main challenges to performing this are: 1) most models are trained to output text and cannot natively express versatile domains, such as segments or 3D geometry, and 2) many leading models are proprietary and accessible only at an API level, i.e., there is no weight access to adapt them. We address these challenges by translating standard vision tasks into equivalent text-promptable and API-compatible tasks via prompt chaining to create a standardized benchmarking framework. We observe that 1) the models are not close to the state-of-the-art specialist models at any task. However, 2) they are respectable generalists; this is remarkable as they are presumably trained on primarily image-text-based tasks. 3) They perform semantic tasks notably better than geometric ones. 4) While the prompt-chaining techniques affect performance, better models exhibit less sensitivity to prompt variations. 5) GPT-4o performs the best among non-reasoning models, securing the top position in 4 out of 6 tasks, 6) reasoning models, e.g. o3, show improvements in geometric tasks, and 7) a preliminary analysis of models with native image generation, like the latest GPT-4o, shows they exhibit quirks like hallucinations and spatial misalignments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page at https://fm-vision-evals.epfl.ch/</p></details> |
| **[Hyperbolic Deep Learning for Foundation Models: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17787v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models pre-trained on massive datasets, including large language models (LLMs), vision-language models (VLMs), and large multimodal models, have demonstrated remarkable success in diverse downstream tasks. However, recent studies have shown fundamental limitations of these models: (1) limited representational capacity, (2) lower adaptability, and (3) diminishing scalability. These shortcomings raise a critical question: is Euclidean geometry truly the optimal inductive bias for all foundation models, or could incorporating alternative geometric spaces enable models to better align with the intrinsic structure of real-world data and improve reasoning processes? Hyperbolic spaces, a class of non-Euclidean manifolds characterized by exponential volume growth with respect to distance, offer a mathematically grounded solution. These spaces enable low-distortion embeddings of hierarchical structures (e.g., trees, taxonomies) and power-law distributions with substantially fewer dimensions compared to Euclidean counterparts. Recent advances have leveraged these properties to enhance foundation models, including improving LLMs' complex reasoning ability, VLMs' zero-shot generalization, and cross-modal semantic alignment, while maintaining parameter efficiency. This paper provides a comprehensive review of hyperbolic neural networks and their recent development for foundation models. We further outline key challenges and research directions to advance the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 Pa...</summary><p>11 Pages, SIGKDD 2025</p></details> |
| **[Risk In Context: Benchmarking Privacy Leakage of Foundation Models in Synthetic Tabular Data Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17066v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthetic tabular data is essential for machine learning workflows, especially for expanding small or imbalanced datasets and enabling privacy-preserving data sharing. However, state-of-the-art generative models (GANs, VAEs, diffusion models) rely on large datasets with thousands of examples. In low-data settings, often the primary motivation for synthetic data, these models can overfit, leak sensitive records, and require frequent retraining. Recent work uses large pre-trained transformers to generate rows via in-context learning (ICL), which needs only a few seed examples and no parameter updates, avoiding retraining. But ICL repeats seed rows verbatim, introducing a new privacy risk that has only been studied in text. The severity of this risk in tabular synthesis-where a single row may identify a person-remains unclear. We address this gap with the first benchmark of three foundation models (GPT-4o-mini, LLaMA 3.3 70B, TabPFN v2) against four baselines on 35 real-world tables from health, finance, and policy. We evaluate statistical fidelity, downstream utility, and membership inference leakage. Results show foundation models consistently have the highest privacy risk. LLaMA 3.3 70B reaches up to 54 percentage points higher true-positive rate at 1% FPR than the safest baseline. GPT-4o-mini and TabPFN are also highly vulnerable. We plot the privacy-utility frontier and show that CTGAN and GPT-4o-mini offer better tradeoffs. A factorial study finds that three zero-cost prompt tweaks-small batch size, low temperature, and using summary statistics-can reduce worst-case AUC by 14 points and rare-class leakage by up to 39 points while maintaining over 90% fidelity. Our benchmark offers a practical guide for safer low-data synthesis with foundation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Agentic & GenAI Evaluation KDD2025, poster presentation</p></details> |

It begins by outlining the characteristics of terahertz UM-MIMO systems and identifies three primary challenges for transceiver design: computational complexity, modeling difficulty, and measurement limitations. The study posits that AI provides a promising solution to these challenges. Three systematic research roadmaps are proposed for developing AI algorithms tailored to terahertz UM-MIMO systems. The first roadmap, model-driven deep learning (DL), emphasizes the importance of leveraging available domain knowledge and advocates the adoption of AI only to enhance bottleneck modules within an established signal processing or optimization framework. Four essential steps are discussed: algorithmic frameworks, basis algorithms, loss-function design, and neural architecture design. The second roadmap presents channel state information (CSI) foundation models, aimed at unifying the design of different transceiver modules by focusing on their shared foundation, that is, the wireless channel. The training of a single compact foundation model is proposed to estimate the score function of wireless channels, which serve as a versatile prior for designing a wide variety of transceiver modules. Four essential steps are outlined: general frameworks, conditioning, site-specific adaptation, joint design of CSI foundation models, and model-driven DL. The third roadmap aims to explore potential directions for applying pretrained large language models (LLMs) to terahertz UM-MIMO systems. Several application scenarios are envisioned, including LLM-based estimation, optimization, search, network management, and protocol understanding. Finally, the study highlights open problems and future research directions.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 8 figures, 1 table, accepted by Engineering.

This gap is primarily due to the absence of domain-specific foundational models, with existing solutions often relying on general-purpose LLMs that fail to address the unique challenges and technical intricacies of O-RAN. To bridge this gap, we introduce ORANSight-2.0 (O-RAN Insights), a pioneering initiative to develop specialized foundational LLMs tailored for O-RAN. Built on 18 models spanning five open-source LLM frameworks -- Mistral, Qwen, Llama, Phi, and Gemma -- ORANSight-2.0 fine-tunes models ranging from 1B to 70B parameters, significantly reducing reliance on proprietary, closed-source models while enhancing performance in O-RAN-specific tasks. At the core of ORANSight-2.0 is RANSTRUCT, a novel Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based instruction-tuning framework that employs two LLM agents -- a Mistral-based Question Generator and a Qwen-based Answer Generator -- to create high-quality instruction-tuning datasets. The generated dataset is then used to fine-tune the 18 pre-trained open-source LLMs via QLoRA. To evaluate ORANSight-2.0, we introduce srsRANBench, a novel benchmark designed for code generation and codebase understanding in the context of srsRAN, a widely used 5G O-RAN stack.</p></details> |  |

However, training new models requires large amounts of labeled data, a challenge due to high cost of precise annotations and data privacy. To address this issue, we introduce the MRI-CORE, a vision foundation model trained using more than 6 million slices from over 110 thousand MRI volumes across 18 body locations. Our experiments show notable improvements in performance over state-of-the-art methods in 13 data-restricted segmentation tasks, as well as in image classification, and zero-shot segmentation, showing the strong potential of MRI-CORE to enable data-efficient development of artificial intelligence models. We also present data on which strategies yield most useful foundation models and a novel analysis relating similarity between pre-training and downstream task data with transfer learning performance.

| **[Towards Robust Foundation Models for Digital Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17845v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Biomedical Foundation Models (FMs) are rapidly transforming AI-enabled healthcare research and entering clinical validation. However, their susceptibility to learning non-biological technical features -- including variations in surgical/endoscopic techniques, laboratory procedures, and scanner hardware -- poses risks for clinical deployment. We present the first systematic investigation of pathology FM robustness to non-biological features. Our work (i) introduces measures to quantify FM robustness, (ii) demonstrates the consequences of limited robustness, and (iii) proposes a framework for FM robustification to mitigate these issues. Specifically, we developed PathoROB, a robustness benchmark with three novel metrics, including the robustness index, and four datasets covering 28 biological classes from 34 medical centers. Our experiments reveal robustness deficits across all 20 evaluated FMs, and substantial robustness differences between them. We found that non-robust FM representations can cause major diagnostic downstream errors and clinical blunders that prevent safe clinical adoption. Using more robust FMs and post-hoc robustification considerably reduced (but did not yet eliminate) the risk of such errors. This work establishes that robustness evaluation is essential for validating pathology FMs before clinical adoption and demonstrates that future FM development must integrate robustness as a core design principle. PathoROB provides a blueprint for assessing robustness across biomedical domains, guiding FM improvement efforts towards more robust, representative, and clinically deployable AI systems that prioritize biological information over technical artifacts.</p></details> |  |
| **[FISHER: A Foundation Model for Multi-Modal Industrial Signal Comprehensive Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16696v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid deployment of SCADA systems, how to effectively analyze industrial signals and detect abnormal states is an urgent need for the industry. Due to the significant heterogeneity of these signals, which we summarize as the M5 problem, previous works only focus on small sub-problems and employ specialized models, failing to utilize the synergies between modalities and the powerful scaling law. However, we argue that the M5 signals can be modeled in a unified manner due to the intrinsic similarity. As a result, we propose FISHER, a Foundation model for multi-modal Industrial Signal compreHEnsive Representation. To support arbitrary sampling rates, FISHER considers the increment of sampling rate as the concatenation of sub-band information. Specifically, FISHER takes the STFT sub-band as the modeling unit and adopts a teacher student SSL framework for pre-training. We also develop the RMIS benchmark, which evaluates the representations of M5 industrial signals on multiple health management tasks. Compared with top SSL models, FISHER showcases versatile and outstanding capabilities with a general performance gain up to 5.03%, along with much more efficient scaling curves. We also investigate the scaling law on downstream tasks and derive potential avenues for future works. FISHER is now open-sourced on https://github.com/jianganbai/FISHER</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |

However, current vision-language models in EO, particularly CLIP-based variants, remain confined to individual modalities, limiting generalization and scalability across diverse tasks. We present DOFA-CLIP (Dynamic-One-For-All CLIP), a unified vision-language foundation model that dynamically adapts to EO modalities with flexible spectral configurations through a single Transformer backbone. Our approach introduces three key contributions: 1) the construction of GeoLangBind-2M, a large-scale EO image-text dataset covering six heterogeneous modalities with rich natural language descriptions; 2) a novel training strategy called VECT (Vision-models Enhanced Contrastive Text-image pretraining), which enhances the spatial awareness of CLIP features with multiple vision foundation models; and 3) a Modality-aware Knowledge Agglomeration (MaKA) module that refines feature distillation with modality-specific awareness. DOFA-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance across a wide range of EO benchmarks, including unseen modalities and a diverse number of input spectral bands. Together, these contributions establish a scalable foundation for multimodal EO understanding and open new avenues for integrating heterogeneous EO data with large language models. Code and datasets will be released.

Since most resources are developed primarily for English, cross-linguistic applications of moral foundation theory remain limited. Using Chinese as a case study, this paper evaluates the effectiveness of applying English resources to machine translated text, local language lexicons, multilingual language models, and large language models (LLMs) in measuring MFs in non-English texts. The results indicate that machine translation and local lexicon approaches are insufficient for complex moral assessments, frequently resulting in a substantial loss of cultural information. In contrast, multilingual models and LLMs demonstrate reliable cross-language performance with transfer learning, with LLMs excelling in terms of data efficiency. Importantly, this study also underscores the need for human-in-the-loop validation of automated MF assessment, as the most advanced models may overlook cultural nuances in cross-language measurements. The findings highlight the potential of LLMs for cross-language MF measurements and other complex multilingual deductive coding tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 2 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[Are Foundation Models All You Need for Zero-shot Face Presentation Attack Detection?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16393v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although face recognition systems have undergone an impressive evolution in the last decade, these technologies are vulnerable to attack presentations (AP). These attacks are mostly easy to create and, by executing them against the system's capture device, the malicious actor can impersonate an authorised subject and thus gain access to the latter's information (e.g., financial transactions). To protect facial recognition schemes against presentation attacks, state-of-the-art deep learning presentation attack detection (PAD) approaches require a large amount of data to produce reliable detection performances and even then, they decrease their performance for unknown presentation attack instruments (PAI) or database (information not seen during training), i.e. they lack generalisability. To mitigate the above problems, this paper focuses on zero-shot PAD. To do so, we first assess the effectiveness and generalisability of foundation models in established and challenging experimental scenarios and then propose a simple but effective framework for zero-shot PAD. Experimental results show that these models are able to achieve performance in difficult scenarios with minimal effort of the more advanced PAD mechanisms, whose weights were optimised mainly with training sets that included APs and bona fide presentations. The top-performing foundation model outperforms by a margin the best from the state of the art observed with the leaving-one-out protocol on the SiW-Mv2 database, which contains challenging unknown 2D and 3D attacks</p></details> | Accepted at FG 2025 |
| **[Dens3R: A Foundation Model for 3D Geometry Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16290v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in dense 3D reconstruction have led to significant progress, yet achieving accurate unified geometric prediction remains a major challenge. Most existing methods are limited to predicting a single geometry quantity from input images. However, geometric quantities such as depth, surface normals, and point maps are inherently correlated, and estimating them in isolation often fails to ensure consistency, thereby limiting both accuracy and practical applicability. This motivates us to explore a unified framework that explicitly models the structural coupling among different geometric properties to enable joint regression. In this paper, we present Dens3R, a 3D foundation model designed for joint geometric dense prediction and adaptable to a wide range of downstream tasks. Dens3R adopts a two-stage training framework to progressively build a pointmap representation that is both generalizable and intrinsically invariant. Specifically, we design a lightweight shared encoder-decoder backbone and introduce position-interpolated rotary positional encoding to maintain expressive power while enhancing robustness to high-resolution inputs. By integrating image-pair matching features with intrinsic invariance modeling, Dens3R accurately regresses multiple geometric quantities such as surface normals and depth, achieving consistent geometry perception from single-view to multi-view inputs. Additionally, we propose a post-processing pipeline that supports geometrically consistent multi-view inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of Dens3R across various dense 3D prediction tasks and highlight its potential for broader applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://g-1nonly.github.io/Dens3R/, Code: https://github.com/G-1nOnly/Dens3R</p></details> |

Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSSS) has emerged as a solution to alleviate the labeling burden by leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data through self-training techniques. Meanwhile, the advent of foundational segmentation models pre-trained on massive data, has shown the potential to generalize across domains effectively. This work explores whether a foundational segmentation model can address label scarcity in the pixel-level vision task as an annotator for unlabeled images. Specifically, we investigate the efficacy of using SEEM, a Segment Anything Model (SAM) variant fine-tuned for textual input, to generate predictive masks for unlabeled data. To address the shortcomings of using SEEM-generated masks as supervision, we propose ConformalSAM, a novel SSSS framework which first calibrates the foundation model using the target domain's labeled data and then filters out unreliable pixel labels of unlabeled data so that only high-confidence labels are used as supervision. By leveraging conformal prediction (CP) to adapt foundation models to target data through uncertainty calibration, ConformalSAM exploits the strong capability of the foundational segmentation model reliably which benefits the early-stage learning, while a subsequent self-reliance training strategy mitigates overfitting to SEEM-generated masks in the later training stage. Our experiment demonstrates that, on three standard benchmarks of SSSS, ConformalSAM achieves superior performance compared to recent SSSS methods and helps boost the performance of those methods as a plug-in.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |

We explore how these architectures, with their global receptive fields and adaptability, address challenges such as long-range dependency modeling, contextual modeling and data scarcity. The survey categorizes VAD methods into reconstruction-based, feature-based and zero/few-shot approaches, highlighting the paradigm shift brought about by foundation models. By integrating attention mechanisms and leveraging large-scale pre-training, Transformers and foundation models enable more robust, interpretable, and scalable anomaly detection solutions. This work provides a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art techniques, their strengths, limitations, and emerging trends in leveraging these architectures for VAD.</p></details> |  |

Various scientific and engineering applications demand a versatile and differentiable PDE solver that can quickly generate solutions with adequate accuracy, and limitations of the traditional solvers and specialized neural operators motivate the development of foundation models for solving PDEs. This paper introduces PDEformer-2, a versatile foundation model for two-dimensional PDEs. Based on our previous one-dimensional PDEformer-1 model, PDEformer-2 receives the PDE form as network input via computational graph representation, which has the flexibility to encode most common PDEs. The mesh-free predicted solutions can be directly queried at arbitrary spatio-temporal coordinates. A large (40TB) diverse dataset is employed to pretrain the current model, making it capable of simultaneously addressing PDEs with different symbolic forms, domain shapes, boundary conditions, number of variables, and time-dependency. Accurate zero-shot prediction is allowed for PDEs that resemble the pretraining ones. When adapted to new unseen PDEs, PDEformer-2 demonstrates faster learning than many specialized models, and has smaller errors given limited (less than 100) samples. Additionally, PDEformer-2 can be employed in the inverse problems thanks to its fast and differentiable nature and produces reasonable results in our experiments to recover coefficient scalars and fields of a PDE.</p></details> |  |

We present a method for self-supervised domain adaptation for the scenario where annotated source domain data (e.g. from synthetic generation) is available, but the target domain data is completely unannotated. Our method targets the semantic segmentation task and leverages a segmentation foundation model (Segment Anything Model) to obtain segment information on unannotated data. We take inspiration from recent advances in unsupervised local feature learning and propose an invariance-variance loss over the detected segments for regularizing feature representations in the target domain. Crucially, this loss structure and network architecture can handle overlapping segments and oversegmentation as produced by Segment Anything. We demonstrate the advantage of our method on the challenging YCB-Video and HomebrewedDB datasets and show that it outperforms prior work and, on YCB-Video, even a network trained with real annotations. Additionally, we provide insight through model ablations and show applicability to a custom robotic application.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for IEEE International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE) 2025.

Recent advancements in deep learning have led to powerful depth foundation models (DFMs), yet their evaluation remains challenging due to inconsistencies in existing protocols. Traditional benchmarks rely on alignment-based metrics that introduce biases, favor certain depth representations, and complicate fair comparisons. In this work, we propose BenchDepth, a new benchmark that evaluates DFMs through five carefully selected downstream proxy tasks: depth completion, stereo matching, monocular feed-forward 3D scene reconstruction, SLAM, and vision-language spatial understanding. Unlike conventional evaluation protocols, our approach assesses DFMs based on their practical utility in real-world applications, bypassing problematic alignment procedures. We benchmark eight state-of-the-art DFMs and provide an in-depth analysis of key findings and observations.

This paper provides a rigorous treatment of hallucination in LLMs, including formal definitions and theoretical analyses. We distinguish between intrinsic and extrinsic hallucinations, and define a \textit{hallucination risk} for models. We derive bounds on this risk using learning-theoretic frameworks (PAC-Bayes and Rademacher complexity). We then survey detection strategies for hallucinations, such as token-level uncertainty estimation, confidence calibration, and attention alignment checks. On the mitigation side, we discuss approaches including retrieval-augmented generation, hallucination-aware fine-tuning, logit calibration, and the incorporation of fact-verification modules. We propose a unified detection and mitigation workflow, illustrated with a diagram, to integrate these strategies. Finally, we outline evaluation protocols for hallucination, recommending datasets, metrics, and experimental setups to quantify and reduce hallucinations. Our work lays a theoretical foundation and practical guidelines for addressing the crucial challenge of hallucination in LLMs.</p></details> | 12 pages |

Central to our approach is the Universal Embedding and Linear Approximation Theorem (UELAT), which establishes that functions in broad spaces -- including C(K), Sobolev spaces W^{k,p}(Omega), and distributions D'(Omega) -- can be explicitly approximated by finite-rank linear projections, each with a constructive, algorithmically verifiable certificate of accuracy. These constructions are governed categorically by a functorial adjunction between local logical probes and analytic models, making analytic existence both formally certifiable and programmatically extractable. As a key result, we prove a uniform certificate stability theorem, ensuring that approximation certificates persist under uniform convergence. The CCP avoids classical pathologies (e.g., non-measurable sets, Banach--Tarski paradoxes) by eliminating non-constructive choice and replacing it with a coherent, local-to-global semantic logic. Our framework strengthens the foundations of constructive analysis while contributing tools relevant to formal verification, type-theoretic proof systems, and computational mathematics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Advances in Mathematics.

| **[Calibrated and Robust Foundation Models for Vision-Language and Medical Image Tasks Under Distribution Shift](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09222v2)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models like CLIP and SAM have advanced computer vision and medical imaging via low-shot transfer learning, aiding CADD with limited data. However, their deployment faces two key challenges. \textit{distribution shift} where pre-training and post-training data distributions differ (e.g., due to inter-center image acquisition) and \textit{confidence misalignment}, which leads to overconfident errors. These issues surface differently, vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) suffer from 2D embedding shift (image-text misalignment), while medical models (e.g., SAM) encounter 3D domain shifts (e.g., scanner variation) and voxel-wise calibration need. Existing solutions are domain-specific. We propose \textbf{StaRFM}, a fusion of Fisher information penalty (FIP) and confidence misalignment penalty (CMP) tackling both challenges. It applies FIP, extended to 3D via patch-wise regularization, to reduce embedding shift, and CMP, reformulated for voxel-level predictions, to calibrate segmentation uncertainty. We derive PAC-Bayes bounds. FIP controls generalization via the Fisher-Rao norm, and CMP reduces calibration error via Brier score minimization. StaRFM surpasses baselines by \texttt{+}3.5\% accuracy and 28\% lower ECE on 19 vision datasets (e.g., ImageNet, Office-Home), achieves +4.2\% DSC over SAM-FT and 4.8mm HD95 on medical benchmarks (e.g., BraTS, ATLAS), and reduces cross-domain gaps by up to 20\%. The framework is plug-and-play, requiring minimal architectural changes.

In this study, we present a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates the performance, fairness, and interpretability of foundation models, both as unimodal encoders and as multimodal learners, using the publicly available MIMIC-IV database. To support consistent and reproducible evaluation, we developed a standardized data processing pipeline that harmonizes heterogeneous clinical records into an analysis-ready format. We systematically compared eight foundation models, encompassing both unimodal and multimodal models, as well as domain-specific and general-purpose variants. Our findings demonstrate that incorporating multiple data modalities leads to consistent improvements in predictive performance without introducing additional bias.

These models leverage large-scale pre-training techniques, allowing them to generalize effectively across multiple scenarios, tasks, and modalities, thus overcoming the traditional limitations faced by conventional artificial intelligence (AI) approaches in understanding complex brain data. By tapping into the power of pretrained models, BFMs provide a means to process neural data in a more unified manner, enabling advanced analysis and discovery in the field of neuroscience. In this survey, we define BFMs for the first time, providing a clear and concise framework for constructing and utilizing these models in various applications. We also examine the key principles and methodologies for developing these models, shedding light on how they transform the landscape of neural signal processing. This survey presents a comprehensive review of the latest advancements in BFMs, covering the most recent methodological innovations, novel views of application areas, and challenges in the field. Notably, we highlight the future directions and key challenges that need to be addressed to fully realize the potential of BFMs. These challenges include improving the quality of brain data, optimizing model architecture for better generalization, increasing training efficiency, and enhancing the interpretability and robustness of BFMs in real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Signal Processing Magazine</p></details> |

However, existing models rely heavily on real-world data, which is costly and labor-intensive to collect. Synthetic data offers a cost-effective alternative, yet its potential remains largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we explore the feasibility of training Vision-Language-Action models entirely with large-scale synthetic action data. We curate SynGrasp-1B, a billion-frame robotic grasping dataset generated in simulation with photorealistic rendering and extensive domain randomization. Building on this, we present GraspVLA, a VLA model pretrained on large-scale synthetic action data as a foundational model for grasping tasks. GraspVLA integrates autoregressive perception tasks and flow-matching-based action generation into a unified Chain-of-Thought process, enabling joint training on synthetic action data and Internet semantics data. This design helps mitigate sim-to-real gaps and facilitates the transfer of learned actions to a broader range of Internet-covered objects, achieving open-vocabulary generalization in grasping. Extensive evaluations across real-world and simulation benchmarks demonstrate GraspVLA's advanced zero-shot generalizability and few-shot adaptability to specific human preferences. We will release SynGrasp-1B dataset and pre-trained weights to benefit the community.</p></details> |  |
| **[ViT-Split: Unleashing the Power of Vision Foundation Models via Efficient Splitting Heads](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03433v2)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision foundation models (VFMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of downstream tasks. While several VFM adapters have shown promising results by leveraging the prior knowledge of VFMs, we identify two inefficiencies in these approaches. First, the interaction between convolutional neural network (CNN) and VFM backbone triggers early layer gradient backpropagation. Second, existing methods require tuning all components, adding complexity. Besides, these adapters alter VFM features, underutilizing the prior knowledge. To tackle these challenges, we propose a new approach called ViT-Split, based on a key observation: the layers of several VFMs, like DINOv2, can be divided into two distinct components: an extractor for learning low-level features and an adapter for learning task-specific features. Leveraging this insight, we eliminate the CNN branch and introduce two heads, task head and prior head, to the frozen VFM. The task head is designed to learn task-specific features, mitigating the early gradient propagation issue. The prior head is used to leverage the multi-scale prior features from the frozen VFM, reducing tuning parameters and overfitting. Extensive experiments on various tasks (e.g., segmentation, detection, depth estimation, and visual question answering) validate the effectiveness and efficiency of ViT-Split. Specifically, ViT-Split reduces training time up to $4\times$ while achieving comparable or even better results on ADE20K, compared to other VFM adapters.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The project is available: https://jackyfl.github.io/vitsplit.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Foundation Models as Class-Incremental Learners for Dermatological Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14050v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to learn new classes over time without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. The emergence of foundation models (FM) pretrained on large datasets presents new opportunities for CIL by offering rich, transferable representations. However, their potential for enabling incremental learning in dermatology remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we systematically evaluate frozen FMs pretrained on large-scale skin lesion datasets for CIL in dermatological disease classification. We propose a simple yet effective approach where the backbone remains frozen, and a lightweight MLP is trained incrementally for each task. This setup achieves state-of-the-art performance without forgetting, outperforming regularization, replay, and architecture based methods. To further explore the capabilities of frozen FMs, we examine zero training scenarios using nearest mean classifiers with prototypes derived from their embeddings. Through extensive ablation studies, we demonstrate that this prototype based variant can also achieve competitive results. Our findings highlight the strength of frozen FMs for continual learning in dermatology and support their broader adoption in real world medical applications. Our code and datasets are available here.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the MICCAI EMERGE 2025 workshop</p></details> |
| **[Leveraging Pathology Foundation Models for Panoptic Segmentation of Melanoma in H&E Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13974v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Melanoma is an aggressive form of skin cancer with rapid progression and high metastatic potential. Accurate characterisation of tissue morphology in melanoma is crucial for prognosis and treatment planning. However, manual segmentation of tissue regions from haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained whole-slide images (WSIs) is labour-intensive and prone to inter-observer variability, this motivates the need for reliable automated tissue segmentation methods. In this study, we propose a novel deep learning network for the segmentation of five tissue classes in melanoma H&E images. Our approach leverages Virchow2, a pathology foundation model trained on 3.1 million histopathology images as a feature extractor. These features are fused with the original RGB images and subsequently processed by an encoder-decoder segmentation network (Efficient-UNet) to produce accurate segmentation maps. The proposed model achieved first place in the tissue segmentation task of the PUMA Grand Challenge, demonstrating robust performance and generalizability. Our results show the potential and efficacy of incorporating pathology foundation models into segmentation networks to accelerate computational pathology workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by MIUA 2025</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing LiDAR Point Features with Foundation Model Priors for 3D Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13899v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in foundation models have opened up new possibilities for enhancing 3D perception. In particular, DepthAnything offers dense and reliable geometric priors from monocular RGB images, which can complement sparse LiDAR data in autonomous driving scenarios. However, such priors remain underutilized in LiDAR-based 3D object detection. In this paper, we address the limited expressiveness of raw LiDAR point features, especially the weak discriminative capability of the reflectance attribute, by introducing depth priors predicted by DepthAnything. These priors are fused with the original LiDAR attributes to enrich each point's representation. To leverage the enhanced point features, we propose a point-wise feature extraction module. Then, a Dual-Path RoI feature extraction framework is employed, comprising a voxel-based branch for global semantic context and a point-based branch for fine-grained structural details. To effectively integrate the complementary RoI features, we introduce a bidirectional gated RoI feature fusion module that balances global and local cues. Extensive experiments on the KITTI benchmark show that our method consistently improves detection accuracy, demonstrating the value of incorporating visual foundation model priors into LiDAR-based 3D object detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards scientific discovery with dictionary learning: Extracting biological concepts from microscopy foundation models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16247v3)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sparse dictionary learning (DL) has emerged as a powerful approach to extract semantically meaningful concepts from the internals of large language models (LLMs) trained mainly in the text domain. In this work, we explore whether DL can extract meaningful concepts from less human-interpretable scientific data, such as vision foundation models trained on cell microscopy images, where limited prior knowledge exists about which high-level concepts should arise. We propose a novel combination of a sparse DL algorithm, Iterative Codebook Feature Learning (ICFL), with a PCA whitening pre-processing step derived from control data. Using this combined approach, we successfully retrieve biologically meaningful concepts, such as cell types and genetic perturbations. Moreover, we demonstrate how our method reveals subtle morphological changes arising from human-interpretable interventions, offering a promising new direction for scientific discovery via mechanistic interpretability in bioimaging.</p></details> |  |
| **[SkySense V2: A Unified Foundation Model for Multi-modal Remote Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13812v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The multi-modal remote sensing foundation model (MM-RSFM) has significantly advanced various Earth observation tasks, such as urban planning, environmental monitoring, and natural disaster management. However, most existing approaches generally require the training of separate backbone networks for each data modality, leading to redundancy and inefficient parameter utilization. Moreover, prevalent pre-training methods typically apply self-supervised learning (SSL) techniques from natural images without adequately accommodating the characteristics of remote sensing (RS) images, such as the complicated semantic distribution within a single RS image. In this work, we present SkySense V2, a unified MM-RSFM that employs a single transformer backbone to handle multiple modalities. This backbone is pre-trained with a novel SSL strategy tailored to the distinct traits of RS data. In particular, SkySense V2 incorporates an innovative adaptive patch merging module and learnable modality prompt tokens to address challenges related to varying resolutions and limited feature diversity across modalities. In additional, we incorporate the mixture of experts (MoE) module to further enhance the performance of the foundation model. SkySense V2 demonstrates impressive generalization abilities through an extensive evaluation involving 16 datasets over 7 tasks, outperforming SkySense by an average of 1.8 points.</p></details> | Accepted by ICCV25 |
| **[On-the-Fly Fine-Tuning of Foundational Neural Network Potentials: A Bayesian Neural Network Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13805v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the computational complexity of evaluating interatomic forces from first principles, the creation of interatomic machine learning force fields has become a highly active field of research. However, the generation of training datasets of sufficient size and sample diversity itself comes with a computational burden that can make this approach impractical for modeling rare events or systems with a large configuration space. Fine-tuning foundation models that have been pre-trained on large-scale material or molecular databases offers a promising opportunity to reduce the amount of training data necessary to reach a desired level of accuracy. However, even if this approach requires less training data overall, creating a suitable training dataset can still be a very challenging problem, especially for systems with rare events and for end-users who don't have an extensive background in machine learning. In on-the-fly learning, the creation of a training dataset can be largely automated by using model uncertainty during the simulation to decide if the model is accurate enough or if a structure should be recalculated with classical methods and used to update the model. A key challenge for applying this form of active learning to the fine-tuning of foundation models is how to assess the uncertainty of those models during the fine-tuning process, even though most foundation models lack any form of uncertainty quantification. In this paper, we overcome this challenge by introducing a fine-tuning approach based on Bayesian neural network methods and a subsequent on-the-fly workflow that automatically fine-tunes the model while maintaining a pre-specified accuracy and can detect rare events such as transition states and sample them at an increased rate relative to their occurrence.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey of Behavior Foundation Model: Next-Generation Whole-Body Control System of Humanoid Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20487v3)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humanoid robots are drawing significant attention as versatile platforms for complex motor control, human-robot interaction, and general-purpose physical intelligence. However, achieving efficient whole-body control (WBC) in humanoids remains a fundamental challenge due to sophisticated dynamics, underactuation, and diverse task requirements. While learning-based controllers have shown promise for complex tasks, their reliance on labor-intensive and costly retraining for new scenarios limits real-world applicability. To address these limitations, behavior(al) foundation models (BFMs) have emerged as a new paradigm that leverages large-scale pre-training to learn reusable primitive skills and broad behavioral priors, enabling zero-shot or rapid adaptation to a wide range of downstream tasks. In this paper, we present a comprehensive overview of BFMs for humanoid WBC, tracing their development across diverse pre-training pipelines. Furthermore, we discuss real-world applications, current limitations, urgent challenges, and future opportunities, positioning BFMs as a key approach toward scalable and general-purpose humanoid intelligence. Finally, we provide a curated and long-term list of BFM papers and projects to facilitate more subsequent research, which is available at https://github.com/yuanmingqi/awesome-bfm-papers.</p></details> | 18 pages, 9 figures |

| **[MoTM: Towards a Foundation Model for Time Series Imputation based on Continuous Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13207v2)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have witnessed a growing interest for time series foundation models, with a strong emphasis on the forecasting task. Yet, the crucial task of out-of-domain imputation of missing values remains largely underexplored. We propose a first step to fill this gap by leveraging implicit neural representations (INRs). INRs model time series as continuous functions and naturally handle various missing data scenarios and sampling rates. While they have shown strong performance within specific distributions, they struggle under distribution shifts. To address this, we introduce MoTM (Mixture of Timeflow Models), a step toward a foundation model for time series imputation. Building on the idea that a new time series is a mixture of previously seen patterns, MoTM combines a basis of INRs, each trained independently on a distinct family of time series, with a ridge regressor that adapts to the observed context at inference. We demonstrate robust in-domain and out-of-domain generalization across diverse imputation scenarios (e.g., block and pointwise missingness, variable sampling rates), paving the way for adaptable foundation imputation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>10th ...</summary><p>10th Workshop on Advanced Analytics and Learning on Temporal Data (AALTD), ECML 2025</p></details> |

Building upon established next-token prediction approaches, we aim to address potential challenges such as resolution loss from existing tokenization schemes and limited support for conditional generation. We propose four key innovations: (i) separate vocabularies for discrete and continuous variates, combined via Causal Multi-Head Cross-Attention (CMHCA), (ii) continuous kinematic conditioning through prepended context embeddings, (iii) scalable and simple, high-resolution continuous variate tokenization without joint vocabulary inflation, and (iv) class conditional generation through a Mixture of Experts. Our model enables fast, high-fidelity generation of pixel and time sequences for Cherenkov photons, validated through closure tests in the High Performance DIRC. We also show our model generalizes to reconstruction tasks such as pion/kaon identification, and noise filtering, in which we show its ability to leverage fine-tuning under specific objectives.</p></details> | 27 pages; 18 figures |

However, progress has been hindered by limited datasets and the restricted generalizability of existing models. Here, we propose NanoPro-3M, the largest nanomaterial-protein interaction dataset to date, comprising over 3.2 million samples and 37,000 unique proteins. Leveraging this, we present NanoProFormer, a foundational model that predicts nanomaterial-protein affinities through multimodal representation learning, demonstrating strong generalization, handling missing features, and unseen nanomaterials or proteins. We show that multimodal modeling significantly outperforms single-modality approaches and identifies key determinants of corona formation. Furthermore, we demonstrate its applicability to a range of downstream tasks through zero-shot inference and fine-tuning. Together, this work establishes a solid foundation for high-performance and generalized prediction of nanomaterial-protein interaction endpoints, reducing experimental reliance and accelerating various in vitro applications.</p></details> | 31 pages, 6 figures |

Both models are trained on large-scale multilingual and multimodal datasets sourced via responsible web crawling, licensed corpora, and high-quality synthetic data, then further refined with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning on a new asynchronous platform. The resulting models support several additional languages while understanding images and executing tool calls. In public benchmarks and human evaluations, both the server model and the on-device model match or surpass comparably sized open baselines. A new Swift-centric Foundation Models framework exposes guided generation, constrained tool calling, and LoRA adapter fine-tuning, allowing developers to integrate these capabilities with a few lines of code. The latest advancements in Apple Intelligence models are grounded in our Responsible AI approach with safeguards like content filtering and locale-specific evaluation, as well as our commitment to protecting our users' privacy with innovations like Private Cloud Compute.</p></details> |  |
