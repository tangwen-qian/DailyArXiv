| **[An Architecture for Spatial Networking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22687v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physical spaces are increasingly dense with networked devices, promising seamless coordination and ambient intelligence. Yet today, cloud-first architectures force all communication through wide-area networks regardless of physical proximity. We lack an abstraction for spatial networking: using physical spaces to create boundaries for private, robust, and low-latency communication. We introduce $\textit{Bifr\"ost}$, a programming model that realizes spatial networking using bigraphs to express both containment and connectivity, enabling policies to be scoped by physical boundaries, devices to be named by location, the instantiation of spatial services, and the composition of spaces while maintaining local autonomy. Bifr\"ost enables a new class of spatially-aware applications, where co-located devices communicate directly, physical barriers require explicit gateways, and local control bridges to global coordination.</p></details> |  |

However, one of the main hesitations regarding their introduction is that creating personalized HRTFs is impractical at scale due to the complexities of the HRTF measurement process. To mitigate this drawback, HRTF spatial upsampling has been proposed with the aim of reducing measurements required. While prior work has seen success with different machine learning (ML) approaches, these models often struggle with long-range spatial consistency and generalization at high upsampling factors. In this paper, we propose a novel transformer-based architecture for HRTF upsampling, leveraging the attention mechanism to better capture spatial correlations across the HRTF sphere. Working in the spherical harmonic (SH) domain, our model learns to reconstruct high-resolution HRTFs from sparse input measurements with significantly improved accuracy. To enhance spatial coherence, we introduce a neighbor dissimilarity loss that promotes magnitude smoothness, yielding more realistic upsampling. We evaluate our method using both perceptual localization models and objective spectral distortion metrics. Experiments show that our model surpasses leading methods by a substantial margin in generating realistic, high-fidelity HRTFs.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages and 5 figures</p></details> |
| **[Like Playing a Video Game: Spatial-Temporal Optimization of Foot Trajectories for Controlled Football Kicking in Bipedal Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01843v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humanoid robot soccer presents several challenges, particularly in maintaining system stability during aggressive kicking motions while achieving precise ball trajectory control. Current solutions, whether traditional position-based control methods or reinforcement learning (RL) approaches, exhibit significant limitations. Model predictive control (MPC) is a prevalent approach for ordinary quadruped and biped robots. While MPC has demonstrated advantages in legged robots, existing studies often oversimplify the leg swing progress, relying merely on simple trajectory interpolation methods. This severely constrains the foot's environmental interaction capability, hindering tasks such as ball kicking. This study innovatively adapts the spatial-temporal trajectory planning method, which has been successful in drone applications, to bipedal robotic systems. The proposed approach autonomously generates foot trajectories that satisfy constraints on target kicking position, velocity, and acceleration while simultaneously optimizing swing phase duration. Experimental results demonstrate that the optimized trajectories closely mimic human kicking behavior, featuring a backswing motion. Simulation and hardware experiments confirm the algorithm's efficiency, with trajectory planning times under 1 ms, and its reliability, achieving nearly 100 % task completion accuracy when the soccer goal is within the range of -90{\deg} to 90{\deg}.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 8 figures, conference paper</p></details> |
| **[Scalable Asynchronous Federated Modeling for Spatial Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01771v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial data are central to applications such as environmental monitoring and urban planning, but are often distributed across devices where privacy and communication constraints limit direct sharing. Federated modeling offers a practical solution that preserves data privacy while enabling global modeling across distributed data sources. For instance, environmental sensor networks are privacy- and bandwidth-constrained, motivating federated spatial modeling that shares only privacy-preserving summaries to produce timely, high-resolution pollution maps without centralizing raw data. However, existing federated modeling approaches either ignore spatial dependence or rely on synchronous updates that suffer from stragglers in heterogeneous environments. This work proposes an asynchronous federated modeling framework for spatial data based on low-rank Gaussian process approximations. The method employs block-wise optimization and introduces strategies for gradient correction, adaptive aggregation, and stabilized updates. We establish linear convergence with explicit dependence on staleness, a result of standalone theoretical significance. Moreover, numerical experiments demonstrate that the asynchronous algorithm achieves synchronous performance under balanced resource allocation and significantly outperforms it in heterogeneous settings, showcasing superior robustness and scalability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Euclid's Gift: Enhancing Spatial Perception and Reasoning in Vision-Language Models via Geometric Surrogate Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24473v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial intelligence spans a rich suite of abilities, including visualising and transforming shapes, mentally rotating objects, judging relational positions and containment, and estimating numerosity. However, it still remains a critical unresolved challenge for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).To fill this gap, we propose to treat Euclidean geometry problem-solving as a surrogate task. Specifically, we meticulously constructed a curated multimodal dataset, called Euclid30K, comprising approximately 30K plane and solid geometry problems. To enable the model to acquire and apply Euclidean principles from these geometry problems, we employed Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to finetune the Qwen2.5VL family and RoboBrain2.0 family, inspiring the models to identify shapes, count, and relate entities, and perform multi-step deductive reasoning using Euclidean principles. Our experiments demonstrate that the resulting models achieve substantial zero-shot gains across four spatial reasoning benchmarks (Super-CLEVR, Omni3DBench, VSI-Bench, and MindCube) without any task-specific adaptations. Notably, after training on the Euclid30K, the mean VSI-Bench accuracy of all evaluated models rose from 34.5% to 40.5%, improving by 5.5 percentage points. Among them, RoboBrain2.0-Euclid-7B achieves 49.6\% accuracy, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art model, Spatial-MLLM.To our knowledge, this is the first systematic study showing that geometry-centric fine-tuning can confer vision-language models with broadly transferable spatial skills. Code and Euclid30K dataset can be found in https://zgca-ai4edu.github.io/Euclids_Gift.</p></details> |  |
| **[OpenFLAME: A Federated Spatial Naming Infrastructure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04271v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial applications, i.e., applications that tie digital information with the physical world, have improved many of our daily activities, such as navigation and ride-sharing. This class of applications also holds significant promise of enabling new industries such as augmented reality and robotics. The development of these applications is enabled by a system that can resolve real-world locations to names, or a spatial naming system. Today, mapping platforms provided by organizations like Google and Apple serve as spatial naming systems. These maps are centralized and primarily cover outdoor spaces. We envision that future spatial applications, such as persistent world-scale augmented reality, would require detailed and precise spatial data across indoor and outdoor spaces. The scale of cartography efforts required to survey indoor spaces and their privacy needs inhibit existing centralized maps from incorporating such spaces into their platform. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of OpenFLAME stands for Open Federated Localization and Mapping Engine, a federated spatial naming system, or in other words, a federated mapping infrastructure. It enables independent parties to manage and serve their own maps of physical regions. This unlocks scalability of map management, isolation, and privacy of maps. The discovery system that identifies maps hosted at a given location is a primary component of our system. We implement OpenFLAME on top of the existing Domain Name System (DNS), which enables us to leverage its existing infrastructure. We implement map services such as address-to-location mapping, routing, and localization on top of our federated mapping infrastructure.</p></details> |  |
| **[Disentangling Multiplex Spatial-Temporal Transition Graph Representation Learning for Socially Enhanced POI Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07649v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Next Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation is a research hotspot in business intelligence, where users' spatial-temporal transitions and social relationships play key roles. However, most existing works model spatial and temporal transitions separately, leading to misaligned representations of the same spatial-temporal key nodes. This misalignment introduces redundant information during fusion, increasing model uncertainty and reducing interpretability. To address this issue, we propose DiMuST, a socially enhanced POI recommendation model based on disentangled representation learning over multiplex spatial-temporal transition graphs. The model employs a novel Disentangled variational multiplex graph Auto-Encoder (DAE), which first disentangles shared and private distributions using a multiplex spatial-temporal graph strategy. It then fuses the shared features via a Product of Experts (PoE) mechanism and denoises the private features through contrastive constraints. The model effectively captures the spatial-temporal transition representations of POIs while preserving the intrinsic correlation of their spatial-temporal relationships. Experiments on two challenging datasets demonstrate that our DiMuST significantly outperforms existing methods across multiple metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>There...</summary><p>There are quality issues with the paper and it requires major revisions</p></details> |
| **[Sparkle: Mastering Basic Spatial Capabilities in Vision Language Models Elicits Generalization to Spatial Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16162v4)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision language models (VLMs) perform well on many tasks but often fail at spatial reasoning, which is essential for navigation and interaction with physical environments. Many spatial reasoning tasks depend on fundamental two-dimensional (2D) skills, yet our evaluation shows that state-of-the-art VLMs give implausible or incorrect answers to composite spatial problems, including simple pathfinding tasks that humans solve effortlessly. To address this, we enhance 2D spatial reasoning in VLMs by training them only on basic spatial capabilities. We first disentangle 2D spatial reasoning into three core components: direction comprehension, distance estimation, and localization. We hypothesize that mastering these skills substantially improves performance on complex spatial tasks that require advanced reasoning and combinatorial problem solving, while also generalizing to real-world scenarios. To test this, we introduce Sparkle, a framework that generates synthetic data to provide targeted supervision across these three capabilities and yields an instruction dataset for each. Experiments show that VLMs fine-tuned with \emph{Sparkle} improve not only on basic tasks but also on composite and out-of-distribution real-world spatial reasoning tasks. These results indicate that enhancing basic spatial skills through synthetic generalization effectively advances complex spatial reasoning and offers a systematic strategy for boosting the spatial understanding of VLMs. Source codes of Sparkle are available at https://github.com/YihongT/Sparkle.</p></details> |  |
| **[Grounded GUI Understanding for Vision-Based Spatial Intelligent Agent: Exemplified by Extended Reality Apps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10811v4)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, spatial computing a.k.a. Extended Reality (XR) has emerged as a transformative technology, offering users immersive and interactive experiences across diversified virtual environments. Users can interact with XR apps through interactable GUI elements (IGEs) on the stereoscopic three-dimensional (3D) graphical user interface (GUI). The accurate recognition of these IGEs is instrumental, serving as the foundation of many software engineering tasks, including automated testing and effective GUI search. The most recent IGE detection approaches for 2D mobile apps typically train a supervised object detection model based on a large-scale manually-labeled GUI dataset, usually with a pre-defined set of clickable GUI element categories like buttons and spinners. Such approaches can hardly be applied to IGE detection in XR apps, due to a multitude of challenges including complexities posed by open-vocabulary and heterogeneous IGE categories, intricacies of context-sensitive interactability, and the necessities of precise spatial perception and visual-semantic alignment for accurate IGE detection results. Thus, it is necessary to embark on the IGE research tailored to XR apps. In this paper, we propose the first zero-shot cOntext-sensitive inteRactable GUI ElemeNT dEtection framework for virtual Reality apps, named Orienter. By imitating human behaviors, Orienter observes and understands the semantic contexts of XR app scenes first, before performing the detection. The detection process is iterated within a feedback-directed validation and reflection loop. Specifically, Orienter contains three components, including (1) Semantic context comprehension, (2) Reflection-directed IGE candidate detection, and (3) Context-sensitive interactability classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Orienter is more effective than the state-of-the-art GUI element detection approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Local aggregate multiscale processes: A scalable, machine-learning-compatible spatial model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00968v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study develops the Local Aggregate Multiscale Process (LAMP), a scalable and machine-learning-compatible alternative to conventional spatial Gaussian processes (GPs, or kriging). Unlike conventional covariance-based spatial models, LAMP represents spatial processes by a multiscale ensemble of local models, inspired by geographically weighted regression. To ensure stable model training, larger-scale patterns that are easier to learn are modeled first, followed by smaller-scale patterns, with training terminated once the validation score stops improving. The training procedure, which is based on holdout validation, is easily integrated with other machine learning algorithms (e.g., random forests and neural networks). LAMP training is computationally efficient as it avoids explicit matrix inversion, a major computational bottleneck in conventional GPs. Comparative Monte Carlo experiments demonstrate that LAMP, as well as its integration with random forests, achieves superior predictive performance compared to existing models. Finally, we apply the proposed methods to an analysis of residential land prices in the Tokyo metropolitan area, Japan. The R code is available from available from https://github.com/dmuraka/spLAMP_dev_version/tree/main</p></details> |  |
| **[MoveGPT: Scaling Mobility Foundation Models with Spatially-Aware Mixture of Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18670v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The success of foundation models in language has inspired a new wave of general-purpose models for human mobility. However, existing approaches struggle to scale effectively due to two fundamental limitations: a failure to use meaningful basic units to represent movement, and an inability to capture the vast diversity of patterns found in large-scale data. In this work, we develop MoveGPT, a large-scale foundation model specifically architected to overcome these barriers. MoveGPT is built upon two key innovations: (1) a unified location encoder that maps geographically disjoint locations into a shared semantic space, enabling pre-training on a global scale; and (2) a Spatially-Aware Mixture-of-Experts Transformer that develops specialized experts to efficiently capture diverse mobility patterns. Pre-trained on billion-scale datasets, MoveGPT establishes a new state-of-the-art across a wide range of downstream tasks, achieving performance gains of up to 35% on average. It also demonstrates strong generalization capabilities to unseen cities. Crucially, our work provides empirical evidence of scaling ability in human mobility, validating a clear path toward building increasingly capable foundation models in this domain.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial Gaussian fields for complex areas with application to marine megafauna conservation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00611v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial Gaussian fields (SGFs) are widely employed in modeling the distributions of marine megafauna, yet they traditionally rely on assumptions of isotropy and stationarity, conditions that often prove unrealistic in complex ecological environments featuring coastlines, islands, and depth gradients acting as partial movement barriers. Existing spatial models typically treat these barriers as either fully impermeable, completely blocking species movement and dispersal, or entirely absent, which inadequately represents most real-world scenarios. To address this limitation, we introduce the Transparent Barrier Model, an extension of spatial Gaussian fields that explicitly incorporates barriers with varying levels of permeability. The model assigns spatially varying range parameters to distinct barrier regions, allowing ecological and geographical knowledge about barrier permeability to directly inform model specifications. This approach maintains computational efficiency by utilizing the integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) framework combined with stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs), ensuring feasible application even in large, complex spatial domains.We demonstrate the practical utility and flexibility of the Transparent Barrier Model through its application to dugong (Dugong dugon) distribution data from the Red Sea.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Semantics: Rediscovering Spatial Awareness in Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17349v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Language Models (VLMs) excel at identifying and describing objects but often fail at spatial reasoning. We study why VLMs, such as LLaVA, underutilize spatial cues despite having positional encodings and spatially rich vision encoder features. Our analysis reveals a key imbalance: vision token embeddings have much larger norms than text tokens, suppressing LLM's position embedding. To expose this mechanism, we developed three interpretability tools: (1) the Position Sensitivity Index, which quantifies reliance on token order, (2) the Cross Modality Balance, which reveals attention head allocation patterns, and (3) a RoPE Sensitivity probe, which measures dependence on rotary positional embeddings. These tools uncover that vision tokens and system prompts dominate attention. We validated our mechanistic understanding through targeted interventions that predictably restore positional sensitivity. These findings reveal previously unknown failure modes in multimodal attention and demonstrate how interpretability analysis can guide principled improvements.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contrastive Diffusion Guidance for Spatial Inverse Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26489v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the inverse problem of reconstructing the spatial layout of a place, a home floorplan for example, from a user`s movements inside that layout. Direct inversion is ill-posed since many floorplans can explain the same movement trajectories. We adopt a diffusion-based posterior sampler to generate layouts consistent with the measurements. While active research is in progress on generative inverse solvers, we find that the forward operator in our problem poses new challenges. The path-planning process inside a floorplan is a non-invertible, non-differentiable function, and causes instability while optimizing using the likelihood score. We break-away from existing approaches and reformulate the likelihood score in a smoother embedding space. The embedding space is trained with a contrastive loss which brings compatible floorplans and trajectories close to each other, while pushing mismatched pairs far apart. We show that a surrogate form of the likelihood score in this embedding space is a valid approximation of the true likelihood score, making it possible to steer the denoising process towards the posterior. Across extensive experiments, our model CoGuide produces more consistent floorplans from trajectories, and is more robust than differentiable-planner baselines and guided-diffusion methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial-Spectral Binarized Neural Network for Panchromatic and Multi-spectral Images Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23321v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote sensing pansharpening aims to reconstruct spatial-spectral properties during the fusion of panchromatic (PAN) images and low-resolution multi-spectral (LR-MS) images, finally generating the high-resolution multi-spectral (HR-MS) images. Although deep learning-based models have achieved excellent performance, they often come with high computational complexity, which hinder their applications on resource-limited devices. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of applying the binary neural network (BNN) to pan-sharpening. Nevertheless, there are two main issues with binarizing pan-sharpening models: (i) the binarization will cause serious spectral distortion due to the inconsistent spectral distribution of the PAN/LR-MS images; (ii) the common binary convolution kernel is difficult to adapt to the multi-scale and anisotropic spatial features of remote sensing objects, resulting in serious degradation of contours. To address the above issues, we design the customized spatial-spectral binarized convolution (S2B-Conv), which is composed of the Spectral-Redistribution Mechanism (SRM) and Gabor Spatial Feature Amplifier (GSFA). Specifically, SRM employs an affine transformation, generating its scaling and bias parameters through a dynamic learning process. GSFA, which randomly selects different frequencies and angles within a preset range, enables to better handle multi-scale and-directional spatial features. A series of S2B-Conv form a brand-new binary network for pan-sharpening, dubbed as S2BNet. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments have shown our high-efficiency binarized pan-sharpening method can attain a promising performance.</p></details> |  |

Yet, we identify two bottlenecks of LAMs: 1) the commonly adopted end-to-end trained image encoder suffers from poor spatial understanding; 2) LAMs can be fragile when input frames are distant, leading to limited temporal perception. Such factors inevitably hinder stable and clear action modeling. To this end, we propose Farsighted-LAM, a latent action framework with geometry-aware spatial encoding and multi-scale temporal modeling, capturing structural priors and dynamic motion patterns from consecutive frames. We further propose SSM-VLA, an end-to-end VLA framework built upon Farsighted-LAM, which integrates structured perception with a visual Chain-of-Thought module to explicitly reason about environmental dynamics, enhancing decision consistency and interpretability. We validate SSM-VLA on multiple VLA tasks in both simulation and real-world settings, and achieve state-of-the-art performance. Our results demonstrate that our strategy of combining geometry-aware modeling, temporal coherence, and explicit reasoning is effective in enhancing the robustness and generalizability of embodied intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[OWL: Geometry-Aware Spatial Reasoning for Audio Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26140v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial reasoning is fundamental to auditory perception, yet current audio large language models (ALLMs) largely rely on unstructured binaural cues and single step inference. This limits both perceptual accuracy in direction and distance estimation and the capacity for interpretable reasoning. Recent work such as BAT demonstrates spatial QA with binaural audio, but its reliance on coarse categorical labels (left, right, up, down) and the absence of explicit geometric supervision constrain resolution and robustness. We introduce the $\textbf{Spatial-Acoustic Geometry Encoder (SAGE}$), a geometry-aware audio encoder that aligns binaural acoustic features with 3D spatial structure using panoramic depth images and room-impulse responses at training time, while requiring only audio at inference. Building on this representation, we present $\textbf{OWL}$, an ALLM that integrates $\textbf{SAGE}$ with a spatially grounded chain-of-thought to rationalize over direction-of-arrivals (DoA) and distance estimates. Through curriculum learning from perceptual QA to multi-step reasoning, $\textbf{OWL}$ supports o'clock-level azimuth and DoA estimation. To enable large-scale training and evaluation, we construct and release $\textbf{BiDepth}$, a dataset of over one million QA pairs combining binaural audio with panoramic depth images and room impulse responses across both in-room and out-of-room scenarios. Across two benchmark datasets, our new $\textbf{BiDepth}$ and the public SpatialSoundQA, $\textbf{OWL}$ reduces mean DoA error by $\textbf{11$^{\circ}$}$ through $\textbf{SAGE}$ and improves spatial reasoning QA accuracy by up to $\textbf{25}$\% over BAT.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial exponential decay of perturbations in optimal control of general evolution equations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12279v3)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We analyze the robustness of optimally controlled evolution equations with respect to spatially localized perturbations. We prove that if the involved operators are domain-uniformly stabilizable and detectable, then these localized perturbations only have a local effect on the optimal solution. We characterize this domain-uniform stabilizability and detectability for the transport equation with constant transport velocity, showing that even for unitary semigroups, optimality implies exponential damping. We extend this result to the case of a space-dependent transport velocity. Finally we leverage the results for the transport equation to characterize domain-uniform stabilizability of the wave equation. Numerical examples in one space dimension complement the theoretical results.</p></details> | 53 pages, 5 figures |

To help overcome these limitations, we introduce iVISPAR, an interactive multimodal benchmark designed to evaluate the spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs acting as agents. \mbox{iVISPAR} is based on a variant of the sliding tile puzzle, a classic problem that demands logical planning, spatial awareness, and multi-step reasoning. The benchmark supports visual 3D, 2D, and text-based input modalities, enabling comprehensive assessments of VLMs' planning and reasoning skills. We evaluate a broad suite of state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source VLMs, comparing their performance while also providing optimal path solutions and a human baseline to assess the task's complexity and feasibility for humans. Results indicate that while VLMs perform better on 2D tasks compared to 3D or text-based settings, they struggle with complex spatial configurations and consistently fall short of human performance, illustrating the persistent challenge of visual alignment. This underscores critical gaps in current VLM capabilities, highlighting their limitations in achieving human-level cognition. Project website: https://microcosm.ai/ivispar</p></details> |  |

We identify a critical limitation: current VLMs excel primarily at egocentric spatial reasoning (from the camera's perspective) but fail to generalize to allocentric viewpoints when required to adopt another entity's spatial frame of reference. We introduce ViewSpatial-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed specifically for multi-viewpoint spatial localization recognition evaluation across five distinct task types, supported by an automated 3D annotation pipeline that generates precise directional labels. Comprehensive evaluation of diverse VLMs on ViewSpatial-Bench reveals a significant performance disparity: models demonstrate reasonable performance on camera-perspective tasks but exhibit reduced accuracy when reasoning from a human viewpoint. By fine-tuning VLMs on our multi-perspective spatial dataset, we achieve an overall performance improvement of 46.24% across tasks, highlighting the efficacy of our approach. Our work establishes a crucial benchmark for spatial intelligence in embodied AI systems and provides empirical evidence that modeling 3D spatial relationships enhances VLMs' corresponding spatial comprehension capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project: https://zju-real.github.io/ViewSpatial-Page/</p></details> |
| **[S$^2$FS: Spatially-Aware Separability-Driven Feature Selection in Fuzzy Decision Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25841v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Feature selection is crucial for fuzzy decision systems (FDSs), as it identifies informative features and eliminates rule redundancy, thereby enhancing predictive performance and interpretability. Most existing methods either fail to directly align evaluation criteria with learning performance or rely solely on non-directional Euclidean distances to capture relationships among decision classes, which limits their ability to clarify decision boundaries. However, the spatial distribution of instances has a potential impact on the clarity of such boundaries. Motivated by this, we propose Spatially-aware Separability-driven Feature Selection (S$^2$FS), a novel framework for FDSs guided by a spatially-aware separability criterion. This criterion jointly considers within-class compactness and between-class separation by integrating scalar-distances with spatial directional information, providing a more comprehensive characterization of class structures. S$^2$FS employs a forward greedy strategy to iteratively select the most discriminative features. Extensive experiments on ten real-world datasets demonstrate that S$^2$FS consistently outperforms eight state-of-the-art feature selection algorithms in both classification accuracy and clustering performance, while feature visualizations further confirm the interpretability of the selected features.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial Reasoning with Vision-Language Models in Ego-Centric Multi-View Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06266v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding 3D spatial relationships remains a major limitation of current Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Prior work has addressed this issue by creating spatial question-answering (QA) datasets based on single images or indoor videos. However, real-world embodied AI agents such as robots and self-driving cars typically rely on ego-centric, multi-view observations. To this end, we introduce Ego3D-Bench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate the spatial reasoning abilities of VLMs using ego-centric, multi-view outdoor data. Ego3D-Bench comprises over 8,600 QA pairs, created with significant involvement from human annotators to ensure quality and diversity. We benchmark 16 SOTA VLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini1.5-Pro, InternVL3, and Qwen2.5-VL. Our results reveal a notable performance gap between human level scores and VLM performance, highlighting that current VLMs still fall short of human level spatial understanding. To bridge this gap, we propose Ego3D-VLM, a post-training framework that enhances 3D spatial reasoning of VLMs. Ego3D-VLM generates cognitive map based on estimated global 3D coordinates, resulting in 12% average improvement on multi-choice QA and 56% average improvement on absolute distance estimation. Ego3D-VLM is modular and can be integrated with any existing VLM. Together, Ego3D-Bench and Ego3D-VLM offer valuable tools for advancing toward human level spatial understanding in real-world, multi-view environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[SAGE: Spatial-visual Adaptive Graph Exploration for Visual Place Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25723v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Place Recognition (VPR) requires robust retrieval of geotagged images despite large appearance, viewpoint, and environmental variation. Prior methods focus on descriptor fine-tuning or fixed sampling strategies yet neglect the dynamic interplay between spatial context and visual similarity during training. We present SAGE (Spatial-visual Adaptive Graph Exploration), a unified training pipeline that enhances granular spatial-visual discrimination by jointly improving local feature aggregation, organize samples during training, and hard sample mining. We introduce a lightweight Soft Probing module that learns residual weights from training data for patch descriptors before bilinear aggregation, boosting distinctive local cues. During training we reconstruct an online geo-visual graph that fuses geographic proximity and current visual similarity so that candidate neighborhoods reflect the evolving embedding landscape. To concentrate learning on the most informative place neighborhoods, we seed clusters from high-affinity anchors and iteratively expand them with a greedy weighted clique expansion sampler. Implemented with a frozen DINOv2 backbone and parameter-efficient fine-tuning, SAGE achieves SOTA across eight benchmarks. It attains 98.9%, 95.8%, 94.5%, and 96.0% Recall@1 on SPED, Pitts30k-test, MSLS-val, and Nordland, respectively.

| **[Modeling Spatial Heterogeneity in Exposure Buffers and Risk: A Hierarchical Bayesian Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25708v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Place-based epidemiology studies often rely on circular buffers to define "exposure" to spatially distributed risk factors, where the buffer radius represents a threshold beyond which exposure does not influence the outcome of interest. This approach is popular due to its simplicity and alignment with public health policies. However, buffer radii are often chosen relatively arbitrarily and assumed constant across the spatial domain. This may result in suboptimal statistical inference if these modeling choices are incorrect. To address this, we develop SVBR (Spatially-Varying Buffer Radii), a flexible hierarchical Bayesian spatial change points approach that treats buffer radii as unknown parameters and allows both radii and exposure effects to vary spatially. Through simulations, we find that SVBR improves estimation and inference for key model parameters compared to traditional methods. We also apply SVBR to study healthcare access in Madagascar, finding that proximity to healthcare facilities generally increases antenatal care usage, with clear spatial variation in this relationship. By relaxing rigid assumptions about buffer characteristics, our method offers a flexible, data-driven approach to accurately defining exposure and quantifying its impact. The newly developed methods are available in the R package EpiBuffer.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series C</p></details> |
| **[Neural Operator Feedback for a First-Order PIDE with Spatially-Varying State Delay](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08219v3)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A transport PDE with a spatial integral and recirculation with constant delay has been a benchmark for neural operator approximations of PDE backstepping controllers. Introducing a spatially-varying delay into the model gives rise to a gain operator defined through integral equations which the operator's input -- the varying delay function -- enters in previously unencountered manners, including in the limits of integration and as the inverse of the `delayED time' function. This, in turn, introduces novel mathematical challenges in estimating the operator's Lipschitz constant. The backstepping kernel function having two branches endows the feedback law with a two-branch structure, where only one of the two feedback branches depends on both of the kernel branches. For this rich feedback structure, we propose a neural operator approximation of such a two-branch feedback law and prove the approximator to be semiglobally practically stabilizing. With numerical results we illustrate the training of the neural operator and its stabilizing capability.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This 14 page paper contains 1 table and 9 figures</p></details> |
| **[Analysis of a Spatialized Brain-Body-Environment System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25640v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The brain-body-environment framework studies adaptive behavior through embodied and situated agents, emphasizing interactions between brains, biomechanics, and environmental dynamics. However, many models often treat the brain as a network of coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs), neglecting finer spatial properties which can not only increase model complexity but also constrain observable neural dynamics. To address this limitation, we propose a spatially extended approach using partial differential equations (PDEs) for both the brain and body. As a case study, we revisit a previously developed model of a child swinging, now incorporating spatial dynamics. By considering the spatio-temporal properties of the brain and body, we analyze how input location and propagation along a PDE influence behavior. This approach offers new insights into the role of spatial organization in adaptive behavior, bridging the gap between abstract neural models and the physical constraints of embodied systems. Our results highlight the importance of spatial dynamics in understanding brain-body-environment interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 7 figures, Artificial Life Conference 2025, selected for talk</p></details> |
| **[A General Theory of Emergent Linearity in Complex Dynamical Systems: The Role of Spatial Averaging and Vanishing Correlations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25589v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Various natural and engineered systems, from urban traffic flow to the human brain, have been described by large-scale networked dynamical systems. Despite their vast differences, these systems are often similar in being comprised of numerous microscopic subsystems with complex nonlinear dynamics and interactions that give rise to diverse emergent macroscopic behaviors. As such, a long-standing question across various fields has been to understand why and how various forms of macroscopic behavior emerge from underlying microscopic dynamics. Motivated by a growing body of empirical observations, in this work we focus on linearity as one of the most fundamental aspects of system dynamics, and develop a general theoretical framework for the interplay between spatial averaging, decaying microscopic correlations, and emergent macroscopic linearity. Using and extending the theory of mixing sequences, we show that in a broad class of autonomous nonlinear networked systems, the dynamics of the average of all subsystems' states becomes asymptotically linear as the number of subsystems grows to infinity, provided that (in addition to technical assumptions) pairwise correlations between subsystems decay to 0 as their pairwise distance grows to infinity. We prove this result when the latter distance is between subsystems' linear indices or spatial locations, and provide extensions to linear time-invariant (LTI) limit dynamics, finite-sample analysis of rates of convergence, and networks of spatially-embedded subsystems with random locations. To our knowledge, this work is the first rigorous analysis of macroscopic linearity in large-scale heterogeneous networked systems, and provides a solid foundation for further theoretical and empirical analyses in various domains of science and engineering.</p></details> |  |

SpinBench is designed around the core challenge of spatial reasoning: perspective taking, the ability to reason about how scenes and object relations change under viewpoint transformation. Since perspective taking requires multiple cognitive capabilities, such as recognizing objects across views, relative positions grounding, and mentally simulating transformations, SpinBench introduces a set of fine-grained diagnostic categories. Our categories target translation, rotation, object relative pose, and viewpoint change, and are progressively structured so that single-object simpler tasks scaffold toward the most demanding multi-object perspective-taking setting. We evaluate 37 state-of-the-art VLMs, both proprietary and open source. Results reveal systematic weaknesses: strong egocentric bias, poor rotational understanding, and inconsistencies under symmetrical and syntactic reformulations. Scaling analysis shows both smooth improvements and emergent capabilities. While human subjects achieve high accuracy (91.2\%), task difficulty as measured by human response time shows strong correlation with VLM accuracy, indicating that SpinBench captures spatial reasoning challenges shared across humans and VLMs. We believe SpinBench provides critical insights into spatial reasoning in VLMs and highlights key gaps in their ability to reason about physical space.

| **[Adapt or Regress: Rate-Memory-Compatible Spatially-Coupled Codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21112v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatially-coupled (SC) codes are a class of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes that have excellent performance thanks to the degrees of freedom they offer. An SC code is designed by partitioning a base matrix into components, the number of which implies the code memory, then coupling and lifting them. In the same system, various error-correction coding schemes are typically needed. For example, in wireless communication standards, several channel conditions and data rates should be supported. In storage and computing systems, stronger codes should be adopted as the device ages. Adaptive code design enables switching from one code to another when needed, ensuring reliability while reducing hardware cost. In this paper, we introduce a class of reconfigurable SC codes named rate-memory-compatible SC (RMC-SC) codes, which we design probabilistically. In particular, rate compatibility in RMC-SC codes is achieved via increasing the SC code memory, which also makes the codes memory-compatible and improves performance. We express the expected number of short cycles in the SC code protograph as a function of the fixed probability distribution characterizing the already-designed SC code as well as the unknown distribution characterizing the additional components. We use the gradient-descent algorithm to find a locally-optimal distribution, in terms of cycle count, for the new components. The method can be recursively used to design any number of SC codes needed, and we show how to extend it to other cases. Next, we perform the finite-length optimization using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MC$^2$) approach that we update to design the proposed RMC-SC codes. Experimental results demonstrate significant reductions in cycle counts and remarkable performance gains achieved by RMC-SC codes compared with a literature-based straightforward scheme.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages (double column), 4 figures, submitted to the IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)</p></details> |
| **[VideoAnchor: Reinforcing Subspace-Structured Visual Cues for Coherent Visual-Spatial Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25151v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive progress in vision-language alignment, yet they remain limited in visual-spatial reasoning. We first identify that this limitation arises from the attention mechanism: visual tokens are overshadowed by language tokens, preventing the model from consistently recognizing the same visual cues across frames. To address this challenge, we draw a novel connection between the self-expressiveness property in sparse subspace clustering and the attention mechanism in Transformers. Building on this insight, we propose VideoAnchor, a plug-and-play module that leverages subspace affinities to reinforce visual cues across frames without retraining, effectively anchoring attention to shared visual structures. Extensive experiments across benchmarks and backbone models show consistent performance gains -- $e.g.$, 3.2% and 4.6% improvements on VSI-Bench and Video-MME (spatial-related tasks) with InternVL2-8B and Qwen2.5VL-72B -- while qualitative analyses demonstrate more coherent subspace partitions and stronger visual grounding. Our codes will be made public available at https://github.com/feufhd/VideoAnchor.</p></details> | 16 pages, 6 figures |
| **[SSR-ZSON: Zero-Shot Object Navigation via Spatial-Semantic Relations within a Hierarchical Exploration Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24763v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-shot object navigation in unknown environments presents significant challenges, mainly due to two key limitations: insufficient semantic guidance leads to inefficient exploration, while limited spatial memory resulting from environmental structure causes entrapment in local regions. To address these issues, we propose SSR-ZSON, a spatial-semantic relative zero-shot object navigation method based on the TARE hierarchical exploration framework, integrating a viewpoint generation strategy balancing spatial coverage and semantic density with an LLM-based global guidance mechanism. The performance improvement of the proposed method is due to two key innovations. First, the viewpoint generation strategy prioritizes areas of high semantic density within traversable sub-regions to maximize spatial coverage and minimize invalid exploration. Second, coupled with an LLM-based global guidance mechanism, it assesses semantic associations to direct navigation toward high-value spaces, preventing local entrapment and ensuring efficient exploration. Deployed on hybrid Habitat-Gazebo simulations and physical platforms, SSR-ZSON achieves real-time operation and superior performance. On Matterport3D and Habitat-Matterport3D datasets, it improves the Success Rate(SR) by 18.5\% and 11.2\%, and the Success weighted by Path Length(SPL) by 0.181 and 0.140, respectively, over state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial-Functional awareness Transformer-based graph archetype contrastive learning for Decoding Visual Neural Representations from EEG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24761v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decoding visual neural representations from Electroencephalography (EEG) signals remains a formidable challenge due to their high-dimensional, noisy, and non-Euclidean nature. In this work, we propose a Spatial-Functional Awareness Transformer-based Graph Archetype Contrastive Learning (SFTG) framework to enhance EEG-based visual decoding. Specifically, we introduce the EEG Graph Transformer (EGT), a novel graph-based neural architecture that simultaneously encodes spatial brain connectivity and temporal neural dynamics. To mitigate high intra-subject variability, we propose Graph Archetype Contrastive Learning (GAC), which learns subject-specific EEG graph archetypes to improve feature consistency and class separability. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive subject-dependent and subject-independent evaluations on the Things-EEG dataset, demonstrating that our approach significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art EEG decoding methods.The results underscore the transformative potential of integrating graph-based learning with contrastive objectives to enhance EEG-based brain decoding, paving the way for more generalizable and robust neural representations.</p></details> |  |
| **[InSpire: Vision-Language-Action Models with Intrinsic Spatial Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13888v3)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to map language instruction and visual observations to raw low-level actions, Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) hold great promise for achieving general-purpose robotic systems. Despite their advancements, existing VLAs tend to spuriously correlate task-irrelevant visual features with actions, limiting their generalization capacity beyond the training data. To tackle this challenge, we propose Intrinsic Spatial Reasoning (InSpire), a simple yet effective approach that mitigates the adverse effects of spurious correlations by boosting the spatial reasoning ability of VLAs. Specifically, InSpire redirects the VLA's attention to task-relevant factors by prepending the question "In which direction is the [object] relative to the robot?" to the language instruction and aligning the answer "right/left/up/down/front/back/grasped" and predicted actions with ground-truth. Notably, InSpire can be used as a plugin to enhance existing autoregressive VLAs, requiring no extra training data or interaction with other large models. Extensive experimental results in both simulation and real-world environments demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of our approach.</p></details> |  |

While prior efforts often rely on explicit 3D inputs or specialized model architectures, we ask: can LMMs reason about 3D space using only structured 2D representations derived from perception? We introduce Struct2D, a perception-guided prompting framework that combines bird's-eye-view (BEV) images with object marks and object-centric metadata, optionally incorporating egocentric keyframes when needed. Using Struct2D, we conduct an in-depth zero-shot analysis of closed-source LMMs (e.g., GPT-o3) and find that they exhibit surprisingly strong spatial reasoning abilities when provided with structured 2D inputs, effectively handling tasks such as relative direction estimation and route planning. Building on these insights, we construct Struct2D-Set, a large-scale instruction tuning dataset with 200K fine-grained QA pairs across eight spatial reasoning categories, generated automatically from 3D indoor scenes. We fine-tune an open-source LMM (Qwen2.5VL) on Struct2D-Set, achieving competitive performance on multiple benchmarks, including 3D question answering, dense captioning, and object grounding. Our approach demonstrates that structured 2D inputs can effectively bridge perception and language reasoning in LMMs-without requiring explicit 3D representations as input. We will release both our code and dataset to support future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025, code link: https://github.com/neu-vi/struct2d</p></details> |
| **[Impact of spatial coarsening on Parareal convergence for the linear advection equation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.10228v3)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Parareal parallel-in-time integration method often performs poorly when applied to hyperbolic partial differential equations. This effect is even more pronounced when the coarse propagator uses a reduced spatial resolution. However, some combinations of spatial discretization and numerical time stepping nevertheless allow for Parareal to converge with monotonically decreasing errors. This raises the question how these configurations can be distinguished theoretically from those where the error initially increases, sometimes over many orders of magnitude. For linear problems, we prove a theorem that implies that the 2-norm of the Parareal iteration matrix is not a suitable tool to predict convergence for hyperbolic problems when spatial coarsening is used. We then show numerical results that suggest that the pseudo-spectral radius can reliably indicate if a given configuration of Parareal will show transient growth or monotonic convergence. For the studied examples, it also provides a good quantitative estimate of the convergence rate in the first few Parareal iterations.</p></details> |  |
| **[FSDENet: A Frequency and Spatial Domains based Detail Enhancement Network for Remote Sensing Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00059v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To fully leverage spatial information for remote sensing image segmentation and address semantic edge ambiguities caused by grayscale variations (e.g., shadows and low-contrast regions), we propose the Frequency and Spatial Domains based Detail Enhancement Network (FSDENet). Our framework employs spatial processing methods to extract rich multi-scale spatial features and fine-grained semantic details. By effectively integrating global and frequency-domain information through the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) in global mappings, the model's capability to discern global representations under grayscale variations is significantly strengthened. Additionally, we utilize Haar wavelet transform to decompose features into high- and low-frequency components, leveraging their distinct sensitivity to edge information to refine boundary segmentation. The model achieves dual-domain synergy by integrating spatial granularity with frequency-domain edge sensitivity, substantially improving segmentation accuracy in boundary regions and grayscale transition zones. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that FSDENet achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on four widely adopted datasets: LoveDA, Vaihingen, Potsdam, and iSAID.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication by IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing</p></details> |

Learning to Manipulate Object States via Visual Spatial Progress](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24129v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most robot manipulation focuses on changing the kinematic state of objects: picking, placing, opening, or rotating them. However, a wide range of real-world manipulation tasks involve a different class of object state change--such as mashing, spreading, or slicing--where the object's physical and visual state evolve progressively without necessarily changing its position. We present SPARTA, the first unified framework for the family of object state change manipulation tasks. Our key insight is that these tasks share a common structural pattern: they involve spatially-progressing, object-centric changes that can be represented as regions transitioning from an actionable to a transformed state. Building on this insight, SPARTA integrates spatially progressing object change segmentation maps, a visual skill to perceive actionable vs. transformed regions for specific object state change tasks, to generate a) structured policy observations that strip away appearance variability, and b) dense rewards that capture incremental progress over time. These are leveraged in two SPARTA policy variants: reinforcement learning for fine-grained control without demonstrations or simulation; and greedy control for fast, lightweight deployment. We validate SPARTA on a real robot for three challenging tasks across 10 diverse real-world objects, achieving significant improvements in training time and accuracy over sparse rewards and visual goal-conditioned baselines. Our results highlight progress-aware visual representations as a versatile foundation for the broader family of object state manipulation tasks.

In a large-scale evaluation of SceneDiffuser++, a state-of-the-art traffic simulator, we find that 50% of generated trajectories violate basic physical laws - vehicles collide, drive off roads, and spawn inside buildings. This reveals a fundamental limitation: current models treat physical validity as an emergent property rather than an architectural requirement. We propose Validity-First Spatial Intelligence (VFSI), which enforces constraints through energy-based guidance during diffusion sampling, without model retraining. By incorporating collision avoidance and kinematic constraints as energy functions, we guide the denoising process toward physically valid trajectories. Across 200 urban scenarios from the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, VFSI reduces collision rates by 67% (24.6% to 8.1%) and improves overall validity by 87% (50.3% to 94.2%), while simultaneously improving realism metrics (ADE: 1.34m to 1.21m). Our model-agnostic approach demonstrates that explicit constraint enforcement during inference is both necessary and sufficient for physically valid traffic simulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[ColLab: A Collaborative Spatial Progressive Data Engine for Referring Expression Comprehension and Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23955v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) and Referring Expression Generation (REG) are fundamental tasks in multimodal understanding, supporting precise object localization through natural language. However, existing REC and REG datasets rely heavily on manual annotation, which is labor-intensive and difficult to scale. In this paper, we propose ColLab, a collaborative spatial progressive data engine that enables fully automated REC and REG data generation without human supervision. Specifically, our method introduces a Collaborative Multimodal Model Interaction (CMMI) strategy, which leverages the semantic understanding of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and large language models (LLMs) to generate descriptions. Furthermore, we design a module termed Spatial Progressive Augmentation (SPA) to enhance spatial expressiveness among duplicate instances. Experiments demonstrate that ColLab significantly accelerates the annotation process of REC and REG while improving the quality and discriminability of the generated expressions. In addition to the core methodological contribution, our framework was partially adopted in the data generation pipeline of the ICCV 2025 MARS2 Challenge on Multimodal Reasoning, enriching the dataset with diverse and challenging samples that better reflect real-world reasoning demands.</p></details> |  |

Speech and semantics guide the production of gestures by determining their timing (WHEN) and style (HOW), while the spatial locations of interactive objects dictate their directional execution (WHERE). Existing approaches either rely solely on descriptive language to generate motions or utilize audio to produce non-interactive gestures, thereby lacking the characterization of interactive timing and spatial intent. This significantly limits the applicability of conversational gesture generation, whether in robotics or in the fields of game and animation production. To address this gap, we present a full-stack solution. We first established a unique data collection method to simultaneously capture high-precision human motion and spatial intent. We then developed a generation model driven by audio, language, and spatial data, alongside dedicated metrics for evaluating interaction timing and spatial accuracy. Finally, we deployed the solution on a humanoid robot, enabling rich, context-aware physical interactions.</p></details> |  |

AI agents with the spatial planning ability can better adapt to various real-world applications, including robotic manipulation, automatic assembly, urban planning etc. Recent works have attempted to construct benchmarks for evaluating the spatial intelligence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Nevertheless, these benchmarks primarily focus on spatial reasoning based on typical Visual Question-Answering (VQA) forms, which suffers from the gap between abstract spatial understanding and concrete task execution. In this work, we take a step further to build a comprehensive benchmark called MineAnyBuild, aiming to evaluate the spatial planning ability of open-world AI agents in the Minecraft game. Specifically, MineAnyBuild requires an agent to generate executable architecture building plans based on the given multi-modal human instructions. It involves 4,000 curated spatial planning tasks and also provides a paradigm for infinitely expandable data collection by utilizing rich player-generated content. MineAnyBuild evaluates spatial planning through four core supporting dimensions: spatial understanding, spatial reasoning, creativity, and spatial commonsense. Based on MineAnyBuild, we perform a comprehensive evaluation for existing MLLM-based agents, revealing the severe limitations but enormous potential in their spatial planning abilities. We believe our MineAnyBuild will open new avenues for the evaluation of spatial intelligence and help promote further development for open-world AI agents capable of spatial planning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025 Datasets and Benchmarks Track</p></details> |

Although knowledge distillation and sparse attention mechanisms can improve efficiency, they often fall short of delivering the high segmentation accuracy necessary for complex tasks. Balancing model performance with computational efficiency remains a critical challenge. In this work, we propose a novel 3D multi-modal image segmentation framework, termed MSD-KMamba, which integrates bidirectional spatial perception with multi-scale self-distillation. The bidirectional spatial aware branch effectively captures long-range spatial context dependencies across brain regions, while also incorporating a powerful nonlinear feature extraction mechanism that further enhances the model's ability to learn complex and heterogeneous patterns. In addition, the proposed multi-scale self-distilled fusion strategy strengthens hierarchical feature representations and improves the transfer of semantic information at different resolution levels. By jointly leveraging the bidirectional spatial perception branch and the multi-scale self-distilled fusion strategy, our framework effectively mitigates the bottleneck of quadratic computational complexity in volumetric segmentation, while simultaneously addressing the limitation of insufficient global perception. Extensive experiments on multiple standard benchmark datasets demonstrate that MSD-KMamba consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in segmentation accuracy, robustness, and generalization, while maintaining high computational efficiency and favorable scalability. The source code of MSD-KMamba is publicly available at https://github.com/daimao-zhang/MSD-KMamba.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatially Parallel All-optical Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23611v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>All-optical neural networks (AONNs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for ultrafast and energy-efficient computation. These networks typically consist of multiple serially connected layers between input and output layers--a configuration we term spatially series AONNs, with deep neural networks (DNNs) being the most prominent examples. However, such series architectures suffer from progressive signal degradation during information propagation and critically require additional nonlinearity designs to model complex relationships effectively. Here we propose a spatially parallel architecture for all-optical neural networks (SP-AONNs). Unlike series architecture that sequentially processes information through consecutively connected optical layers, SP-AONNs divide the input signal into identical copies fed simultaneously into separate optical layers. Through coherent interference between these parallel linear sub-networks, SP-AONNs inherently enable nonlinear computation without relying on active nonlinear components or iterative updates. We implemented a modular 4F optical system for SP-AONNs and evaluated its performance across multiple image classification benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that increasing the number of parallel sub-networks consistently enhances accuracy, improves noise robustness, and expands model expressivity. Our findings highlight spatial parallelism as a practical and scalable strategy for advancing the capabilities of optical neural computing.</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures |

The dataset includes a variety of tasks, ranging from filling in masked regions within partial structures to predicting complete material distributions. Solving these tasks requires understanding the flow of forces and the required material distribution under given constraints, without access to simulation tools or explicit physical models, challenging models to reason about structural stability and spatial organization. Our dataset targets the evaluation of spatial and physical reasoning abilities in 2D settings, offering a complementary perspective to traditional language and logic benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Furthermore, fVDB can process datasets with much larger footprint and spatial resolution than prior works, while providing a competitive memory footprint on small inputs. To achieve this combination of versatility and performance, fVDB relies on a single novel VDB index grid acceleration structure paired with several key innovations including GPU accelerated sparse grid construction, convolution using tensorcores, fast ray tracing kernels using a Hierarchical Digital Differential Analyzer algorithm (HDDA), and jagged tensors. Our framework is fully integrated with PyTorch enabling interoperability with existing pipelines, and we demonstrate its effectiveness on a number of representative tasks such as large-scale point-cloud segmentation, high resolution 3D generative modeling, unbounded scale Neural Radiance Fields, and large-scale point cloud reconstruction.</p></details> |  |

With the rapid progress in Multimodal Language models, the moment has come to integrate this long-overlooked dimension into these models. In particular, in text-to-image (T2I) generation, even state-of-the-art models exhibit a significant performance gap when spatial descriptions are provided from perspectives other than the camera. To address this limitation, we propose Frame of Reference-guided Spatial Adjustment in LLM-based Diffusion Editing (FoR-SALE), an extension of the Self-correcting LLM-controlled Diffusion (SLD) framework for T2I. For-Sale evaluates the alignment between a given text and an initially generated image, and refines the image based on the Frame of Reference specified in the spatial expressions. It employs vision modules to extract the spatial configuration of the image, while simultaneously mapping the spatial expression to a corresponding camera perspective. This unified perspective enables direct evaluation of alignment between language and vision. When misalignment is detected, the required editing operations are generated and applied. FoR-SALE applies novel latent-space operations to adjust the facing direction and depth of the generated images. We evaluate FoR-SALE on two benchmarks specifically designed to assess spatial understanding with FoR. Our framework improves the performance of state-of-the-art T2I models by up to 5.3% using only a single round of correction.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 3 Tables, 4 Figures, Under Reviewed</p></details> |

To address these challenges, we propose the Spatial-Spectral Summarizer Fusion Network (S$^3$F-Net), a dual-branch framework that learns from both spatial and spectral representations simultaneously. The S$^3$F-Net performs a fusion of a deep spatial CNN with our proposed shallow spectral encoder, SpectraNet. SpectraNet features the proposed SpectralFilter layer, which leverages the Convolution Theorem by applying a bank of learnable filters directly to an image's full Fourier spectrum via a computation-efficient element-wise multiplication. This allows the SpectralFilter layer to attain a global receptive field instantaneously, with its output being distilled by a lightweight summarizer network. We evaluate S$^3$F-Net across four medical imaging datasets spanning different modalities to validate its efficacy and generalizability. Our framework consistently and significantly outperforms its strong spatial-only baseline in all cases, with accuracy improvements of up to 5.13%. With a powerful Bilinear Fusion, S$^3$F-Net achieves a SOTA competitive accuracy of 98.76% on the BRISC2025 dataset. Concatenation Fusion performs better on the texture-dominant Chest X-Ray Pneumonia dataset, achieving 93.11% accuracy, surpassing many top-performing, much deeper models. Our explainability analysis also reveals that the S$^3$F-Net learns to dynamically adjust its reliance on each branch based on the input pathology. These results verify that our dual-domain approach is a powerful and generalizable paradigm for medical image analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics (JBHI).

Moreover, as audio foundation models are typically trained on dry, single-channel audio clips, the inherent spatial nature of real-world sound scenes is overlooked and tasks involving sound localization ruled out. To address these limitations, we propose GRAM: a General-purpose Real-world Audio Model utilizing a multi-channel masked auto-encoder approach to efficiently learn spatial audio representations from high-quality simulated real-world scenes. To evaluate the performance of GRAM and other audio foundation models in real-world sound scenes, we release Nat-HEAR: A naturalistic version of the HEAR benchmark suite comprising a simulated real-world version, as well as two new sound localization tasks. We show that the performance of GRAM surpasses all state-of-the-art self-supervised audio foundation models and speech models on both HEAR and Nat-HEAR, while using only a fraction of the training data. GRAM also showcases state-of-the-art localization performance, surpassing even supervised sound localization approaches, and can be flexibly applied either to a two-channel, binaural sound format or a four-channel, Ambisonics format. Validating GRAM's performance on real-world sound recordings demonstrates robust transfer to real-world scenes. Taken together, GRAM presents a significant advancement towards robust, spatial audio foundation models for real-world applications.</p></details> | Still under review |
| **[CoPatch: Zero-Shot Referring Image Segmentation by Leveraging Untapped Spatial Knowledge in CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23098v1)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial grounding is crucial for referring image segmentation (RIS), where the goal of the task is to localize an object described by language. Current foundational vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, excel at aligning images and text but struggle with understanding spatial relationships. Within the language stream, most existing methods often focus on the primary noun phrase when extracting local text features, undermining contextual tokens. Within the vision stream, CLIP generates similar features for images with different spatial layouts, resulting in limited sensitivity to spatial structure. To address these limitations, we propose \textsc{CoPatch}, a zero-shot RIS framework that leverages internal model components to enhance spatial representations in both text and image modalities. For language, \textsc{CoPatch} constructs hybrid text features by incorporating context tokens carrying spatial cues. For vision, it extracts patch-level image features using our novel path discovered from intermediate layers, where spatial structure is better preserved. These enhanced features are fused into a clustered image-text similarity map, \texttt{CoMap}, enabling precise mask selection. As a result, \textsc{CoPatch} significantly improves spatial grounding in zero-shot RIS across RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg, and PhraseCut (+ 2--7 mIoU) without requiring any additional training. Our findings underscore the importance of recovering and leveraging the untapped spatial knowledge inherently embedded in VLMs, thereby paving the way for opportunities in zero-shot RIS.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 22 Figures, 11 Tables</p></details> |
| **[JanusVLN: Decoupling Semantics and Spatiality with Dual Implicit Memory for Vision-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22548v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-Language Navigation requires an embodied agent to navigate through unseen environments, guided by natural language instructions and a continuous video stream. Recent advances in VLN have been driven by the powerful semantic understanding of Multimodal Large Language Models. However, these methods typically rely on explicit semantic memory, such as building textual cognitive maps or storing historical visual frames. This type of method suffers from spatial information loss, computational redundancy, and memory bloat, which impede efficient navigation. Inspired by the implicit scene representation in human navigation, analogous to the left brain's semantic understanding and the right brain's spatial cognition, we propose JanusVLN, a novel VLN framework featuring a dual implicit neural memory that models spatial-geometric and visual-semantic memory as separate, compact, and fixed-size neural representations. This framework first extends the MLLM to incorporate 3D prior knowledge from the spatial-geometric encoder, thereby enhancing the spatial reasoning capabilities of models based solely on RGB input. Then, the historical key-value caches from the spatial-geometric and visual-semantic encoders are constructed into a dual implicit memory. By retaining only the KVs of tokens in the initial and sliding window, redundant computation is avoided, enabling efficient incremental updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that JanusVLN outperforms over 20 recent methods to achieve SOTA performance. For example, the success rate improves by 10.5-35.5 compared to methods using multiple data types as input and by 3.6-10.8 compared to methods using more RGB training data. This indicates that the proposed dual implicit neural memory, as a novel paradigm, explores promising new directions for future VLN research.

Statistical surrogates or emulators can predict high-fidelity fields from cheap low-fidelity output. We propose a highly scalable Bayesian approach that can learn the joint non-Gaussian distribution and nonlinear dependence structure of nonstationary spatial fields at multiple fidelities from a small number of training samples. Our method is based on fidelity-aware autoregressive GPs with suitably chosen regularization-inducing priors. Exploiting conjugacy, the integrated likelihood is available in closed form, enabling efficient hyperparameter optimization via stochastic gradient descent. After training, the method also characterizes in closed form the distribution of higher-fidelity fields given lower-fidelity data. In our numerical comparisons, we show that our approach substantially outperforms existing methods and that it can be used to characterize and simulate high-fidelity fine-scale climate behavior based on output from coarse (low-fidelity) global circulation models.</p></details> | 30 pages, 8 figures |

However, traditional methods for creating these scenes rely on time-consuming manual layout design or purely randomized layouts, which are limited in terms of plausibility or alignment with the tasks. In this paper, we formulate a novel task, namely task-oriented tabletop scene generation, which poses significant challenges due to the substantial gap between high-level task instructions and the tabletop scenes. To support research on such a challenging task, we introduce MesaTask-10K, a large-scale dataset comprising approximately 10,700 synthetic tabletop scenes with manually crafted layouts that ensure realistic layouts and intricate inter-object relations. To bridge the gap between tasks and scenes, we propose a Spatial Reasoning Chain that decomposes the generation process into object inference, spatial interrelation reasoning, and scene graph construction for the final 3D layout. We present MesaTask, an LLM-based framework that utilizes this reasoning chain and is further enhanced with DPO algorithms to generate physically plausible tabletop scenes that align well with given task descriptions. Exhaustive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of MesaTask compared to baselines in generating task-conforming tabletop scenes with realistic layouts.

| **[Boosting LLM Serving through Spatial-Temporal GPU Resource Sharing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19516v4)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern LLM serving systems confront inefficient GPU utilization due to the fundamental mismatch between compute-intensive prefill and memory-bound decode phases. While current practices attempt to address this by organizing these phases into hybrid batches, such solutions create an inefficient tradeoff that sacrifices either throughput or latency, leaving substantial GPU resources underutilized. We identify two key root causes: 1) the prefill phase suffers from suboptimal compute utilization due to wave quantization and attention bottlenecks. 2) hybrid batches disproportionately prioritize latency over throughput, resulting in wasted compute and memory bandwidth. To mitigate the issues, we present Bullet, a novel spatial-temporal orchestration system that eliminates these inefficiencies through precise phase coordination. Bullet enables concurrent execution of prefill and decode phases, while dynamically provisioning GPU resources using real-time performance modeling. By integrating SLO-aware scheduling and adaptive resource allocation, Bullet maximizes utilization without compromising latency targets. Experimental evaluations on real-world workloads demonstrate that Bullet delivers 1.26x average throughput gains (up to 1.55x) over state-of-the-arts, while consistently meeting latency constraints.</p></details> |  |

To complete many common tasks, relevant objects are required to pass in and out of a robot's field of view. In these settings, spatial memory - the ability to remember the spatial composition of the scene - is an important competency. However, building such mechanisms into robot learning systems remains an open research problem. We introduce mindmap (Spatial Memory in Deep Feature Maps for 3D Action Policies), a 3D diffusion policy that generates robot trajectories based on a semantic 3D reconstruction of the environment. We show in simulation experiments that our approach is effective at solving tasks where state-of-the-art approaches without memory mechanisms struggle. We release our reconstruction system, training code, and evaluation tasks to spur research in this direction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CoRL 2025 Workshop RemembeRL</p></details> |

TAPTRv2 is a simple yet effective DETR-like point tracking framework that works fine in regular videos but tends to fail in long videos. TAPTRv3 improves TAPTRv2 by addressing its shortcomings in querying high-quality features from long videos, where the target tracking points normally undergo increasing variation over time. In TAPTRv3, we propose to utilize both spatial and temporal context to bring better feature querying along the spatial and temporal dimensions for more robust tracking in long videos. For better spatial feature querying, we identify that off-the-shelf attention mechanisms struggle with point-level tasks and present Context-aware Cross-Attention (CCA). CCA introduces spatial context into the attention mechanism to enhance the quality of attention scores when querying image features. For better temporal feature querying, we introduce Visibility-aware Long-Temporal Attention (VLTA), which conducts temporal attention over past frames while considering their corresponding visibilities. This effectively addresses the feature drifting problem in TAPTRv2 caused by its RNN-like long-term modeling. TAPTRv3 surpasses TAPTRv2 by a large margin on most of the challenging datasets and obtains state-of-the-art performance. Even when compared with methods trained on large-scale extra internal data, TAPTRv3 still demonstrates superiority.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Bias to Balance: Exploring and Mitigating Spatial Bias in LVLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21984v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable success across a wide range of multimodal tasks, yet their robustness to spatial variations remains insufficiently understood. In this work, we present a systematic study of the spatial bias of LVLMs, focusing on how models respond when identical key visual information is placed at different locations within an image. Through a carefully designed probing dataset, we demonstrate that current LVLMs often produce inconsistent outputs under such spatial shifts, revealing a fundamental limitation in their spatial-semantic understanding. Further analysis shows that this phenomenon originates not from the vision encoder, which reliably perceives and interprets visual content across positions, but from the unbalanced design of position embeddings in the language model component. In particular, the widely adopted position embedding strategies, such as RoPE, introduce imbalance during cross-modal interaction, leading image tokens at different positions to exert unequal influence on semantic understanding. To mitigate this issue, we introduce Balanced Position Assignment (BaPA), a simple yet effective mechanism that assigns identical position embeddings to all image tokens, promoting a more balanced integration of visual information. Extensive experiments show that BaPA enhances the spatial robustness of LVLMs without retraining and further boosts their performance across diverse multimodal benchmarks when combined with lightweight fine-tuning. Further analysis of information flow reveals that BaPA yields balanced attention, enabling more holistic visual understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial Reasoning in Foundation Models: Benchmarking Object-Centric Spatial Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21922v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial understanding is a critical capability for vision foundation models. While recent advances in large vision models or vision-language models (VLMs) have expanded recognition capabilities, most benchmarks emphasize localization accuracy rather than whether models capture how objects are arranged and related within a scene. This gap is consequential; effective scene understanding requires not only identifying objects, but reasoning about their relative positions, groupings, and depth. In this paper, we present a systematic benchmark for object-centric spatial reasoning in foundation models. Using a controlled synthetic dataset, we evaluate state-of-the-art vision models (e.g., GroundingDINO, Florence-2, OWLv2) and large VLMs (e.g., InternVL, LLaVA, GPT-4o) across three tasks: spatial localization, spatial reasoning, and downstream retrieval tasks. We find a stable trade-off: detectors such as GroundingDINO and OWLv2 deliver precise boxes with limited relational reasoning, while VLMs like SmolVLM and GPT-4o provide coarse layout cues and fluent captions but struggle with fine-grained spatial context. Our study highlights the gap between localization and true spatial understanding, and pointing toward the need for spatially-aware foundation models in the community.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, NeurIPS Workshop SpaVLE</p></details> |

In particular, the effective exploitation of spatial-temporal correlations between point cloud frames remains largely unexplored. Addressing this gap, we propose a spatial-temporal attribute quality enhancement (STQE) network that exploits both spatial and temporal correlations to improve the visual quality of G-PCC compressed dynamic point clouds. Our contributions include a recoloring-based motion compensation module that remaps reference attribute information to the current frame geometry to achieve precise inter-frame geometric alignment, a channel-aware temporal attention module that dynamically highlights relevant regions across bidirectional reference frames, a Gaussian-guided neighborhood feature aggregation module that efficiently captures spatial dependencies between geometry and color attributes, and a joint loss function based on the Pearson correlation coefficient, designed to alleviate over-smoothing effects typical of point-wise mean squared error optimization. When applied to the latest G-PCC test model, STQE achieved improvements of 0.855 dB, 0.682 dB, and 0.828 dB in delta PSNR, with Bj{\o}ntegaard Delta rate (BD-rate) reductions of -25.2%, -31.6%, and -32.5% for the Luma, Cb, and Cr components, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[CubistMerge: Spatial-Preserving Token Merging For Diverse ViT Backbones](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21764v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many modern ViT backbones adopt spatial architectural designs, such as window attention, decomposed relative positional embeddings in SAM, and RoPE in DINOv3. Such architectures impose new challenges on token reduction, as the vast majority of existing methods fail to preserve the spatial structure these architectures depend on. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective token merging method that maintains spatial integrity, enabling seamless compatibility with spatial architectures. We reconcile two seemingly conflicting requirements: (i)exploiting the uneven information distribution across the spatial layout while (ii)preserving the spatial structure post-merging. Our approach employs (i)a 2D reduction strategy to enforce structured token layouts, (ii)a spatial-aware merging algorithm that maintains relative token positions, and (iii)a novel max-magnitude-per-dimension token representation that preserves salient features. Our method demonstrates strong performance both off-the-shelf and with fine-tuning, achieving state-of-the-art results on spatial and non-spatial architectures across various vision tasks. Specifically, we achieve 1.25x speedup on SAM-H with only 0.7% mIOU drop evaluated on COCO off-the-shelf, and 1.15x speedup on DeiT-B with no top-1 accuracy drop on ImageNet within just one epoch of fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |

While Transformer-based methods have become prevalent in online HD map construction, most existing approaches overlook the inherent spatial dependencies and semantic relationships among map elements, which constrains their accuracy and generalization capabilities. To address this, we propose RelMap, an end-to-end framework that explicitly models both spatial relations and semantic priors to enhance online HD map construction. Specifically, we introduce a Class-aware Spatial Relation Prior, which explicitly encodes relative positional dependencies between map elements using a learnable class-aware relation encoder. Additionally, we design a Mixture-of-Experts-based Semantic Prior, which routes features to class-specific experts based on predicted class probabilities, refining instance feature decoding. RelMap is compatible with both single-frame and temporal perception backbones, achieving state-of-the-art performance on both the nuScenes and Argoverse 2 datasets.</p></details> |  |

We evaluate both approaches on the UCF Sports dataset, examining feature quality through multiple dimensions including classification accuracy, clustering performance, intra-class consistency, and inter-class discrimination. Our analysis reveals fundamental architectural trade-offs: DINOv3 achieves superior clustering performance (Silhouette score: 0.31 vs 0.21) and demonstrates exceptional discrimination capability (6.16x separation ratio) particularly for pose-identifiable actions, while V-JEPA2 exhibits consistent reliability across all action types with significantly lower performance variance (0.094 vs 0.288). Through action-specific evaluation, we identify that DINOv3's spatial processing architecture excels at static pose recognition but shows degraded performance on motion-dependent actions, whereas V-JEPA2's temporal modeling provides balanced representation quality across diverse action categories. These findings contribute to the understanding of architectural design choices in video analysis systems and provide empirical guidance for selecting appropriate feature extraction methods based on task requirements and reliability constraints.</p></details> |  |

However, recent Vision Language Models (VLMs) often fail to predict accurate numeric coordinates when processing high-resolution GUI images with complex layouts. To address this issue, we reframe GUI grounding as an \emph{interactive search task}, where the VLM generates actions to move a cursor in the GUI to locate UI elements. At each step, the model determines the target object, evaluates the spatial relations between the cursor and the target, and moves the cursor closer to the target conditioned on the movement history. In this interactive process, the rendered cursor provides visual feedback to help the model align its predictions with the corresponding on-screen locations. We train our GUI grounding model, GUI-Cursor, using multi-step online reinforcement learning with a dense trajectory-based reward function. Our experimental results show that GUI-Cursor, based on Qwen2.5-VL-7B, improves the GUI grounding accuracy and achieves state-of-the-art results on ScreenSpot-v2 ($88.8\% \rightarrow 93.9\%$) and ScreenSpot-Pro ($26.8\% \rightarrow 56.5\%$). Moreover, we observe that GUI-Cursor learns to solve the problem within two steps for 95\% of instances and can adaptively conduct more steps on more difficult examples.</p></details> |  |

With the advent of spatial-omics data, we have the promise of characterizing cells within their tissue context as it provides both spatial coordinates and intra-cellular transcriptional or protein counts. Proteomics offers a complementary view by directly measuring proteins, which are the primary effectors of cellular function and key therapeutic targets. However, existing models either ignore the spatial information or the complex genetic and proteomic programs within cells. Thus they cannot infer how cell internal regulation adapts to microenvironmental cues. Furthermore, these models often utilize fixed gene vocabularies, hindering their generalizability unseen genes. In this paper, we introduce HEIST, a hierarchical graph transformer foundation model for spatial transcriptomics and proteomics. HEIST models tissues as hierarchical graphs. The higher level graph is a spatial cell graph, and each cell in turn, is represented by its lower level gene co-expression network graph. HEIST achieves this by performing both intra-level and cross-level message passing to utilize the hierarchy in its embeddings and can thus generalize to novel datatypes including spatial proteomics without retraining. HEIST is pretrained on 22.3M cells from 124 tissues across 15 organs using spatially-aware contrastive and masked autoencoding objectives. Unsupervised analysis of HEIST embeddings reveals spatially informed subpopulations missed by prior models. Downstream evaluations demonstrate generalizability to proteomics data and state-of-the-art performance in clinical outcome prediction, cell type annotation, and gene imputation across multiple technologies.</p></details> |  |

Existing benchmarks, however, probe only single-image relations and thus fail to assess the multi-image spatial reasoning that real-world deployments demand. We introduce MMSI-Bench, a VQA benchmark dedicated to multi-image spatial intelligence. Six 3D-vision researchers spent more than 300 hours meticulously crafting 1,000 challenging, unambiguous multiple-choice questions from over 120,000 images, each paired with carefully designed distractors and a step-by-step reasoning process. We conduct extensive experiments and thoroughly evaluate 34 open-source and proprietary MLLMs, observing a wide gap: the strongest open-source model attains roughly 30% accuracy and OpenAI's o3 reasoning model reaches 40%, while humans score 97%. These results underscore the challenging nature of MMSI-Bench and the substantial headroom for future research. Leveraging the annotated reasoning processes, we also provide an automated error analysis pipeline that diagnoses four dominant failure modes, including (1) grounding errors, (2) overlap-matching and scene-reconstruction errors, (3) situation-transformation reasoning errors, and (4) spatial-logic errors, offering valuable insights for advancing multi-image spatial intelligence.

However, conventional lightweighting methods often sacrifice critical capabilities, particularly spatial reasoning. This creates a trade-off between efficiency and performance. To address this challenge, our work reuses Register Tokens, which were introduced for artifact removal in Vision Transformers but subsequently discarded. We suppose that these tokens contain essential spatial information and propose RetoVLA, a novel architecture that reuses them directly by injecting them into the Action Expert. RetoVLA maintains a lightweight structure while leveraging this repurposed spatial context to enhance reasoning. We demonstrate RetoVLA's effectiveness through a series of comprehensive experiments. On our custom-built 7-DOF robot arm, the model achieves a 17.1%p absolute improvement in success rates for complex manipulation tasks. Our results confirm that reusing Register Tokens directly enhances spatial reasoning, demonstrating that what was previously discarded as an artifact is in fact a valuable, unexplored resource for robotic intelligence.

Despite recent progress by large language models (LLMs) across various domains, these models often fail to extend their knowledge to novel compositional scenarios, revealing notable limitations in systematic generalization. There has been an ongoing debate about whether neural networks possess the capacity for systematic generalization, with recent studies suggesting that meta-learning approaches designed for compositionality can significantly enhance this ability. However, these insights have largely been confined to linguistic problems, leaving their applicability to other tasks an open question. In this study, we extend meta-learning for compositionality to the domain of abstract spatial reasoning. To this end, we introduce $\textit{Compositional-ARC}-$a dataset designed to evaluate the capacity of models to systematically generalize from known geometric transformations (e.g., translation, rotation) of abstract two-dimensional objects to novel combinations of these transformations (e.g., translation+rotation). Our results show that a small transformer-based encoder-decoder model, trained via meta-learning for compositionality, can systematically generalize to previously unseen transformation compositions. Notably, despite having only 5.7M parameters, this model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs$-$including o3-mini, GPT-4o, and Gemini 2.0 Flash, which fail to exhibit similar systematic behavior$-$and performs on par with the winning model of the ARC prize 2024, an 8B-parameter LLM trained via test-time training. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of meta-learning in promoting systematicity beyond linguistic tasks, suggesting a promising direction toward more robust and generalizable models.</p></details> | 29 pages, 14 figures |

Specifically, in terms of spatial decomposition, we decouple videos into three key components: the foreground subject, the background, and the motion flow. Building upon this decomposed formulation, we further introduce a dual-to-single-stream DiT-based architecture for supporting fine-grained control over different components in the videos. We also introduce a self-supervised pretraining strategy based on random masking to enhance the decomposed representation learning from large-scale unlabeled video data. Inspired by the Chain-of-Thought reasoning paradigm, we further revisit the denoising diffusion process and propose a Chain-of-Prompt (CoP) mechanism to achieve the timestep decomposition. We decompose the denoising process into three stages of different granularity and leverage large language models (LLMs) for stage-specific instructions to guide the generation progressively. We also curate an animal-centric video dataset called OpenAnimal to facilitate the advancement and benchmarking of research in video concept transfer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves high-quality and controllable video concept transfer across diverse reference images and scenes, surpassing existing baselines in both visual fidelity and editability.

While this information can be particularly valuable in high-stakes domains such as medical imaging, these scores are heuristic in nature and do not constitute rigorous quantitative uncertainty estimates. Conformal prediction (CP) provides a principled framework for transforming heuristic confidence scores into statistically valid uncertainty estimates. However, applying CP directly to image segmentation ignores the spatial correlations between pixels, a fundamental characteristic of image data. This can result in overly conservative and less interpretable uncertainty estimates. To address this, we propose CONSIGN (Conformal Segmentation Informed by Spatial Groupings via Decomposition), a CP-based method that incorporates spatial correlations to improve uncertainty quantification in image segmentation. Our method generates meaningful prediction sets that come with user-specified, high-probability error guarantees. It is compatible with any pre-trained segmentation model capable of generating multiple sample outputs. We evaluate CONSIGN against two CP baselines across three medical imaging datasets and two COCO dataset subsets, using three different pre-trained segmentation models. Results demonstrate that accounting for spatial structure significantly improves performance across multiple metrics and enhances the quality of uncertainty estimates.</p></details> |  |
| **[Autoregressive End-to-End Planning with Time-Invariant Spatial Alignment and Multi-Objective Policy Refinement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20938v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The inherent sequential modeling capabilities of autoregressive models make them a formidable baseline for end-to-end planning in autonomous driving. Nevertheless, their performance is constrained by a spatio-temporal misalignment, as the planner must condition future actions on past sensory data. This creates an inconsistent worldview, limiting the upper bound of performance for an otherwise powerful approach. To address this, we propose a Time-Invariant Spatial Alignment (TISA) module that learns to project initial environmental features into a consistent ego-centric frame for each future time step, effectively correcting the agent's worldview without explicit future scene prediction. In addition, we employ a kinematic action prediction head (i.e., acceleration and yaw rate) to ensure physically feasible trajectories. Finally, we introduce a multi-objective post-training stage using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to move beyond pure imitation. Our approach provides targeted feedback on specific driving behaviors, offering a more fine-grained learning signal than the single, overall objective used in standard DPO. Our model achieves a state-of-the-art 89.8 PDMS on the NAVSIM dataset among autoregressive models. The video document is available at https://tisa-dpo-e2e.github.io/.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mesh Interpolation Graph Network for Dynamic and Spatially Irregular Global Weather Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20911v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks have shown promising results in weather forecasting, which is critical for human activity such as agriculture planning and extreme weather preparation. However, most studies focus on finite and local areas for training, overlooking the influence of broader areas and limiting their ability to generalize effectively. Thus, in this work, we study global weather forecasting that is irregularly distributed and dynamically varying in practice, requiring the model to generalize to unobserved locations. To address such challenges, we propose a general Mesh Interpolation Graph Network (MIGN) that models the irregular weather station forecasting, consisting of two key designs: (1) learning spatially irregular data with regular mesh interpolation network to align the data; (2) leveraging parametric spherical harmonics location embedding to further enhance spatial generalization ability. Extensive experiments on an up-to-date observation dataset show that MIGN significantly outperforms existing data-driven models. Besides, we show that MIGN has spatial generalization ability, and is capable of generalizing to previous unseen stations.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 main track</p></details> |

While prior work has made progress in constructing robotic memory, few have addressed the principled mechanisms needed for efficient memory retrieval and integration. To bridge this gap, we propose Meta-Memory, a large language model (LLM)-driven agent that constructs a high-density memory representation of the environment. The key innovation of Meta-Memory lies in its capacity to retrieve and integrate relevant memories through joint reasoning over semantic and spatial modalities in response to natural language location queries, thereby empowering robots with robust and accurate spatial reasoning capabilities. To evaluate its performance, we introduce SpaceLocQA, a large-scale dataset encompassing diverse real-world spatial question-answering scenarios. Experimental results show that Meta-Memory significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both the SpaceLocQA and the public NaVQA benchmarks. Furthermore, we successfully deployed Meta-Memory on real-world robotic platforms, demonstrating its practical utility in complex environments.

| **[A Hierarchical Variational Graph Fused Lasso for Recovering Relative Rates in Spatial Compositional Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20636v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The analysis of spatial data from biological imaging technology, such as imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) or imaging mass cytometry (IMC), is challenging because of a competitive sampling process which convolves signals from molecules in a single pixel. To address this, we develop a scalable Bayesian framework that leverages natural sparsity in spatial signal patterns to recover relative rates for each molecule across the entire image. Our method relies on the use of a heavy-tailed variant of the graphical lasso prior and a novel hierarchical variational family, enabling efficient inference via automatic differentiation variational inference. Simulation results show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-practice point estimate methodologies in IMS, and has superior posterior coverage than mean-field variational inference techniques. Results on real IMS data demonstrate that our approach better recovers the true anatomical structure of known tissue, removes artifacts, and detects active regions missed by the standard analysis approach.</p></details> |  |

While the input modality (photographs) is well within the training distribution of modern multimodal models, the task of spatial reconstruction requires genuine spatial intelligence: inferring room layouts, understanding connectivity, and maintaining consistent scale. We evaluate leading language models (GPT-5, Claude 4 Opus, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Grok-4), image generation models (GPT-Image, NanoBanana), and agent systems (Codex CLI, Claude Code) on a dataset of 50 apartments with approximately 20 interior images each. Our scoring algorithm measures similarity between generated and ground-truth floor plans based on room connectivity graphs and size rankings. Results reveal a significant blind spot in current AI capabilities: most models perform at or below a random baseline, while human performance remains substantially superior. Image generation models particularly struggle with instruction following, while agent-based approaches with iterative refinement capabilities show no meaningful improvement over single-pass generation. Blueprint-Bench provides the first numerical framework for comparing spatial intelligence across different model architectures. We will continue evaluating new models as they are released and welcome community submissions, monitoring for the emergence of spatial intelligence in generalist AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 8 figures, submitted for ICLR 2026</p></details> |

On one hand, while recent advances in diffusion models have enabled high-quality image generation, they lack explicit spatial reasoning, leading to unrealistic object layouts. On the other hand, traditional spatial planning methods in robotics emphasize geometric and relational consistency, but they struggle to capture semantic richness in visual scenes. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose LayoutAgent, an agentic framework that unifies vision-language reasoning with compositional diffusion for layout generation. Given multiple input images with target objects in them, our method first employs visual-language model to preprocess the inputs through segmentation, object size estimation, scene graph construction, and prompt rewriting. Then we leverage compositional diffusion-a method traditionally used in robotics-to synthesize bounding boxes that respect object relations encoded in the scene graph for spatial layouts. In the end, a foreground-conditioned image generator composes the complete scene by rendering the objects into the planned layout guided by designed prompts. Experiments demonstrate that LayoutAgent outperforms other state-of-the-art layout generation models in layout coherence, spatial realism and aesthetic alignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on SPACE in Vision, Language, and Embodied AI</p></details> |

While standard architectures like ConvLSTM often fail to model long-range dependencies, we argue that a more fundamental limitation of prior work lies in the uni-modal data paradigm. To address this, we propose the Multi-Modal Spatio-Temporal Transformer (MM-STT), a novel framework that fuses dynamic displacement data with static physical priors. Its core innovation is a joint spatio-temporal attention mechanism that processes all multi-modal features in a unified manner. On the public EGMS dataset, MM-STT establishes a new state-of-the-art, reducing the long-range forecast RMSE by an order of magnitude compared to all baselines, including SOTA methods like STGCN and STAEformer. Our results demonstrate that for this class of problems, an architecture's inherent capacity for deep multi-modal fusion is paramount for achieving transformative performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is submitted to IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing for reviewing</p></details> |

In a graphon particle system, the interactions among particles are characterized by the coupled mean field terms through an underlying graphon and the randomness of the coefficients comes from exogenous stochastic processes. By constructing two-level approximated sequences converging in 2-Wasserstein distance, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the system. Besides, by constructing two-level approximated functions converging to the graphon mean field terms, we establish the law of large numbers, which reveals that if the number of particles tends to infinity and the discretization step tends to zero, then the discrete-time interacting particle system over a large-scale network converges to the graphon particle system. As a byproduct, we discover that the graphon particle system can describe the limiting dynamics of the distributed stochastic gradient descent algorithm over the large-scale network and prove that if the gradients of the local cost functions are Lipschitz continuous, then the graphon particle system can be regarded as the spatio-temporal approximation of the discrete-time distributed stochastic gradient descent algorithm as the number of network nodes tends to infinity and the algorithm step size tends to zero.</p></details> |  |
| **[UrbanGraph: Physics-Informed Spatio-Temporal Dynamic Heterogeneous Graphs for Urban Microclimate Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00457v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With rapid urbanization, predicting urban microclimates has become critical, as it affects building energy demand and public health risks. However, existing generative and homogeneous graph approaches fall short in capturing physical consistency, spatial dependencies, and temporal variability. To address this, we introduce UrbanGraph, a physics-informed framework integrating heterogeneous and dynamic spatio-temporal graphs. It encodes key physical processes -- vegetation evapotranspiration, shading, and convective diffusion -- while modeling complex spatial dependencies among diverse urban entities and their temporal evolution. We evaluate UrbanGraph on UMC4/12, a physics-based simulation dataset covering diverse urban configurations and climates. Results show that UrbanGraph improves $R^2$ by up to 10.8% and reduces FLOPs by 17.0% over all baselines, with heterogeneous and dynamic graphs contributing 3.5% and 7.1% gains. Our dataset provides the first high-resolution benchmark for spatio-temporal microclimate modeling, and our method extends to broader urban heterogeneous dynamic computing tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[STaR-Attack: A Spatio-Temporal and Narrative Reasoning Attack Framework for Unified Multimodal Understanding and Generation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26473v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unified Multimodal understanding and generation Models (UMMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in both understanding and generation tasks. However, we identify a vulnerability arising from the generation-understanding coupling in UMMs. The attackers can use the generative function to craft an information-rich adversarial image and then leverage the understanding function to absorb it in a single pass, which we call Cross-Modal Generative Injection (CMGI). Current attack methods on malicious instructions are often limited to a single modality while also relying on prompt rewriting with semantic drift, leaving the unique vulnerabilities of UMMs unexplored. We propose STaR-Attack, the first multi-turn jailbreak attack framework that exploits unique safety weaknesses of UMMs without semantic drift. Specifically, our method defines a malicious event that is strongly correlated with the target query within a spatio-temporal context. Using the three-act narrative theory, STaR-Attack generates the pre-event and the post-event scenes while concealing the malicious event as the hidden climax. When executing the attack strategy, the opening two rounds exploit the UMM's generative ability to produce images for these scenes. Subsequently, an image-based question guessing and answering game is introduced by exploiting the understanding capability. STaR-Attack embeds the original malicious question among benign candidates, forcing the model to select and answer the most relevant one given the narrative context. Extensive experiments show that STaR-Attack consistently surpasses prior approaches, achieving up to 93.06% ASR on Gemini-2.0-Flash and surpasses the strongest prior baseline, FlipAttack. Our work uncovers a critical yet underdeveloped vulnerability and highlights the need for safety alignments in UMMs.</p></details> |  |

The majority of existing placement campaigns either follow standard `space-filling' designs or relatively ad-hoc expert opinions. A key challenge to applying principled active learning in this setting is that Lagrangian observers are continuously advected through the vector field, so they make measurements at different locations and times. It is, therefore, important to consider the likely future trajectories of placed observers to account for the utility of candidate placement locations. To this end, we present BALLAST: Bayesian Active Learning with Look-ahead Amendment for Sea-drifter Trajectories. We observe noticeable benefits of BALLAST-aided sequential observer placement strategies on both synthetic and high-fidelity ocean current models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Behavioural Classification in C. elegans: a Spatio-Temporal Analysis of Locomotion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00086v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The 1mm roundworm C. elegans is a model organism used in many sub-areas of biology to investigate different types of biological processes. In order to complement the n-vivo analysis with computer-based investigations, several methods have been proposed to simulate the worm behaviour. These methods extract discrete behavioural units from the flow of the worm movements using different types of tracking techniques. Nevertheless, these techniques require a clear view of the entire worm body, which is not always achievable. For example, this happens in high density worm conditions, which are particularly informative to understand the influence of the social context on the single worm behaviour. In this paper, we illustrate and evaluate a method to extract behavioural units from recordings of C. elegans movements which do not necessarily require a clear view of the entire worm body. Moreover, the behavioural units are defined by an unsupervised automatic pipeline which frees the process from predefined assumptions that inevitably bias the behavioural analysis. The behavioural units resulting from the automatic method are interpreted by comparing them with hand-designed behavioural units. The effectiveness of the automatic method is evaluated by measuring the extent to which the movement of a simulated worm, with an agent-based model, matches the movement of a natural worm. Our results indicate that spatio-temporal locomotory patterns emerge even from single point worm tracking. Moreover, we show that such patterns represent a fundamental aspect of the behavioural classification process.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adjustable Spatio-Spectral Hyperspectral Image Compression Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23447v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid growth of hyperspectral data archives in remote sensing (RS), the need for efficient storage has become essential, driving significant attention toward learning-based hyperspectral image (HSI) compression. However, a comprehensive investigation of the individual and joint effects of spectral and spatial compression on learning-based HSI compression has not been thoroughly examined yet. Conducting such an analysis is crucial for understanding how the exploitation of spectral, spatial, and joint spatio-spectral redundancies affects HSI compression. To address this issue, we propose Adjustable Spatio-Spectral Hyperspectral Image Compression Network (HyCASS), a learning-based model designed for adjustable HSI compression in both spectral and spatial dimensions. HyCASS consists of six main modules: 1) spectral encoder module; 2) spatial encoder module; 3) compression ratio (CR) adapter encoder module; 4) CR adapter decoder module; 5) spatial decoder module; and 6) spectral decoder module. The modules employ convolutional layers and transformer blocks to capture both short-range and long-range redundancies. Experimental results on three HSI benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed adjustable model compared to existing learning-based compression models, surpassing the state of the art by up to 2.36 dB in terms of PSNR. Based on our results, we establish a guideline for effectively balancing spectral and spatial compression across different CRs, taking into account the spatial resolution of the HSIs. Our code and pre-trained model weights are publicly available at https://git.tu-berlin.de/rsim/hycass .</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal-Network Point Processes for Modeling Crime Events with Landmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10882v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-exciting point processes are widely used to model the contagious effects of crime events living within continuous geographic space, using their occurrence time and locations. However, in urban environments, most events are naturally constrained within the city's street network structure, and the contagious effects of crime are governed by such a network geography. Meanwhile, the complex distribution of urban infrastructures also plays an important role in shaping crime patterns across space. We introduce a novel spatio-temporal-network point process framework for crime modeling that integrates these urban environmental characteristics by incorporating self-attention graph neural networks. Our framework incorporates the street network structure as the underlying event space, where crime events can occur at random locations on the network edges. To realistically capture criminal movement patterns, distances between events are measured using street network distances. We then propose a new mark for a crime event by concatenating the event's crime category with the type of its nearby landmark, aiming to capture how the urban design influences the mixing structures of various crime types. A graph attention network architecture is adopted to learn the existence of mark-to-mark interactions. Extensive experiments on crime data from Valencia, Spain, demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in understanding the crime landscape and forecasting crime risks across regions.</p></details> |  |

Traditional spot trading suffers from negotiation delays and high energy costs, while conventional futures trading struggles to adapt to the dynamic, uncertain UAV-edge environment. To address these challenges, we propose PAST (pilot-and-adaptive stable trading), a novel framework for edge-assisted UAV networks with spatio-temporal dynamism. PAST integrates two complementary mechanisms: PilotAO (pilot trading agreements with overbooking), a risk-aware, overbooking-enabled early-stage decision-making module that establishes long-term, mutually beneficial agreements and boosts resource utilization; and AdaptAO (adaptive trading agreements with overbooking rate update), an intelligent adaptation module that dynamically updates agreements and overbooking rates based on UAV mobility, supply-demand variations, and agreement performance. Together, these mechanisms enable both stability and flexibility, guaranteeing individual rationality, strong stability, competitive equilibrium, and weak Pareto optimality. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that PAST consistently outperforms benchmark methods in decision-making overhead, task completion latency, resource utilization, and social welfare. By combining predictive planning with real-time adjustments, PAST offers a valuable reference on robust and adaptive practice for improving low-altitude mission performance.</p></details> |  |

While approaches such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and rule-based reward mechanisms demonstrate promise in text and image domains, their application to video understanding remains limited. This paper presents a systematic exploration of Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) with GRPO for video MLLMs, aiming to enhance spatio-temporal perception while maintaining general capabilities. Our experiments reveal that RFT is highly data-efficient for task-specific improvements. Through multi-task RFT on spatio-temporal perception objectives with limited samples, we develop VideoChat-R1, a powerful video MLLM that achieves state-of-the-art performance on spatio-temporal perception tasks without sacrificing chat ability, while exhibiting emerging spatio-temporal reasoning abilities. Compared to Qwen2.5-VL-7B, VideoChat-R1 boosts performance several-fold in tasks like temporal grounding (+31.8) and object tracking (+31.2). Additionally, it significantly improves on general QA benchmarks such as VideoMME (+0.9), MVBench (+1.0), and Perception Test (+0.9). Our findings underscore the potential of RFT for specialized task enhancement of Video MLLMs. We hope our work offers valuable insights for future RL research in video MLLMs.</p></details> |  |

This sole focus on efficacy has steered development of large-scale models that require massive resources, and results in considerable carbon footprint across the model life-cycle. In this work, we explore how physics inductive biases can offer useful trade-offs between model efficacy and model efficiency (compute, energy, and carbon). We study a variety of models for spatio-temporal forecasting, a task governed by physical laws and well-suited for exploring different levels of physics inductive bias. We show that embedding physics inductive biases into the model design can yield substantial efficiency gains while retaining or even improving efficacy for the tasks under consideration. In addition to using standard physics-informed spatio-temporal models, we demonstrate the usefulness of more recent models like flow matching as a general purpose method for spatio-temporal forecasting. Our experiments show that incorporating physics inductive biases offer a principled way to improve the efficiency and reduce the carbon footprint of machine learning models. We argue that model efficiency, along with model efficacy, should become a core consideration driving machine learning model development and deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Sourc...</summary><p>Source code available at https://github.com/sophiawilson18/FlowMatching</p></details> |

| **[Spatio-temporal, multi-field deep learning of shock propagation in meso-structured media](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16139v2)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to predict how shock waves traverse porous and architected materials is a key challenge in planetary defense and in the pursuit of inertial fusion energy. Yet capturing pore collapse, anomalous Hugoniot responses, and localized heating-phenomena that strongly influence asteroid deflection or fusion ignition has remained a major challenge despite recent advances in single-field and reduced representations. We introduce a multi-field spatio-temporal deep learning model (MSTM) that unifies seven coupled fields-pressure, density, temperature, energy, material distribution, and two velocity components into a single autoregressive surrogate. Trained on high-fidelity hydrocode data, MSTM captures nonlinear shock-driven dynamics across porous and architected configurations, achieving mean errors of 1.4% and 3.2% respectively, all while delivering over three orders of magnitude in speedup. This advance transforms problems once considered intractable into tractable design studies, establishing a practical framework for optimizing meso-structured materials in planetary impact mitigation and inertial fusion energy.</p></details> | 16 pages, 10 figures |
| **[ASTGI: Adaptive Spatio-Temporal Graph Interactions for Irregular Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23313v1)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Irregular multivariate time series (IMTS) are prevalent in critical domains like healthcare and finance, where accurate forecasting is vital for proactive decision-making. However, the asynchronous sampling and irregular intervals inherent to IMTS pose two core challenges for existing methods: (1) how to accurately represent the raw information of irregular time series without introducing data distortion, and (2) how to effectively capture the complex dynamic dependencies between observation points. To address these challenges, we propose the Adaptive Spatio-Temporal Graph Interaction (ASTGI) framework. Specifically, the framework first employs a Spatio-Temporal Point Representation module to encode each discrete observation as a point within a learnable spatio-temporal embedding space. Second, a Neighborhood-Adaptive Graph Construction module adaptively builds a causal graph for each point in the embedding space via nearest neighbor search. Subsequently, a Spatio-Temporal Dynamic Propagation module iteratively updates information on these adaptive causal graphs by generating messages and computing interaction weights based on the relative spatio-temporal positions between points. Finally, a Query Point-based Prediction module generates the final forecast by aggregating neighborhood information for a new query point and performing regression. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that ASTGI outperforms various state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Open-Vocabulary Spatio-Temporal Scene Graph for Robot Perception and Teleoperation Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23107v1)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Teleoperation via natural-language reduces operator workload and enhances safety in high-risk or remote settings. However, in dynamic remote scenes, transmission latency during bidirectional communication creates gaps between remote perceived states and operator intent, leading to command misunderstanding and incorrect execution. To mitigate this, we introduce the Spatio-Temporal Open-Vocabulary Scene Graph (ST-OVSG), a representation that enriches open-vocabulary perception with temporal dynamics and lightweight latency annotations. ST-OVSG leverages LVLMs to construct open-vocabulary 3D object representations, and extends them into the temporal domain via Hungarian assignment with our temporal matching cost, yielding a unified spatio-temporal scene graph. A latency tag is embedded to enable LVLM planners to retrospectively query past scene states, thereby resolving local-remote state mismatches caused by transmission delays. To further reduce redundancy and highlight task-relevant cues, we propose a task-oriented subgraph filtering strategy that produces compact inputs for the planner. ST-OVSG generalizes to novel categories and enhances planning robustness against transmission latency without requiring fine-tuning. Experiments show that our method achieves 74 percent node accuracy on the Replica benchmark, outperforming ConceptGraph. Notably, in the latency-robustness experiment, the LVLM planner assisted by ST-OVSG achieved a planning success rate of 70.5 percent.</p></details> |  |
| **[PSTTS: A Plug-and-Play Token Selector for Efficient Event-based Spatio-temporal Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22481v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mainstream event-based spatio-temporal representation learning methods typically process event streams by converting them into sequences of event frames, achieving remarkable performance. However, they neglect the high spatial sparsity and inter-frame motion redundancy inherent in event frame sequences, leading to significant computational overhead. Existing token sparsification methods for RGB videos rely on unreliable intermediate token representations and neglect the influence of event noise, making them ineffective for direct application to event data. In this paper, we propose Progressive Spatio-Temporal Token Selection (PSTTS), a Plug-and-Play module for event data without introducing any additional parameters. PSTTS exploits the spatio-temporal distribution characteristics embedded in raw event data to effectively identify and discard spatio-temporal redundant tokens, achieving an optimal trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, PSTTS consists of two stages, Spatial Token Purification and Temporal Token Selection. Spatial Token Purification discards noise and non-event regions by assessing the spatio-temporal consistency of events within each event frame to prevent interference with subsequent temporal redundancy evaluation. Temporal Token Selection evaluates the motion pattern similarity between adjacent event frames, precisely identifying and removing redundant temporal information. We apply PSTTS to four representative backbones UniformerV2, VideoSwin, EVMamba, and ExACT on the HARDVS, DailyDVS-200, and SeACT datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that PSTTS achieves significant efficiency improvements. Specifically, PSTTS reduces FLOPs by 29-43.6% and increases FPS by 21.6-41.3% on the DailyDVS-200 dataset, while maintaining task accuracy. Our code will be available.</p></details> |  |

While earlier approaches have largely focused on forecasting the exact delays of individual trains, recent studies have begun exploring station-level delay prediction to support higher-level traffic management. In this paper, we propose the Railway-centric Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (RSTGCN), designed to forecast average arrival delays of all the incoming trains at railway stations for a particular time period. Our approach incorporates several architectural innovations and novel feature integrations, including train frequency-aware spatial attention, which significantly enhances predictive performance. To support this effort, we curate and release a comprehensive dataset for the entire Indian Railway Network (IRN), spanning 4,735 stations across 17 zones - the largest and most diverse railway network studied to date. We conduct extensive experiments using multiple state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating consistent improvements across standard metrics. Our work not only advances the modeling of average delay prediction in large-scale rail networks but also provides an open dataset to encourage further research in this critical domain.</p></details> |  |

However, this task remains challenging due to the complex dysfunctions in the spatio-temporal characteristics of underlying brain networks, which are often overlooked by existing methods. To address these limitations, we develop an interpretable spatio-temporal graph neural network framework to predict future AD progression, leveraging dual Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) to model the irregularly-sampled longitudinal functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. We validate our approach on two independent cohorts, including the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS-3) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Our framework effectively learns sparse regional and connective importance probabilities, enabling the identification of key brain circuit abnormalities associated with disease progression. Notably, we detect the parahippocampal cortex, prefrontal cortex, and parietal lobule as salient regions, with significant disruptions in the ventral attention, dorsal attention, and default mode networks. These abnormalities correlate strongly with longitudinal AD-related clinical symptoms. Moreover, our interpretability strategy reveals both established and novel neural systems-level and sex-specific biomarkers, offering new insights into the neurobiological mechanisms underlying AD progression. Our findings highlight the potential of spatio-temporal graph-based learning for early, individualized prediction of AD progression, even in the context of irregularly-sampled longitudinal imaging data.</p></details> |  |

In Ireland's highly variable maritime climate, where ground-based measurement stations are sparsely distributed, selecting an appropriate solar irradiance dataset presents a significant challenge. This study introduces a novel Bayesian spatio-temporal modelling framework for predicting solar irradiance at hourly and sub-hourly (10-minute) resolutions across Ireland. Cross-validation demonstrates that our model is statistically robust across all temporal resolutions with hourly showing highest prediction precision whereas 10-minute resolution encounters higher errors but better uncertainty quantification. In separate evaluations, we compare our model against alternative data sources, including reanalysis datasets and nearest-station interpolation, and find that it consistently provides superior site-specific accuracy. At the hourly scale, our model outperforms ERA5 in agreement with ground-based observations. At the sub-hourly scale, 10-minute resolution estimates provide solar PV power outputs consistent with residential and industrial solar PV installations in Ireland. Beyond surpassing existing datasets, our model delivers full uncertainty quantification, scalability and the capacity for real-time implementation, offering a powerful tool for solar energy prediction and the estimation of losses due to overload clipping from inverter undersizing.</p></details> |  |

The physical layer maps the geographic movement of individuals, while the information layer tracks the spread of knowledge and health behavior via social interactions. We explore the interplay between physical mobility, information flow, and epidemic outcomes by simulating disease spread within this dual-structured network. Our model employs stochastic elements to mirror human behavior, mobility, and information dissemination uncertainties. Through simulations, we assess the impact of network structure, mobility patterns, and information spread speed on epidemic dynamics. The findings highlight the crucial role of effective communication in curbing disease transmission, even in highly mobile societies. Additionally, our agent-based simulation allows for real-time scenario analysis through a user interface, offering insights into leveraging physical and informational networks for epidemic control. This research sheds light on designing strategic interventions in complex social systems to manage disease outbreaks.</p></details> |  |

Production systems typically rely on tabular gradient-boosted decision trees (e.g., XGBoost) that score sessions independently, overlooking the relational and temporal structure of online activity that characterizes coordinated attacks and "fraud rings." We introduce ATLAS (Account Takeover Learning Across Spatio-Temporal Directed Graph), a framework that reformulates ATO detection as spatio-temporal node classification on a time-respecting directed session graph. ATLAS links entities via shared identifiers (account, device, IP) and regulates connectivity with time-window and recency constraints, enabling causal, time-respecting message passing and latency-aware label propagation that uses only labels available at scoring time, non-anticipative and leakage-free. We operationalize ATLAS with inductive GraphSAGE variants trained via neighbor sampling, at scale on a sessions graph with more than 100M nodes and around 1B edges. On a high-risk digital product at Capital One, ATLAS delivers 6.38 percent AUC improvement and more than 50 percent reduction in customer friction, improving fraud capture while reducing user friction.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted at NeurIPS 2025 workshop New Perspective in Graph Machine Learning (NPGML)</p></details> |

Although spatio-temporal traffic prediction has received extensive research attention, further improvements in prediction accuracy and computational efficiency remain necessary. In particular, existing decomposition-based methods or hybrid architectures often incur heavy overhead when capturing local and global feature correlations, necessitating novel approaches that optimize accuracy and complexity. In this paper, we propose an efficient spatio-temporal network traffic prediction framework, DP-LET, which consists of a data processing module, a local feature enhancement module, and a Transformer-based prediction module. The data processing module is designed for high-efficiency denoising of network data and spatial decoupling. In contrast, the local feature enhancement module leverages multiple Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) to capture fine-grained local features. Meanwhile, the prediction module utilizes a Transformer encoder to model long-term dependencies and assess feature relevance. A case study on real-world cellular traffic prediction demonstrates the practicality of DP-LET, which maintains low computational complexity while achieving state-of-the-art performance, significantly reducing MSE by 31.8% and MAE by 23.1% compared to baseline models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation to the 2025 IEEE Global Communications Conference (IEEE GLOBECOM)</p></details> |

Efficient compression and representation are crucial for analyzing complex motion dynamics. In this work, we introduce an adversarially-refined VQ-GAN framework with dense motion tokenization for compressing spatio-temporal heatmaps while preserving the fine-grained traces of human motion. Our approach combines dense motion tokenization with adversarial refinement, which eliminates reconstruction artifacts like motion smearing and temporal misalignment observed in non-adversarial baselines. Our experiments on the CMU Panoptic dataset provide conclusive evidence of our method's superiority, outperforming the dVAE baseline by 9.31% SSIM and reducing temporal instability by 37.1%. Furthermore, our dense tokenization strategy enables a novel analysis of motion complexity, revealing that 2D motion can be optimally represented with a compact 128-token vocabulary, while 3D motion's complexity demands a much larger 1024-token codebook for faithful reconstruction. These results establish practical deployment feasibility across diverse motion analysis applications.

| **[GSTM-HMU: Generative Spatio-Temporal Modeling for Human Mobility Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19135v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human mobility traces, often recorded as sequences of check-ins, provide a unique window into both short-term visiting patterns and persistent lifestyle regularities. In this work we introduce GSTM-HMU, a generative spatio-temporal framework designed to advance mobility analysis by explicitly modeling the semantic and temporal complexity of human movement. The framework consists of four key innovations. First, a Spatio-Temporal Concept Encoder (STCE) integrates geographic location, POI category semantics, and periodic temporal rhythms into unified vector representations. Second, a Cognitive Trajectory Memory (CTM) adaptively filters historical visits, emphasizing recent and behaviorally salient events in order to capture user intent more effectively. Third, a Lifestyle Concept Bank (LCB) contributes structured human preference cues, such as activity types and lifestyle patterns, to enhance interpretability and personalization. Finally, task-oriented generative heads transform the learned representations into predictions for multiple downstream tasks. We conduct extensive experiments on four widely used real-world datasets, including Gowalla, WeePlace, Brightkite, and FourSquare, and evaluate performance on three benchmark tasks: next-location prediction, trajectory-user identification, and time estimation. The results demonstrate consistent and substantial improvements over strong baselines, confirming the effectiveness of GSTM-HMU in extracting semantic regularities from complex mobility data. Beyond raw performance gains, our findings also suggest that generative modeling provides a promising foundation for building more robust, interpretable, and generalizable systems for human mobility intelligence.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches, including spatio-temporal graph convolutional networks (ST-GCNs), often face high memory demands and struggle to capture complex spatio-temporal dependencies, limiting their efficiency in clinical applications. To address these challenges, we introduce DynSTG-Mamba (Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Graph Mamba), a novel framework that combines DF-STGNN and STG-Mamba to enhance motion sequence modeling. The DF-STGNN incorporates a dynamic spatio-temporal filter that adaptively adjusts spatial connections between skeletal joints and temporal interactions across different movement phases. This approach ensures better feature propagation through dynamic graph structures by considering the hierarchical nature and dynamics of skeletal gait data. Meanwhile, STG-Mamba, an extension of Mamba adapted for skeletal motion data, ensures a continuous propagation of states, facilitating the capture of long-term dependencies while reducing computational complexity. To reduce the number of model parameters and computational costs while maintaining consistency, we propose Cross-Graph Relational Knowledge Distillation, a novel knowledge transfer mechanism that aligns relational information between teacher (large architecture) and student models (small architecture) while using shared memory. This ensures that the interactions and movement patterns of the joints are accurately preserved in the motion sequences. We validate our DynSTG-Mamba on KOA-NM, PD-WALK, and ATAXIA datasets, where it outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by achieving in terms of Accuracy, F1-score, and Recall. Our results highlight the efficiency and robustness of our approach, offering a lightweight yet highly accurate solution for automated gait analysis and movement disorder assessment.</p></details> | <details><summary>After...</summary><p>After receiving detailed feedback from journalreviewers, we identified limitations in the initial approach and substantially improved the methodology and contributions of the work.

| **[Deformable Dynamic Convolution for Accurate yet Efficient Spatio-Temporal Traffic Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11550v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic prediction is a critical component of intelligent transportation systems, enabling applications such as congestion mitigation and accident risk prediction. While recent research has explored both graph-based and grid-based approaches, key limitations remain. Graph-based methods effectively capture non-Euclidean spatial structures but often incur high computational overhead, limiting their practicality in large-scale systems. In contrast, grid-based methods, which primarily leverage Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), offer greater computational efficiency but struggle to model irregular spatial patterns due to the fixed shape of their filters. Moreover, both approaches often fail to account for inherent spatio-temporal heterogeneity, as they typically apply a shared set of parameters across diverse regions and time periods. To address these challenges, we propose the Deformable Dynamic Convolutional Network (DDCN), a novel CNN-based architecture that integrates both deformable and dynamic convolution operations. The deformable layer introduces learnable offsets to create flexible receptive fields that better align with spatial irregularities, while the dynamic layer generates region-specific filters, allowing the model to adapt to varying spatio-temporal traffic patterns. By combining these two components, DDCN effectively captures both non-Euclidean spatial structures and spatio-temporal heterogeneity. Extensive experiments on four real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that DDCN achieves competitive predictive performance while significantly reducing computational costs, underscoring its potential for large-scale and real-time deployment.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

It employs an online data quality monitoring (DQM) system to promptly spot and diagnose particle data acquisition problems to avoid data quality loss. In this study, we present a semi-supervised spatio-temporal anomaly detection (AD) monitoring system for the physics particle reading channels of the Hadron Calorimeter (HCAL) of the CMS using three-dimensional digi-occupancy map data of the DQM. We propose the GraphSTAD system, which employs convolutional and graph neural networks to learn local spatial characteristics induced by particles traversing the detector and the global behavior owing to shared backend circuit connections and housing boxes of the channels, respectively. Recurrent neural networks capture the temporal evolution of the extracted spatial features. We validate the accuracy of the proposed AD system in capturing diverse channel fault types using the LHC collision data sets. The GraphSTAD system achieves production-level accuracy and is being integrated into the CMS core production system for real-time monitoring of the HCAL. We provide a quantitative performance comparison with alternative benchmark models to demonstrate the promising leverage of the presented system.

| **[Spatio-temporal Dynamical Indices for Complex Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10069v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Complex systems span multiple spatial and temporal scales, making their dynamics challenging to understand and predict. This challenge is especially daunting when one wants to study localized and/or rare events. Advances in dynamical systems theory, including the development of state-dependent dynamical indices, namely local dimension and persistence, have provided powerful tools for studying these phenomena. However, existing applications of such indices rely on a predefined and fixed spatial domain, that provides a single scalar quantity for the entire region of interest. This aspect prevents understanding the spatially localized dynamical behavior of the system. In this work, we introduce Spatio-temporal Dynamical Indices (SDIs), that leverage the existing framework of state-dependent local dimension and persistence. SDIs are obtained via a sliding window approach, enabling the exploration of space-dependent properties in spatio-temporal data. As an example, we show that, through this framework, we are able to reconcile previously different perspectives on European summertime heatwaves. This result showcases the importance of accounting for spatial scales when performing scale-dependent dynamical analyses.</p></details> |  |
| **[StFT: Spatio-temporal Fourier Transformer for Long-term Dynamics Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11899v2)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulating the long-term dynamics of multi-scale and multi-physics systems poses a significant challenge in understanding complex phenomena across science and engineering. The complexity arises from the intricate interactions between scales and the interplay of diverse physical processes, which manifest in PDEs through coupled, nonlinear terms that govern the evolution of multiple physical fields across scales. Neural operators have shown potential in short-term prediction of such complex spatio-temporal dynamics; however, achieving stable high-fidelity predictions and providing robust uncertainty quantification over extended time horizons remains an open and unsolved area of research. These limitations often lead to stability degradation with rapid error accumulation, particularly in long-term forecasting of systems characterized by multi-scale behaviors involving dynamics of different orders. To address these challenges, we propose an autoregressive Spatio-temporal Fourier Transformer (StFT), in which each transformer block is designed to learn the system dynamics at a distinct scale through a dual-path architecture that integrates frequency-domain and spatio-temporal representations. By leveraging a structured hierarchy of \ours blocks, the resulting model explicitly captures the underlying dynamics across both macro- and micro- spatial scales. Furthermore, a generative residual correction mechanism is introduced to learn a probabilistic refinement temporally while simultaneously quantifying prediction uncertainties, enhancing both the accuracy and reliability of long-term probabilistic forecasting. Evaluations conducted on three benchmark datasets (plasma, fluid, and atmospheric dynamics) demonstrate the advantages of our approach over state-of-the-art ML methods.</p></details> | 23 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Unleashing the Potential of Multimodal LLMs for Zero-Shot Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15178v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal video grounding (STVG) aims at localizing the spatio-temporal tube of a video, as specified by the input text query. In this paper, we utilize multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to explore a zero-shot solution in STVG. We reveal two key insights about MLLMs: (1) MLLMs tend to dynamically assign special tokens, referred to as \textit{grounding tokens}, for grounding the text query; and (2) MLLMs often suffer from suboptimal grounding due to the inability to fully integrate the cues in the text query (\textit{e.g.}, attributes, actions) for inference. Based on these insights, we propose a MLLM-based zero-shot framework for STVG, which includes novel decomposed spatio-temporal highlighting (DSTH) and temporal-augmented assembling (TAS) strategies to unleash the reasoning ability of MLLMs. The DSTH strategy first decouples the original query into attribute and action sub-queries for inquiring the existence of the target both spatially and temporally. It then uses a novel logit-guided re-attention (LRA) module to learn latent variables as spatial and temporal prompts, by regularizing token predictions for each sub-query. These prompts highlight attribute and action cues, respectively, directing the model's attention to reliable spatial and temporal related visual regions. In addition, as the spatial grounding by the attribute sub-query should be temporally consistent, we introduce the TAS strategy to assemble the predictions using the original video frames and the temporal-augmented frames as inputs to help improve temporal consistency. We evaluate our method on various MLLMs, and show that it outperforms SOTA methods on three common STVG benchmarks. The code will be available at https://github.com/zaiquanyang/LLaVA_Next_STVG.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian inference for spatio-temporal hidden Markov models using the exchange algorithm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15164v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal hidden Markov models are extremely difficult to estimate because their latent joint distributions are available only in trivial cases. In the estimation phase, these latent distributions are usually substituted with pseudo-distributions, which could affect the estimation results, in particular in the presence of strong dependence between the latent variables. In this work, we propose a spatio-temporal hidden Markov model where the latent process is an extension of the autologistic model. We show how inference can be carried out in a Bayesian framework using an approximate exchange algorithm, which circumvents the impractical calculations of the normalizing constants that arise in the model. Our proposed method leads to a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler that targets the correct posterior distribution of the model and not a pseudo-posterior. In addition, we develop a new initialization approach for the approximate exchange method, reducing the computational time of the algorithm. An extensive simulation study shows that the approximate exchange algorithm generally outperforms the pseudo-distribution approach, yielding more accurate parameter estimates. Finally, the proposed methodology is applied to a real-world case study analyzing rainfall levels across Italian regions over time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Marginals: Learning Joint Spatio-Temporal Patterns for Multivariate Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15033v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we aim to improve multivariate anomaly detection (AD) by modeling the \textit{time-varying non-linear spatio-temporal correlations} found in multivariate time series data . In multivariate time series data, an anomaly may be indicated by the simultaneous deviation of interrelated time series from their expected collective behavior, even when no individual time series exhibits a clearly abnormal pattern on its own. In many existing approaches, time series variables are assumed to be (conditionally) independent, which oversimplifies real-world interactions. Our approach addresses this by modeling joint dependencies in the latent space and decoupling the modeling of \textit{marginal distributions, temporal dynamics, and inter-variable dependencies}. We use a transformer encoder to capture temporal patterns, and to model spatial (inter-variable) dependencies, we fit a multi-variate likelihood and a copula. The temporal and the spatial components are trained jointly in a latent space using a self-supervised contrastive learning objective to learn meaningful feature representations to separate normal and anomaly samples.</p></details> |  |

However, forecasting future deformation from sparse Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) time-series data remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces a novel deep learning framework that transforms these sparse point measurements into a dense spatio-temporal tensor. This methodological shift allows, for the first time, the direct application of advanced computer vision architectures to this forecasting problem. We design and implement a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network and Long-Short Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) model, specifically engineered to simultaneously learn spatial patterns and temporal dependencies from the generated data tensor. The model's performance is benchmarked against powerful machine learning baselines, Light Gradient Boosting Machine and LASSO regression, using Sentinel-1 data from eastern Ireland. Results demonstrate that the proposed architecture provides significantly more accurate and spatially coherent forecasts, establishing a new performance benchmark for this task. Furthermore, an interpretability analysis reveals that baseline models often default to simplistic persistence patterns, highlighting the necessity of our integrated spatio-temporal approach to capture the complex dynamics of ground deformation.

In recent research, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising method, but their intrinsic design, tailored primarily for sequential token processing, introduces notable challenges in effectively capturing spatial dependencies. Specifically, the inherent limitations of LLMs in modeling spatial relationships and their architectural incompatibility with graph-structured spatial data remain largely unaddressed. To overcome these limitations, we introduce ST-LINK, a novel framework that enhances the capability of Large Language Models to capture spatio-temporal dependencies. Its key components are Spatially-Enhanced Attention (SE-Attention) and the Memory Retrieval Feed-Forward Network (MRFFN). SE-Attention extends rotary position embeddings to integrate spatial correlations as direct rotational transformations within the attention mechanism. This approach maximizes spatial learning while preserving the LLM's inherent sequential processing structure. Meanwhile, MRFFN dynamically retrieves and utilizes key historical patterns to capture complex temporal dependencies and improve the stability of long-term forecasting. Comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that ST-LINK surpasses conventional deep learning and LLM approaches, and effectively captures both regular traffic patterns and abrupt changes.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 4 figures, Accepted to CIKM 2025.

However, it often suffers from missing values due to sensor malfunctions, transmission failures, etc. Recent years have seen continued efforts to improve spatio-temporal data imputation performance. Recently diffusion models have outperformed other approaches in various tasks, including spatio-temporal imputation, showing competitive performance. Extracting and utilizing spatio-temporal dependencies as conditional information is vital in diffusion-based methods. However, previous methods introduce error accumulation in this process and ignore the variability of the dependencies in the noisy data at different diffusion steps. In this paper, we propose AdaSTI (Adaptive Dependency Model in Diffusion-based Spatio-Temporal Imputation), a novel spatio-temporal imputation approach based on conditional diffusion model. Inside AdaSTI, we propose a BiS4PI network based on a bi-directional S4 model for pre-imputation with the imputed result used to extract conditional information by our designed Spatio-Temporal Conditionalizer (STC)network. We also propose a Noise-Aware Spatio-Temporal (NAST) network with a gated attention mechanism to capture the variant dependencies across diffusion steps. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that AdaSTI outperforms existing methods in all the settings, with up to 46.4% reduction in imputation error.</p></details> | 9 pages |

Building on these developments, we introduce the identifiable autoregressive variational autoencoder, which ensures the identifiability of latent components consisting of nonstationary autoregressive processes. The blind source separation efficacy of the proposed method is showcased through a simulation study, where it is compared against state-of-the-art methods, and the spatio-temporal prediction performance is evaluated against several competitors on air pollution and weather datasets.</p></details> |  |

Based on the EEG signals from four frontal lobe channels, the network aims to generate virtual channel EEG signals for other 13 important brain regions. The architecture of the network is a two-dimensional convolutional neural network and it includes a parallel module for temporal and spatial domain feature extraction, followed by a feature fusion module. The public PRED+CT database, which includes multi-channel EEG signals from 119 subjects, was selected to verify the constructed network. The results showed that the average correlation coefficient between the generated virtual channel EEG signals and the original real signals was 0.6724, with an average absolute error of 3.9470. Furthermore, the 13 virtual channel EEG signals were combined with the original EEG signals of four brain regions and then used for anxiety classification with a support vector machine. The results indicate that the virtual EEG signals generated by the constructed network not only have a high degree of consistency with the real channel EEG signals but also significantly enhance the performance of machine learning algorithms for anxiety classification. This study effectively alleviates the problem of insufficient information acquisition by portable EEG devices with few channels.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improved Classification of Nitrogen Stress Severity in Plants Under Combined Stress Conditions Using Spatio-Temporal Deep Learning Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06625v2)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Plants in their natural habitats endure an array of interacting stresses, both biotic and abiotic, that rarely occur in isolation. Nutrient stress-particularly nitrogen deficiency-becomes even more critical when compounded with drought and weed competition, making it increasingly difficult to distinguish and address its effects. Early detection of nitrogen stress is therefore crucial for protecting plant health and implementing effective management strategies. This study proposes a novel deep learning framework to accurately classify nitrogen stress severity in a combined stress environment. Our model uses a unique blend of four imaging modalities-RGB, multispectral, and two infrared wavelengths-to capture a wide range of physiological plant responses from canopy images. These images, provided as time-series data, document plant health across three levels of nitrogen availability (low, medium, and high) under varying water stress and weed pressures. The core of our approach is a spatio-temporal deep learning pipeline that merges a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for extracting spatial features from images with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to capture temporal dependencies. We also devised and evaluated a spatial-only CNN pipeline for comparison. Our CNN-LSTM pipeline achieved an impressive accuracy of 98%, impressively surpassing the spatial-only model's 80.45% and other previously reported machine learning method's 76%. These results bring actionable insights based on the power of our CNN-LSTM approach in effectively capturing the subtle and complex interactions between nitrogen deficiency, water stress, and weed pressure. This robust platform offers a promising tool for the timely and proactive identification of nitrogen stress severity, enabling better crop management and improved plant health.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 8 figures, 7 Tables</p></details> |

The mechanistic model, formulated as a system of ordinary differential equations, captures temporal tumor dynamics including radiotherapy effects and estimates future tumor burden. These estimates condition a gradient-guided DDIM, enabling image synthesis that aligns with both predicted growth and patient anatomy. We train our model on the BraTS adult and pediatric glioma datasets and evaluate on 60 axial slices of in-house longitudinal pediatric diffuse midline glioma (DMG) cases. Our framework generates realistic follow-up scans based on spatial similarity metrics. It also introduces tumor growth probability maps, which capture both clinically relevant extent and directionality of tumor growth as shown by 95th percentile Hausdorff Distance. The method enables biologically informed image generation in data-limited scenarios, offering generative-space-time predictions that account for mechanistic priors.</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures |
| **[A Zero-Inflated Spatio-Temporal Model for Integrating Fishery-Dependent and Independent Data under Preferential Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09336v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sustainable management of marine ecosystems is vital for maintaining healthy fishery resources, and benefits from advanced scientific tools to accurately assess species distribution patterns. In fisheries science, two primary data sources are used: fishery-independent data (FID), collected through systematic surveys, and fishery-dependent data (FDD), obtained from commercial fishing activities. While these sources provide complementary information, their distinct sampling schemes - systematic for FID and preferential for FDD - pose significant integration challenges. This study introduces a novel spatio-temporal model that integrates FID and FDD, addressing challenges associated with zero-inflation and preferential sampling (PS) common in ecological data. The model employs a six-layer structure to differentiate between presence-absence and biomass observations, offering a robust framework for ecological studies affected by PS biases. Simulation results demonstrate the model's accuracy in parameter estimation across diverse PS scenarios and its ability to detect preferential signals. Application to the study of the distribution patterns of the European sardine populations along the southern Portuguese continental shelf illustrates the model's effectiveness in integrating diverse data sources and incorporating environmental and vessel-specific covariates. The model reveals spatio-temporal variability in sardine presence and biomass, providing actionable insights for fisheries management. Beyond ecology, this framework offers broad applicability to data integration challenges in other disciplines.</p></details> |  |
| **[DyC-STG: Dynamic Causal Spatio-Temporal Graph Network for Real-time Data Credibility Analysis in IoT](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06483v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The wide spreading of Internet of Things (IoT) sensors generates vast spatio-temporal data streams, but ensuring data credibility is a critical yet unsolved challenge for applications like smart homes. While spatio-temporal graph (STG) models are a leading paradigm for such data, they often fall short in dynamic, human-centric environments due to two fundamental limitations: (1) their reliance on static graph topologies, which fail to capture physical, event-driven dynamics, and (2) their tendency to confuse spurious correlations with true causality, undermining robustness in human-centric environments. To address these gaps, we propose the Dynamic Causal Spatio-Temporal Graph Network (DyC-STG), a novel framework designed for real-time data credibility analysis in IoT. Our framework features two synergistic contributions: an event-driven dynamic graph module that adapts the graph topology in real-time to reflect physical state changes, and a causal reasoning module to distill causally-aware representations by strictly enforcing temporal precedence. To facilitate the research in this domain we release two new real-world datasets. Comprehensive experiments show that DyC-STG establishes a new state-of-the-art, outperforming the strongest baselines by 1.4 percentage points and achieving an F1-Score of up to 0.930.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks Approach for Predicting Silent Data Corruption inducing Circuit-Level Faults](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06289v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Silent Data Errors (SDEs) from time-zero defects and aging degrade safety-critical systems. Functional testing detects SDE-related faults but is expensive to simulate. We present a unified spatio-temporal graph convolutional network (ST-GCN) for fast, accurate prediction of long-cycle fault impact probabilities (FIPs) in large sequential circuits, supporting quantitative risk assessment. Gate-level netlists are modeled as spatio-temporal graphs to capture topology and signal timing; dedicated spatial and temporal encoders predict multi-cycle FIPs efficiently. On ISCAS-89 benchmarks, the method reduces simulation time by more than 10x while maintaining high accuracy (mean absolute error 0.024 for 5-cycle predictions). The framework accepts features from testability metrics or fault simulation, allowing efficiency-accuracy trade-offs. A test-point selection study shows that choosing observation points by predicted FIPs improves detection of long-cycle, hard-to-detect faults. The approach scales to SoC-level test strategy optimization and fits downstream electronic design automation flows.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 9 figures, plan to submit to ACM TODAES</p></details> |

Traditional input modalities, such as Apex Frame, Optical Flow, and Dynamic Image, often fail to adequately capture these brief facial movements, resulting in suboptimal performance. In this study, we introduce the Micro-expression Spatio-Temporal Image (MESTI), a novel dynamic input modality that transforms a video sequence into a single image while preserving the essential characteristics of micro-movements. Additionally, we present the Micro-expression Gradient Attention Network (MEGANet), which incorporates a novel Gradient Attention block to enhance the extraction of fine-grained motion features from micro-expressions. By combining MESTI and MEGANet, we aim to establish a more effective approach to MER. Extensive experiments were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of MESTI, comparing it with existing input modalities across three CNN architectures (VGG19, ResNet50, and EfficientNetB0). Moreover, we demonstrate that replacing the input of previously published MER networks with MESTI leads to consistent performance improvements. The performance of MEGANet, both with MESTI and Dynamic Image, is also evaluated, showing that our proposed network achieves state-of-the-art results on the CASMEII and SAMM datasets. The combination of MEGANet and MESTI achieves the highest accuracy reported to date, setting a new benchmark for micro-expression recognition. These findings underscore the potential of MESTI as a superior input modality and MEGANet as an advanced recognition network, paving the way for more effective MER systems in a variety of applications.</p></details> |  |

However, the precise and efficient decoding of MI remains challenging due to their non-stationary nature and low signal-to-noise ratio. This paper introduces a novel end-to-end deep learning framework of Discriminative Residual Dense Convolutional Autoencoder with Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network (DRDCAE-STGNN) to enhance the MI feature learning and classification. Specifically, the DRDCAE module leverages residual-dense connections to learn discriminative latent representations through joint reconstruction and classifica-tion, while the STGNN module captures dynamic spatial dependencies via a learnable graph adjacency matrix and models temporal dynamics using bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM). Extensive evaluations on BCI Competition IV 2a, 2b, and PhysioNet datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with average accuracies of 95.42%, 97.51%, and 90.15%, respectively. Ablation studies confirm the contribution of each component, and interpreta-bility analysis reveals neurophysiologically meaningful connectivity patterns. Moreover, despite its complexity, the model maintains a feasible parameter count and an inference time of 0.32 ms per sample. These results indicate that our method offers a robust, accurate, and interpretable solution for MI-EEG decoding, with strong generalizability across subjects and tasks and meeting the requirements for potential real-time BCI applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submit to IEEE Journal</p></details> |
| **[Select, then Balance: A Plug-and-Play Framework for Exogenous-Aware Spatio-Temporal Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05779v1)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal forecasting aims to predict the future state of dynamic systems and plays an important role in multiple fields. However, existing solutions only focus on modeling using a limited number of observed target variables. In real-world scenarios, exogenous variables can be integrated into the model as additional input features and associated with the target signal to promote forecast accuracy. Although promising, this still encounters two challenges: the inconsistent effects of different exogenous variables to the target system, and the imbalance effects between historical variables and future variables. To address these challenges, this paper introduces \model, a novel framework for modeling \underline{exo}genous variables in \underline{s}patio-\underline{t}emporal forecasting, which follows a ``select, then balance'' paradigm. Specifically, we first construct a latent space gated expert module, where fused exogenous information is projected into a latent space to dynamically select and recompose salient signals via specialized sub-experts. Furthermore, we design a siamese network architecture in which recomposed representations of past and future exogenous variables are fed into dual-branch spatio-temporal backbones to capture dynamic patterns. The outputs are integrated through a context-aware weighting mechanism to achieve dynamic balance during the modeling process. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness, generality, robustness, and efficiency of our proposed framework.</p></details> | 16 pages, 11 figures |

To address key limitations in modeling spatio-temporal dependencies and exploiting multi-source data for parking availability prediction, this study proposes a novel approach with SST-iTransformer. The methodology leverages K-means clustering to establish parking cluster zones (PCZs), extracting and integrating traffic demand characteristics from various transportation modes (i.e., metro, bus, online ride-hailing, and taxi) associated with the targeted parking lots. Upgraded on vanilla iTransformer, SST-iTransformer integrates masking-reconstruction-based pretext tasks for self-supervised spatio-temporal representation learning, and features an innovative dual-branch attention mechanism: Series Attention captures long-term temporal dependencies via patching operations, while Channel Attention models cross-variate interactions through inverted dimensions. Extensive experiments using real-world data from Chengdu, China, demonstrate that SST-iTransformer outperforms baseline deep learning models (including Informer, Autoformer, Crossformer, and iTransformer), achieving state-of-the-art performance with the lowest mean squared error (MSE) and competitive mean absolute error (MAE). Comprehensive ablation studies quantitatively reveal the relative importance of different data sources: incorporating ride-hailing data provides the largest performance gains, followed by taxi, whereas fixed-route transit features (bus/metro) contribute marginally. Spatial correlation analysis further confirms that excluding historical data from correlated parking lots within PCZs leads to substantial performance degradation, underscoring the importance of modeling spatial dependencies.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 5 figures, under review for journal publication</p></details> |

Specifically, we model the observations by two weakly time-stationary point processes with spatial intensity measures $\mu$ and $\nu$ over the expanding window $(0,t]$ as $t$ increases to infinity, and establish sharp convergence rates of the empirical UOT in terms of the intrinsic dimensions of the measures. We assume a sub-quadratic temporal growth condition of the variance of the process, which allows for a wide range of temporal dependencies. As the growth approaches quadratic, the convergence rate becomes slower. This variance assumption is related to the time-reduced factorial covariance measure, and we exemplify its validity for various point processes, including the Poisson cluster, Hawkes, Neyman-Scott, and log-Gaussian Cox processes. Complementary to our upper bounds, we also derive matching lower bounds for various spatio-temporal point processes of interest and establish near minimax rate optimality of the empirical Kantorovich-Rubinstein distance.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contributed equally, 76 pages, 7 figures</p></details> |
| **[S2M2ECG: Spatio-temporal bi-directional State Space Model Enabled Multi-branch Mamba for ECG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03066v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As one of the most effective methods for cardiovascular disease (CVD) diagnosis, multi-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals present a characteristic multi-sensor information fusion challenge that has been continuously researched in deep learning domains. Despite the numerous algorithms proposed with different DL architectures, maintaining a balance among performance, computational complexity, and multi-source ECG feature fusion remains challenging. Recently, state space models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness across various fields. Their inherent design for high-efficiency computation and linear complexity makes them particularly suitable for low-dimensional data like ECGs. This work proposes S2M2ECG, an SSM architecture featuring three-level fusion mechanisms: (1) Spatio-temporal bi-directional SSMs with segment tokenization for low-level signal fusion, (2) Intra-lead temporal information fusion with bi-directional scanning to enhance recognition accuracy in both forward and backward directions, (3) Cross-lead feature interaction modules for spatial information fusion. To fully leverage the ECG-specific multi-lead mechanisms inherent in ECG signals, a multi-branch design and lead fusion modules are incorporated, enabling individual analysis of each lead while ensuring seamless integration with others. Experimental results reveal that S2M2ECG achieves superior performance in the rhythmic, morphological, and clinical scenarios. Moreover, its lightweight architecture ensures it has nearly the fewest parameters among existing models, making it highly suitable for efficient inference and convenient deployment. Collectively, S2M2ECG offers a promising alternative that strikes an excellent balance among performance, computational complexity, and ECG-specific characteristics, paving the way for high-performance, lightweight computations in CVD diagnosis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Sequential Ordinal Models: Application to Invasive Weeds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01976v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The multivariate sequential ordinal model is investigated for use in the Bayesian analysis of spatio-temporal ordinal data. The sequential ordinal model likelihood is equivalent to a binary model conditional on unknown regression coefficients and spatio-temporal random effects. Therefore, estimation and prediction in the space-time context can proceed using the well-established dynamic generalised linear model framework. Moreover, the sequential ordinal model avoids the ordering constraints on the threshold parameters that determine the category break points required by cumulative ordinal models, and so simplifies the estimation procedure for high-dimensional space-time applications using Bayesian inference. The dynamic spatio-temporal sequential ordinal model is applied to estimate foliage cover abundance of four actively managed invasive alien species. These invasive weed species are observed by means of a modified Braun-Blanquet score that is commonly used in vegetation studies and constitutes ordinal data. The multivariate ordinal data for the managed weeds species are sparsely distributed in space and time with few observations recorded in high foliage cover categories. A separable model for space-time dependence that maintains parameter interpretability in the presence of aggregated ordinal categories is therefore developed. Estimation and prediction is demonstrated using integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) methods developed for univariate spatio-temporal models. Bayesian estimation and prediction shows that the four invasive weed species differentially respond to habitat type, control effort and accessibility, and share similar magnitudes of dependence with short effective spatial ranges and strong temporal autocorrelations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transforming Norm-based To Graph-based Spatial Representation for Spatio-Temporal Epidemiological Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14539v3)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pandemics, with their profound societal and economic impacts, pose significant threats to global health, mortality rates, economic stability, and political landscapes. In response to these challenges, numerous studies have employed spatio-temporal models to enhance our understanding and management of these complex phenomena. These spatio-temporal models can be roughly divided into two main spatial categories: norm-based and graph-based. Norm-based models are usually more accurate and easier to model but are more computationally intensive and require more data to fit. On the other hand, graph-based models are less accurate and harder to model but are less computationally intensive and require fewer data to fit. As such, ideally, one would like to use a graph-based model while preserving the representation accuracy obtained by the norm-based model. In this study, we explore the ability to transform from norm-based to graph-based spatial representation for these models. We first show no analytical mapping between the two exists, requiring one to use approximation numerical methods instead. We introduce a novel framework for this task together with twelve possible implementations using a wide range of heuristic optimization approaches. Our findings show that by leveraging agent-based simulations and heuristic algorithms for the graph node's location and population's spatial walk dynamics approximation one can use graph-based spatial representation without losing much of the model's accuracy and expressiveness. We investigate our framework for three real-world cases, achieving 94\% accuracy preservation, on average. Moreover, an analysis of synthetic cases shows the proposed framework is relatively robust for changes in both spatial and temporal properties.</p></details> |  |

While advanced vision-language models (VLMs) excel in static scene understanding, their limitations in spatio-temporal reasoning and adaptation to dynamic, open-set tasks like task-oriented navigation and embodied question answering (EQA) persist due to inadequate modeling of fine-grained spatio-temporal cues and physical world comprehension. To address this, we propose VEME, a novel cross-modal alignment method that enhances generalization in unseen scenes by learning an ego-centric, experience-centered world model. Our framework integrates three key components: (1) a cross-modal alignment framework bridging objects, spatial representations, and visual semantics with spatio-temporal cues to enhance VLM in-context learning; (2) a dynamic, implicit cognitive map activated by world embedding to enable task-relevant geometric-semantic memory recall; and (3) an instruction-based navigation and reasoning framework leveraging embodied priors for long-term planning and efficient exploration. By embedding geometry-aware spatio-temporal episodic experiences, our method significantly improves reasoning and planning in dynamic environments. Experimental results on VSI-Bench and VLN-CE demonstrate 1%-3% accuracy and exploration efficiency improvement compared to traditional approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Flow Matching for Learning Spatio-Temporal Trajectories in 4D Longitudinal Medical Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21580v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding temporal dynamics in medical imaging is crucial for applications such as disease progression modeling, treatment planning and anatomical development tracking. However, most deep learning methods either consider only single temporal contexts, or focus on tasks like classification or regression, limiting their ability for fine-grained spatial predictions. While some approaches have been explored, they are often limited to single timepoints, specific diseases or have other technical restrictions. To address this fundamental gap, we introduce Temporal Flow Matching (TFM), a unified generative trajectory method that (i) aims to learn the underlying temporal distribution, (ii) by design can fall back to a nearest image predictor, i.e. predicting the last context image (LCI), as a special case, and (iii) supports $3D$ volumes, multiple prior scans, and irregular sampling. Extensive benchmarks on three public longitudinal datasets show that TFM consistently surpasses spatio-temporal methods from natural imaging, establishing a new state-of-the-art and robust baseline for $4D$ medical image prediction.</p></details> |  |

To fully leverage this information, however, the extracted features must be organized in a structured and meaningful way that supports efficient access and use. One promising approach is question answering (QA), which allows users -- especially those unfamiliar with database query languages -- to retrieve knowledge in a natural and intuitive manner. In this project, we developed a GeoQA system by integrating a spatio-temporal knowledge graph (KG) constructed from historical map data with large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we have defined the ontology to guide the construction of the spatio-temporal KG and investigated workflows of two different types of GeoQA: factual and descriptive. Additional data sources, such as historical map images and internet search results, are incorporated into our framework to provide extra context for descriptive GeoQA. Evaluation results demonstrate that the system can generate answers with a high delivery rate and a high semantic accuracy. To make the framework accessible, we further developed a web application that supports interactive querying and visualization.</p></details> |  |

The proposed system requires neither access to multi-channel training data nor prior knowledge about the number or placement of microphones. It works for both a compact microphone array and distributed microphones, with minor adjustments. Due to its superior handling of overlapping speech during segmentation, the proposed pipeline significantly outperforms the single-channel pyannote approach, both in a scenario with a compact microphone array and in a setup with distributed microphones. Additionally, we show that, unlike fully spatial diarization pipelines, the proposed system can correctly track speakers when they change positions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of INTERSPEECH</p></details> |

They pose, however, significant computational challenges in high-dimensional settings, which frequently arise in spatial-temporal applications. We present DALIA, a highly scalable framework for performing Bayesian inference tasks on spatio-temporal multivariate GPs, based on the methodology of integrated nested Laplace approximations. Our approach relies on a sparse inverse covariance matrix formulation of the GP, puts forward a GPU-accelerated block-dense approach, and introduces a hierarchical, triple-layer, distributed memory parallel scheme. We showcase weak scaling performance surpassing the state-of-the-art by two orders of magnitude on a model whose parameter space is 8$\times$ larger and measure strong scaling speedups of three orders of magnitude when running on 496 GH200 superchips on the Alps supercomputer. Applying DALIA to air pollution data from northern Italy over 48 days, we showcase refined spatial resolutions over the aggregated pollutant measurements.</p></details> |  |

Privacy statutes such as the GDPR require that any individual's contribution be unlearned on demand, yet retraining deep models from scratch for every request is untenable. We introduce MobText-SISA, a scalable machine-unlearning framework that extends Sharded, Isolated, Sliced, and Aggregated (SISA) training to heterogeneous spatio-temporal data. MobText-SISA first embeds each trip's numerical and linguistic features into a shared latent space, then employs similarity-aware clustering to distribute samples across shards so that future deletions touch only a single constituent model while preserving inter-shard diversity. Each shard is trained incrementally; at inference time, constituent predictions are aggregated to yield the output. Deletion requests trigger retraining solely of the affected shard from its last valid checkpoint, guaranteeing exact unlearning. Experiments on a ten-month real-world mobility log demonstrate that MobText-SISA (i) sustains baseline predictive accuracy, and (ii) consistently outperforms random sharding in both error and convergence speed. These results establish MobText-SISA as a practical foundation for privacy-compliant analytics on multimodal mobility data at urban scale.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to The 33rd ACM International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems(SIGSPATIAL '25) as a short paper in the Short Paper Track</p></details> |

It aims to provide accurate assessment of cardiac structure and function through Ejection Fraction (EF) estimation. Although existing studies have achieved good segmentation performance, their results do not perform well in EF estimation. In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Spatio-temporal Segmentation Network (\ourmodel) for echocardiography video, aiming to improve EF estimation accuracy by synergizing local detail modeling with global dynamic perception. The network employs a hierarchical design, with low-level stages using convolutional networks to process single-frame images and preserve details, while high-level stages utilize the Mamba architecture to capture spatio-temporal relationships. The hierarchical design balances single-frame and multi-frame processing, avoiding issues such as local error accumulation when relying solely on single frames or neglecting details when using only multi-frame data. To overcome local spatio-temporal limitations, we propose the Spatio-temporal Cross Scan (STCS) module, which integrates long-range context through skip scanning across frames and positions. This approach helps mitigate EF calculation biases caused by ultrasound image noise and other factors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Pruning for Compressed Spiking Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20122v1)** | 2025-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) present significant challenges for deployment in energy-constrained environments due to their large model sizes and high inference latency. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), inspired by the sparse event-driven neural processing and energy-efficient information transmission in the brain, offer a promising alternative for achieving low-power computing. Integrating the event-driven efficiency of spiking neurons with the advanced capabilities of LLMs represents a promising direction for power-efficient LLMs. This work specifically delves into the design of compressed spiking LLMs. Here, we revisit spatial and temporal pruning from the perspective of SNNs and propose a novel spatio-temporal pruning framework for Spiking LLMs to optimize computational efficiency while preserving high performance. Our spatial pruning technique reduces the number of active neurons and attention heads, effectively lowering the computational complexity of the model. Meanwhile, temporal pruning minimizes inference latency by dynamically adjusting the number of timesteps required for different layers. By combining these approaches with other compression techniques, we present the first work in the domain of Spiking LLMs to jointly explore spatial pruning, temporal pruning, extreme quantization and knowledge distillation strategies. Extensive experimental evaluation of our proposed framework for SpikingBERT on the large-scale GLUE benchmark demonstrates the efficacy of our approach in terms of computational operations and inference latency. Our approach offers a compelling solution for real-time, low-power natural language processing applications, making Spiking LLMs more practical for deployment on edge devices and in power-constrained settings.</p></details> |  |

We establish representer theorems for time dependent OV-RKHS interpolation, derive Sobolev type approximation bounds for smooth vector fields, and provide spectral convergence guarantees for kernel Koopman operator approximations.

Traditional models often rely on parametric kernels, limiting their ability to capture heterogeneous, nonstationary dynamics. Recent innovations integrate deep neural architectures -- either by modeling the conditional intensity function directly or by learning flexible, data-driven influence kernels, substantially broadening their expressive power. This article reviews the development of the deep influence kernel approach, which enjoys statistical explainability, since the influence kernel remains in the model to capture the spatiotemporal propagation of event influence and its impact on future events, while also possessing strong expressive power, thereby benefiting from both worlds. We explain the main components in developing deep kernel point processes, leveraging tools such as functional basis decomposition and graph neural networks to encode complex spatial or network structures, as well as estimation using both likelihood-based and likelihood-free methods, and address computational scalability for large-scale data. We also discuss the theoretical foundation of kernel identifiability. Simulated and real-data examples highlight applications to crime analysis, earthquake aftershock prediction, and sepsis prediction modeling, and we conclude by discussing promising directions for the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Annua...</summary><p>Annual Review of Statistics and Its Application, 2025</p></details> |

Although various domain adaptation and generalization methods were proposed to promote the adaptability of deep-based RPM models in unseen deployment environments, considerations in aspects such as privacy concerns and real-time adaptation restrict their application in real-world deployment. Thus, we aim to propose a novel fully Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) strategy tailored for RPM tasks in this work. Specifically, based on prior knowledge in physiology and our observations, we noticed not only there is spatio-temporal consistency in the frequency domain of BVP signals, but also that inconsistency in the time domain was significant. Given this, by leveraging both consistency and inconsistency priors, we introduce an innovative expert knowledge-based self-supervised \textbf{C}onsistency-\textbf{i}n\textbf{C}onsistency-\textbf{i}ntegration (\textbf{CiCi}) framework to enhances model adaptation during inference. Besides, our approach further incorporates a gradient dynamic control mechanism to mitigate potential conflicts between priors, ensuring stable adaptation across instances. Through extensive experiments on five diverse datasets under the TTA protocol, our method consistently outperforms existing techniques, presenting state-of-the-art performance in real-time self-supervised adaptation without accessing source data. The code will be released later.</p></details> |  |

However, current models struggle with ensuring the validity and generalizability of inferred spatio-temporal patterns, especially in capturing dynamic spatial dependencies and temporal shifts, and optimizing the generalizability of unknown sensors. To overcome these limitations, we propose Spatio-Temporal Aware Graph Adversarial Neural Network (STA-GANN), a novel GNN-based kriging framework that improves spatio-temporal pattern validity and generalization. STA-GANN integrates (i) Decoupled Phase Module that senses and adjusts for timestamp shifts. (ii) Dynamic Data-Driven Metadata Graph Modeling to update spatial relationships using temporal data and metadata; (iii) An adversarial transfer learning strategy to ensure generalizability. Extensive validation across nine datasets from four fields and theoretical evidence both demonstrate the superior performance of STA-GANN.</p></details> |  |

While current spatial media technologies have primarily focused on capturing or replaying content as static assets, often disconnected from the viewer's environment or offering limited interactivity, the means to describe an experience's underlying semantic and interactive structure remains underexplored. We propose a descriptive framework called MAR-ED based on three core primitives: 1) Event Primitives for semantic scene graph representation, 2) Keyframe Primitives for efficient and meaningful data access, and 3) Playback Primitives for user-driven adaptive interactive playback of recorded MAR experience. The proposed flowchart of the three-stage process of the proposed MAR-ED framework transforms a recorded experience into a unique adaptive MAR experience during playback, where its spatio-temporal structure dynamically conforms to a new environment and its narrative can be altered by live user input. Drawing on this framework, personal digital memories and recorded events can evolve beyond passive 2D/3D videos into immersive, spatially-integrated group experiences, opening new paradigms for training, cultural heritage, and interactive storytelling without requiring complex, per-user adaptive rendering.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 2 figures, Accepted in the IEEE ISMAR 2025 XRStand Workshop</p></details> |

Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) are designed to support human drivers and are especially useful when they can anticipate potential accidents before they happen. While many existing systems depend on a range of sensors such as LiDAR, radar, and GPS, relying solely on dash-cam video input presents a more challenging but a more cost-effective and easily deployable solution. In this work, we incorporate better spatio-temporal features and aggregate them through a recurrent network to improve upon state-of-the-art graph neural networks for predicting accidents from dash-cam videos. Experiments using three publicly available datasets show that our proposed STAGNet model achieves higher average precision and mean time-to-collision values than previous methods, both when cross-validated on a given dataset and when trained and tested on different datasets.</p></details> |  |

Although Selective State Space Models (SSMs) have shown good performance in sequence modeling with linear complexity, the spatio-temporal disorder of point cloud videos hinders their unidirectional modeling when directly unfolding the point cloud video into a 1D sequence through temporally sequential scanning. To address this challenge, we propose the Unified Spatio-Temporal State Space Model (UST-SSM), which extends the latest advancements in SSMs to point cloud videos. Specifically, we introduce Spatial-Temporal Selection Scanning (STSS), which reorganizes unordered points into semantic-aware sequences through prompt-guided clustering, thereby enabling the effective utilization of points that are spatially and temporally distant yet similar within the sequence. For missing 4D geometric and motion details, Spatio-Temporal Structure Aggregation (STSA) aggregates spatio-temporal features and compensates. To improve temporal interaction within the sampled sequence, Temporal Interaction Sampling (TIS) enhances fine-grained temporal dependencies through non-anchor frame utilization and expanded receptive fields. Experimental results on the MSR-Action3D, NTU RGB+D, and Synthia 4D datasets validate the effectiveness of our method.

Interpretation of digital subtraction angiography (DSA) sequences poses challenges due to anatomical complexity and time constraints. This work proposes OccluNet, a spatio-temporal deep learning model that integrates YOLOX, a single-stage object detector, with transformer-based temporal attention mechanisms to automate occlusion detection in DSA sequences. We compared OccluNet with a YOLOv11 baseline trained on either individual DSA frames or minimum intensity projections. Two spatio-temporal variants were explored for OccluNet: pure temporal attention and divided space-time attention. Evaluation on DSA images from the MR CLEAN Registry revealed the model's capability to capture temporally consistent features, achieving precision and recall of 89.02% and 74.87%, respectively. OccluNet significantly outperformed the baseline models, and both attention variants attained similar performance.

While various dynamic computation methods have been developed to mitigate this by targeting spatial, temporal, or architecture-specific redundancies, they remain fragmented. While the principles of adaptive computation time (ACT) offer a robust foundation for a unified approach, its application to SNN-based vision Transformers (ViTs) is hindered by two core issues: the violation of its temporal similarity prerequisite and a static architecture fundamentally unsuited for its principles. To address these challenges, we propose STAS (Spatio-Temporal Adaptive computation time for Spiking transformers), a framework that co-designs the static architecture and dynamic computation policy. STAS introduces an integrated spike patch splitting (I-SPS) module to establish temporal stability by creating a unified input representation, thereby solving the architectural problem of temporal dissimilarity. This stability, in turn, allows our adaptive spiking self-attention (A-SSA) module to perform two-dimensional token pruning across both spatial and temporal axes. Implemented on spiking Transformer architectures and validated on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, STAS reduces energy consumption by up to 45.9%, 43.8%, and 30.1%, respectively, while simultaneously improving accuracy over SOTA models.</p></details> | 8 pages |

This paper introduces STER-VLM, a computationally efficient framework that enhances VLM performance through (1) caption decomposition to tackle spatial and temporal information separately, (2) temporal frame selection with best-view filtering for sufficient temporal information, and (3) reference-driven understanding for capturing fine-grained motion and dynamic context and (4) curated visual/textual prompt techniques. Experimental results on the WTS \cite{kong2024wts} and BDD \cite{BDD} datasets demonstrate substantial gains in semantic richness and traffic scene interpretation. Our framework is validated through a decent test score of 55.655 in the AI City Challenge 2025 Track 2, showing its effectiveness in advancing resource-efficient and accurate traffic analysis for real-world applications.</p></details> | ICCV Workshop 2025 |

Although Transformer-based models offer strong global modeling, they often struggle with rigid temporal encoding and weak space-time fusion. We propose STPFormer, a Spatio-Temporal Pattern-Aware Transformer that achieves state-of-the-art performance via unified and interpretable representation learning. It integrates four modules: Temporal Position Aggregator (TPA) for pattern-aware temporal encoding, Spatial Sequence Aggregator (SSA) for sequential spatial learning, Spatial-Temporal Graph Matching (STGM) for cross-domain alignment, and an Attention Mixer for multi-scale fusion. Experiments on five real-world datasets show that STPFormer consistently sets new SOTA results, with ablation and visualizations confirming its effectiveness and generalizability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Compact Attention: Exploiting Structured Spatio-Temporal Sparsity for Fast Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12969v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The computational demands of self-attention mechanisms pose a critical challenge for transformer-based video generation, particularly in synthesizing ultra-long sequences. Current approaches, such as factorized attention and fixed sparse patterns, fail to fully exploit the inherent spatio-temporal redundancies in video data. Through systematic analysis of video diffusion transformers (DiT), we uncover a key insight: Attention matrices exhibit structured, yet heterogeneous sparsity patterns, where specialized heads dynamically attend to distinct spatiotemporal regions (e.g., local pattern, cross-shaped pattern, or global pattern). Existing sparse attention methods either impose rigid constraints or introduce significant overhead, limiting their effectiveness. To address this, we propose Compact Attention, a hardware-aware acceleration framework featuring three innovations: 1) Adaptive tiling strategies that approximate diverse spatial interaction patterns via dynamic tile grouping, 2) Temporally varying windows that adjust sparsity levels based on frame proximity, and 3) An automated configuration search algorithm that optimizes sparse patterns while preserving critical attention pathways. Our method achieves 1.6~2.5x acceleration in attention computation on single-GPU setups while maintaining comparable visual quality with full-attention baselines. This work provides a principled approach to unlocking efficient long-form video generation through structured sparsity exploitation.

A critical research gap lies in identifying the underlying causes of hydrogen bond formation and separation -understanding which interactions or prior events contribute to their emergence over time. With this challenge in mind, we propose leveraging spatio-temporal data analytics and machine learning models to enhance the detection of these phenomena. In this paper, our approach is inspired by causal modeling and aims to identify the root cause variables of hydrogen bond formation and separation events. Specifically, we treat the separation of hydrogen bonds as an "intervention" occurring and represent the causal structure of the bonding and separation events in the MDS as graphical causal models. These causal models are built using a variational autoencoder-inspired architecture that enables us to infer causal relationships across samples with diverse underlying causal graphs while leveraging shared dynamic information. We further include a step to infer the root causes of changes in the joint distribution of the causal models. By constructing causal models that capture shifts in the conditional distributions of molecular interactions during bond formation or separation, this framework provides a novel perspective on root cause analysis in molecular dynamic systems. We validate the efficacy of our model empirically on the atomic trajectories that used MDS for chiral separation, demonstrating that we can predict many steps in the future and also find the variables driving the observed changes in the system.</p></details> | Submitted to ACM |

The long-term spatio-temporal dependency learning brings two new challenges: 1) The long-term temporal sequence includes multiscale information naturally which is hard to extract efficiently; 2) The multiscale temporal information from different nodes is highly correlated and hard to model. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient \textit{\textbf{S}patio-\textbf{T}emporal \textbf{M}ultiscale \textbf{M}amba} (STM2) that includes a multiscale Mamba architecture to capture the multiscale information efficiently and simultaneously, and an adaptive graph causal convolution network to learn the complex multiscale spatio-temporal dependency. STM2 includes hierarchical information aggregation for different-scale information that guarantees their distinguishability. To capture diverse temporal dynamics across all spatial nodes more efficiently, we further propose an enhanced version termed \textit{\textbf{S}patio-\textbf{T}emporal \textbf{M}ixture of \textbf{M}ultiscale \textbf{M}amba} (STM3) that employs a special Mixture-of-Experts architecture, including a more stable routing strategy and a causal contrastive learning strategy to enhance the scale distinguishability. We prove that STM3 has much better routing smoothness and guarantees the pattern disentanglement for each expert successfully. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmarks demonstrate STM2/STM3's superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art results in long-term spatio-temporal time-series prediction.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposed PTSM (Physiology-aware and Task-invariant Spatio-temporal Modeling), a novel framework for interpretable and robust EEG decoding across unseen subjects. PTSM employs a dual-branch masking mechanism that independently learns personalized and shared spatio-temporal patterns, enabling the model to preserve individual-specific neural characteristics while extracting task-relevant, population-shared features. The masks are factorized across temporal and spatial dimensions, allowing fine-grained modulation of dynamic EEG patterns with low computational overhead. To further address representational entanglement, PTSM enforces information-theoretic constraints that decompose latent embeddings into orthogonal task-related and subject-related subspaces. The model is trained end-to-end via a multi-objective loss integrating classification, contrastive, and disentanglement objectives. Extensive experiments on cross-subject motor imagery datasets demonstrate that PTSM achieves strong zero-shot generalization, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines without subject-specific calibration. Results highlight the efficacy of disentangled neural representations for achieving both personalized and transferable decoding in non-stationary neurophysiological settings.</p></details> |  |

While recent vision language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable progress in specialized domains like multimodal mathematics and pure spatial understanding, their capability for spatio-physical reasoning remains largely unexplored. This paper provides a comprehensive diagnostic analysis of mainstream VLMs, revealing that current models perform inadequately on this crucial task. Further detailed analysis shows that this underperformance is largely attributable to biases caused by human-like prior and a lack of deep reasoning. To address these challenges, we apply supervised fine-tuning followed by rule-based reinforcement learning to Qwen2.5-VL-7B, resulting in significant improvements in spatio-physical reasoning capabilities and surpassing leading proprietary models. Nevertheless, despite this success, the model's generalization to new physics scenarios remains limited -- underscoring the pressing need for new approaches in spatio-physical reasoning.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |

Conventional approaches based on large-scale fixed antenna arrays and UAV trajectory optimization struggle to balance energy efficiency, real-time adaptation, and spatial flexibility. The movable antenna (MA) technology has emerged as a promising solution, offering enhanced spatial flexibility and reduced energy consumption to overcome the bottlenecks of urban low-altitude communications. However, MA deployment faces a critical velocity mismatch between UAV mobility and mechanical repositioning latency, undermining real-time link optimization and security assurance. To overcome this, we propose a predictive MA-UAV collaborative control framework. First, optimal antenna positions are derived via secrecy rate maximization. Second, a Transformer-enhanced long short-term memory (LSTM) network predicts future MA positions by capturing spatio-temporal correlations in antenna trajectories. Extensive simulations demonstrate superior prediction accuracy (NMSE reduction exceeds 49\%) and communication reliability versus current popular benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Although advanced Spatio-temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) and pre-trained models have achieved significant progress in traffic prediction, two key challenges remain: (i) limited contextual capacity when modeling complex spatio-temporal dependencies, and (ii) low predictability at fine-grained spatio-temporal points due to heterogeneous patterns. Inspired by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), we propose RAST, a universal framework that integrates retrieval-augmented mechanisms with spatio-temporal modeling to address these challenges. Our framework consists of three key designs: 1) Decoupled Encoder and Query Generator to capture decoupled spatial and temporal features and construct a fusion query via residual fusion; 2) Spatio-temporal Retrieval Store and Retrievers to maintain and retrieve vectorized fine-grained patterns; and 3) Universal Backbone Predictor that flexibly accommodates pre-trained STGNNs or simple MLP predictors. Extensive experiments on six real-world traffic networks, including large-scale datasets, demonstrate that RAST achieves superior performance while maintaining computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |

While traditional matrix time series focus mainly on temporal evolution, our approach incorporates both spatial and temporal dynamics, enabling simultaneous analysis of interactions across multiple dimensions. The inherent endogeneity in spatio-temporal autoregressive models renders ordinary least squares estimation inconsistent. To overcome this difficulty while simultaneously estimating two distinct weight matrices with banded structure, we develop an iterated generalized Yule-Walker estimator by adapting a generalized method of moments framework based on Yule-Walker equations. Moreover, unlike conventional models that employ a single bandwidth parameter, the dual-bandwidth specification in our framework requires a new two-step, ratio-based sequential estimation procedure.</p></details> |  |

Beyond a high number of ignitions, the country has experienced devastating mega-fires, such as those in 2017. Accurate forecasting of wildfire occurrence and burned areas is therefore essential for effective firefighting resource allocation and emergency preparedness. In this study, we present a novel two-stage ensemble approach that extends the widely used latent Gaussian modelling framework with the integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) for spatio-temporal wildfire forecasting. The first stage uses XGBoost, a gradient boosting model, to identify wildfire patterns from environmental covariates and historical fire records, producing one-month-ahead point forecasts for fire counts and burned area. These predictions are then incorporated as external covariates in a latent Gaussian model, which includes additional spatiotemporal random effects to produce the final probabilistic forecasts of monthly total fire counts and burned area at the council level. To effectively model both moderate and extreme wildfire events, we implement the extended generalised Pareto (eGP) likelihood (a sub-asymptotic distribution) within the INLA framework. We also develop and discuss penalised complexity priors (PC-priors) for the eGP parameters and provide a comprehensive comparison of the eGP likelihood against other commonly employed distributions in environmental modelling, such as the Gamma and Weibull distributions. The proposed framework addresses the challenge of accessing future environmental covariates, which are typically unavailable at prediction time, and demonstrates strong performance in one-month-ahead wildfire forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>44 pa...</summary><p>44 pages, 12 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

We present STAC, a cross-cameras surveillance system that leverages spatio-temporal associations for efficient object tracking under constrained network conditions. STAC integrates multi-resolution feature learning, ensuring robustness under variable networked system level optimizations such as frame filtering, FFmpeg-based compression, and Region-of-Interest (RoI) masking, to eliminate redundant content across distributed video streams while preserving downstream model accuracy for object identification and tracking. Evaluated on NVIDIA's AICity Challenge dataset, STAC achieves a 76\% improvement in tracking accuracy and an 8.6x reduction in inference latency over a standard multi-object multi-camera tracking baseline (using YOLOv4 and DeepSORT). Furthermore, 29\% of redundant frames are filtered, significantly reducing data volume without compromising inference quality.</p></details> |  |

Many existing solutions rely on computationally demanding deep learning models, which result in high latency and are unsuitable for embedded robotic devices with limited resources (such as intelligent vehicles/cars) where rapid detection is necessary to prevent accidents. This paper introduces LiteFat, a lightweight spatio-temporal graph learning model designed to detect driver fatigue efficiently while maintaining high accuracy and low computational demands. LiteFat involves converting streaming video data into spatio-temporal graphs (STG) using facial landmark detection, which focuses on key motion patterns and reduces unnecessary data processing. LiteFat uses MobileNet to extract facial features and create a feature matrix for the STG. A lightweight spatio-temporal graph neural network is then employed to identify signs of fatigue with minimal processing and low latency. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that LiteFat performs competitively while significantly decreasing computational complexity and latency as compared to current state-of-the-art methods. This work enables the development of real-time, resource-efficient human fatigue detection systems that can be implemented upon embedded robotic devices.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

We introduce a Physics- and Geometry- Aware Spatio-Spectral Graph Neural Operator ($\pi$G-Sp$^2$GNO) for learning the solution operators of time-independent and time-dependent PDEs. The proposed approach first improves upon the recently developed Sp$^2$GNO by enabling geometry awareness and subsequently exploits the governing physics to learn the underlying solution operator in a simulation-free setup. While the spatio-spectral structure present in the proposed architecture allows multiscale learning, two separate strategies for enabling geometry awareness is introduced in this paper. For time dependent problems, we also introduce a novel hybrid physics informed loss function that combines higher-order time-marching scheme with upscaled theory inspired stochastic projection scheme. This allows accurate integration of the physics-information into the loss function. The performance of the proposed approach is illustrated on number of benchmark examples involving regular and complex domains, variation in geometry during inference, and time-independent and time-dependent problems. The results obtained illustrate the efficacy of the proposed approach as compared to the state-of-the-art physics-informed neural operator algorithms in the literature.</p></details> |  |

Thus, the USVs need to continuously adapt their paths with real-time information to avoid collisions and follow the path of least resistance to the goal via exploiting ocean currents. In this regard, we introduce a novel algorithm, called Self-Morphing Adaptive Replanning Tree for dynamic Obstacles and Currents (SMART-OC), that facilitates real-time time-risk optimal replanning in dynamic environments. SMART-OC integrates the obstacle risks along a path with the time cost to reach the goal to find the time-risk optimal path. The effectiveness of SMART-OC is validated by simulation experiments, which demonstrate that the USV performs fast replannings to avoid dynamic obstacles and exploit ocean currents to successfully reach the goal.</p></details> |  |

Despite this importance, due to the limitations of urban sensing techniques, the data quality from most sources is inadequate for monitoring crowd flow at each POI. This renders the inference of accurate crowd flow from low-quality data a critical and challenging task. The complexity is heightened by three key factors: 1) \emph{The scarcity and rarity of labeled data}, 2) \emph{The intricate spatio-temporal dependencies among POIs}, and 3) \emph{The myriad correlations between precise crowd flow and GPS reports}. To address these challenges, we recast the crowd flow inference problem as a self-supervised attributed graph representation learning task and introduce a novel \underline{C}ontrastive \underline{S}elf-learning framework for \underline{S}patio-\underline{T}emporal data (\model). Our approach initiates with the construction of a spatial adjacency graph founded on the POIs and their respective distances. We then employ a contrastive learning technique to exploit large volumes of unlabeled spatio-temporal data. We adopt a swapped prediction approach to anticipate the representation of the target subgraph from similar instances. Following the pre-training phase, the model is fine-tuned with accurate crowd flow data.

However, current modeling approaches are limited in capturing such complex interplay between human activities and commercial land use change under and following disturbances. Such interactions have been more effectively captured in current resilient urban planning theories. This study designs and calibrates a Urban Theory-Informed Spatio-Temporal Attention Model for Predicting Post-Disaster Commercial Land Use Change (Urban-STA4CLC) to predict both the yearly decline and expansion of commercial land use at census block level under cumulative impact of disasters on human activities over two years. Guided by urban theories, Urban-STA4CLC integrates both spatial and temporal attention mechanisms with three theory-informed modules. Resilience theory guides a disaster-aware temporal attention module that captures visitation dynamics. Spatial economic theory informs a multi-relational spatial attention module for inter-block representation. Diffusion theory contributes a regularization term that constrains land use transitions. The model performs significantly better than non-theoretical baselines in predicting commercial land use change under the scenario of recurrent hurricanes, with around 19% improvement in F1 score (0.8763). The effectiveness of the theory-guided modules was further validated through ablation studies. The research demonstrates that embedding urban theory into commercial land use modeling models may substantially enhance the capacity to capture its gains and losses. These advances in commercial land use modeling contribute to land use research that accounts for cumulative impacts of recurrent disasters and shifts in economic activity patterns.</p></details> |  |
| **[UniSTFormer: Unified Spatio-Temporal Lightweight Transformer for Efficient Skeleton-Based Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08944v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Skeleton-based action recognition (SAR) has achieved impressive progress with transformer architectures. However, existing methods often rely on complex module compositions and heavy designs, leading to increased parameter counts, high computational costs, and limited scalability. In this paper, we propose a unified spatio-temporal lightweight transformer framework that integrates spatial and temporal modeling within a single attention module, eliminating the need for separate temporal modeling blocks. This approach reduces redundant computations while preserving temporal awareness within the spatial modeling process. Furthermore, we introduce a simplified multi-scale pooling fusion module that combines local and global pooling pathways to enhance the model's ability to capture fine-grained local movements and overarching global motion patterns. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our lightweight model achieves a superior balance between accuracy and efficiency, reducing parameter complexity by over 58% and lowering computational cost by over 60% compared to state-of-the-art transformer-based baselines, while maintaining competitive recognition performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[B-VLLM: A Vision Large Language Model with Balanced Spatio-Temporal Tokens](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09919v2)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) integrated with vision encoders have shown promising performance in vision understanding. The key of VLLMs is to encode visual content into sequences of visual tokens, enabling VLLMs to simultaneously process both visual and textual content. However, understanding videos, especially long videos, remain a challenge to VLLMs as the number of visual tokens grows rapidly when encoding videos, resulting in the risk of exceeding the context window of VLLMs and introducing heavy computation burden. To restrict the number of visual tokens, existing VLLMs either: (1) uniformly downsample videos into a fixed number of frames or (2) reducing the number of visual tokens encoded from each frame. We argue the former solution neglects the rich temporal cue in videos and the later overlooks the spatial details in each frame. In this work, we present Balanced-VLLM (B-VLLM): a novel VLLM framework that aims to effectively leverage task relevant spatio-temporal cues while restricting the number of visual tokens under the VLLM context window length. At the core of our method, we devise a text-conditioned adaptive frame selection module to identify frames relevant to the visual understanding task. The selected frames are then de-duplicated using a temporal frame token merging technique. The visual tokens of the selected frames are processed through a spatial token sampling module and an optional spatial token merging strategy to achieve precise control over the token count. Experimental results show that B-VLLM is effective in balancing the number of frames and visual tokens in video understanding, yielding superior performance on various video understanding benchmarks.

While many spatio-temporal methods focus on improving accuracy, fairness has recently gained attention due to growing evidence that biased predictions in spatio-temporal applications can disproportionately disadvantage certain demographic or geographic groups, thereby reinforcing existing socioeconomic inequalities and undermining the ethical deployment of AI in public services. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, FairDRL-ST, based on disentangled representation learning, to address fairness concerns in spatio-temporal prediction, with a particular focus on mobility demand forecasting. By leveraging adversarial learning and disentangled representation learning, our framework learns to separate attributes that contain sensitive information. Unlike existing methods that enforce fairness through supervised learning, which may lead to overcompensation and degraded performance, our framework achieves fairness in an unsupervised manner with minimal performance loss. We apply our framework to real-world urban mobility datasets and demonstrate its ability to close fairness gaps while delivering competitive predictive performance compared to state-of-the-art fairness-aware methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a Research Paper (short) at ACM SIGSPATIAL 2025.

| **[Spatio-Temporal Representation Decoupling and Enhancement for Federated Instrument Segmentation in Surgical Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23759v2)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Surgical instrument segmentation under Federated Learning (FL) is a promising direction, which enables multiple surgical sites to collaboratively train the model without centralizing datasets. However, there exist very limited FL works in surgical data science, and FL methods for other modalities do not consider inherent characteristics in surgical domain: i) different scenarios show diverse anatomical backgrounds while highly similar instrument representation; ii) there exist surgical simulators which promote large-scale synthetic data generation with minimal efforts. In this paper, we propose a novel Personalized FL scheme, Spatio-Temporal Representation Decoupling and Enhancement (FedST), which wisely leverages surgical domain knowledge during both local-site and global-server training to boost segmentation. Concretely, our model embraces a Representation Separation and Cooperation (RSC) mechanism in local-site training, which decouples the query embedding layer to be trained privately, to encode respective backgrounds. Meanwhile, other parameters are optimized globally to capture the consistent representations of instruments, including the temporal layer to capture similar motion patterns. A textual-guided channel selection is further designed to highlight site-specific features, facilitating model adapta tion to each site. Moreover, in global-server training, we propose Synthesis-based Explicit Representation Quantification (SERQ), which defines an explicit representation target based on synthetic data to synchronize the model convergence during fusion for improving model generalization.</p></details> |  |

Given that the typical data (i.e., videos and images) collected by the fleet of UAVs deployed in such scenarios can be considerably larger than what the onboard computers can process, the UAVs need to offload their data in real-time to the edge and the cloud for further processing. To that end, we present the design of AerialDB - a lightweight decentralized data storage and query system that can store and process time series data on a multi-UAV system comprising: A) a fleet of hundreds of UAVs fitted with onboard computers, and B) ground-based edge servers connected through a cellular link. Leveraging lightweight techniques for content-based replica placement and indexing of shards, AerialDB has been optimized for efficient processing of different possible combinations of typical spatial and temporal queries performed by real-world disaster management applications. Using containerized deployment spanning up to 400 drones and 80 edges, we demonstrate that AerialDB is able to scale efficiently while providing near real-time performance with different realistic workloads. Further, AerialDB comprises a decentralized and locality-aware distributed execution engine which provides graceful degradation of performance upon edge failures with relatively low latency while processing large spatio-temporal data. AerialDB exhibits comparable insertion performance and 100 times improvement in query performance against state-of-the-art baseline. Moreover, it exhibits a 10 times and 100 times improvement with insertion and query workloads respectively over the cloud baseline.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce the first treatment-aware spatio-temporal diffusion model that is able to generate future masks demonstrating lesion evolution in MS. Our voxel-space approach incorporates multi-modal patient data, including MRI and treatment information, to forecast new and enlarging T2 (NET2) lesion masks at a future time point. Extensive experiments on a multi-centre dataset of 2131 patient 3D MRIs from randomized clinical trials for relapsing-remitting MS demonstrate that our generative model is able to accurately predict NET2 lesion masks for patients across six different treatments. Moreover, we demonstrate our model has the potential for real-world clinical applications through downstream tasks such as future lesion count and location estimation, binary lesion activity classification, and generating counterfactual future NET2 masks for several treatments with different efficacies. This work highlights the potential of causal, image-based generative models as powerful tools for advancing data-driven prognostics in MS.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to MICCAI 2025 (LMID Workshop)</p></details> |

Land Surface Temperature (LST) is a key variable in this context and is retrieved from remote sensing satellites. However, these systems face a trade-off between spatial and temporal resolution. While spatio-temporal fusion methods offer promising solutions, few have addressed the estimation of daily LST at 10 m resolution. In this study, we present WGAST, a Weakly-Supervised Generative Network for Daily 10 m LST Estimation via Spatio-Temporal Fusion of Terra MODIS, Landsat 8, and Sentinel-2. WGAST is the first end-to-end deep learning framework designed for this task. It adopts a conditional generative adversarial architecture, with a generator composed of four stages: feature extraction, fusion, LST reconstruction, and noise suppression. The first stage employs a set of encoders to extract multi-level latent representations from the inputs, which are then fused in the second stage using cosine similarity, normalization, and temporal attention mechanisms. The third stage decodes the fused features into high-resolution LST, followed by a Gaussian filter to suppress high-frequency noise. Training follows a weakly supervised strategy based on physical averaging principles and reinforced by a PatchGAN discriminator. Experiments demonstrate that WGAST outperforms existing methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Compared to the best-performing baseline, on average, WGAST reduces RMSE by 17.18% and improves SSIM by 11.00%. Furthermore, WGAST is robust to cloud-induced LST and effectively captures fine-scale thermal patterns, as validated against 33 ground-based sensors.

While Transformers have been the dominant architecture, recent alternatives such as xLSTM offer linear complexity with respect to context length while remaining competitive in the billion-parameter regime. We conduct a comparative investigation on the scaling behavior of Transformers and xLSTM along the following lines, providing insights to guide future model design and deployment. First, we study the scaling behavior for xLSTM in compute-optimal and over-training regimes using both IsoFLOP and parametric fit approaches on a wide range of model sizes (80M-7B) and number of training tokens (2B-2T). Second, we examine the dependence of optimal model sizes on context length, a pivotal aspect that was largely ignored in previous work. Finally, we analyze inference-time scaling characteristics. Our findings reveal that in typical LLM training and inference scenarios, xLSTM scales favorably compared to Transformers. Importantly, xLSTM's advantage widens as training and inference contexts grow.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and data available at https://github.com/NX-AI/xlstm_scaling_laws</p></details> |

Recently, time series foundation models have leveraged multi-step lookahead predictions to improve the quality and efficiency of multi-step forecasts. However, these models only predict independent marginal distributions for each time step, rather than a full joint predictive distribution. To generate forecast sample paths with realistic correlation structures, one typically resorts to autoregressive sampling, which can be extremely expensive. In this paper, we present a copula-based approach to efficiently generate accurate, correlated sample paths from existing multi-step time series foundation models in one forward pass. Our copula-based approach generates correlated sample paths orders of magnitude faster than autoregressive sampling, and it yields improved sample path quality by mitigating the snowballing error phenomenon.</p></details> |  |

Existing personalization approaches typically require extensive pre-recorded data and place the burden of adaptation on the DHH speaker. We present EvolveCaptions, a real-time, collaborative ASR adaptation system that supports in-situ personalization with minimal effort. Hearing participants correct ASR errors during live conversations. Based on these corrections, the system generates short, phonetically targeted prompts for the DHH speaker to record, which are then used to fine-tune the ASR model. In a study with 12 DHH and six hearing participants, EvolveCaptions reduced Word Error Rate (WER) across all DHH users within one hour of use, using only five minutes of recording time on average. Participants described the system as intuitive, low-effort, and well-integrated into communication. These findings demonstrate the promise of collaborative, real-time ASR adaptation for more equitable communication.</p></details> |  |

Machines cannot perform music in the human sense; they can produce, reproduce, execute, or synthesize music, but they lack the capacity for affective or emotional experience. As such, music performance is an ideal candidate through which to explore aspects of collaboration between humans and machines. In this paper, we introduce the witheFlow system, designed to enhance real-time music performance by automatically modulating audio effects based on features extracted from both biosignals and the audio itself. The system, currently in a proof-of-concept phase, is designed to be lightweight, able to run locally on a laptop, and is open-source given the availability of a compatible Digital Audio Workstation and sensors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS Creative AI Track 2025: Humanity</p></details> |

The proposed solution uses the Vision Transformer for Video (ViViT) model for video feature extraction and the Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST) for audio analysis. The system implements a Tensor Fusion Network (TFN) architecture that explicitly models unimodal and bimodal interactions through a 2-fold Cartesian product. This advanced fusion technique captures complex cross-modal dynamics between visual behaviors (e.g., tailgating,unauthorized access) and audio cues (e.g., fare transaction sounds). The system was trained and tested on a custom dataset, achieving an accuracy of 89.5%, precision of 87.2%, and recall of 84.0% in detecting fraudulent activities, significantly outperforming early fusion baselines and exceeding the 75% recall rates typically reported in state-of-the-art transportation fraud detection systems. Our ablation studies demonstrate that the tensor fusion approach provides a 7.0% improvement in the F1 score and an 8.8% boost in recall compared to traditional concatenation methods. The solution supports real-time detection, enabling public transport operators to reduce revenue loss, improve passenger safety, and ensure operational compliance.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[Policy Gradient Guidance Enables Test Time Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02148v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Policy Gradient Guidance (PGG), a simple extension of classifier-free guidance from diffusion models to classical policy gradient methods. PGG augments the policy gradient with an unconditional branch and interpolates conditional and unconditional branches, yielding a test-time control knob that modulates behavior without retraining. We provide a theoretical derivation showing that the additional normalization term vanishes under advantage estimation, leading to a clean guided policy gradient update. Empirically, we evaluate PGG on discrete and continuous control benchmarks. We find that conditioning dropout-central to diffusion guidance-offers gains in simple discrete tasks and low sample regimes, but dropout destabilizes continuous control. Training with modestly larger guidance ($\gamma>1$) consistently improves stability, sample efficiency, and controllability. Our results show that guidance, previously confined to diffusion policies, can be adapted to standard on-policy methods, opening new directions for controllable online reinforcement learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pandora's Box Problem With Time Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15261v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Pandora's Box problem models the search for the best alternative when evaluation is costly. In the simplest variant, a decision maker is presented with $n$ boxes, each associated with a cost of inspection and a hidden random reward. The decision maker inspects a subset of these boxes one after the other, in a possibly adaptive order, and gains the difference between the largest revealed reward and the sum of the inspection costs. Although this classic version is well understood (Weitzman 1979), there is a flourishing recent literature on variants of the problem. Here we introduce a general framework -- the Pandora's Box Over Time problem -- that captures a wide range of variants where time plays a role, e.g., by constraining the schedules of exploration and influencing costs and rewards. In our framework, boxes have time-dependent rewards and costs, whereas inspection may require a box-specific processing time. Moreover, once a box is inspected, its reward may deteriorate over time. Our main result is an efficient constant-factor approximation to the optimal strategy for the Pandora's Box Over Time problem, which is generally NP-hard to compute. We further obtain improved results for the natural special cases where boxes have no processing time, boxes are available only in specific time slots, or when costs and reward distributions are time-independent (but rewards may still deteriorate after inspection).</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper unifies and extends preliminary versions that appeared in AAAI 2024 (DOI:10.1609/aaai.v38i18.30015) and WINE 2024 (arXiv:2407.15261v1)</p></details> |
| **[KAIROS: Unified Training for Universal Non-Autoregressive Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02084v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the World Wide Web, reliable time series forecasts provide the forward-looking signals that drive resource planning, cache placement, and anomaly response, enabling platforms to operate efficiently as user behavior and content distributions evolve. Compared with other domains, time series forecasting for Web applications requires much faster responsiveness to support real-time decision making. We present KAIROS, a non-autoregressive time series forecasting framework that directly models segment-level multi-peak distributions. Unlike autoregressive approaches, KAIROS avoids error accumulation and achieves just-in-time inference, while improving over existing non-autoregressive models that collapse to over-smoothed predictions. Trained on the large-scale corpus, KAIROS demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization on six widely used benchmarks, delivering forecasting performance comparable to state-of-the-art foundation models with similar scale, at a fraction of their inference cost. Beyond empirical results, KAIROS highlights the importance of non-autoregressive design as a scalable paradigm for foundation models in time series.</p></details> |  |
| **[Accuracy of Discretely Sampled Stochastic Policies in Continuous-time Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09981v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stochastic policies (also known as relaxed controls) are widely used in continuous-time reinforcement learning algorithms. However, executing a stochastic policy and evaluating its performance in a continuous-time environment remain open challenges. This work introduces and rigorously analyzes a policy execution framework that samples actions from a stochastic policy at discrete time points and implements them as piecewise constant controls. We prove that as the sampling mesh size tends to zero, the controlled state process converges weakly to the dynamics with coefficients aggregated according to the stochastic policy. We explicitly quantify the convergence rate based on the regularity of the coefficients and establish an optimal first-order convergence rate for sufficiently regular coefficients. Additionally, we prove a $1/2$-order weak convergence rate that holds uniformly over the sampling noise with high probability, and establish a $1/2$-order pathwise convergence for each realization of the system noise in the absence of volatility control. Building on these results, we analyze the bias and variance of various policy evaluation and policy gradient estimators based on discrete-time observations. Our results provide theoretical justification for the exploratory stochastic control framework in [H. Wang, T. Zariphopoulou, and X.Y. Zhou, J. Mach. Learn. Res., 21 (2020), pp. 1-34].</p></details> |  |

This enables compact and scalable codes for multi-stage, multi-step, and adaptive explicit time integration on distributed-memory parallel computers and on Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). The present implementation is based on extending OpenFPM's metaprogramming system to Odeint data types. This makes the time-integration methods from Odeint available in a concise template-expression language for numerical simulations distributed and parallelized using OpenFPM. We benchmark the present software for exponential and sigmoidal dynamics and present application examples to the 3D Gray-Scott reaction-diffusion problem and the "dam break" problem from fluid mechanics. We find a strong-scaling efficiency of 80% on up to 512 CPU cores and a five-fold speedup on a single GPU.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods predominantly utilize the temporal mean squared error, which faces two critical challenges: (1) label autocorrelation, which leads to bias from the label sequence likelihood; (2) excessive amount of tasks, which increases with the forecast horizon and complicates optimization. To address these challenges, we propose Time-o1, a transformation-augmented learning objective tailored for time-series forecasting. The central idea is to transform the label sequence into decorrelated components with discriminated significance. Models are then trained to align the most significant components, thereby effectively mitigating label autocorrelation and reducing task amount. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Time-o1 achieves state-of-the-art performance and is compatible with various forecast models.

Existing MTS anomaly detection methods fall into three categories: reconstruction-based, prediction-based, and classifier-based methods. However, these methods face two key challenges: (1) Unsupervised learning methods, such as reconstruction-based and prediction-based methods, rely on error thresholds, which can lead to inaccuracies; (2) Semi-supervised methods mainly model normal data and often underuse anomaly labels, limiting detection of subtle anomalies;(3) Supervised learning methods, such as classifier-based approaches, often fail to capture local relationships, incur high computational costs, and are constrained by the scarcity of labeled data. To address these limitations, we propose Moon, a supervised modality conversion-based multivariate time series anomaly detection framework. Moon enhances the efficiency and accuracy of anomaly detection while providing detailed anomaly analysis reports. First, Moon introduces a novel multivariate Markov Transition Field (MV-MTF) technique to convert numeric time series data into image representations, capturing relationships across variables and timestamps. Since numeric data retains unique patterns that cannot be fully captured by image conversion alone, Moon employs a Multimodal-CNN to integrate numeric and image data through a feature fusion model with parameter sharing, enhancing training efficiency. Finally, a SHAP-based anomaly explainer identifies key variables contributing to anomalies, improving interpretability. Extensive experiments on six real-world MTS datasets demonstrate that Moon outperforms six state-of-the-art methods by up to 93% in efficiency, 4% in accuracy and, 10.8% in interpretation performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uniform-in-time convergence bounds for Persistent Contrastive Divergence Algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01944v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a continuous-time formulation of persistent contrastive divergence (PCD) for maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of unnormalised densities. Our approach expresses PCD as a coupled, multiscale system of stochastic differential equations (SDEs), which perform optimisation of the parameter and sampling of the associated parametrised density, simultaneously. From this novel formulation, we are able to derive explicit bounds for the error between the PCD iterates and the MLE solution for the model parameter. This is made possible by deriving uniform-in-time (UiT) bounds for the difference in moments between the multiscale system and the averaged regime. An efficient implementation of the continuous-time scheme is introduced, leveraging a class of explicit, stable intregators, stochastic orthogonal Runge-Kutta Chebyshev (S-ROCK), for which we provide explicit error estimates in the long-time regime. This leads to a novel method for training energy-based models (EBMs) with explicit error guarantees.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Novel Approach for Estimating Largest Lyapunov Exponents in One-Dimensional Chaotic Time Series Using Machine Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04868v3)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding and quantifying chaos from data remains challenging. We present a data-driven method for estimating the largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE) from one-dimensional chaotic time series using machine learning. A predictor is trained to produce out-of-sample, multi-horizon forecasts; the LLE is then inferred from the exponential growth of the geometrically averaged forecast error (GMAE) across the horizon, which serves as a proxy for trajectory divergence. We validate the approach on four canonical 1D maps-logistic, sine, cubic, and Chebyshev-achieving R2pos > 0.99 against reference LLE curves with series as short as M = 450. Among baselines, KNN yields the closest fits (KNN-R comparable; RF larger deviations). By design the estimator targets positive exponents: in periodic/stable regimes it returns values indistinguishable from zero. Noise robustness is assessed by adding zero-mean white measurement noise and summarizing performance versus the average SNR over parameter sweeps: accuracy saturates for SNRm > 30 dB and collapses below 27 dB, a conservative sensor-level benchmark. The method is simple, computationally efficient, and model-agnostic, requiring only stationarity and the presence of a dominant positive exponent. It offers a practical route to LLE estimation in experimental settings where only scalar time-series measurements are available, with extensions to higher-dimensional and irregularly sampled data left for future work.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 5 figures, 2 Tables, 14 Equations</p></details> |
| **[Wasserstein multivariate auto-regressive models for modeling distributional time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05442v6)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper is focused on the statistical analysis of data consisting of a collection of multiple series of probability measures that are indexed by distinct time instants and supported over a bounded interval of the real line. By modeling these time-dependent probability measures as random objects in the Wasserstein space, we propose a new auto-regressive model for the statistical analysis of multivariate distributional time series. Using the theory of iterated random function systems, results on the second order stationarity of the solution of such a model are provided. We also propose a consistent estimator for the auto-regressive coefficients of this model. Due to the simplex constraints that we impose on the model coefficients, the proposed estimator that is learned under these constraints, naturally has a sparse structure. The sparsity allows the application of the proposed model in learning a graph of temporal dependency from multivariate distributional time series. We explore the numerical performances of our estimation procedure using simulated data. To shed some light on the benefits of our approach for real data analysis, we also apply this methodology to two data sets, respectively made of observations from age distribution in different countries and those from the bike sharing network in Paris.</p></details> |  |

While this is largely true for language and vision foundation models, we argue that the inherent diversity of time series data makes them less suited for building effective foundation models. We demonstrate this using forecasting as our downstream task. We show that the zero-shot capabilities of a time series foundation model are significantly influenced and tied to the specific domains it has been pretrained on. Furthermore, when applied to unseen real-world time series data, fine-tuned foundation models do not consistently yield substantially better results, relative to their increased parameter count and memory footprint, than smaller, dedicated models tailored to the specific forecasting task at hand.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on Recent Advances in Time Series Foundation Models (BERT2S)</p></details> |

However, their robustness to continual adaptation remains underexplored. In this work, we investigate the extent to which TSFMs suffer from catastrophic forgetting when fine-tuned sequentially on multiple datasets. Using synthetic datasets designed with varying degrees of periodic structure, we measure the trade-off between adaptation to new data and retention of prior knowledge. Our experiments reveal that, while fine-tuning improves performance on new tasks, it often causes significant degradation on previously learned ones, illustrating a fundamental stability-plasticity dilemma.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural non-canonical Hamiltonian dynamics for long-time simulations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01788v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work focuses on learning non-canonical Hamiltonian dynamics from data, where long-term predictions require the preservation of structure both in the learned model and in numerical schemes. Previous research focused on either facet, respectively with a potential-based architecture and with degenerate variational integrators, but new issues arise when combining both. In experiments, the learnt model is sometimes numerically unstable due to the gauge dependency of the scheme, rendering long-time simulations impossible. In this paper, we identify this problem and propose two different training strategies to address it, either by directly learning the vector field or by learning a time-discrete dynamics through the scheme. Several numerical test cases assess the ability of the methods to learn complex physical dynamics, like the guiding center from gyrokinetic plasma physics.</p></details> |  |
| **[IndexNet: Timestamp and Variable-Aware Modeling for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23813v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) plays a vital role in a wide range of real-world applications, such as weather prediction and traffic flow forecasting. Although recent advances have significantly improved the modeling of temporal dynamics and inter-variable dependencies, most existing methods overlook index-related descriptive information, such as timestamps and variable indices, which carry rich contextual semantics. To unlock the potential of such information and take advantage of the lightweight and powerful periodic capture ability of MLP-based architectures, we propose IndexNet, an MLP-based framework augmented with an Index Embedding (IE) module. The IE module consists of two key components: Timestamp Embedding (TE) and Channel Embedding (CE). Specifically, TE transforms timestamps into embedding vectors and injects them into the input sequence, thereby improving the model's ability to capture long-term complex periodic patterns. In parallel, CE assigns each variable a unique and trainable identity embedding based on its index, allowing the model to explicitly distinguish between heterogeneous variables and avoid homogenized predictions when input sequences seem close. Extensive experiments on 12 diverse real-world datasets demonstrate that IndexNet achieves comparable performance across mainstream baselines, validating the effectiveness of our temporally and variably aware design. Moreover, plug-and-play experiments and visualization analyses further reveal that IndexNet exhibits strong generality and interpretability, two aspects that remain underexplored in current MTSF research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Finite-Time Bounds for Distributionally Robust TD Learning with Linear Function Approximation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01721v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distributionally robust reinforcement learning (DRRL) focuses on designing policies that achieve good performance under model uncertainties. In particular, we are interested in maximizing the worst-case long-term discounted reward, where the data for RL comes from a nominal model while the deployed environment can deviate from the nominal model within a prescribed uncertainty set. Existing convergence guarantees for robust temporal-difference (TD) learning for policy evaluation are limited to tabular MDPs or are dependent on restrictive discount-factor assumptions when function approximation is used. We present the first robust TD learning with linear function approximation, where robustness is measured with respect to the total-variation distance and Wasserstein-l distance uncertainty set. Additionally, our algorithm is both model-free and does not require generative access to the MDP. Our algorithm combines a two-time-scale stochastic-approximation update with an outer-loop target-network update. We establish an $\tilde{O}(1/\epsilon^2)$ sample complexity to obtain an $\epsilon$-accurate value estimate. Our results close a key gap between the empirical success of robust RL algorithms and the non-asymptotic guarantees enjoyed by their non-robust counterparts. The key ideas in the paper also extend in a relatively straightforward fashion to robust Q-learning with function approximation.</p></details> | Preprint. 32 Pages |

When considering 51 distinct particle sizes, these curves form a high-dimensional functional time series observed over equally spaced and densely sampled grids. While high dimensionality poses statistical challenges due to the curse of dimensionality, it also offers a rich source of information that enables detailed analysis of temporal variation across short time intervals for all particle sizes. To model this complexity, we propose a multilevel functional time series framework incorporating a functional factor model to facilitate one-day-ahead forecasting. To quantify forecast uncertainty, we develop a calibration approach and a split conformal prediction approach to construct prediction intervals. Both approaches are designed to minimise the absolute difference between empirical and nominal coverage probabilities using a validation dataset. Furthermore, to improve forecast accuracy as new intraday data become available, we implement dynamic updating techniques for point and interval forecasts. The proposed methods are validated through an empirical application to hourly measurements of particulate matter in 51 size categories in London.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 11 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

This paper establishes a novel theoretical framework for time-optimal control of controllable linear systems with a single input, proposing the augmented switching law (ASL) that represents the input control and the feasibility in a compact form. Given a feasible trajectory, the perturbed trajectory under the constraints of ASL is guaranteed to be feasible, resulting in a novel state-centric necessary condition without dependence on costate information. A first-order necessary condition is proposed that the Jacobian matrix of the ASL is not of full row rank, which also results in a potential approach to optimizing a given feasible trajectory with the preservation of arc structures. The proposed necessary condition is applied to high-order chain-of-integrator systems with full box constraints, contributing to some theoretical results challenging to reason by costate-based conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by IEEE TAC</p></details> |

Two major families of methods fail in distinct ways: (i) imitation learning (IL) is reactive but lacks compositional generalization, as monolithic policies do not decide which skill to reuse when scenes change; (ii) classical task-and-motion planning (TAMP) offers compositionality but has prohibitive planning latency, preventing real-time failure recovery. We introduce SymSkill, a unified learning framework that combines the benefits of IL and TAMP, allowing compositional generalization and failure recovery in real-time. Offline, SymSkill jointly learns predicates, operators, and skills directly from unlabeled and unsegmented demonstrations. At execution time, upon specifying a conjunction of one or more learned predicates, SymSkill uses a symbolic planner to compose and reorder learned skills to achieve the symbolic goals, while performing recovery at both the motion and symbolic levels in real time. Coupled with a compliant controller, SymSkill enables safe and uninterrupted execution under human and environmental disturbances. In RoboCasa simulation, SymSkill can execute 12 single-step tasks with 85% success rate. Without additional data, it composes these skills into multi-step plans requiring up to 6 skill recompositions, recovering robustly from execution failures. On a real Franka robot, we demonstrate SymSkill, learning from 5 minutes of unsegmented and unlabeled play data, is capable of performing multiple tasks simply by goal specifications.

Our method uses two distinct losses to learn strong representations with the aim of striking an effective balance between uniformity and tolerance in the embedding space. First, TimeHUT uses a hierarchical setup to learn both instance-wise and temporal information from input time-series. Next, we integrate a temperature scheduler within the vanilla contrastive loss to balance the uniformity and tolerance characteristics of the embeddings. Additionally, a hierarchical angular margin loss enforces instance-wise and temporal contrast losses, creating geometric margins between positive and negative pairs of temporal sequences. This approach improves the coherence of positive pairs and their separation from the negatives, enhancing the capture of temporal dependencies within a time-series sample. We evaluate our approach on a wide range of tasks, namely 128 UCR and 30 UAE datasets for univariate and multivariate classification, as well as Yahoo and KPI datasets for anomaly detection. The results demonstrate that TimeHUT outperforms prior methods by considerable margins on classification, while obtaining competitive results for anomaly detection. Finally, detailed sensitivity and ablation studies are performed to evaluate different components and hyperparameters of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in Transactions on Machine Learning Research</p></details> |
| **[Rethinking Reward Models for Multi-Domain Test-Time Scaling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00492v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The reliability of large language models (LLMs) during test-time scaling is often assessed with \emph{external verifiers} or \emph{reward models} that distinguish correct reasoning from flawed logic. Prior work generally assumes that process reward models (PRMs), which score every intermediate reasoning step, outperform outcome reward models (ORMs) that assess only the final answer. This view is based mainly on evidence from narrow, math-adjacent domains. We present the first unified evaluation of four reward model variants, discriminative ORM and PRM (\DisORM, \DisPRM) and generative ORM and PRM (\GenORM, \GenPRM), across 14 diverse domains. Contrary to conventional wisdom, we find that (i) \DisORM performs on par with \DisPRM, (ii) \GenPRM is not competitive, and (iii) overall, \GenORM is the most robust, yielding significant and consistent gains across every tested domain. We attribute this to PRM-style stepwise scoring, which inherits label noise from LLM auto-labeling and has difficulty evaluating long reasoning trajectories, including those involving self-correcting reasoning. Our theoretical analysis shows that step-wise aggregation compounds errors as reasoning length grows, and our empirical observations confirm this effect. These findings challenge the prevailing assumption that fine-grained supervision is always better and support generative outcome verification for multi-domain deployment. We publicly release our code, datasets, and checkpoints at \href{https://github.com/db-Lee/Multi-RM}{\underline{\small\texttt{https://github.com/db-Lee/Multi-RM}}} to facilitate future research in multi-domain settings.</p></details> |  |

Existing online planar mapping approaches struggle to balance accuracy and computational efficiency: direct depth image segmentation from specific sensors suffers from poor temporal integration, height map-based methods cannot represent complex 3D structures like overhangs, and voxel-based plane segmentation remains unexplored for real-time applications. To address these limitations, we develop a novel framework that integrates vertex-based connected component labeling with random sample consensus based plane detection and convex hull, leveraging GPU parallel computing to rapidly extract planar regions from point clouds accumulated in high-resolution 3D voxel maps. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves fast and accurate 3D multi-plane segmentation at over 30 Hz update rate even at a resolution of 0.01 m, enabling the detected planes to be utilized in real time for locomotion tasks. Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of our approach through experiments in both simulated environments and physical legged robot platforms, confirming robust locomotion performance when considering 3D planar structures.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 12 figures, This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication.

We introduce two temporal structures, defected temporal graphs (DTGs) and weakly defected temporal graphs (WDTGs), that serve as graph-theoretic certificates linking stubborn influence and temporal connectivity to contraction of the state-transition matrix. Using these tools, we prove asymptotic stability of TVFJ dynamics under infinitely recurring DTGs, exponential stability in semi-periodic defected networks, and asymptotic stability of a trust-based extension under the weaker condition of recurring WDTGs. We also establish boundedness of the omega-limit set, showing that long-run opinions remain within the convex hull of innate beliefs, and characterize the limit set for periodically switching systems via a p-LTI decomposition with the tight bound that the size of the omega-limit set is at most p. Finally, we show that exponential stability persists under bounded perturbations, ensuring robustness in noisy or imperfect networks. These results unify algebraic contraction tests with interpretable graph-based reasoning, providing scalable and resilient tools for analyzing opinion formation in evolving social and human-AI networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Synthetic Prefixes to Mitigate Bias in Real-Time Neural Query Autocomplete](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01574v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a data-centric approach for mitigating presentation bias in real-time neural query autocomplete systems through the use of synthetic prefixes. These prefixes are generated from complete user queries collected during regular search sessions where autocomplete was not active. This allows us to enrich the training data for learning to rank models with more diverse and less biased examples. This method addresses the inherent bias in engagement signals collected from live query autocomplete interactions, where model suggestions influence user behavior. Our neural ranker is optimized for real-time deployment under strict latency constraints and incorporates a rich set of features, including query popularity, seasonality, fuzzy match scores, and contextual signals such as department affinity, device type, and vertical alignment with previous user queries. To support efficient training, we introduce a task-specific simplification of the listwise loss, reducing computational complexity from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$ by leveraging the query autocomplete structure of having only one ground-truth selection per prefix. Deployed in a large-scale e-commerce setting, our system demonstrates statistically significant improvements in user engagement, as measured by mean reciprocal rank and related metrics. Our findings show that synthetic prefixes not only improve generalization but also provide a scalable path toward bias mitigation in other low-latency ranking tasks, including related searches and query recommendations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the Proceedings of the ACM SIGIR Asia Pacific Conference on Information Retrieval (SIGIR-AP 2025), December 7-10, 2025, Xi'an, China</p></details> |

A Survey and Outlook](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11835v4)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series analysis (TSA) is a longstanding research topic in the data mining community and has wide real-world significance. Compared to "richer" modalities such as language and vision, which have recently experienced explosive development and are densely connected, the time-series modality remains relatively underexplored and isolated. We notice that many recent TSA works have formed a new research field, i.e., Multiple Modalities for TSA (MM4TSA). In general, these MM4TSA works follow a common motivation: how TSA can benefit from multiple modalities. This survey is the first to offer a comprehensive review and a detailed outlook for this emerging field. Specifically, we systematically discuss three benefits: (1) reusing foundation models of other modalities for efficient TSA, (2) multimodal extension for enhanced TSA, and (3) cross-modality interaction for advanced TSA. We further group the works by the introduced modality type, including text, images, audio, tables, and others, within each perspective. Finally, we identify the gaps with future opportunities, including the reused modalities selections, heterogeneous modality combinations, and unseen tasks generalizations, corresponding to the three benefits. We release an up-to-date GitHub repository that includes key papers and resources.</p></details> | <details><summary>Githu...</summary><p>Github Repo: https://github.com/AdityaLab/MM4TSA Updated to include papers accepted by IJCAI25, KDD25, ICML25, NeurIPS25 4 figures or tables, 19 pages, 251 references</p></details> |
| **[AI Foundation Model for Time Series with Innovations Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01560v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces an Artificial Intelligence (AI) foundation model for time series in engineering applications, where causal operations are required for real-time monitoring and control. Since engineering time series are governed by physical, rather than linguistic, laws, large-language-model-based AI foundation models may be ineffective or inefficient. Building on the classical innovations representation theory of Wiener, Kallianpur, and Rosenblatt, we propose Time Series GPT (TS-GPT) -- an innovations-representation-based Generative Pre-trained Transformer for engineering monitoring and control. As an example of foundation model adaptation, we consider Probabilistic Generative Forecasting, which produces future time series samples from conditional probability distributions given past realizations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TS-GPT in forecasting real-time locational marginal prices using historical data from U.S. independent system operators.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose a novel multi-scale time series reshape module that effectively captures cross-period patch interactions and variable dependencies. Building on this, we develop MS-DFTVNet, the multi-scale 3D deformable convolutional framework tailored for long-term forecasting. Moreover, to handle the inherently uneven distribution of temporal features, we introduce a context-aware dynamic deformable convolution mechanism, which further enhances the model's ability to capture complex temporal patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MS-DFTVNet not only significantly outperforms strong baselines but also achieves an average improvement of about 7.5% across six public datasets, setting new state-of-the-art results.</p></details> |  |
| **[MIRA: Towards Mitigating Reward Hacking in Inference-Time Alignment of T2I Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01549v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models excel at generating images conditioned on text prompts, but the resulting images often do not satisfy user-specific criteria measured by scalar rewards such as Aesthetic Scores. This alignment typically requires fine-tuning, which is computationally demanding. Recently, inference-time alignment via noise optimization has emerged as an efficient alternative, modifying initial input noise to steer the diffusion denoising process towards generating high-reward images. However, this approach suffers from reward hacking, where the model produces images that score highly, yet deviate significantly from the original prompt. We show that noise-space regularization is insufficient and that preventing reward hacking requires an explicit image-space constraint. To this end, we propose MIRA (MItigating Reward hAcking), a training-free, inference-time alignment method. MIRA introduces an image-space, score-based KL surrogate that regularizes the sampling trajectory with a frozen backbone, constraining the output distribution so reward can increase without off-distribution drift (reward hacking). We derive a tractable approximation to KL using diffusion scores. Across SDv1.5 and SDXL, multiple rewards (Aesthetic, HPSv2, PickScore), and public datasets (e.g., Animal-Animal, HPDv2), MIRA achieves >60\% win rate vs. strong baselines while preserving prompt adherence; mechanism plots show reward gains with near-zero drift, whereas DNO drifts as compute increases. We further introduce MIRA-DPO, mapping preference optimization to inference time with a frozen backbone, extending MIRA to non-differentiable rewards without fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |
| **[TimeSeriesScientist: A General-Purpose AI Agent for Time Series Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01538v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting is central to decision-making in domains as diverse as energy, finance, climate, and public health. In practice, forecasters face thousands of short, noisy series that vary in frequency, quality, and horizon, where the dominant cost lies not in model fitting, but in the labor-intensive preprocessing, validation, and ensembling required to obtain reliable predictions. Prevailing statistical and deep learning models are tailored to specific datasets or domains and generalize poorly. A general, domain-agnostic framework that minimizes human intervention is urgently in demand. In this paper, we introduce TimeSeriesScientist (TSci), the first LLM-driven agentic framework for general time series forecasting. The framework comprises four specialized agents: Curator performs LLM-guided diagnostics augmented by external tools that reason over data statistics to choose targeted preprocessing; Planner narrows the hypothesis space of model choice by leveraging multi-modal diagnostics and self-planning over the input; Forecaster performs model fitting and validation and, based on the results, adaptively selects the best model configuration as well as ensemble strategy to make final predictions; and Reporter synthesizes the whole process into a comprehensive, transparent report. With transparent natural-language rationales and comprehensive reports, TSci transforms the forecasting workflow into a white-box system that is both interpretable and extensible across tasks. Empirical results on eight established benchmarks demonstrate that TSci consistently outperforms both statistical and LLM-based baselines, reducing forecast error by an average of 10.4% and 38.2%, respectively. Moreover, TSci produces a clear and rigorous report that makes the forecasting workflow more transparent and interpretable.</p></details> |  |

This requires accurate, fine-grained carbon intensity forecasts, yet existing tools have several key limitations: (i) they require grid-specific electricity mix data, restricting use where such information is unavailable; (ii) they depend on separate grid-specific models that make it challenging to provide global coverage; and (iii) they provide forecasts without uncertainty estimates, limiting reliability for downstream carbon-aware applications. In this paper, we present CarbonX, an open-source tool that leverages Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) for a range of decarbonization tasks. CarbonX utilizes the versatility of TSFMs to provide strong performance across multiple tasks, such as carbon intensity forecasting and imputation, and across diverse grids. Using only historical carbon intensity data and a single general model, our tool achieves a zero-shot forecasting Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 15.82% across 214 grids worldwide. Across 13 benchmark grids, CarbonX performance is comparable with the current state-of-the-art, with an average MAPE of 9.59% and tail forecasting MAPE of 16.54%, while also providing prediction intervals with 95% coverage. CarbonX can provide forecasts for up to 21 days with minimal accuracy degradation. Further, when fully fine-tuned, CarbonX outperforms the statistical baselines by 1.2--3.9X on the imputation task. Overall, these results demonstrate that CarbonX can be used easily on any grid with limited data and still deliver strong performance, making it a practical tool for global-scale decarbonization.</p></details> |  |

These random disturbances can render deterministic guarantees inapplicable and cause catastrophic safety failures. To overcome this, this paper proposes a method for designing safe controllers for discrete-time stochastic systems that retain probabilistic guarantees of safety. To do this we modify the traditional notion of a control barrier function (CBF) to explicitly account for these stochastic uncertainties and call these new modified functions probabilistic CBFs. We show that probabilistic CBFs can be used to design controllers that guarantee safety over a finite number of time steps with a prescribed probability. Next, by leveraging various uncertainty quantification methods, such as concentration inequalities, the scenario approach, and conformal prediction, we provide a variety of sufficient conditions that result in computationally tractable controllers with tunable probabilistic guarantees across a plethora of practical scenarios. Finally, we showcase the applicability of our results in simulation and hardware for the control of a quadruped robot.</p></details> |  |
| **[Local Linear Attention: An Optimal Interpolation of Linear and Softmax Attention For Test-Time Regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01450v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer architectures have achieved remarkable success in various domains. While efficient alternatives to Softmax Attention have been widely studied, the search for more expressive mechanisms grounded in theoretical insight-even at greater computational cost-has been relatively underexplored. In this work, we bridge this gap by proposing Local Linear Attention (LLA), a novel attention mechanism derived from nonparametric statistics through the lens of test-time regression. First, we show that LLA offers theoretical advantages over Linear and Softmax Attention for associative memory via a bias-variance trade-off analysis. Next, we address its computational challenges and propose two memory-efficient primitives to tackle the $\Theta(n^2 d)$ and $\Theta(n d^2)$ complexity. We then introduce FlashLLA, a hardware-efficient, blockwise algorithm that enables scalable and parallel computation on modern accelerators. In addition, we implement and profile a customized inference kernel that significantly reduces memory overheads. Finally, we empirically validate the advantages and limitations of LLA on test-time regression, in-context regression, associative recall and state tracking tasks. Experiment results demonstrate that LLA effectively adapts to non-stationarity, outperforming strong baselines in test-time training and in-context learning, and exhibiting promising evidence for its scalability and applicability in large-scale models.

| **[NeuroTTT: Bridging Pretraining-Downstream Task Misalignment in EEG Foundation Models via Test-Time Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26301v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale foundation models for EEG signals offer a promising path to generalizable brain-computer interface (BCI) applications, but they often suffer from misalignment between pretraining objectives and downstream tasks, as well as significant cross-subject distribution shifts. This paper addresses these challenges by introducing a two-stage alignment strategy that bridges the gap between generic pretraining and specific EEG decoding tasks. First, we propose NeuroTTT: a domain-specific self-supervised fine-tuning paradigm that augments the foundation model with task-relevant self-supervised objectives, aligning latent representations to important spectral, spatial, and temporal EEG features without requiring additional labeled data. Second, we incorporate test-time training (TTT) at inference, we perform (i) self-supervised test-time training on individual unlabeled test samples and (ii) prediction entropy minimization (Tent), which updates only normalization statistics to continually calibrate the model to each new input on the fly. Our approach, which, to our knowledge, is the first to unify domain-tuned self-supervision with test-time training in large-scale EEG foundation models, yields substantially improved robustness and accuracy across diverse BCI tasks (imagined speech, stress detection, motor imagery). Using CBraMod and LaBraM as backbones, our method pushes their performance to a markedly higher level. Results on three diverse tasks demonstrate that the proposed alignment strategy achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming conventional fine-tuning and adaptation methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/wsl2000/NeuroTTT.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimal Stopping vs Best-of-$N$ for Inference Time Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01394v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) generation often requires balancing output quality against inference cost, especially when using multiple generations. We introduce a new framework for inference-time optimization based on the classical Pandora's Box problem. Viewing each generation as opening a costly "box" with random reward, we develop algorithms that decide when to stop generating without knowing the underlying reward distribution. Our first contribution is a UCB-style Pandora's Box algorithm, which achieves performance that is provably close to Weitzman's algorithm, the optimal strategy when the distribution is known. We further adapt this method to practical LLM settings by addressing reward scaling across prompts via a Bradley-Terry inspired transformation. This leads to an adaptive inference-time optimization method that normalizes rewards and learns stopping thresholds on the fly. Experiments on the AlpacaFarm and HH-RLHF datasets, using multiple LLM-reward model pairs, show that our adaptive strategy can obtain the same performance as non-adaptive Best-of-N sampling while requiring 15-35 percent fewer generations on average. Our results establish a principled bridge between optimal stopping theory and inference-time scaling, providing both theoretical performance bounds and practical efficiency gains for LLM deployment.</p></details> | 24 pages |

We present \textbf{INSIGHT}, a learning framework for leveraging token-level uncertainty signals to predict when a VLA should request help. Using $\pi_0$-FAST as the underlying model, we extract per-token \emph{entropy}, \emph{log-probability}, and Dirichlet-based estimates of \emph{aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty}, and train compact transformer classifiers to map these sequences to help triggers. We explore supervision regimes for strong or weak supervision, and extensively compare them across in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks. Our results show a trade-off: strong labels enable models to capture fine-grained uncertainty dynamics for reliable help detection, while weak labels, though noisier, still support competitive introspection when training and evaluation are aligned, offering a scalable path when dense annotation is impractical. Crucially, we find that modeling the temporal evolution of token-level uncertainty signals with transformers provides far greater predictive power than static sequence-level scores. This study provides the first systematic evaluation of uncertainty-based introspection in VLAs, opening future avenues for active learning and for real-time error mitigation through selective human intervention.</p></details> |  |

These limitations can be sensitive to unmodelled disturbances acting on the robot. Inspired by a factor-graph optimization paradigm, this work introduces a continuous-time stochastic state estimation framework for continuum robots. We introduce factors based on continuous-time kinematics that are corrupted by a white noise Gaussian process (GP). By using a simple robot model paired with high-rate sensing, we show adaptability to unmodelled external forces and data dropout. The result contains an estimate of the mean and covariance for the robot's pose, velocity, and strain, each of which can be interpolated continuously in time or space. This same interpolation scheme can be used during estimation, allowing for inclusion of measurements on states that are not explicitly estimated. Our method's inherent sparsity leads to a linear solve complexity with respect to time and interpolation queries in constant time. We demonstrate our method on a CR with gyroscope and pose sensors, highlighting its versatility in real-world systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 11 figures.

| **[Kapitza-Inspired Stabilization of Non-Foster Circuits via Time Modulations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12976v3)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With his formal analysis in 1951, the physicist Pyotr Kapitza demonstrated that an inverted pendulum with an externally vibrating base can be stable in its upper position, thus overcoming the force of gravity. Kapitza's work is an example that an originally unstable system can become stable after a minor perturbation of its properties or initial conditions is applied. Inspired by his ideas, we show how non-Foster circuits can be stabilized with the application of external \textit{electrical vibration}, i.e., time modulations. Non-Foster circuits are highly appreciated in the engineering community since their bandwidth characteristics are not limited by passive-circuits bounds. Unfortunately, non-Foster circuits are usually unstable and they must be stabilized prior to operation. Here, we focus on the study of non-Foster $L(t)C$ circuits with time-varying inductors and time-invariant negative capacitors. We find an intrinsic connection between Kapitza's inverted pendulum and non-Foster $L(t)C$ resonators. Moreover, we show how positive time-varying modulations of $L(t)>0$ can overcome and stabilize non-Foster negative capacitances $C<0$. These findings open up an alternative manner of stabilizing electric circuits with the use of time modulations, and lay the groundwork for application of, what we coin \textit{Vibrational Electromagnetics}, in more complex media.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages (7 pages main text, 2 pages supplementary materials), 4 figures; a minor issue in Fig. 3(a) is corrected.

| **[Autoregressive Adversarial Post-Training for Real-Time Interactive Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09350v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing large-scale video generation models are computationally intensive, preventing adoption in real-time and interactive applications. In this work, we propose autoregressive adversarial post-training (AAPT) to transform a pre-trained latent video diffusion model into a real-time, interactive video generator. Our model autoregressively generates a latent frame at a time using a single neural function evaluation (1NFE). The model can stream the result to the user in real time and receive interactive responses as controls to generate the next latent frame. Unlike existing approaches, our method explores adversarial training as an effective paradigm for autoregressive generation. This not only allows us to design an architecture that is more efficient for one-step generation while fully utilizing the KV cache, but also enables training the model in a student-forcing manner that proves to be effective in reducing error accumulation during long video generation. Our experiments demonstrate that our 8B model achieves real-time, 24fps, streaming video generation at 736x416 resolution on a single H100, or 1280x720 on 8xH100 up to a minute long (1440 frames).

Central to our approach is an encoder model that transforms audio signals into latent facial expression sequences in real time, which are then decoded as photorealistic 3D facial avatars. Leveraging the generative capabilities of diffusion models, we capture the rich spectrum of facial expressions necessary for natural communication while achieving real-time performance (<15ms GPU time). Our novel architecture minimizes latency through two key innovations: an online transformer that eliminates dependency on future inputs and a distillation pipeline that accelerates iterative denoising into a single step. We further address critical design challenges in live scenarios for processing continuous audio signals frame-by-frame while maintaining consistent animation quality. The versatility of our framework extends to multimodal applications, including semantic modalities such as emotion conditions and multimodal sensors with head-mounted eye cameras on VR headsets. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in facial animation accuracy over existing offline state-of-the-art baselines, achieving 100 to 1000 times faster inference speed. We validate our approach through live VR demonstrations and across various scenarios such as multilingual speeches.</p></details> | <details><summary>SIGGR...</summary><p>SIGGRAPH Asia 2025.

However, real-world data is limited despite its quantity, quality, and variety. The data shortage of various financial assets directly hinders the performance of machine learning models designed to trade and invest in these assets. Generative methods can mitigate this shortage. In this paper, we introduce a set of novel techniques for time series data generation (we name them Fiaingen) and assess their performance across three criteria: (a) overlap of real-world and synthetic data on a reduced dimensionality space, (b) performance on downstream machine learning tasks, and (c) runtime performance. Our experiments demonstrate that the methods achieve state-of-the-art performance across the three criteria listed above. Synthetic data generated with Fiaingen methods more closely mirrors the original time series data while keeping data generation time close to seconds - ensuring the scalability of the proposed approach. Furthermore, models trained on it achieve performance close to those trained with real-world data.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches typically require robustness conditions of the entire network to guarantee resilient consensus. However, the behavior of such systems when these conditions are not fully met remains unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce the notion of partial leader-follower consensus, in which a subset of non-adversarial followers successfully tracks the leader's reference state despite insufficient robustness. We propose a novel distributed algorithm - the Bootstrap Percolation and Mean Subsequence Reduced (BP-MSR) algorithm - and establish sufficient conditions for individual followers to achieve consensus via the BP-MSR algorithm in arbitrary time-varying graphs. We validate our findings through simulations, demonstrating that our method guarantees partial leader-follower consensus, even when standard resilient consensus algorithms fail.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, Submitted to American Control Conference (ACC) 2026</p></details> |

We introduce Ivy, a novel BWE method that leverages offline meta-learning to combat data drift and maximize user Quality of Experience (QoE). Our approach dynamically selects the most suitable BWE algorithm for current network conditions, enabling effective adaptation to changing environments without requiring live network interactions. We implemented our method in Microsoft Teams and demonstrated that Ivy can enhance QoE by 5.9% to 11.2% over individual BWE algorithms and by 6.3% to 11.4% compared to existing online meta heuristics. Additionally, we show that our method is more data efficient compared to online meta-learning methods, achieving up to 21% improvement in QoE while requiring significantly less training data.</p></details> | 6 pages |

Advances in robot performance have increased the hopping height to greater than 4 meters and opened up the possibility for more complex aerial trajectories (i.e., behaviors). However, currently hopping robots do not directly control their aerial trajectory or transition to flight, eliminating the efficiency benefits of a hopping system. Here we show a real-time, computationally efficiency, non-linear drag compensated, trajectory generation methodology and accompanying Lyapunov-based controller. The combined system can create and follow complex aerial trajectories from liftoff to touchdown on horizontal and vertical surfaces, while maintaining strick control over the orientation at touchdown. The computational efficiency provides broad applicability across all size scales of hopping robots while maintaining applicability to quadrotors in general.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Dynamic Pacing for Real-time Satellite Traffic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09798v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Google's congestion control (GCC) has become a cornerstone for real-time video and audio communication, yet its performance remains fragile in emerging Low Earth Orbit (LEO) networks. In this paper, we study the behavior of videoconferencing systems in LEO constellations. We observe that video quality degrades due to inherent delays and network instability introduced by the high altitude and rapid movement of LEO satellites, with these effects exacerbated by WebRTC's conventional "one-size-fits-all" sender-side pacing queue management. To address these challenges, we introduce a data-driven queue management mechanism that tunes the maximum pacing queue capacity based on predicted handover activity, minimizing latency during no-handover periods and prioritizing stability when entering periods of increased handover activity. Our method yields up to 3x improvements in video bitrate and reduces freeze rate by 62% in emulation, while delivering up to a 41% reduction in freeze rate and 40% decrease in mean packet loss on real Starlink constellations compared to WebRTC's default pacing queue policy.</p></details> | 6 pages |
| **[Eliciting Chain-of-Thought Reasoning for Time Series Analysis using Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01116v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Complex numerical time series analysis often demands multi-step reasoning capabilities beyond current models' reach. Tasks like medical diagnosis and weather forecasting require sequential reasoning processes -- including counterfactual analysis, logical deduction, knowledge application, and multi-modal contextual integration -- that existing time series models cannot explicitly perform. While recent research has shown large language models (LLMs) can achieve sophisticated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning through reinforcement learning (RL), these advances have primarily focused on mathematical and coding domains, with LLMs still demonstrating poor performance on time series tasks. We introduce Chain Of thought for Understanding Numerical Time Series (COUNTS), the first framework that trains LLMs to perform CoT reasoning across diverse time series tasks using RL with verifiable rewards. Our approach employs a Residual Vector-Quantized VAE to create high-fidelity discrete tokens that seamlessly integrate into a pre-trained LLM's vocabulary. COUNTS undergoes a two-stage training process: first, supervised fine-tuning on time series analysis tasks to master our novel representations, followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization training on verifiable problems using prompting strategies that encourage explicit reasoning steps before producing final answers. Our experiments demonstrate that this RL-driven approach with intermediate CoT reasoning significantly enhances LLM performance across various time series analysis tasks, opening new possibilities for complex temporal data reasoning.</p></details> |  |

Here we present quantum algorithms for parallel-in-time simulations that are inspired by the Page and Wootters formalism. In this framework, and thus in our algorithms, the classical time-variable of quantum mechanics is promoted to the quantum realm by introducing a Hilbert space of ``clock'' qubits which are then entangled with the ``system'' qubits. We show that our algorithms can compute temporal properties over $N$ different times of many-body systems by only using $\log(N)$ clock qubits. As such, we achieve an exponential trade-off between time and spatial complexities. In addition, we rigorously prove that the entanglement created between the system qubits and the clock qubits has operational meaning, as it encodes valuable information about the system's dynamics. We also provide a circuit depth estimation of all the protocols, showing a running time advantage in computation times over traditional sequential-in-time algorithms. In particular, for the case when the dynamics are determined by the Aubry--Andre model, we present a hybrid method for which our algorithms have a depth that only scales as $\mathcal{O}(\log(N)n)$. As a by-product, we can relate the previous schemes to the problem of equilibration of an isolated quantum system, thus indicating that our framework enables a new dimension for studying dynamical properties of many-body systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>26+14...</summary><p>26+14 pages, 19+3 figures; final version</p></details> |
| **[Augmenting LLMs for General Time Series Understanding and Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01111v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series data is fundamental to decision-making in many crucial domains including healthcare, finance, and environmental science. However, analyzing this data often requires incorporating unstructured contextual information, answering domain-specific questions, and generating natural language explanations -- capabilities that traditional time series models lack due to their inability to process text. While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at contextual reasoning and knowledge integration, they struggle with numerical time series due to inefficient text-based representations and limited exposure to temporal data during pretraining. We address this gap by augmenting an LLM with specialized time series perception through a patch-based encoder-decoder architecture. We train this Time Series-augmented LLM (TsLLM) on a large corpus of over 2 million interleaved time series and text examples spanning diverse analysis tasks: forecasting with contextual information, time series question-answering, pattern explanation, classification with natural language outputs, and report generation. This training enables TsLLM to leverage both its language understanding and newly acquired temporal reasoning capabilities. While not designed to surpass specialized models on traditional benchmarks, TsLLM demonstrates strong performance on tasks requiring the integration of time series analysis with natural language -- capabilities that existing approaches cannot provide. Our work establishes a new paradigm for time series analysis that bridges numerical computation and natural language understanding, democratizing access to sophisticated temporal reasoning through natural language interaction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hybrid Predictive Modeling of Malaria Incidence in the Amhara Region, Ethiopia: Integrating Multi-Output Regression and Time-Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01302v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Malaria remains a major public health concern in Ethiopia, particularly in the Amhara Region, where seasonal and unpredictable transmission patterns make prevention and control challenging. Accurately forecasting malaria outbreaks is essential for effective resource allocation and timely interventions. This study proposes a hybrid predictive modeling framework that combines time-series forecasting, multi-output regression, and conventional regression-based prediction to forecast the incidence of malaria. Environmental variables, past malaria case data, and demographic information from Amhara Region health centers were used to train and validate the models. The multi-output regression approach enables the simultaneous prediction of multiple outcomes, including Plasmodium species-specific cases, temporal trends, and spatial variations, whereas the hybrid framework captures both seasonal patterns and correlations among predictors. The proposed model exhibits higher prediction accuracy than single-method approaches, exposing hidden patterns and providing valuable information to public health authorities. This study provides a valid and repeatable malaria incidence prediction framework that can support evidence-based decision-making, targeted interventions, and resource optimization in endemic areas.</p></details> |  |

We employ a standard finite-difference method for spatial discretization coupled with diagonally implicit Runge-Kutta temporal schemes. The discrete equation is a generalized Sylvester equation (GSE), which we solve with an adaptive-rank algorithm structured around three key strategies: {(i) constructing dimension-wise subspaces based on an extended Krylov strategy, (ii) developing an effective preconditioner for the reduced coefficient matrix, and (iii) efficiently computing the residual of the equation without explicitly reverting to the full-rank form. {The low-rank decomposition is performed in 2D using SVD, and with high-order SVD (HOSVD) in 3D to represent the tensor in a compressed Tucker format.} The computational complexity of the proposed approach {is demonstrated numerically to} be comparable to the constant-coefficient case [El Kahza et al, J. Comput. Phys., 518 (2024)], scaling as $\mathcal{O}(N {r^2} + {r^{d+1}})$ for $d$-dimensional problems (here, $d = 2$ or $3$), with $N$ the resolution in one dimension and $r$ the maximal rank during the Krylov iteration (which we find to be largely independent of $N$). We present numerical examples that illustrate the computational efficacy and complexity of our algorithm.}</p></details> |  |
| **[Compose Your Policies! Improving Diffusion-based or Flow-based Robot Policies via Test-time Distribution-level Composition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01068v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based models for robotic control, including vision-language-action (VLA) and vision-action (VA) policies, have demonstrated significant capabilities. Yet their advancement is constrained by the high cost of acquiring large-scale interaction datasets. This work introduces an alternative paradigm for enhancing policy performance without additional model training. Perhaps surprisingly, we demonstrate that the composed policies can exceed the performance of either parent policy. Our contribution is threefold. First, we establish a theoretical foundation showing that the convex composition of distributional scores from multiple diffusion models can yield a superior one-step functional objective compared to any individual score. A Gr\"onwall-type bound is then used to show that this single-step improvement propagates through entire generation trajectories, leading to systemic performance gains. Second, motivated by these results, we propose General Policy Composition (GPC), a training-free method that enhances performance by combining the distributional scores of multiple pre-trained policies via a convex combination and test-time search. GPC is versatile, allowing for the plug-and-play composition of heterogeneous policies, including VA and VLA models, as well as those based on diffusion or flow-matching, irrespective of their input visual modalities. Third, we provide extensive empirical validation. Experiments on Robomimic, PushT, and RoboTwin benchmarks, alongside real-world robotic evaluations, confirm that GPC consistently improves performance and adaptability across a diverse set of tasks. Further analysis of alternative composition operators and weighting strategies offers insights into the mechanisms underlying the success of GPC. These results establish GPC as a simple yet effective method for improving control performance by leveraging existing policies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://sagecao1125.github.io/GPC-Site/</p></details> |

Existing discrete-time CBF formulations typically require the construction of auxiliary barrier functions when the relative degree is greater than one, which complicates implementation and may yield conservative safe sets. The proposed PCBF framework addresses this challenge by extending the prediction horizon to construct a CBF for an associated system with relative degree one. As a result, the superlevel set of the PCBF coincides with the safe set, simplifying constraint enforcement and eliminating the need for auxiliary functions. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated on a discrete-time double integrator with input delay and a bicopter system with position constraints.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, submitted to ACC 2026</p></details> |

During the game, agents use parametrized and differentiable policies that depend on the current state and the policy parameters of other agents. During training, agents update their policy parameters following stochastic gradients. The gradient estimation involves two consecutive episodes, generating unbiased estimators of reward and policy score functions. In addition, it involves keeping estimates of others' parameters using consensus steps given local estimates received through a time-varying communication network. In Markov potential games, there exists a potential value function among agents with gradients corresponding to the gradients of local value functions. Using this structure, we prove almost sure convergence to a stationary point of the potential value function with rate $O(1/\epsilon^2)$. Compared to previous works, our results do not require bounded policy gradients or initial agreement on the values of individual policy parameters. Numerical experiments on a dynamic multi-agent newsvendor problem verify the convergence of local beliefs and gradients. It further shows that networked policy gradient play converges as fast as independent policy gradient updates, while collecting higher rewards.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, extended journal version</p></details> |

The variant MB-ESO extends the MB-ESO to address cases where the disturbance gain matrix is non-diagonal. Leveraging the connection between the variant MB-ESO and the well-known unknown input observer (UIO), the condition for the existence of a MB-ESO and its variant in multivariable systems is established, for the first time, i.e., no invariant zeros exist between the disturbances and the plant outputs. It is shown that, with the observer eigenvalues all placed at the origin and the subsystems decoupled, the variant MB-ESO produces the identical disturbance estimation as that of UIO. Moreover, the error characteristics of MB-ESO and its variant are analyzed and the transfer functions associated with the disturbance estimation errors are derived. It is demonstrated both mathematically and in simulations that the disturbance estimation error of MB-ESO decreases monotonically with respect to both the observer eigenvalues and time.</p></details> |  |

However, their potential swarm charging in depots may deteriorate operation of the power system, further in turn affecting EAMoD system's optimal operation. To prevent this latent risk, we develop a real-time coordination framework for the EAMoD system and the power system. First, the temporal-spatial characteristics of EAMoD fleets are fully described based on a Markov decision process model, including serving trips, repositioning, and charging. Second, charger accessibility of EAMoD depot charging is well modeled as real-world configuration, wherein fast and slow charge piles are both included. Third, the power system regulation model provides real-time charging regulation constraints for EAMoD systems to prevent potential overload and undervoltage. To address the poor solution quality attributed to the complex decision space of the EAMoD system, this paper proposes a piecewise linear-based approximate dynamic programming algorithm combined with model predictive control. Numerical experiments in the Manhattan and a 14-node power distribution network validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and underscore the necessity of system coordination.</p></details> |  |
| **[Test-Time Search in Neural Graph Coarsening Procedures for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00958v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The identification of valid inequalities, such as the rounded capacity inequalities (RCIs), is a key component of cutting plane methods for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). While a deep learning-based separation method can learn to find high-quality cuts, our analysis reveals that the model produces fewer cuts than expected because it is insufficiently sensitive to generate a diverse set of generated subsets. This paper proposes an alternative: enhancing the performance of a trained model at inference time through a new test-time search with stochasticity. First, we introduce stochastic edge selection into the graph coarsening procedure, replacing the previously proposed greedy approach. Second, we propose the Graph Coarsening History-based Partitioning (GraphCHiP) algorithm, which leverages coarsening history to identify not only RCIs but also, for the first time, the Framed capacity inequalities (FCIs). Experiments on randomly generated CVRP instances demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in reducing the dual gap compared to the existing neural separation method. Additionally, our method discovers effective FCIs on a specific instance, despite the challenging nature of identifying such cuts.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present new statistical methods for estimating the reproduction number based on the popular model of \citet{cori2013new} which defines the effective reproduction number based on self-exciting dynamics of new infections. Such a model is conceptually simple and less susceptible to misspecifications than more complicated multi-compartment models. However, statistical inference is challenging, and the previous literature has either relied on proxy data and/or a two-step approach in which the number of infections are first estimated. In contrast, we present a coherent Bayesian method that approximates the joint posterior of daily new infections and reproduction numbers using a novel Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. Comparing our method to the state-of-the-art three-step estimation procedure of \citet{huisman2022estimation}, both using daily confirmed cases from Switzerland in the Covid-19 epidemic and simulated data, we find that our method is more accurate in terms of point estimates and uncertainty quantification, especially near the beginning and end of an observation period.</p></details> |  |
| **[Introducing Large Language Models into the Design Flow of Time Sensitive Networking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26368v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing demand for real-time, safety-critical systems has significantly increased both the adoption and complexity of Time Sensitive Networking (TSN). Configuring an optimized TSN network is highly challenging, requiring careful planning, design, verification, validation, and deployment. Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong capabilities in solving complex tasks, positioning them as promising candidates for automating end-to-end TSN deployment, referred to as TSN orchestration. This paper outlines the steps involved in TSN orchestration and the associated challenges. To assess the capabilities of existing LLM models, we conduct an initial proof-of-concept case study focused on TSN configuration across multiple models. Building on these insights, we propose an LLM-assisted orchestration framework. Unlike prior research on LLMs in computer networks, which has concentrated on general configuration and management, TSN-specific orchestration has not yet been investigated. We present the building blocks for automating TSN using LLMs, describe the proposed pipeline, and analyze opportunities and limitations for real-world deployment. Finally, we highlight key challenges and research directions, including the development of TSN-focused datasets, standardized benchmark suites, and the integration of external tools such as Network Calculus (NC) engines and simulators. This work provides the first roadmap toward assessing the feasibility of LLM-assisted TSN orchestration.</p></details> |  |

While PRMs have been extensively studied in text-based domains, their extension to Vision Language Models (VLMs) remains limited. Existing Vision-Language PRMs (VL-PRMs) rely on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for data construction, which can often produce noisy supervision signals and limit generalization across tasks. In this work, we aim to elucidate the design space of VL-PRMs by exploring diverse strategies for dataset construction, training, and test-time scaling. First, we introduce a hybrid data synthesis framework that combines MCTS with judgments from a strong VLM, producing more accurate step-level labels. Second, we propose perception-focused supervision, enabling our PRM to explicitly detect errors at the visual grounding stage of reasoning. Third, we systematically evaluate multiple test-time scaling strategies, showing that our PRMs can reliably guide VLMs toward more accurate solutions. Our experiments covering five diverse multimodal benchmarks (MMMU, PuzzleVQA, AlgoPuzzleVQA, MathVista, and MathVision) reveal several key insights: (i) VL-PRMs when used as Outcome Reward Models (ORMs) during test-time scaling (TTS) can outperform VL-PRM guided process step selection, (ii) smaller VL-PRMs can match or even surpass larger ones in detecting process errors, (iii) VL-PRMs uncover latent reasoning abilities in stronger VLM backbones, (iv) perception-level supervision leads to significant gains in test-time scaling, and (v) TTS performance of different policies improve on advanced math reasoning datasets despite not training VL-PRMs on such datasets. We hope our work will motivate further research and support the advancement of VLMs.</p></details> |  |

The goal of online monitoring is to determine the satisfaction or violation of a specification during runtime, i.e., based on finite execution prefixes. However, not every specification is amenable to monitoring, e.g., properties for which no finite execution can witness satisfaction or violation. Monitorability is the question of whether a given specification is amenable to monitoring, and has been extensively studied in discrete time. Here, we study the monitorability problem for real-time properties expressed as Timed Automata. For specifications given by deterministic Timed Muller Automata, we prove decidability while we show that the problem is undecidable for specifications given by nondeterministic Timed B\"uchi automata. Furthermore, we refine monitorability to also determine bounds on the number of events as well as the time that must pass before monitoring the property may yield an informative verdict.

| **[Automated flood detection from Sentinel-1 GRD time series using Bayesian analysis for change point problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19526v3)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)-based flood detection methods face critical limitations that hinder operational deployment. Supervised learning approaches require extensive labeled training data, exhibit poor geographical transferability, and may fail to adapt to new regions without additional training examples. Existing approaches do not fully exploit the rich temporal information available in SAR time series, instead relying on simple change detection between pre- and post-flood images or supplementary datasets that often introduce error propagation. These limitations prevent effective automated flood monitoring in data-scarce regions where disaster response is most needed. To address these limitations, we develop a novel training-free approach by adapting Bayesian analysis for change point problems, specifically for automated flood detection from Sentinel-1 Ground Range Detected time series data. Our method statistically models the temporal behavior of SAR backscatter intensity over a one-year baseline period, then computes the posterior probability of change points at flood observation dates. This approach eliminates supervised learning dependencies by using Bayesian inference to identify when backscatter deviations exceed expected normal variations, leveraging inherent statistical properties of time series data. Validation across three diverse geographical contexts using the UrbanSARFloods benchmark dataset demonstrates superior performance compared to conventional thresholding and deep learning approaches, achieving F1 scores up to 0.76. This enables immediate deployment to any region with SAR coverage, providing critical advantages for disaster response.</p></details> | 17 pages, 6 figures |

Recently, implicit neural representation (INR) has been applied to video restoration, representing videos as implicit fields that can be decoded at an arbitrary scale. However, existing INR-based C-STVSR methods typically rely on only two frames as input, leading to insufficient inter-frame motion information. Consequently, they struggle to capture fast, complex motion and long-term dependencies (spanning more than three frames), hindering their performance in dynamic scenes. In this paper, we propose a novel C-STVSR framework, named HR-INR, which captures both holistic dependencies and regional motions based on INR. It is assisted by an event camera -- a novel sensor renowned for its high temporal resolution and low latency. To fully utilize the rich temporal information from events, we design a feature extraction consisting of (1) a regional event feature extractor -- taking events as inputs via the proposed event temporal pyramid representation to capture the regional nonlinear motion and (2) a holistic event-frame feature extractor for long-term dependence and continuity motion. We then propose a novel INR-based decoder with spatiotemporal embeddings to capture long-term dependencies with a larger temporal perception field. We validate the effectiveness and generalization of our method on four datasets (both simulated and real data), showing the superiority of our method.

However, these models frequently lack fine-grained temporal control, meaning they do not allow users to specify when particular visual elements should appear within a generated sequence. In this work, we introduce TempoControl, a method that allows for temporal alignment of visual concepts during inference, without requiring retraining or additional supervision. TempoControl utilizes cross-attention maps, a key component of text-to-video diffusion models, to guide the timing of concepts through a novel optimization approach. Our method steers attention using three complementary principles: aligning its temporal shape with a control signal (via correlation), amplifying it where visibility is needed (via energy), and maintaining spatial focus (via entropy). TempoControl allows precise control over timing while ensuring high video quality and diversity. We demonstrate its effectiveness across various video generation applications, including temporal reordering for single and multiple objects, as well as action and audio-aligned generation.</p></details> | Under Review |

Previous supervised approaches rely heavily on costly manual annotations, while LiDAR sequences naturally capture temporal motion cues that can be leveraged for self-supervised learning. In this paper, we propose Temporal Overlapping Prediction (TOP), a self-supervised pre-training method that alleviate the labeling burden for MOS. TOP explores the temporal overlapping points that commonly observed by current and adjacent scans, and learns spatiotemporal representations by predicting the occupancy states of temporal overlapping points. Moreover, we utilize current occupancy reconstruction as an auxiliary pre-training objective, which enhances the current structural awareness of the model. We conduct extensive experiments and observe that the conventional metric Intersection-over-Union (IoU) shows strong bias to objects with more scanned points, which might neglect small or distant objects. To compensate for this bias, we introduce an additional metric called mIoU_obj to evaluate object-level performance. Experiments on nuScenes and SemanticKITTI show that TOPoutperforms both supervised training-from-scratch baseline and other self-supervised pre-training baselines by up to 28.77% relative improvement, demonstrating strong transferability across LiDAR setups and generalization to other tasks. Code and pre-trained models will be publicly available upon publication.</p></details> |  |

While challenging, reconstructing their temporal evolution to decipher underlying dynamic properties is of major interest to scientific research. Existing approaches enable data transport along a temporal axis but are poorly scalable in high dimension and require restrictive assumptions to be met. To address these issues, we propose \textit{\textbf{Multi-Marginal temporal Schr\"odinger Bridge Matching}} (\textbf{MMtSBM}) \textit{for video generation from unpaired data}, extending the theoretical guarantees and empirical efficiency of Diffusion Schr\"odinger Bridge Matching (arXiv:archive/2303.16852) by deriving the Iterative Markovian Fitting algorithm to multiple marginals in a novel factorized fashion. Experiments show that MMtSBM retains theoretical properties on toy examples, achieves state-of-the-art performance on real world datasets such as transcriptomic trajectory inference in 100 dimensions, and for the first time recovers couplings and dynamics in very high dimensional image settings. Our work establishes multi-marginal Schr\"odinger bridges as a practical and principled approach for recovering hidden dynamics from static data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review.

Current solutions, whether traditional position-based control methods or reinforcement learning (RL) approaches, exhibit significant limitations. Model predictive control (MPC) is a prevalent approach for ordinary quadruped and biped robots. While MPC has demonstrated advantages in legged robots, existing studies often oversimplify the leg swing progress, relying merely on simple trajectory interpolation methods. This severely constrains the foot's environmental interaction capability, hindering tasks such as ball kicking. This study innovatively adapts the spatial-temporal trajectory planning method, which has been successful in drone applications, to bipedal robotic systems. The proposed approach autonomously generates foot trajectories that satisfy constraints on target kicking position, velocity, and acceleration while simultaneously optimizing swing phase duration. Experimental results demonstrate that the optimized trajectories closely mimic human kicking behavior, featuring a backswing motion. Simulation and hardware experiments confirm the algorithm's efficiency, with trajectory planning times under 1 ms, and its reliability, achieving nearly 100 % task completion accuracy when the soccer goal is within the range of -90{\deg} to 90{\deg}.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 8 figures, conference paper</p></details> |
| **[Foremost, Fastest, Shortest: Temporal Graph Realization under Various Path Metrics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01702v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we follow the current trend on temporal graph realization, where one is given a property P and the goal is to determine whether there is a temporal graph, that is, a graph where the edge set changes over time, with property P . We consider the problems where as property P , we are given a prescribed matrix for the duration, length, or earliest arrival time of pairwise temporal paths. That is, we are given a matrix D and ask whether there is a temporal graph such that for any ordered pair of vertices (s, t), Ds,t equals the duration (length, or earliest arrival time, respectively) of any temporal path from s to t minimizing that specific temporal path metric. For shortest and earliest arrival temporal paths, we are the first to consider these problems as far as we know. We analyze these problems for many settings like: strict and non-strict paths, periodic and non-periodic temporal graphs, and limited number of labels per edge (that is, limited occurrence number per edge over time). In contrast to all other path metrics, we show that for the earliest arrival times, we can achieve polynomial-time algorithms in periodic and non-periodic temporal graphs and for strict and and non-strict paths. However, the problem becomes NP-hard when the matrix does not contain a single integer but a set or range of possible allowed values. As we show, the problem can still be solved efficiently in this scenario, when the number of entries with more than one value is small, that is, we develop an FPT-algorithm for the number of such entries. For the setting of fastest paths, we achieve new hardness results that answers an open question by Klobas, Mertzios, Molter, and Spirakis [Theor. Comput. Sci. '25] about the parameterized complexity of the problem with respect to the vertex cover number and significantly improves over a previous hardness result for the feedback vertex set number. When considering shortest paths, we show that the periodic versions are polynomial-time solvable whereas the non-periodic versions become NP-hard.</p></details> |  |

Total Electron Content (TEC), a key ionospheric parameter, is derived from GNSS observations, but its reliable forecasting is limited by the sparse nature of global measurements and the limited accuracy of empirical models, especially during strong space weather conditions. In this work, we present a machine learning framework for ionospheric TEC forecasting that leverages Temporal Fusion Transformers (TFT) to predict sparse ionosphere data. Our approach accommodates heterogeneous input sources, including solar irradiance, geomagnetic indices, and GNSS-derived vertical TEC, and applies preprocessing and temporal alignment strategies. Experiments spanning 2010-2025 demonstrate that the model achieves robust predictions up to 24 hours ahead, with root mean square errors as low as 3.33 TECU. Results highlight that solar EUV irradiance provides the strongest predictive signals. Beyond forecasting accuracy, the framework offers interpretability through attention-based analysis, supporting both operational applications and scientific discovery. To encourage reproducibility and community-driven development, we release the full implementation as the open-source toolkit \texttt{ionopy}.</p></details> |  |
| **[FTSCommDetector: Discovering Behavioral Communities through Temporal Synchronization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00014v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Why do trillion-dollar tech giants AAPL and MSFT diverge into different response patterns during market disruptions despite identical sector classifications? This paradox reveals a fundamental limitation: traditional community detection methods fail to capture synchronization-desynchronization patterns where entities move independently yet align during critical moments. To this end, we introduce FTSCommDetector, implementing our Temporal Coherence Architecture (TCA) to discover similar and dissimilar communities in continuous multivariate time series. Unlike existing methods that process each timestamp independently, causing unstable community assignments and missing evolving relationships, our approach maintains coherence through dual-scale encoding and static topology with dynamic attention. Furthermore, we establish information-theoretic foundations demonstrating how scale separation maximizes complementary information and introduce Normalized Temporal Profiles (NTP) for scale-invariant evaluation. As a result, FTSCommDetector achieves consistent improvements across four diverse financial markets (SP100, SP500, SP1000, Nikkei 225), with gains ranging from 3.5% to 11.1% over the strongest baselines. The method demonstrates remarkable robustness with only 2% performance variation across window sizes from 60 to 120 days, making dataset-specific tuning unnecessary, providing practical insights for portfolio construction and risk management.</p></details> |  |
| **[Disentangling Multiplex Spatial-Temporal Transition Graph Representation Learning for Socially Enhanced POI Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07649v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Next Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation is a research hotspot in business intelligence, where users' spatial-temporal transitions and social relationships play key roles. However, most existing works model spatial and temporal transitions separately, leading to misaligned representations of the same spatial-temporal key nodes. This misalignment introduces redundant information during fusion, increasing model uncertainty and reducing interpretability. To address this issue, we propose DiMuST, a socially enhanced POI recommendation model based on disentangled representation learning over multiplex spatial-temporal transition graphs. The model employs a novel Disentangled variational multiplex graph Auto-Encoder (DAE), which first disentangles shared and private distributions using a multiplex spatial-temporal graph strategy. It then fuses the shared features via a Product of Experts (PoE) mechanism and denoises the private features through contrastive constraints. The model effectively captures the spatial-temporal transition representations of POIs while preserving the intrinsic correlation of their spatial-temporal relationships. Experiments on two challenging datasets demonstrate that our DiMuST significantly outperforms existing methods across multiple metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>There...</summary><p>There are quality issues with the paper and it requires major revisions</p></details> |

However, fixation sequences captured in active gaze tasks often exhibit irregular dispersion and systematic deviations from target locations, a variability primarily caused by the combined effects of human oculomotor physiology, insufficient AR headset tracking and calibration accuracy, and environmental disturbances, undermining interaction performance and visual engagement. To address this issue, we propose TimeGazer, which reformulates gaze stabilization as a sequence-to-sequence temporal regression problem, predicting idealized fixation trajectories for the target-fixation phase from historical gaze dynamics in the search phase. We present a synthetic data generation and blending strategy that produces spatially concentrated, target-centered fixation references aligned with task objectives, substantially enriching the training space and enhancing model generalization. We train and evaluate TimeGazer on a hybrid dataset of real and augmented gaze sequences collected via Microsoft HoloLens 2 from 54 participants across multiple prediction horizons. Through the user study, statistical results demonstrate that TimeGazer significantly improves interaction accuracy and reduces completion time, confirming that temporal modeling of predictive gaze stabilization can strengthen attentional consistency and responsiveness in task-driven AR interaction. These findings highlight the broader potential of TimeGazer for advancing adaptive gaze-based interfaces and temporal modeling research in immersive systems.</p></details> |  |

However, its strict reliance on precise temporal synchronization exposes it to new vulnerabilities. In this paper, we introduce DejaVu, an attack that exploits the in-vehicular network and induces delays across sensor streams to create subtle temporal misalignments, severely degrading downstream MMF-based perception tasks. Our comprehensive attack analysis across different models and datasets reveals the sensors' task-specific imbalanced sensitivities: object detection is overly dependent on LiDAR inputs, while object tracking is highly reliant on the camera inputs. Consequently, with a single-frame LiDAR delay, an attacker can reduce the car detection mAP by up to 88.5%, while with a three-frame camera delay, multiple object tracking accuracy (MOTA) for car drops by 73%. We further demonstrated two attack scenarios using an automotive Ethernet testbed for hardware-in-the-loop validation and the Autoware stack for end-to-end AD simulation, demonstrating the feasibility of the DejaVu attack and its severe impact, such as collisions and phantom braking.</p></details> | 15 pages |

While standard architectures like ConvLSTM often fail to model long-range dependencies, we argue that a more fundamental limitation of prior work lies in the uni-modal data paradigm. To address this, we propose the Multi-Modal Spatio-Temporal Transformer (MM-STT), a novel framework that fuses dynamic displacement data with static physical priors. Its core innovation is a joint spatio-temporal attention mechanism that processes all multi-modal features in a unified manner. On the public EGMS dataset, MM-STT establishes a new state-of-the-art, reducing the long-range forecast RMSE by an order of magnitude compared to all baselines, including SOTA methods like STGCN and STAEformer. Our results demonstrate that for this class of problems, an architecture's inherent capacity for deep multi-modal fusion is paramount for achieving transformative performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is submitted to IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing for reviewing</p></details> |

Such patterns can be revealed by analyzing communities formed by nodes, which in turn can be effectively modeled through temporal $k$-cores. This paper introduces a novel decentralized and incremental algorithm for computing the core decomposition of temporal networks. Decentralized solutions leverage the ability of network nodes to communicate and coordinate locally, addressing complex problems in a scalable, adaptive, and timely manner. By leveraging previously computed coreness values, our approach significantly reduces the activation of nodes and the volume of message exchanges when the network changes over time. This enables scalability with only a minimal trade-off in precision. Experimental evaluations on large real-world networks under varying levels of dynamism demonstrate the efficiency of our solution compared to a state-of-the-art approach, particularly in terms of active nodes, communication overhead, and convergence speed.</p></details> |  |

In a graphon particle system, the interactions among particles are characterized by the coupled mean field terms through an underlying graphon and the randomness of the coefficients comes from exogenous stochastic processes. By constructing two-level approximated sequences converging in 2-Wasserstein distance, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the system. Besides, by constructing two-level approximated functions converging to the graphon mean field terms, we establish the law of large numbers, which reveals that if the number of particles tends to infinity and the discretization step tends to zero, then the discrete-time interacting particle system over a large-scale network converges to the graphon particle system. As a byproduct, we discover that the graphon particle system can describe the limiting dynamics of the distributed stochastic gradient descent algorithm over the large-scale network and prove that if the gradients of the local cost functions are Lipschitz continuous, then the graphon particle system can be regarded as the spatio-temporal approximation of the discrete-time distributed stochastic gradient descent algorithm as the number of network nodes tends to infinity and the algorithm step size tends to zero.</p></details> |  |

However, they also face the inefficiency challenge as they process long sequences of high-resolution screenshots and solving long-horizon tasks, making inference slow, costly and memory-bound. While key-value (KV) caching can mitigate this, storing the full cache is prohibitive for image-heavy contexts. Existing cache-compression methods are sub-optimal as they do not account for the spatial and temporal redundancy of GUIs. In this work, we first analyze attention patterns in GUI agent workloads and find that, unlike in natural images, attention sparsity is uniformly high across all transformer layers. This insight motivates a simple uniform budget allocation strategy, which we show empirically outperforms more complex layer-varying schemes. Building on this, we introduce GUI-KV, a plug-and-play KV cache compression method for GUI agents that requires no retraining. GUI-KV combines two novel techniques: (i) spatial saliency guidance, which augments attention scores with the L2 norm of hidden states to better preserve semantically important visual tokens, and (ii) temporal redundancy scoring, which projects previous frames' keys onto the current frame's key subspace to preferentially prune redundant history. Across standard GUI agent benchmarks and models, GUI-KV outperforms competitive KV compression baselines, closely matching full-cache accuracy at modest budgets. Notably, in a 5-screenshot setting on the AgentNetBench benchmark, GUI-KV reduces decoding FLOPs by 38.9% while increasing step accuracy by 4.1% over the full-cache baseline. These results demonstrate that exploiting GUI-specific redundancies enables efficient and reliable agent performance.</p></details> |  |

However, existing generative and homogeneous graph approaches fall short in capturing physical consistency, spatial dependencies, and temporal variability. To address this, we introduce UrbanGraph, a physics-informed framework integrating heterogeneous and dynamic spatio-temporal graphs. It encodes key physical processes -- vegetation evapotranspiration, shading, and convective diffusion -- while modeling complex spatial dependencies among diverse urban entities and their temporal evolution. We evaluate UrbanGraph on UMC4/12, a physics-based simulation dataset covering diverse urban configurations and climates. Results show that UrbanGraph improves $R^2$ by up to 10.8% and reduces FLOPs by 17.0% over all baselines, with heterogeneous and dynamic graphs contributing 3.5% and 7.1% gains.

For rasterization and other tasks, it is often necessary to extract a mesh that represents the shape. Unbounded scenes with long-range camera trajectories, such as flying through a forest, pose a unique challenge for mesh extraction. A single static mesh representing all the geometric detail necessary for the full camera path can be prohibitively large. Therefore, independent meshes can be extracted for different camera views, but this approach may lead to popping artifacts during transitions. We propose a temporally coherent method for extracting meshes suitable for long-range camera trajectories in unbounded scenes represented by an occupancy function. The key idea is to perform 4D mesh extraction using a new spacetime tree structure called a binary-octree. Experiments show that, compared to existing baseline methods, our method offers superior visual consistency at a comparable cost.

In this framework, temporal predicates are encoded as polyhedron constraints on each edge of the network flow, instead of as constraints between the nodes as in the traditional Logic Tree formulation. Synthesized with Dynamic Network Flows, Logic Network Flows render a tighter convex relaxation compared to Logic Trees derived from these STL specifications. Our formulation is evaluated on several multi-robot motion planning case studies. Empirical results demonstrate that our formulation outperforms Logic Tree formulation in terms of computation time for several planning problems. As the problem size scales up, our method still discovers better lower and upper bounds by exploring fewer number of nodes during the branch-and-bound process, although this comes at the cost of increased computational load for each node when exploring branches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) 2025</p></details> |

Signal Temporal Logic (STL) offers a powerful and expressive language for specifying such tasks, but its non-Markovian nature and inherent sparse reward make it difficult to be solved via standard Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms. Prior RL approaches focus only on limited STL fragments or use STL robustness scores as sparse terminal rewards. In this paper, we propose TGPO, Temporal Grounded Policy Optimization, to solve general STL tasks. TGPO decomposes STL into timed subgoals and invariant constraints and provides a hierarchical framework to tackle the problem. The high-level component of TGPO proposes concrete time allocations for these subgoals, and the low-level time-conditioned policy learns to achieve the sequenced subgoals using a dense, stage-wise reward signal. During inference, we sample various time allocations and select the most promising assignment for the policy network to rollout the solution trajectory. To foster efficient policy learning for complex STL with multiple subgoals, we leverage the learned critic to guide the high-level temporal search via Metropolis-Hastings sampling, focusing exploration on temporally feasible solutions. We conduct experiments on five environments, ranging from low-dimensional navigation to manipulation, drone, and quadrupedal locomotion. Under a wide range of STL tasks, TGPO significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines (especially for high-dimensional and long-horizon cases), with an average of 31.6% improvement in task success rate compared to the best baseline. The code will be available at https://github.com/mengyuest/TGPO</p></details> |  |

One promising solution is to view task progress as a dense reward signal, as it quantifies the degree to which actions advance the system toward task completion over time. We present TimeRewarder, a simple yet effective reward learning method that derives progress estimation signals from passive videos, including robot demonstrations and human videos, by modeling temporal distances between frame pairs. We then demonstrate how TimeRewarder can supply step-wise proxy rewards to guide reinforcement learning. In our comprehensive experiments on ten challenging Meta-World tasks, we show that TimeRewarder dramatically improves RL for sparse-reward tasks, achieving nearly perfect success in 9/10 tasks with only 200,000 interactions per task with the environment. This approach outperformed previous methods and even the manually designed environment dense reward on both the final success rate and sample efficiency. Moreover, we show that TimeRewarder pretraining can exploit real-world human videos, highlighting its potential as a scalable approach path to rich reward signals from diverse video sources.</p></details> |  |
| **[STaR-Attack: A Spatio-Temporal and Narrative Reasoning Attack Framework for Unified Multimodal Understanding and Generation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26473v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unified Multimodal understanding and generation Models (UMMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in both understanding and generation tasks. However, we identify a vulnerability arising from the generation-understanding coupling in UMMs. The attackers can use the generative function to craft an information-rich adversarial image and then leverage the understanding function to absorb it in a single pass, which we call Cross-Modal Generative Injection (CMGI). Current attack methods on malicious instructions are often limited to a single modality while also relying on prompt rewriting with semantic drift, leaving the unique vulnerabilities of UMMs unexplored. We propose STaR-Attack, the first multi-turn jailbreak attack framework that exploits unique safety weaknesses of UMMs without semantic drift. Specifically, our method defines a malicious event that is strongly correlated with the target query within a spatio-temporal context. Using the three-act narrative theory, STaR-Attack generates the pre-event and the post-event scenes while concealing the malicious event as the hidden climax. When executing the attack strategy, the opening two rounds exploit the UMM's generative ability to produce images for these scenes. Subsequently, an image-based question guessing and answering game is introduced by exploiting the understanding capability. STaR-Attack embeds the original malicious question among benign candidates, forcing the model to select and answer the most relevant one given the narrative context. Extensive experiments show that STaR-Attack consistently surpasses prior approaches, achieving up to 93.06% ASR on Gemini-2.0-Flash and surpasses the strongest prior baseline, FlipAttack. Our work uncovers a critical yet underdeveloped vulnerability and highlights the need for safety alignments in UMMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-temporal crack segmentation in concrete structures using deep learning approaches](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04620v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cracks are among the earliest indicators of deterioration in concrete structures. Early automatic detection of these cracks can significantly extend the lifespan of critical infrastructures, such as bridges, buildings, and tunnels, while simultaneously reducing maintenance costs and facilitating efficient structural health monitoring. This study investigates whether leveraging multi-temporal data for crack segmentation can enhance segmentation quality. Therefore, we compare a Swin UNETR trained on multi-temporal data with a U-Net trained on mono-temporal data to assess the effect of temporal information compared with conventional single-epoch approaches. To this end, a multi-temporal dataset comprising 1356 images, each with 32 sequential crack propagation images, was created. After training the models, experiments were conducted to analyze their generalization ability, temporal consistency, and segmentation quality. The multi-temporal approach consistently outperformed its mono-temporal counterpart, achieving an IoU of $82.72\%$ and a F1-score of $90.54\%$, representing a significant improvement over the mono-temporal model's IoU of $76.69\%$ and F1-score of $86.18\%$, despite requiring only half of the trainable parameters. The multi-temporal model also displayed a more consistent segmentation quality, with reduced noise and fewer errors. These results suggest that temporal information significantly enhances the performance of segmentation models, offering a promising solution for improved crack detection and the long-term monitoring of concrete structures, even with limited sequential data.</p></details> |  |

However, their capacity of temporal dynamics, including the ability to manage timing, tempo and simultaneous speaking, remains a critical and unevaluated challenge for conversational fluency. To address this gap, we introduce the Game-Time Benchmark, a framework to systematically assess these temporal capabilities. Inspired by how humans learn a language through language activities, Game-Time consists of basic instruction-following tasks and advanced tasks with temporal constraints, such as tempo adherence and synchronized responses. Our evaluation of diverse SLM architectures reveals a clear performance disparity: while state-of-the-art models handle basic tasks well, many contemporary systems still struggle with fundamental instruction-following. More critically, nearly all models degrade substantially under temporal constraints, exposing persistent weaknesses in time awareness and full-duplex interaction. The Game-Time Benchmark provides a foundation for guiding future research toward more temporally-aware conversational AI. Demos and datasets are available on our project website https://ga642381.github.io/Game-Time.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to ICASSP 2026</p></details> |
| **[TimeScope: Towards Task-Oriented Temporal Grounding In Long Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26360v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying key moments in long videos is essential for downstream understanding and reasoning tasks. In this paper, we introduce a new problem, Taskoriented Temporal Grounding ToTG, which aims to localize time intervals containing the necessary information based on a task's natural description. Along with the definition, we also present ToTG Bench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the performance on ToTG. ToTG is particularly challenging for traditional approaches due to their limited generalizability and difficulty in handling long videos. To address these challenges, we propose TimeScope, a novel framework built upon progressive reasoning. TimeScope first identifies a coarse-grained temporal scope in the long video that likely contains the key moments, and then refines this scope through finegrained moment partitioning. Additionally, we curate a highquality dataset, namely ToTG Pile, to enhance TimeScope's ability to perform progressive temporal grounding effectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TimeScope consistently outperforms both existing temporalgrounding methods and popular MLLMs across various settings, highlighting its effectiveness in addressing this new challenging problem.</p></details> |  |
| **[EnScale: Temporally-consistent multivariate generative downscaling via proper scoring rules](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26258v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The practical use of future climate projections from global circulation models (GCMs) is often limited by their coarse spatial resolution, requiring downscaling to generate high-resolution data. Regional climate models (RCMs) provide this refinement, but are computationally expensive. To address this issue, machine learning models can learn the downscaling function, mapping coarse GCM outputs to high-resolution fields. Among these, generative approaches aim to capture the full conditional distribution of RCM data given coarse-scale GCM data, which is characterized by large variability and thus challenging to model accurately. We introduce EnScale, a generative machine learning framework that emulates the full GCM-to-RCM map by training on multiple pairs of GCM and corresponding RCM data. It first adjusts large-scale mismatches between GCM and coarsened RCM data, followed by a super-resolution step to generate high-resolution fields. Both steps employ generative models optimized with the energy score, a proper scoring rule. Compared to state-of-the-art ML downscaling approaches, our setup reduces computational cost by about one order of magnitude. EnScale jointly emulates multiple variables -- temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, and wind -- spatially consistent over an area in Central Europe. In addition, we propose a variant EnScale-t that enables temporally consistent downscaling. We establish a comprehensive evaluation framework across various categories including calibration, spatial structure, extremes, and multivariate dependencies. Comparison with diverse benchmarks demonstrates EnScale's strong performance and computational efficiency. EnScale offers a promising approach for accurate and temporally consistent RCM emulation.</p></details> |  |

We introduce three contributions: (i) temporal embedding similarity that aligns consecutive latent representations, (ii) a motion-aligned transformation loss that matches displacement between predictions and ground truth LiDAR, and (iii) windowed temporal fusion using a specialised temporal module. We further update the model architecture to better preserve spatial structure. Evaluations on radar/sonar-to-LiDAR translation demonstrate improved temporal and spatial coherence, yielding lower absolute trajectory error and better occupancy map accuracy in Cartographer-based SLAM (Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping). We propose different metrics based on the Fr\'echet Video Motion Distance (FVMD) and a correlation-peak distance metric providing practical temporal quality indicators to evaluate SLAM performance. The proposed temporal LiDAR-BIND, or LiDAR-BIND-T, maintains modular modality fusion while substantially enhancing temporal stability, resulting in improved robustness and performance for downstream SLAM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaling Up Temporal Domain Generalization via Temporal Experts Averaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26045v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal Domain Generalization (TDG) aims to generalize across temporal distribution shifts, e.g., lexical change over time. Prior work often addresses this by predicting future model weights. However, full model prediction is prohibitively expensive for even reasonably sized models. Thus, recent methods only predict the classifier layer, limiting generalization by failing to adjust other model components. To address this, we propose Temporal Experts Averaging (TEA), a novel and scalable TDG framework that updates the entire model using weight averaging to maximize generalization potential while minimizing computational costs. Our theoretical analysis guides us to two steps that enhance generalization to future domains. First, we create expert models with functional diversity yet parameter similarity by fine-tuning a domain-agnostic base model on individual temporal domains while constraining weight changes. Second, we optimize the bias-variance tradeoff through adaptive averaging coefficients derived from modeling temporal weight trajectories in a principal component subspace. Expert's contributions are based on their projected proximity to future domains. Extensive experiments across 7 TDG benchmarks, 5 models, and 2 TDG settings shows TEA outperforms prior TDG methods by up to 69% while being up to 60x more efficient.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP 2025 main</p></details> |
| **[BALLAST: Bayesian Active Learning with Look-ahead Amendment for Sea-drifter Trajectories under Spatio-Temporal Vector Fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26005v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a formal active learning methodology for guiding the placement of Lagrangian observers to infer time-dependent vector fields -- a key task in oceanography, marine science, and ocean engineering -- using a physics-informed spatio-temporal Gaussian process surrogate model. The majority of existing placement campaigns either follow standard `space-filling' designs or relatively ad-hoc expert opinions. A key challenge to applying principled active learning in this setting is that Lagrangian observers are continuously advected through the vector field, so they make measurements at different locations and times. It is, therefore, important to consider the likely future trajectories of placed observers to account for the utility of candidate placement locations. To this end, we present BALLAST: Bayesian Active Learning with Look-ahead Amendment for Sea-drifter Trajectories. We observe noticeable benefits of BALLAST-aided sequential observer placement strategies on both synthetic and high-fidelity ocean current models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Behavioural Classification in C. elegans: a Spatio-Temporal Analysis of Locomotion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00086v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The 1mm roundworm C. elegans is a model organism used in many sub-areas of biology to investigate different types of biological processes. In order to complement the n-vivo analysis with computer-based investigations, several methods have been proposed to simulate the worm behaviour. These methods extract discrete behavioural units from the flow of the worm movements using different types of tracking techniques. Nevertheless, these techniques require a clear view of the entire worm body, which is not always achievable. For example, this happens in high density worm conditions, which are particularly informative to understand the influence of the social context on the single worm behaviour. In this paper, we illustrate and evaluate a method to extract behavioural units from recordings of C. elegans movements which do not necessarily require a clear view of the entire worm body. Moreover, the behavioural units are defined by an unsupervised automatic pipeline which frees the process from predefined assumptions that inevitably bias the behavioural analysis. The behavioural units resulting from the automatic method are interpreted by comparing them with hand-designed behavioural units. The effectiveness of the automatic method is evaluated by measuring the extent to which the movement of a simulated worm, with an agent-based model, matches the movement of a natural worm. Our results indicate that spatio-temporal locomotory patterns emerge even from single point worm tracking. Moreover, we show that such patterns represent a fundamental aspect of the behavioural classification process.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal-Network Point Processes for Modeling Crime Events with Landmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10882v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-exciting point processes are widely used to model the contagious effects of crime events living within continuous geographic space, using their occurrence time and locations. However, in urban environments, most events are naturally constrained within the city's street network structure, and the contagious effects of crime are governed by such a network geography. Meanwhile, the complex distribution of urban infrastructures also plays an important role in shaping crime patterns across space. We introduce a novel spatio-temporal-network point process framework for crime modeling that integrates these urban environmental characteristics by incorporating self-attention graph neural networks. Our framework incorporates the street network structure as the underlying event space, where crime events can occur at random locations on the network edges. To realistically capture criminal movement patterns, distances between events are measured using street network distances. We then propose a new mark for a crime event by concatenating the event's crime category with the type of its nearby landmark, aiming to capture how the urban design influences the mixing structures of various crime types. A graph attention network architecture is adopted to learn the existence of mark-to-mark interactions. Extensive experiments on crime data from Valencia, Spain, demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in understanding the crime landscape and forecasting crime risks across regions.</p></details> |  |

Traditional spot trading suffers from negotiation delays and high energy costs, while conventional futures trading struggles to adapt to the dynamic, uncertain UAV-edge environment. To address these challenges, we propose PAST (pilot-and-adaptive stable trading), a novel framework for edge-assisted UAV networks with spatio-temporal dynamism. PAST integrates two complementary mechanisms: PilotAO (pilot trading agreements with overbooking), a risk-aware, overbooking-enabled early-stage decision-making module that establishes long-term, mutually beneficial agreements and boosts resource utilization; and AdaptAO (adaptive trading agreements with overbooking rate update), an intelligent adaptation module that dynamically updates agreements and overbooking rates based on UAV mobility, supply-demand variations, and agreement performance. Together, these mechanisms enable both stability and flexibility, guaranteeing individual rationality, strong stability, competitive equilibrium, and weak Pareto optimality. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that PAST consistently outperforms benchmark methods in decision-making overhead, task completion latency, resource utilization, and social welfare. By combining predictive planning with real-time adjustments, PAST offers a valuable reference on robust and adaptive practice for improving low-altitude mission performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Guiding Mixture-of-Experts with Temporal Multimodal Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25678v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have become pivotal for large-scale multimodal models. However, their routing mechanisms typically overlook the informative, time-varying interaction dynamics between modalities. This limitation hinders expert specialization, as the model cannot explicitly leverage intrinsic modality relationships for effective reasoning. To address this, we propose a novel framework that guides MoE routing using quantified temporal interaction. A multimodal interaction-aware router learns to dispatch tokens to experts based on the nature of their interactions. This dynamic routing encourages experts to acquire generalizable interaction-processing skills rather than merely learning task-specific features. Our framework builds on a new formulation of temporal multimodal interaction dynamics, which are used to guide expert routing. We first demonstrate that these temporal multimodal interactions reveal meaningful patterns across applications, and then show how they can be leveraged to improve both the design and performance of MoE-based models. Comprehensive experiments on challenging multimodal benchmarks validate our approach, demonstrating both enhanced performance and improved interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 8 figures, 10 tables</p></details> |
| **[Conformal Prediction for Signal Temporal Logic Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25473v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Signal Temporal Logic (STL) inference seeks to extract human-interpretable rules from time-series data, but existing methods lack formal confidence guarantees for the inferred rules. Conformal prediction (CP) is a technique that can provide statistical correctness guarantees, but is typically applied as a post-training wrapper without improving model learning. Instead, we introduce an end-to-end differentiable CP framework for STL inference that enhances both reliability and interpretability of the resulting formulas. We introduce a robustness-based nonconformity score, embed a smooth CP layer directly into training, and employ a new loss function that simultaneously optimizes inference accuracy and CP prediction sets with a single term. Following training, an exact CP procedure delivers statistical guarantees for the learned STL formulas. Experiments on benchmark time-series tasks show that our approach reduces uncertainty in predictions (i.e., it achieves high coverage while reducing prediction set size), and improves accuracy (i.e., the number of misclassifications when using a fixed threshold) over state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Vulnerabilities in Temporal Graph Neural Networks via Strategic High-Impact Assaults](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25418v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) have become indispensable for analyzing dynamic graphs in critical applications such as social networks, communication systems, and financial networks. However, the robustness of TGNNs against adversarial attacks, particularly sophisticated attacks that exploit the temporal dimension, remains a significant challenge. Existing attack methods for Spatio-Temporal Dynamic Graphs (STDGs) often rely on simplistic, easily detectable perturbations (e.g., random edge additions/deletions) and fail to strategically target the most influential nodes and edges for maximum impact. We introduce the High Impact Attack (HIA), a novel restricted black-box attack framework specifically designed to overcome these limitations and expose critical vulnerabilities in TGNNs. HIA leverages a data-driven surrogate model to identify structurally important nodes (central to network connectivity) and dynamically important nodes (critical for the graph's temporal evolution). It then employs a hybrid perturbation strategy, combining strategic edge injection (to create misleading connections) and targeted edge deletion (to disrupt essential pathways), maximizing TGNN performance degradation. Importantly, HIA minimizes the number of perturbations to enhance stealth, making it more challenging to detect. Comprehensive experiments on five real-world datasets and four representative TGNN architectures (TGN, JODIE, DySAT, and TGAT) demonstrate that HIA significantly reduces TGNN accuracy on the link prediction task, achieving up to a 35.55% decrease in Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) - a substantial improvement over state-of-the-art baselines. These results highlight fundamental vulnerabilities in current STDG models and underscore the urgent need for robust defenses that account for both structural and temporal dynamics.</p></details> |  |
| **[TemMed-Bench: Evaluating Temporal Medical Image Reasoning in Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25143v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing medical reasoning benchmarks for vision-language models primarily focus on analyzing a patient's condition based on an image from a single visit. However, this setting deviates significantly from real-world clinical practice, where doctors typically refer to a patient's historical conditions to provide a comprehensive assessment by tracking their changes over time. In this paper, we introduce TemMed-Bench, the first benchmark designed for analyzing changes in patients' conditions between different clinical visits, which challenges large vision-language models (LVLMs) to reason over temporal medical images. TemMed-Bench consists of a test set comprising three tasks - visual question-answering (VQA), report generation, and image-pair selection - and a supplementary knowledge corpus of over 17,000 instances. With TemMed-Bench, we conduct an evaluation of six proprietary and six open-source LVLMs. Our results show that most LVLMs lack the ability to analyze patients' condition changes over temporal medical images, and a large proportion perform only at a random-guessing level in the closed-book setting. In contrast, GPT o3, o4-mini and Claude 3.5 Sonnet demonstrate comparatively decent performance, though they have yet to reach the desired level. Furthermore, we explore augmenting the input with both retrieved visual and textual modalities in the medical domain. We also show that multi-modal retrieval augmentation yields notably higher performance gains than no retrieval and textual retrieval alone across most models on our benchmark, with the VQA task showing an average improvement of 2.59%. Overall, we compose a benchmark grounded on real-world clinical practice, and it reveals LVLMs' limitations in temporal medical image reasoning, as well as highlighting the use of multi-modal retrieval augmentation as a potentially promising direction worth exploring to address this challenge.</p></details> |  |

While approaches such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and rule-based reward mechanisms demonstrate promise in text and image domains, their application to video understanding remains limited. This paper presents a systematic exploration of Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) with GRPO for video MLLMs, aiming to enhance spatio-temporal perception while maintaining general capabilities. Our experiments reveal that RFT is highly data-efficient for task-specific improvements. Through multi-task RFT on spatio-temporal perception objectives with limited samples, we develop VideoChat-R1, a powerful video MLLM that achieves state-of-the-art performance on spatio-temporal perception tasks without sacrificing chat ability, while exhibiting emerging spatio-temporal reasoning abilities. Compared to Qwen2.5-VL-7B, VideoChat-R1 boosts performance several-fold in tasks like temporal grounding (+31.8) and object tracking (+31.2). Additionally, it significantly improves on general QA benchmarks such as VideoMME (+0.9), MVBench (+1.0), and Perception Test (+0.9). Our findings underscore the potential of RFT for specialized task enhancement of Video MLLMs. We hope our work offers valuable insights for future RL research in video MLLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contrastive Representations for Temporal Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13113v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In classical AI, perception relies on learning state-based representations, while planning, which can be thought of as temporal reasoning over action sequences, is typically achieved through search. We study whether such reasoning can instead emerge from representations that capture both perceptual and temporal structure. We show that standard temporal contrastive learning, despite its popularity, often fails to capture temporal structure due to its reliance on spurious features. To address this, we introduce Combinatorial Representations for Temporal Reasoning (CRTR), a method that uses a negative sampling scheme to provably remove these spurious features and facilitate temporal reasoning. CRTR achieves strong results on domains with complex temporal structure, such as Sokoban and Rubik's Cube. In particular, for the Rubik's Cube, CRTR learns representations that generalize across all initial states and allow it to solve the puzzle using fewer search steps than BestFS, though with longer solutions. To our knowledge, this is the first method that efficiently solves arbitrary Cube states using only learned representations, without relying on an external search algorithm.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025, Project website: https://princeton-rl.github.io/CRTR/</p></details> |

However, current unsupervised SNNs predominantly employ shallow architectures or localized plasticity rules, limiting their ability to model long-range temporal dependencies and maintain temporal feature consistency. This results in semantically unstable representations, thereby impeding the development of deep unsupervised SNNs for large-scale temporal video data. We propose PredNext, which explicitly models temporal relationships through cross-view future Step Prediction and Clip Prediction. This plug-and-play module seamlessly integrates with diverse self-supervised objectives. We firstly establish standard benchmarks for SNN self-supervised learning on UCF101, HMDB51, and MiniKinetics, which are substantially larger than conventional DVS datasets. PredNext delivers significant performance improvements across different tasks and self-supervised methods. PredNext achieves performance comparable to ImageNet-pretrained supervised weights through unsupervised training solely on UCF101. Additional experiments demonstrate that PredNext, distinct from forced consistency constraints, substantially improves temporal feature consistency while enhancing network generalization capabilities. This work provides a effective foundation for unsupervised deep SNNs on large-scale temporal video data.</p></details> |  |

Common approaches for this task are based on vector auto-regression, and they do not take into account unknown confounding between potential causes. However, in settings with many potential causes and noisy data, these approaches may be substantially biased. Furthermore, potential causes may be correlated in practical applications or even contain cycles. To address these challenges, we propose a new double machine learning based method for structure identification from temporal data (DR-SIT). We provide theoretical guarantees, showing that our method asymptotically recovers the true underlying causal structure. Our analysis extends to cases where the potential causes have cycles, and they may even be confounded. We further perform extensive experiments to showcase the superior performance of our method.

Current neural network approaches to MTPP inference rely on training separate, specialized models for each target system. We pursue a radically different approach: drawing on amortized inference and in-context learning, we pretrain a deep neural network to infer, in-context, the conditional intensity functions of event histories from a context defined by sets of event sequences. Pretraining is performed on a large synthetic dataset of MTPPs sampled from a broad distribution of Hawkes processes. Once pretrained, our Foundation Inference Model for Point Processes (FIM-PP) can estimate MTPPs from real-world data without any additional training, or be rapidly finetuned to target systems. Experiments show that this amortized approach matches the performance of specialized models on next-event prediction across common benchmark datasets. Our pretrained model, repository and tutorials will soon be available online</p></details> |  |

Traditional analytics techniques rely on manual annotation or laboratory-based instrumentation, which are time-consuming, costly, and lack scalability. Automatic extraction of relevant kinetic variables requires a robust and contextually appropriate temporal segmentation. Considering the specific case of elite javelin-throw, we present a novel unsupervised framework for such a contextually aware segmentation, which applies the structured optimal transport (SOT) concept to augment the well-known Attention-based Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (ASTGCN). This enables the identification of motion phase transitions without requiring expensive manual labeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods, achieving 71.02% mean average precision (mAP) and 74.61% F1-score on test data, substantially higher than competing baselines. We also release a new dataset of 211 manually annotated professional javelin-throw videos with frame-level annotations, covering key biomechanical phases: approach steps, drive, throw, and recovery.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted at the IEEE STAR Workshop 2025</p></details> |

However, existing reward models often lack temporal consistency, leading to ineffective policy updates and unstable RL training. We introduce TDRM, a method for learning smoother and more reliable reward models by minimizing temporal differences (TD) for training-time reinforcement learning and inference-time verification. Experiments show that TD-trained process reward models (PRMs) improve performance across Best-of-N (up to 6.6%) and tree-search (up to 23.7%) settings. When combined with Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), TD-trained PRMs lead to more data-efficient RL -- achieving comparable performance with just 2.5k data to what baseline methods require 50.1k data to attain -- and yield higher-quality language model policies in 8 model variants (5 series), e.g., Qwen2.5-(0.5B, 1,5B), GLM4-9B-0414, GLM-Z1-9B-0414, Qwen2.5-Math-(1.5B, 7B), and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-(1.5B, 7B).

This sole focus on efficacy has steered development of large-scale models that require massive resources, and results in considerable carbon footprint across the model life-cycle. In this work, we explore how physics inductive biases can offer useful trade-offs between model efficacy and model efficiency (compute, energy, and carbon). We study a variety of models for spatio-temporal forecasting, a task governed by physical laws and well-suited for exploring different levels of physics inductive bias. We show that embedding physics inductive biases into the model design can yield substantial efficiency gains while retaining or even improving efficacy for the tasks under consideration. In addition to using standard physics-informed spatio-temporal models, we demonstrate the usefulness of more recent models like flow matching as a general purpose method for spatio-temporal forecasting.

We argue that model efficiency, along with model efficacy, should become a core consideration driving machine learning model development and deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Sourc...</summary><p>Source code available at https://github.com/sophiawilson18/FlowMatching</p></details> |
| **[Functional Complexity-adaptive Temporal Tensor Decomposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06164v3)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tensor decomposition is a fundamental tool for analyzing multi-dimensional data by learning low-rank factors to represent high-order interactions. While recent works on temporal tensor decomposition have made significant progress by incorporating continuous timestamps in latent factors, they still struggle with general tensor data with continuous indexes not only in the temporal mode but also in other modes, such as spatial coordinates in climate data. Moreover, the challenge of self-adapting model complexity is largely unexplored in functional temporal tensor models, with existing methods being inapplicable in this setting. To address these limitations, we propose functional \underline{C}omplexity-\underline{A}daptive \underline{T}emporal \underline{T}ensor d\underline{E}composition (\textsc{Catte}). Our approach encodes continuous spatial indexes as learnable Fourier features and employs neural ODEs in latent space to learn the temporal trajectories of factors. To enable automatic adaptation of model complexity, we introduce a sparsity-inducing prior over the factor trajectories. We develop an efficient variational inference scheme with an analytical evidence lower bound, enabling sampling-free optimization. Through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that \textsc{Catte} not only reveals the underlying ranks of functional temporal tensors but also significantly outperforms existing methods in prediction performance and robustness against noise.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional anomaly detection methods focus on modeling spatial or temporal dependencies independently, resulting in suboptimal representation learning and limited sensitivity to anomalous dispersion in high-dimensional spaces. In this work, we conduct an empirical analysis showing that both normal and anomalous samples tend to scatter in high-dimensional space, especially anomalous samples are markedly more dispersed. We formalize this dispersion phenomenon as scattering, quantified by the mean pairwise distance among sample representations, and leverage it as an inductive signal to enhance spatio-temporal anomaly detection. Technically, we propose ScatterAD to model representation scattering across temporal and topological dimensions. ScatterAD incorporates a topological encoder for capturing graph-structured scattering and a temporal encoder for constraining over-scattering through mean squared error minimization between neighboring time steps. We introduce a contrastive fusion mechanism to ensure the complementarity of the learned temporal and topological representations. Additionally, we theoretically show that maximizing the conditional mutual information between temporal and topological views improves cross-view consistency and enhances more discriminative representations. Extensive experiments on multiple public benchmarks show that ScatterAD achieves state-of-the-art performance on multivariate time series anomaly detection.

However, applying MTRL to robotics remains challenging due to the high cost of collecting diverse task data. To address this, we propose MT-L\'evy, a novel exploration strategy that enhances sample efficiency in MTRL environments by combining behavior sharing across tasks with temporally extended exploration inspired by L\'evy flight. MT-L\'evy leverages policies trained on related tasks to guide exploration towards key states, while dynamically adjusting exploration levels based on task success ratios. This approach enables more efficient state-space coverage, even in complex robotics environments. Empirical results demonstrate that MT-L\'evy significantly improves exploration and sample efficiency, supported by quantitative and qualitative analyses. Ablation studies further highlight the contribution of each component, showing that combining behavior sharing with adaptive exploration strategies can significantly improve the practicality of MTRL in robotics applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the proceedings of the 2025 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)</p></details> |
| **[Reversed in Time: A Novel Temporal-Emphasized Benchmark for Cross-Modal Video-Text Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19178v2)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-modal (e.g. image-text, video-text) retrieval is an important task in information retrieval and multimodal vision-language understanding field. Temporal understanding makes video-text retrieval more challenging than image-text retrieval. However, we find that the widely used video-text benchmarks have shortcomings in comprehensively assessing abilities of models, especially in temporal understanding, causing large-scale image-text pre-trained models can already achieve comparable zero-shot performance with video-text pre-trained models. In this paper, we introduce RTime, a novel temporal-emphasized video-text retrieval dataset. We first obtain videos of actions or events with significant temporality, and then reverse these videos to create harder negative samples. We then recruit annotators to judge the significance and reversibility of candidate videos, and write captions for qualified videos. We further adopt GPT-4 to extend more captions based on human-written captions. Our RTime dataset currently consists of 21k videos with 10 captions per video, totalling about 122 hours. Based on RTime, we propose three retrieval benchmark tasks: RTime-Origin, RTime-Hard, and RTime-Binary. We further enhance the use of harder-negatives in model training, and benchmark a variety of video-text models on RTime. Extensive experiment analysis proves that RTime indeed poses new and higher challenges to video-text retrieval. We release our RTime dataset https://github.com/qyr0403/Reversed-in-Time to further advance video-text retrieval and multimodal understanding research.</p></details> | ACMMM 2024 poster |
| **[Temporal Grounding as a Learning Signal for Referring Video Object Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11955v2)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment and track objects in videos based on natural language expressions, requiring precise alignment between visual content and textual queries. However, existing methods often suffer from semantic misalignment, largely due to indiscriminate frame sampling and supervision of all visible objects during training -- regardless of their actual relevance to the expression. We identify the core problem as the absence of an explicit temporal learning signal in conventional training paradigms. To address this, we introduce MeViS-M, a dataset built upon the challenging MeViS benchmark, where we manually annotate temporal spans when each object is referred to by the expression. These annotations provide a direct, semantically grounded supervision signal that was previously missing. To leverage this signal, we propose Temporally Grounded Learning (TGL), a novel learning framework that directly incorporates temporal grounding into the training process. Within this frame- work, we introduce two key strategies. First, Moment-guided Dual-path Propagation (MDP) improves both grounding and tracking by decoupling language-guided segmentation for relevant moments from language-agnostic propagation for others. Second, Object-level Selective Supervision (OSS) supervises only the objects temporally aligned with the expression in each training clip, thereby reducing semantic noise and reinforcing language-conditioned learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our TGL framework effectively leverages temporal signal to establish a new state-of-the-art on the challenging MeViS benchmark. We will make our code and the MeViS-M dataset publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://seung-hun-lee.github.io/projects/TGL/</p></details> |

However, we find that typical strategies designed to enhance DETR do not improve, and may even degrade, its performance in this task. We systematically analyze and identify the root causes of this abnormal behavior: (1) conflicts between queries from similar target moments and (2) internal query conflicts due to the tension between global semantics and local localization. Building on these insights, we propose a simple yet powerful baseline, Sim-DETR, which extends the standard DETR with two minor modifications in the decoder layers: (1) constraining self-attention between queries based on their semantic and positional overlap and (2) adding query-to-frame alignment to bridge the global and local contexts. Experiments demonstrate that Sim-DETR unlocks the full potential of DETR for temporal sentence grounding, offering a strong baseline for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work is accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |

Existing approaches mostly rely on static or attention-only architectures, which struggle to model fine-grained temporal dynamics. We propose TGT, a Transformer framework equipped with a temporal gating module that conditions hidden representations on the hour-of-day. Unlike conventional time embeddings, temporal gating adaptively rescales feature dimensions in a time-aware manner, working orthogonally to self-attention and strengthening temporal sensitivity. TGT further incorporates a context-aware encoder that integrates session sequences and user profiles into a unified representation. Experiments on two real-world datasets, Tsinghua App Usage and LSApp, demonstrate that TGT significantly outperforms 15 competitive baselines, achieving notable gains in HR@1 and maintaining robustness under cold-start scenarios. Beyond accuracy, analysis of gating vectors uncovers interpretable daily usage rhythms, showing that TGT learns human-consistent patterns of app behavior. These results establish TGT as both a powerful and interpretable framework for time-aware app usage prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[STAIR: Addressing Stage Misalignment through Temporal-Aligned Preference Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23802v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) bypasses complex reward engineering by learning rewards directly from human preferences, enabling better alignment with human intentions. However, its effectiveness in multi-stage tasks, where agents sequentially perform sub-tasks (e.g., navigation, grasping), is limited by stage misalignment: Comparing segments from mismatched stages, such as movement versus manipulation, results in uninformative feedback, thus hindering policy learning. In this paper, we validate the stage misalignment issue through theoretical analysis and empirical experiments. To address this issue, we propose STage-AlIgned Reward learning (STAIR), which first learns a stage approximation based on temporal distance, then prioritizes comparisons within the same stage. Temporal distance is learned via contrastive learning, which groups temporally close states into coherent stages, without predefined task knowledge, and adapts dynamically to policy changes. Extensive experiments demonstrate STAIR's superiority in multi-stage tasks and competitive performance in single-stage tasks. Furthermore, human studies show that stages approximated by STAIR are consistent with human cognition, confirming its effectiveness in mitigating stage misalignment.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

However, existing studies on cultural understanding with vision-language models (VLMs) primarily emphasize geographic diversity, often overlooking the critical temporal dimensions. To bridge this gap, we introduce Hanfu-Bench, a novel, expert-curated multimodal dataset. Hanfu, a traditional garment spanning ancient Chinese dynasties, serves as a representative cultural heritage that reflects the profound temporal aspects of Chinese culture while remaining highly popular in Chinese contemporary society. Hanfu-Bench comprises two core tasks: cultural visual understanding and cultural image transcreation. The former task examines temporal-cultural feature recognition based on single- or multi-image inputs through multiple-choice visual question answering, while the latter focuses on transforming traditional attire into modern designs through cultural element inheritance and modern context adaptation. Our evaluation shows that closed VLMs perform comparably to non-experts on visual cutural understanding but fall short by 10% to human experts, while open VLMs lags further behind non-experts. For the transcreation task, multi-faceted human evaluation indicates that the best-performing model achieves a success rate of only 42%. Our benchmark provides an essential testbed, revealing significant challenges in this new direction of temporal cultural understanding and creative adaptation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Cultu...</summary><p>Cultural Analysis, Cultural Visual Understanding, Cultural Image Transcreation.

Unlike multivariate time series from other domains, stock time series exhibit industry correlation. Exploiting this kind of correlation can improve forecasting accuracy. However, existing methods based on hypergraphs can only capture industry correlation relatively superficially. These methods face two key limitations: they do not fully consider inter-industry lead-lag interactions, and they do not model multi-scale information within and among industries. This study proposes the Hermes framework for stock time series forecasting that aims to improve the exploitation of industry correlation by eliminating these limitations. The framework integrates moving aggregation and multi-scale fusion modules in a hypergraph network. Specifically, to more flexibly capture the lead-lag relationships among industries, Hermes proposes a hyperedge-based moving aggregation module. This module incorporates a sliding window and utilizes dynamic temporal aggregation operations to consider lead-lag dependencies among industries. Additionally, to effectively model multi-scale information, Hermes employs cross-scale, edge-to-edge message passing to integrate information from different scales while maintaining the consistency of each scale. Experimental results on multiple real-world stock datasets show that Hermes outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both efficiency and accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Generalization: A Reality Check](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23487v1)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning (ML) models often struggle to maintain performance under distribution shifts, leading to inaccurate predictions on unseen future data. In this work, we investigate whether and under what conditions models can achieve such a generalization when relying solely on past data. We explore two primary approaches: convex combinations of past model parameters (\emph{parameter interpolation}) and explicit extrapolation beyond the convex hull of past parameters (\emph{parameter extrapolation}). We benchmark several methods within these categories on a diverse set of temporal tasks, including language modeling, news summarization, news tag prediction, academic paper categorization, satellite image-based land use classification over time, and historical yearbook photo gender prediction. Our empirical findings show that none of the evaluated methods consistently outperforms the simple baseline of using the latest available model parameters in all scenarios. In the absence of access to future data or robust assumptions about the underlying data-generating process, these results underscore the inherent difficulties of generalizing and extrapolating to future data and warrant caution when evaluating claims of such generalization.</p></details> |  |

Yet capturing pore collapse, anomalous Hugoniot responses, and localized heating-phenomena that strongly influence asteroid deflection or fusion ignition has remained a major challenge despite recent advances in single-field and reduced representations. We introduce a multi-field spatio-temporal deep learning model (MSTM) that unifies seven coupled fields-pressure, density, temperature, energy, material distribution, and two velocity components into a single autoregressive surrogate. Trained on high-fidelity hydrocode data, MSTM captures nonlinear shock-driven dynamics across porous and architected configurations, achieving mean errors of 1.4% and 3.2% respectively, all while delivering over three orders of magnitude in speedup. This advance transforms problems once considered intractable into tractable design studies, establishing a practical framework for optimizing meso-structured materials in planetary impact mitigation and inertial fusion energy.</p></details> | 16 pages, 10 figures |

Standard 2D spectrograms provide rich spectral features but compromise the phase information and temporal precision of the 1D waveform. We propose AudioFuse, an architecture that simultaneously learns from both complementary representations to classify PCGs. To mitigate the overfitting risk common in fusion models, we integrate a custom, wide-and-shallow Vision Transformer (ViT) for spectrograms with a shallow 1D CNN for raw waveforms. On the PhysioNet 2016 dataset, AudioFuse achieves a state-of-the-art competitive ROC-AUC of 0.8608 when trained from scratch, outperforming its spectrogram (0.8066) and waveform (0.8223) baselines. Moreover, it demonstrates superior robustness to domain shift on the challenging PASCAL dataset, maintaining an ROC-AUC of 0.7181 while the spectrogram baseline collapses (0.4873). Fusing complementary representations thus provides a strong inductive bias, enabling the creation of efficient, generalizable classifiers without requiring large-scale pre-training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICASSP 2026.

We focus on interfacing these networks with event-based data to perform online spatiotemporal classification and detection with low latency. By virtue of using structured temporal kernels and event-based data, we have the freedom to vary the sample rate of the data along with the discretization step-size of the network without additional finetuning. We experimented with three event-based benchmarks and obtained state-of-the-art results on all three by large margins with significantly smaller memory and compute costs. We achieved: 1) 99.59% accuracy with 192K parameters on the DVS128 hand gesture recognition dataset and 100% with a small additional output filter; 2) 99.58% test accuracy with 277K parameters on the AIS 2024 eye tracking challenge; and 3) 0.556 mAP with 576k parameters on the PROPHESEE 1 Megapixel Automotive Detection Dataset.</p></details> | 14 pages, 3 figures |

Mechanistic interpretability tools such as sparse autoencoders (SAEs) were developed to extract interpretable features from LLMs but lack temporal dependency modeling, instantaneous relation representation, and more importantly theoretical guarantees, undermining both the theoretical foundations and the practical confidence necessary for subsequent analyses. While causal representation learning (CRL) offers theoretically grounded approaches for uncovering latent concepts, existing methods cannot scale to LLMs' rich conceptual space due to inefficient computation. To bridge the gap, we introduce an identifiable temporal causal representation learning framework specifically designed for LLMs' high-dimensional concept space, capturing both time-delayed and instantaneous causal relations. Our approach provides theoretical guarantees and demonstrates efficacy on synthetic datasets scaled to match real-world complexity. By extending SAE techniques with our temporal causal framework, we successfully discover meaningful concept relationships in LLM activations. Our findings show that modeling both temporal and instantaneous conceptual relationships advances the interpretability of LLMs.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

However, the asynchronous sampling and irregular intervals inherent to IMTS pose two core challenges for existing methods: (1) how to accurately represent the raw information of irregular time series without introducing data distortion, and (2) how to effectively capture the complex dynamic dependencies between observation points. To address these challenges, we propose the Adaptive Spatio-Temporal Graph Interaction (ASTGI) framework. Specifically, the framework first employs a Spatio-Temporal Point Representation module to encode each discrete observation as a point within a learnable spatio-temporal embedding space. Second, a Neighborhood-Adaptive Graph Construction module adaptively builds a causal graph for each point in the embedding space via nearest neighbor search. Subsequently, a Spatio-Temporal Dynamic Propagation module iteratively updates information on these adaptive causal graphs by generating messages and computing interaction weights based on the relative spatio-temporal positions between points. Finally, a Query Point-based Prediction module generates the final forecast by aggregating neighborhood information for a new query point and performing regression. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that ASTGI outperforms various state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Representing these instructions as Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) enables planners to synthesize actionable plans. We introduce CoT-TL, a data-efficient in-context learning framework for translating natural language specifications into LTL representations. CoT-TL addresses the limitations of large language models, which typically rely on extensive fine-tuning data, by extending chain-of-thought reasoning and semantic roles to align with the requirements of formal logic creation. This approach enhances the transparency and rationale behind LTL generation, fostering user trust. CoT-TL achieves state-of-the-art accuracy across three diverse datasets in low-data scenarios, outperforming existing methods without fine-tuning or intermediate translations. To improve reliability and minimize hallucinations, we incorporate model checking to validate the syntax of the generated LTL output. We further demonstrate CoT-TL's effectiveness through ablation studies and evaluations on unseen LTL structures and formulas in a new dataset. Finally, we validate CoT-TL's practicality by integrating it into a QuadCopter for multi-step drone planning based on natural language instructions.

To resolve these problems, we propose the Temporal Mix of Experts (TMOE), a novel attention-level mechanism that reimagines key-value (K-V) pairs as local experts (each specialized in a distinct temporal context) and performs adaptive expert selection for each query via localized filtering of irrelevant timestamps. Complementing this local adaptation, a shared global expert preserves the Transformer's strength in capturing long-range dependencies. We then replace the vanilla attention mechanism in popular time-series Transformer frameworks (i.e., PatchTST and Timer) with TMOE, without extra structural modifications, yielding our specific version TimeExpert and general version TimeExpert-G. Extensive experiments on seven real-world long-term forecasting benchmarks demonstrate that TimeExpert and TimeExpert-G outperform state-of-the-art methods.

To address this, we introduce RHYTHM (Reasoning with Hierarchical Temporal Tokenization for Human Mobility), a unified framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) as general-purpose spatio-temporal predictors and trajectory reasoners. Methodologically, RHYTHM employs temporal tokenization to partition each trajectory into daily segments and encode them as discrete tokens with hierarchical attention that captures both daily and weekly dependencies, thereby significantly reducing the sequence length while preserving cyclical information. Additionally, we enrich token representations by adding pre-computed prompt embeddings for trajectory segments and prediction targets via a frozen LLM, and feeding these combined embeddings back into the LLM backbone to capture complex interdependencies. Computationally, RHYTHM freezes the pretrained LLM's backbone to reduce attention complexity and memory cost. We evaluate our model against state-of-the-art methods using three real-world datasets. Notably, RHYTHM achieves a 2.4% improvement in overall accuracy, a 5.0% increase on weekends, and a 24.6% reduction in training time.

However, in dynamic remote scenes, transmission latency during bidirectional communication creates gaps between remote perceived states and operator intent, leading to command misunderstanding and incorrect execution. To mitigate this, we introduce the Spatio-Temporal Open-Vocabulary Scene Graph (ST-OVSG), a representation that enriches open-vocabulary perception with temporal dynamics and lightweight latency annotations. ST-OVSG leverages LVLMs to construct open-vocabulary 3D object representations, and extends them into the temporal domain via Hungarian assignment with our temporal matching cost, yielding a unified spatio-temporal scene graph. A latency tag is embedded to enable LVLM planners to retrospectively query past scene states, thereby resolving local-remote state mismatches caused by transmission delays. To further reduce redundancy and highlight task-relevant cues, we propose a task-oriented subgraph filtering strategy that produces compact inputs for the planner. ST-OVSG generalizes to novel categories and enhances planning robustness against transmission latency without requiring fine-tuning. Experiments show that our method achieves 74 percent node accuracy on the Replica benchmark, outperforming ConceptGraph. Notably, in the latency-robustness experiment, the LVLM planner assisted by ST-OVSG achieved a planning success rate of 70.5 percent.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhanced Hybrid Temporal Computing Using Deterministic Summations for Ultra-Low-Power Accelerators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22999v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents an accuracy-enhanced Hybrid Temporal Computing (E-HTC) framework for ultra-low-power hardware accelerators with deterministic additions. Inspired by the recently proposed HTC architecture, which leverages pulse-rate and temporal data encoding to reduce switching activity and energy consumption but loses accuracy due to its multiplexer (MUX)-based scaled addition, we propose two bitstream addition schemes: (1) an Exact Multiple-input Binary Accumulator (EMBA), which performs precise binary accumulation, and (2) a Deterministic Threshold-based Scaled Adder (DTSA), which employs threshold logic for scaled addition. These adders are integrated into a multiplier accumulator (MAC) unit supporting both unipolar and bipolar encodings. To validate the framework, we implement two accelerators: a Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter and an 8-point Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)/iDCT engine. Results on a 4x4 MAC show that, in unipolar mode, E-HTC matches the RMSE of state-of-the-art Counter-Based Stochastic Computing (CBSC) MAC, improves accuracy by 94% over MUX-based HTC, and reduces power and area by 23% and 7% compared to MUX-based HTC and 64% and 74% compared to CBSC. In bipolar mode, E-HTC MAC achieves 2.09% RMSE -- an 83% improvement over MUX-based HTC -- and approaches CBSC's 1.40% RMSE with area and power savings of 28% and 43% vs. MUX-based HTC and about 76% vs. CBSC. In FIR experiments, both E-HTC variants yield PSNR gains of 3--5 dB (30--45% RMSE reduction) while saving 13% power and 3% area. For DCT/iDCT, E-HTC boosts PSNR by 10--13 dB (70--75% RMSE reduction) while saving area and power over both MUX- and CBSC-based designs.</p></details> | 8 pages |

In this work, we present CrossScaleNet, an innovative architecture that combines a patch-based cross-attention mechanism with multi-scale processing to achieve both high performance and enhanced temporal explainability. By embedding attention mechanisms into the training process, our model provides intrinsic explainability for temporal saliency, making its decision-making process more transparent. Traditional post-hoc methods for temporal saliency detection are computationally expensive, particularly when compared to feature importance detection. While ablation techniques may suffice for datasets with fewer features, identifying temporal saliency poses greater challenges due to its complexity. We validate CrossScaleNet on synthetic datasets with known saliency ground truth and on established public benchmarks, demonstrating the robustness of our method in identifying temporal saliency. Experiments on real-world datasets for forecasting task show that our approach consistently outperforms most transformer-based models, offering better explainability without sacrificing predictive accuracy. Our evaluations demonstrate superior performance in both temporal saliency detection and forecasting accuracy. Moreover, we highlight that existing models claiming explainability often fail to maintain strong performance on standard benchmarks. CrossScaleNet addresses this gap, offering a balanced approach that captures temporal saliency effectively while delivering state-of-the-art forecasting performance across datasets of varying complexity.</p></details> |  |

TAMMs introduces two key innovations: Temporal Adaptation Modules (TAM) enhance frozen MLLM's ability to comprehend long-range dynamics, and Semantic-Fused Control Injection (SFCI) mechanism translates this change understanding into fine-grained generative control. This synergistic design makes the understanding from the TCD task to directly inform and improve the consistency of the FSIF task. Extensive experiments demonstrate TAMMs significantly outperforms state-of-the-art specialist baselines on both tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to The Fourteenth International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2026).

In this paper, we introduce SpikeMatch, the first SSL framework for SNNs that leverages the temporal dynamics through the leakage factor of SNNs for diverse pseudo-labeling within a co-training framework. By utilizing agreement among multiple predictions from a single SNN, SpikeMatch generates reliable pseudo-labels from weakly-augmented unlabeled samples to train on strongly-augmented ones, effectively mitigating confirmation bias by capturing discriminative features with limited labels. Experiments show that SpikeMatch outperforms existing SSL methods adapted to SNN backbones across various standard benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[PSTTS: A Plug-and-Play Token Selector for Efficient Event-based Spatio-temporal Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22481v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mainstream event-based spatio-temporal representation learning methods typically process event streams by converting them into sequences of event frames, achieving remarkable performance. However, they neglect the high spatial sparsity and inter-frame motion redundancy inherent in event frame sequences, leading to significant computational overhead. Existing token sparsification methods for RGB videos rely on unreliable intermediate token representations and neglect the influence of event noise, making them ineffective for direct application to event data. In this paper, we propose Progressive Spatio-Temporal Token Selection (PSTTS), a Plug-and-Play module for event data without introducing any additional parameters. PSTTS exploits the spatio-temporal distribution characteristics embedded in raw event data to effectively identify and discard spatio-temporal redundant tokens, achieving an optimal trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, PSTTS consists of two stages, Spatial Token Purification and Temporal Token Selection. Spatial Token Purification discards noise and non-event regions by assessing the spatio-temporal consistency of events within each event frame to prevent interference with subsequent temporal redundancy evaluation. Temporal Token Selection evaluates the motion pattern similarity between adjacent event frames, precisely identifying and removing redundant temporal information. We apply PSTTS to four representative backbones UniformerV2, VideoSwin, EVMamba, and ExACT on the HARDVS, DailyDVS-200, and SeACT datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that PSTTS achieves significant efficiency improvements. Specifically, PSTTS reduces FLOPs by 29-43.6% and increases FPS by 21.6-41.3% on the DailyDVS-200 dataset, while maintaining task accuracy. Our code will be available.</p></details> |  |

Whereas existing corpora are diverse, their frequent lack of long-term temporal structure may however limit an LLM's ability to contextualize semantic and normative evolution of language and to capture diachronic variation. To support analysis and training for the latter, we introduce CHRONOBERG, a temporally structured corpus of English book texts spanning 250 years, curated from Project Gutenberg and enriched with a variety of temporal annotations. First, the edited nature of books enables us to quantify lexical semantic change through time-sensitive Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) analysis and to construct historically calibrated affective lexicons to support temporally grounded interpretation. With the lexicons at hand, we demonstrate a need for modern LLM-based tools to better situate their detection of discriminatory language and contextualization of sentiment across various time-periods. In fact, we show how language models trained sequentially on CHRONOBERG struggle to encode diachronic shifts in meaning, emphasizing the need for temporally aware training and evaluation pipelines, and positioning CHRONOBERG as a scalable resource for the study of linguistic change and temporal generalization. Disclaimer: This paper includes language and display of samples that could be offensive to readers.

| **[UrbanFeel: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Temporal and Perceptual Understanding of City Scenes through Human Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22228v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban development impacts over half of the global population, making human-centered understanding of its structural and perceptual changes essential for sustainable development. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities across various domains, existing benchmarks that explore their performance in urban environments remain limited, lacking systematic exploration of temporal evolution and subjective perception of urban environment that aligns with human perception. To address these limitations, we propose UrbanFeel, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the performance of MLLMs in urban development understanding and subjective environmental perception. UrbanFeel comprises 14.3K carefully constructed visual questions spanning three cognitively progressive dimensions: Static Scene Perception, Temporal Change Understanding, and Subjective Environmental Perception. We collect multi-temporal single-view and panoramic street-view images from 11 representative cities worldwide, and generate high-quality question-answer pairs through a hybrid pipeline of spatial clustering, rule-based generation, model-assisted prompting, and manual annotation. Through extensive evaluation of 20 state-of-the-art MLLMs, we observe that Gemini-2.5 Pro achieves the best overall performance, with its accuracy approaching human expert levels and narrowing the average gap to just 1.5\%. Most models perform well on tasks grounded in scene understanding. In particular, some models even surpass human annotators in pixel-level change detection. However, performance drops notably in tasks requiring temporal reasoning over urban development. Additionally, in the subjective perception dimension, several models reach human-level or even higher consistency in evaluating dimension such as beautiful and safety.</p></details> | 13 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Boosting LLM Serving through Spatial-Temporal GPU Resource Sharing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19516v4)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern LLM serving systems confront inefficient GPU utilization due to the fundamental mismatch between compute-intensive prefill and memory-bound decode phases. While current practices attempt to address this by organizing these phases into hybrid batches, such solutions create an inefficient tradeoff that sacrifices either throughput or latency, leaving substantial GPU resources underutilized. We identify two key root causes: 1) the prefill phase suffers from suboptimal compute utilization due to wave quantization and attention bottlenecks. 2) hybrid batches disproportionately prioritize latency over throughput, resulting in wasted compute and memory bandwidth. To mitigate the issues, we present Bullet, a novel spatial-temporal orchestration system that eliminates these inefficiencies through precise phase coordination. Bullet enables concurrent execution of prefill and decode phases, while dynamically provisioning GPU resources using real-time performance modeling. By integrating SLO-aware scheduling and adaptive resource allocation, Bullet maximizes utilization without compromising latency targets. Experimental evaluations on real-world workloads demonstrate that Bullet delivers 1.26x average throughput gains (up to 1.55x) over state-of-the-arts, while consistently meeting latency constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[TimeMosaic: Temporal Heterogeneity Guided Time Series Forecasting via Adaptive Granularity Patch and Segment-wise Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19406v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series forecasting is essential in domains such as finance, transportation, climate, and energy. However, existing patch-based methods typically adopt fixed-length segmentation, overlooking the heterogeneity of local temporal dynamics and the decoding heterogeneity of forecasting. Such designs lose details in information-dense regions, introduce redundancy in stable segments, and fail to capture the distinct complexities of short-term and long-term horizons. We propose TimeMosaic, a forecasting framework that aims to address temporal heterogeneity. TimeMosaic employs adaptive patch embedding to dynamically adjust granularity according to local information density, balancing motif reuse with structural clarity while preserving temporal continuity. In addition, it introduces segment-wise decoding that treats each prediction horizon as a related subtask and adapts to horizon-specific difficulty and information requirements, rather than applying a single uniform decoder. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that TimeMosaic delivers consistent improvements over existing methods, and our model trained on the large-scale corpus with 321 billion observations achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art TSFMs.</p></details> |  |

However, existing datasets mainly depict static AIGT detection. In this work, we introduce RedNote-Vibe, the first longitudinal (5-years) dataset for social media AIGT analysis. This dataset is sourced from Xiaohongshu platform, containing user engagement metrics (e.g., likes, comments) and timestamps spanning from the pre-LLM period to July 2025, which enables research into the temporal dynamics and user interaction patterns of AIGT. Furthermore, to detect AIGT in the context of social media, we propose PsychoLinguistic AIGT Detection Framework (PLAD), an interpretable approach that leverages psycholinguistic features. Our experiments show that PLAD achieves superior detection performance and provides insights into the signatures distinguishing human and AI-generated content. More importantly, it reveals the complex relationship between these linguistic features and social media engagement. The dataset is available at https://github.com/testuser03158/RedNote-Vibe.</p></details> |  |
| **[TAPTRv3: Spatial and Temporal Context Foster Robust Tracking of Any Point in Long Video](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18671v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, built upon TAPTRv2, we present TAPTRv3. TAPTRv2 is a simple yet effective DETR-like point tracking framework that works fine in regular videos but tends to fail in long videos. TAPTRv3 improves TAPTRv2 by addressing its shortcomings in querying high-quality features from long videos, where the target tracking points normally undergo increasing variation over time. In TAPTRv3, we propose to utilize both spatial and temporal context to bring better feature querying along the spatial and temporal dimensions for more robust tracking in long videos. For better spatial feature querying, we identify that off-the-shelf attention mechanisms struggle with point-level tasks and present Context-aware Cross-Attention (CCA). CCA introduces spatial context into the attention mechanism to enhance the quality of attention scores when querying image features. For better temporal feature querying, we introduce Visibility-aware Long-Temporal Attention (VLTA), which conducts temporal attention over past frames while considering their corresponding visibilities. This effectively addresses the feature drifting problem in TAPTRv2 caused by its RNN-like long-term modeling. TAPTRv3 surpasses TAPTRv2 by a large margin on most of the challenging datasets and obtains state-of-the-art performance. Even when compared with methods trained on large-scale extra internal data, TAPTRv3 still demonstrates superiority.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce a framework for generating moving sounds given text prompts in a controllable fashion. To enable training, we construct a synthetic dataset that records moving sounds in binaural format, their spatial trajectories, and text captions about the sound event and spatial motion. Using this dataset, we train a text-to-trajectory prediction model that outputs the three-dimensional trajectory of a moving sound source given text prompts. To generate spatial audio, we first fine-tune a pre-trained text-to-audio generative model to output temporally aligned mono sound with the trajectory. The spatial audio is then simulated using the predicted temporally-aligned trajectory. Experimental evaluation demonstrates reasonable spatial understanding of the text-to-trajectory model. This approach could be easily integrated into existing text-to-audio generative workflow and extended to moving sound generation in other spatial audio formats.</p></details> |  |
| **[MOSS-ChatV: Reinforcement Learning with Process Reasoning Reward for Video Temporal Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21113v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video reasoning has emerged as a critical capability for multimodal large language models (MLLMs), requiring models to move beyond static perception toward coherent understanding of temporal dynamics in complex scenes. Yet existing MLLMs often exhibit process inconsistency, where intermediate reasoning drifts from video dynamics even when the final answer is correct, undermining interpretability and robustness. To address this issue, we introduce MOSS-ChatV, a reinforcement learning framework with a Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)-based process reward. This rule-based reward aligns reasoning traces with temporally grounded references, enabling efficient process supervision without auxiliary reward models. We further identify dynamic state prediction as a key measure of video reasoning and construct MOSS-Video, a benchmark with annotated reasoning traces, where the training split is used to fine-tune MOSS-ChatV and the held-out split is reserved for evaluation. MOSS-ChatV achieves 87.2\% on MOSS-Video (test) and improves performance on general video benchmarks such as MVBench and MMVU. The framework consistently yields gains across different architectures, including Qwen2.5-VL and Phi-2, confirming its broad applicability. Evaluations with GPT-4o-as-judge further show that MOSS-ChatV produces more consistent and stable reasoning traces.</p></details> |  |
| **[STQE: Spatial-Temporal Attribute Quality Enhancement for G-PCC Compressed Dynamic Point Clouds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17522v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Very few studies have addressed quality enhancement for compressed dynamic point clouds. In particular, the effective exploitation of spatial-temporal correlations between point cloud frames remains largely unexplored. Addressing this gap, we propose a spatial-temporal attribute quality enhancement (STQE) network that exploits both spatial and temporal correlations to improve the visual quality of G-PCC compressed dynamic point clouds. Our contributions include a recoloring-based motion compensation module that remaps reference attribute information to the current frame geometry to achieve precise inter-frame geometric alignment, a channel-aware temporal attention module that dynamically highlights relevant regions across bidirectional reference frames, a Gaussian-guided neighborhood feature aggregation module that efficiently captures spatial dependencies between geometry and color attributes, and a joint loss function based on the Pearson correlation coefficient, designed to alleviate over-smoothing effects typical of point-wise mean squared error optimization. When applied to the latest G-PCC test model, STQE achieved improvements of 0.855 dB, 0.682 dB, and 0.828 dB in delta PSNR, with Bj{\o}ntegaard Delta rate (BD-rate) reductions of -25.2%, -31.6%, and -32.5% for the Luma, Cb, and Cr components, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal-Aware Iterative Speech Model for Dementia Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00030v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning systems often struggle with processing long sequences, where computational complexity can become a bottleneck. Current methods for automated dementia detection using speech frequently rely on static, time-agnostic features or aggregated linguistic content, lacking the flexibility to model the subtle, progressive deterioration inherent in speech production. These approaches often miss the dynamic temporal patterns that are critical early indicators of cognitive decline. In this paper, we introduce TAI-Speech, a Temporal Aware Iterative framework that dynamically models spontaneous speech for dementia detection. The flexibility of our method is demonstrated through two key innovations: 1) Optical Flow-inspired Iterative Refinement: By treating spectrograms as sequential frames, this component uses a convolutional GRU to capture the fine-grained, frame-to-frame evolution of acoustic features. 2) Cross-Attention Based Prosodic Alignment: This component dynamically aligns spectral features with prosodic patterns, such as pitch and pauses, to create a richer representation of speech production deficits linked to functional decline (IADL). TAI-Speech adaptively models the temporal evolution of each utterance, enhancing the detection of cognitive markers. Experimental results on the DementiaBank dataset show that TAI-Speech achieves a strong AUC of 0.839 and 80.6\% accuracy, outperforming text-based baselines without relying on ASR. Our work provides a more flexible and robust solution for automated cognitive assessment, operating directly on the dynamics of raw audio.</p></details> |  |
| **[RSTGCN: Railway-centric Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network for Train Delay Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01262v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of train delays is critical for efficient railway operations, enabling better scheduling and dispatching decisions. While earlier approaches have largely focused on forecasting the exact delays of individual trains, recent studies have begun exploring station-level delay prediction to support higher-level traffic management. In this paper, we propose the Railway-centric Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (RSTGCN), designed to forecast average arrival delays of all the incoming trains at railway stations for a particular time period. Our approach incorporates several architectural innovations and novel feature integrations, including train frequency-aware spatial attention, which significantly enhances predictive performance. To support this effort, we curate and release a comprehensive dataset for the entire Indian Railway Network (IRN), spanning 4,735 stations across 17 zones - the largest and most diverse railway network studied to date. We conduct extensive experiments using multiple state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating consistent improvements across standard metrics. Our work not only advances the modeling of average delay prediction in large-scale rail networks but also provides an open dataset to encourage further research in this critical domain.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncovering Alzheimer's Disease Progression via SDE-based Spatio-Temporal Graph Deep Learning on Longitudinal Brain Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21735v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying objective neuroimaging biomarkers to forecast Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression is crucial for timely intervention. However, this task remains challenging due to the complex dysfunctions in the spatio-temporal characteristics of underlying brain networks, which are often overlooked by existing methods. To address these limitations, we develop an interpretable spatio-temporal graph neural network framework to predict future AD progression, leveraging dual Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) to model the irregularly-sampled longitudinal functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. We validate our approach on two independent cohorts, including the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS-3) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Our framework effectively learns sparse regional and connective importance probabilities, enabling the identification of key brain circuit abnormalities associated with disease progression. Notably, we detect the parahippocampal cortex, prefrontal cortex, and parietal lobule as salient regions, with significant disruptions in the ventral attention, dorsal attention, and default mode networks. These abnormalities correlate strongly with longitudinal AD-related clinical symptoms. Moreover, our interpretability strategy reveals both established and novel neural systems-level and sex-specific biomarkers, offering new insights into the neurobiological mechanisms underlying AD progression. Our findings highlight the potential of spatio-temporal graph-based learning for early, individualized prediction of AD progression, even in the context of irregularly-sampled longitudinal imaging data.</p></details> |  |

We evaluate both approaches on the UCF Sports dataset, examining feature quality through multiple dimensions including classification accuracy, clustering performance, intra-class consistency, and inter-class discrimination. Our analysis reveals fundamental architectural trade-offs: DINOv3 achieves superior clustering performance (Silhouette score: 0.31 vs 0.21) and demonstrates exceptional discrimination capability (6.16x separation ratio) particularly for pose-identifiable actions, while V-JEPA2 exhibits consistent reliability across all action types with significantly lower performance variance (0.094 vs 0.288). Through action-specific evaluation, we identify that DINOv3's spatial processing architecture excels at static pose recognition but shows degraded performance on motion-dependent actions, whereas V-JEPA2's temporal modeling provides balanced representation quality across diverse action categories. These findings contribute to the understanding of architectural design choices in video analysis systems and provide empirical guidance for selecting appropriate feature extraction methods based on task requirements and reliability constraints.</p></details> |  |

We reveal that existing reinforcement learning methods, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), rely on on-policy sampling for policy updates. However, in tasks with large temporal search spaces, this strategy becomes both inefficient and limited in performance, as it often fails to identify temporally accurate solutions. To address this limitation, TempSamp-R1 leverages ground-truth annotations as off-policy supervision to provide temporally precise guidance, effectively compensating for the sparsity and misalignment in on-policy solutions. To further stabilize training and reduce variance in reward-based updates, TempSamp-R1 provides a non-linear soft advantage computation method that dynamically reshapes the reward feedback via an asymmetric transformation. By employing a hybrid Chain-of-Thought (CoT) training paradigm, TempSamp-R1 optimizes a single unified model to support both CoT and non-CoT inference modes, enabling efficient handling of queries with varying reasoning complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that TempSamp-R1 outperforms GRPO-based baselines, establishing new state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets: Charades-STA (R1@0.7: 52.9%, +2.7%), ActivityNet Captions (R1@0.5: 56.0%, +5.3%), and QVHighlights (mAP: 30.0%, +3.0%). Moreover, TempSamp-R1 shows robust few-shot generalization capabilities under limited data.

In Ireland's highly variable maritime climate, where ground-based measurement stations are sparsely distributed, selecting an appropriate solar irradiance dataset presents a significant challenge. This study introduces a novel Bayesian spatio-temporal modelling framework for predicting solar irradiance at hourly and sub-hourly (10-minute) resolutions across Ireland. Cross-validation demonstrates that our model is statistically robust across all temporal resolutions with hourly showing highest prediction precision whereas 10-minute resolution encounters higher errors but better uncertainty quantification. In separate evaluations, we compare our model against alternative data sources, including reanalysis datasets and nearest-station interpolation, and find that it consistently provides superior site-specific accuracy. At the hourly scale, our model outperforms ERA5 in agreement with ground-based observations. At the sub-hourly scale, 10-minute resolution estimates provide solar PV power outputs consistent with residential and industrial solar PV installations in Ireland. Beyond surpassing existing datasets, our model delivers full uncertainty quantification, scalability and the capacity for real-time implementation, offering a powerful tool for solar energy prediction and the estimation of losses due to overload clipping from inverter undersizing.</p></details> |  |

The physical layer maps the geographic movement of individuals, while the information layer tracks the spread of knowledge and health behavior via social interactions. We explore the interplay between physical mobility, information flow, and epidemic outcomes by simulating disease spread within this dual-structured network. Our model employs stochastic elements to mirror human behavior, mobility, and information dissemination uncertainties. Through simulations, we assess the impact of network structure, mobility patterns, and information spread speed on epidemic dynamics. The findings highlight the crucial role of effective communication in curbing disease transmission, even in highly mobile societies. Additionally, our agent-based simulation allows for real-time scenario analysis through a user interface, offering insights into leveraging physical and informational networks for epidemic control. This research sheds light on designing strategic interventions in complex social systems to manage disease outbreaks.</p></details> |  |

However, extending these models from static images to sequences of images, such as video data, introduces a significant challenge due to the temporal dependencies inherent in videos, which are essential for capturing actions and events. In this work, we introduce MoTIF (Moving Temporal Interpretable Framework), an architectural design inspired by a transformer that adapts the concept bottleneck framework for video classification and handles sequences of arbitrary length. Within the video domain, concepts refer to semantic entities such as objects, attributes, or higher-level components (e.g., 'bow', 'mount', 'shoot') that reoccur across time - forming motifs collectively describing and explaining actions. Our design explicitly enables three complementary perspectives: global concept importance across the entire video, local concept relevance within specific windows, and temporal dependencies of a concept over time. Our results demonstrate that the concept-based modeling paradigm can be effectively transferred to video data, enabling a better understanding of concept contributions in temporal contexts while maintaining competitive performance.

Temporal hypergraphs are given by ordered sequences of hyperedges representing sets of nodes interacting at given points in time. In this paper we discuss how a recently proposed model family for time-stamped hyperedges - relational hyperevent models (RHEM) - can be employed to define tailored null distributions for temporal hypergraphs and to test and control for complex dependencies in hypergraph dynamics. RHEM can be specified with a given vector of temporal hyperedge statistics - functions that quantify the structural position of hyperedges in the history of previous hyperedges - and equate expected values of these statistics with their empirically observed values. This allows, for instance, to analyze the overrepresentation or underrepresentation of temporal hyperedge configurations in a model that reproduces the observed distributions of possibly complex sub-configurations, including but going beyond node degrees. Concrete examples include, but are not limited to, preferential attachment, repetition of subsets of any given size, triadic closure, homophily, and degree assortativity for subsets of any order.</p></details> |  |

However, the amount of available robotics data in the wild is growing exponentially, creating new opportunities for large-scale data utilization. Reliable temporal task completion prediction could help automatically annotate and curate this data at scale. The Generative Value Learning (GVL) approach was recently proposed, leveraging the knowledge embedded in vision-language models (VLMs) to predict task progress from visual observations. Building upon GVL, we propose OpenGVL, a comprehensive benchmark for estimating task progress across diverse challenging manipulation tasks involving both robotic and human embodiments. We evaluate the capabilities of publicly available open-source foundation models, showing that open-source model families significantly underperform closed-source counterparts, achieving only approximately $70\%$ of their performance on temporal progress prediction tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate how OpenGVL can serve as a practical tool for automated data curation and filtering, enabling efficient quality assessment of large-scale robotics datasets.

However, most prior approaches either handle these modalities separately or rely on simplistic fusion strategies that ignore the directional, hierarchical causal interactions by which narrative observations precipitate diagnoses and propagate risk across admissions. In this paper, we propose THCM-CAL, a Temporal-Hierarchical Causal Model with Conformal Calibration. Our framework constructs a multimodal causal graph where nodes represent clinical entities from two modalities: Textual propositions extracted from notes and ICD codes mapped to textual descriptions. Through hierarchical causal discovery, THCM-CAL infers three clinically grounded interactions: intra-slice same-modality sequencing, intra-slice cross-modality triggers, and inter-slice risk propagation. To enhance prediction reliability, we extend conformal prediction to multi-label ICD coding, calibrating per-code confidence intervals under complex co-occurrences.

To bridge this gap, we propose a new evaluation task for temporal reasoning in multi-session dialogues and introduce an approach to construct a new benchmark by augmenting dialogues from LoCoMo and creating multi-choice QAs. Furthermore, we present TReMu, a new framework aimed at enhancing the temporal reasoning capabilities of LLM-agents in this context. Specifically, the framework employs time-aware memorization through timeline summarization, generating retrievable memory by summarizing events in each dialogue session with their inferred dates. Additionally, we integrate neuro-symbolic temporal reasoning, where LLMs generate Python code to perform temporal calculations and select answers. Experimental evaluations on popular LLMs demonstrate that our benchmark is challenging, and the proposed framework significantly improves temporal reasoning performance compared to baseline methods, raising from 29.83 on GPT-4o via standard prompting to 77.67 via our approach and highlighting its effectiveness in addressing temporal reasoning in multi-session dialogues.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ACL 2025 Findings</p></details> |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Directed Graph Learning for Account Takeover Fraud Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20339v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Account Takeover (ATO) fraud poses a significant challenge in consumer banking, requiring high recall under strict latency while minimizing friction for legitimate users. Production systems typically rely on tabular gradient-boosted decision trees (e.g., XGBoost) that score sessions independently, overlooking the relational and temporal structure of online activity that characterizes coordinated attacks and "fraud rings." We introduce ATLAS (Account Takeover Learning Across Spatio-Temporal Directed Graph), a framework that reformulates ATO detection as spatio-temporal node classification on a time-respecting directed session graph. ATLAS links entities via shared identifiers (account, device, IP) and regulates connectivity with time-window and recency constraints, enabling causal, time-respecting message passing and latency-aware label propagation that uses only labels available at scoring time, non-anticipative and leakage-free. We operationalize ATLAS with inductive GraphSAGE variants trained via neighbor sampling, at scale on a sessions graph with more than 100M nodes and around 1B edges. On a high-risk digital product at Capital One, ATLAS delivers 6.38 percent AUC improvement and more than 50 percent reduction in customer friction, improving fraud capture while reducing user friction.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted at NeurIPS 2025 workshop New Perspective in Graph Machine Learning (NPGML)</p></details> |

Regional MTL morphometric measures extracted from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are supportive features for the diagnosis of AD and related disorders (ADRD). Different MRI modalities have distinct advantages for MTL morphometry. Anisotropic T2-weighted (T2w) MRI is preferred for hippocampal subfields due to its higher contrast between hippocampal layers. Isotropic T1-weighted (T1w) MRI is beneficial for thickness calculation of extra-hippocampal subregions due to its stable image quality and isotropic resolution. We propose a multi-modality MTL segmentation algorithm that bridges the T1w and T2w modalities by bringing both to a nearly isotropic voxel space. Guided by high-resolution ex vivo 9.4T MRI, an upsampling model was designed for the ground truth segmentations. Combined with non-local means upsampling, this model was used to construct a nearly iso-tropic T1w and T2w MTL subregion segmentation training set, which was used to train a nnUNet model. Morphometric biomarkers extracted by this model were compared to those extracted using conventional models operating in anisotropic spaces on downstream tasks. Biomarkers extracted using the proposed model had greater ability to discriminate between individuals with mild cognitive impairment and cognitively unimpaired; and had great-er longitudinal stability. These findings suggest that the biomarkers derived from T1w and T2w MRI unsampled to nearly isotropic resolution have sig-nificant potential for improving disease diagnosis and monitoring disease progression in ADRD.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Smoothness-Aware Rate-Distortion Optimized 4D Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17336v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) effectively extends the high-speed rendering capabilities of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to represent volumetric videos. However, the large number of Gaussians, substantial temporal redundancies, and especially the absence of an entropy-aware compression framework result in large storage requirements. Consequently, this poses significant challenges for practical deployment, efficient edge-device processing, and data transmission. In this paper, we introduce a novel end-to-end RD-optimized compression framework tailored for 4DGS, aiming to enable flexible, high-fidelity rendering across varied computational platforms. Leveraging Fully Explicit Dynamic Gaussian Splatting (Ex4DGS), one of the state-of-the-art 4DGS methods, as our baseline, we start from the existing 3DGS compression methods for compatibility while effectively addressing additional challenges introduced by the temporal axis. In particular, instead of storing motion trajectories independently per point, we employ a wavelet transform to reflect the real-world smoothness prior, significantly enhancing storage efficiency. This approach yields significantly improved compression ratios and provides a user-controlled balance between compression efficiency and rendering quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving up to 91$\times$ compression compared to the original Ex4DGS model while maintaining high visual fidelity. These results highlight the applicability of our framework for real-time dynamic scene rendering in diverse scenarios, from resource-constrained edge devices to high-performance environments.

| **[Markov Decision Processes under External Temporal Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16056v4)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning Algorithms are predominantly developed for stationary environments, and the limited literature that considers nonstationary environments often involves specific assumptions about changes that can occur in transition probability matrices and reward functions. Considering that real-world applications involve environments that continuously evolve due to various external events, and humans make decisions by discerning patterns in historical events, this study investigates Markov Decision Processes under the influence of an external temporal process. We establish the conditions under which the problem becomes tractable, allowing it to be addressed by considering only a finite history of events, based on the properties of the perturbations introduced by the exogenous process. We propose and theoretically analyze a policy iteration algorithm to tackle this problem, which learns policies contingent upon the current state of the environment, as well as a finite history of prior events of the exogenous process. We show that such an algorithm is not guaranteed to converge. However, we provide a guarantee for policy improvement in regions of the state space determined by the approximation error induced by considering tractable policies and value functions. We also establish the sample complexity of least-squares policy evaluation and policy improvement algorithms that consider approximations due to the incorporation of only a finite history of temporal events. While our results are applicable to general discrete-time processes satisfying certain conditions on the rate of decay of the influence of their events, we further analyze the case of discrete-time Hawkes processes with Gaussian marks. We performed experiments to demonstrate our findings for policy evaluation and deployment in traditional control environments.</p></details> | 45 pages |

In this work, we (1) introduce a simple yet interpretable metric, termed date fragmentation ratio, that measures how faithfully a tokenizer preserves multi-digit date components; (2) release DateAugBench, a suite of 6500 examples spanning three temporal reasoning tasks: context-based date resolution, format-invariance puzzles, and date arithmetic across historical, contemporary, and future time periods; and (3) through layer-wise probing and causal attention-hop analyses, uncover an emergent date-abstraction mechanism whereby large language models stitch together the fragments of month, day, and year components for temporal reasoning. Our experiments show that excessive fragmentation correlates with accuracy drops of up to 10 points on uncommon dates like historical and futuristic dates. Further, we find that the larger the model, the faster the emergent date abstraction that heals date fragments is accomplished. Lastly, we observe a reasoning path that LLMs follow to assemble date fragments, typically differing from human interpretation (year $\rightarrow$ month $\rightarrow$ day). Our datasets and code are made publicly available \href{https://github.com/gagan3012/date-fragments}{here}.</p></details> |  |

Distillation on these pre-trained models can be viewed as the process of constructing advanced trajectories within the pair to accelerate sampling. For instance, consistency model distillation develops consistent projection functions to regulate trajectories, although sampling efficiency remains a concern. Rectified flow method enforces straight trajectories to enable faster sampling, yet relies on numerical ODE solvers, which may introduce approximation errors. In this work, we bridge the gap between the consistency model and the rectified flow method by proposing a Straight Consistent Trajectory~(SCoT) model. SCoT enjoys the benefits of both approaches for fast sampling, producing trajectories with consistent and straight properties simultaneously. These dual properties are strategically balanced by targeting two critical objectives: (1) regulating the gradient of SCoT's mapping to a constant, (2) ensuring trajectory consistency. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of SCoT.</p></details> |  |

Current solutions, whether traditional position-based control methods or reinforcement learning (RL) approaches, exhibit significant limitations. Model predictive control (MPC) is a prevalent approach for ordinary quadruped and biped robots. While MPC has demonstrated advantages in legged robots, existing studies often oversimplify the leg swing progress, relying merely on simple trajectory interpolation methods. This severely constrains the foot's environmental interaction capability, hindering tasks such as ball kicking. This study innovatively adapts the spatial-temporal trajectory planning method, which has been successful in drone applications, to bipedal robotic systems. The proposed approach autonomously generates foot trajectories that satisfy constraints on target kicking position, velocity, and acceleration while simultaneously optimizing swing phase duration. Experimental results demonstrate that the optimized trajectories closely mimic human kicking behavior, featuring a backswing motion. Simulation and hardware experiments confirm the algorithm's efficiency, with trajectory planning times under 1 ms, and its reliability, achieving nearly 100 % task completion accuracy when the soccer goal is within the range of -90{\deg} to 90{\deg}.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 8 figures, conference paper</p></details> |

We frame trajectory recovery as a proxy task, which requires models to reconstruct masked GPS traces, and introduce GLOBALTRACE, a dataset with over 4,000 real-world trajectories across diverse regions and transportation modes. Using road network as context, our prompting framework enables LLMs to generate valid paths without accessing any external navigation tools. Experiments show that LLMs outperform off-the-shelf baselines and specialized trajectory recovery models, with strong zero-shot generalization. Fine-grained analysis shows that LLMs have strong comprehension of the road network and coordinate systems, but also pose systematic biases with respect to regions and transportation modes. Finally, we demonstrate how LLMs can enhance navigation experiences by reasoning over maps in flexible ways to incorporate user preferences.</p></details> |  |

A promising direction is to leverage the generalist knowledge and reasoning capabilities of large-language models by treating unusual driving scenarios as a logical reasoning task. In this work, we present Poutine, a method that uses an off-the-shelf 3B-parameter vision-language model (VLM) - without any additional components - to achieve robust end-to-end autonomous driving via a simple and scalable training recipe. To learn strong base driving capabilities, we first train Poutine-Base using self-supervised next-token prediction over vision, language, and trajectory (VLT) tokens, leveraging both nominal and long-tail driving data. In the second stage, we fine-tune Poutine-Base using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a small set of human preference-labeled examples. We evaluated our approach on the Waymo end-to-end driving benchmark curated for long-tail scenarios. The final Poutine model achieves an RFS of 7.99 on the test set, placing 1st in the 2025 Waymo Vision-Based End-to-End Driving Challenge by a significant margin. Our results suggest that handcrafted tokenizers or custom architectural components added to base VLMs in prior work are not necessary to achieve strong driving performance. Instead, this work highlights the potential of scalable VLT pretraining combined with lightweight RL fine-tuning to enable robust and generalizable autonomous driving.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data Selection for Fine-tuning Vision Language Models via Cross Modal Alignment Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01454v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data-efficient learning aims to eliminate redundancy in large training datasets by training models on smaller subsets of the most informative examples. While data selection has been extensively explored for vision models and large language models (LLMs), it remains underexplored for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Notably, none of existing methods can outperform random selection at different subset sizes. In this work, we propose the first principled method for data-efficient instruction tuning of LVLMs. We prove that examples with similar cross-modal attention matrices during instruction tuning have similar gradients. Thus, they influence model parameters in a similar manner and convey the same information to the model during training. Building on this insight, we propose XMAS, which clusters examples based on the trajectories of the top singular values of their attention matrices obtained from fine-tuning a small proxy LVLM. By sampling a balanced subset from these clusters, XMAS effectively removes redundancy in large-scale LVLM training data. Extensive experiments show that XMAS can discard 50% of the LLaVA-665k dataset and 85% of the Vision-Flan dataset while fully preserving performance of LLaVA-1.5-7B on 10 downstream benchmarks and speeding up its training by 1.2x. This is 30% more data reduction compared to the best baseline for LLaVA-665k.

Advances in robot performance have increased the hopping height to greater than 4 meters and opened up the possibility for more complex aerial trajectories (i.e., behaviors). However, currently hopping robots do not directly control their aerial trajectory or transition to flight, eliminating the efficiency benefits of a hopping system. Here we show a real-time, computationally efficiency, non-linear drag compensated, trajectory generation methodology and accompanying Lyapunov-based controller. The combined system can create and follow complex aerial trajectories from liftoff to touchdown on horizontal and vertical surfaces, while maintaining strick control over the orientation at touchdown. The computational efficiency provides broad applicability across all size scales of hopping robots while maintaining applicability to quadrotors in general.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[GoalFlow: Goal-Driven Flow Matching for Multimodal Trajectories Generation in End-to-End Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05689v6)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose GoalFlow, an end-to-end autonomous driving method for generating high-quality multimodal trajectories. In autonomous driving scenarios, there is rarely a single suitable trajectory. Recent methods have increasingly focused on modeling multimodal trajectory distributions. However, they suffer from trajectory selection complexity and reduced trajectory quality due to high trajectory divergence and inconsistencies between guidance and scene information. To address these issues, we introduce GoalFlow, a novel method that effectively constrains the generative process to produce high-quality, multimodal trajectories. To resolve the trajectory divergence problem inherent in diffusion-based methods, GoalFlow constrains the generated trajectories by introducing a goal point. GoalFlow establishes a novel scoring mechanism that selects the most appropriate goal point from the candidate points based on scene information. Furthermore, GoalFlow employs an efficient generative method, Flow Matching, to generate multimodal trajectories, and incorporates a refined scoring mechanism to select the optimal trajectory from the candidates. Our experimental results, validated on the Navsim\cite{Dauner2024_navsim}, demonstrate that GoalFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering robust multimodal trajectories for autonomous driving. GoalFlow achieved PDMS of 90.3, significantly surpassing other methods. Compared with other diffusion-policy-based methods, our approach requires only a single denoising step to obtain excellent performance.

| **[Opt2Skill: Imitating Dynamically-feasible Whole-Body Trajectories for Versatile Humanoid Loco-Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20514v6)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humanoid robots are designed to perform diverse loco-manipulation tasks. However, they face challenges due to their high-dimensional and unstable dynamics, as well as the complex contact-rich nature of the tasks. Model-based optimal control methods offer flexibility to define precise motion but are limited by high computational complexity and accurate contact sensing. On the other hand, reinforcement learning (RL) handles high-dimensional spaces with strong robustness but suffers from inefficient learning, unnatural motion, and sim-to-real gaps. To address these challenges, we introduce Opt2Skill, an end-to-end pipeline that combines model-based trajectory optimization with RL to achieve robust whole-body loco-manipulation. Opt2Skill generates dynamic feasible and contact-consistent reference motions for the Digit humanoid robot using differential dynamic programming (DDP) and trains RL policies to track these optimal trajectories. Our results demonstrate that Opt2Skill outperforms baselines that rely on human demonstrations and inverse kinematics-based references, both in motion tracking and task success rates. Furthermore, we show that incorporating trajectories with torque information improves contact force tracking in contact-involved tasks, such as wiping a table. We have successfully transferred our approach to real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Seeing to Predicting: A Vision-Language Framework for Trajectory Forecasting and Controlled Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00806v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current video generation models produce physically inconsistent motion that violates real-world dynamics. We propose TrajVLM-Gen, a two-stage framework for physics-aware image-to-video generation. First, we employ a Vision Language Model to predict coarse-grained motion trajectories that maintain consistency with real-world physics. Second, these trajectories guide video generation through attention-based mechanisms for fine-grained motion refinement. We build a trajectory prediction dataset based on video tracking data with realistic motion patterns. Experiments on UCF-101 and MSR-VTT demonstrate that TrajVLM-Gen outperforms existing methods, achieving competitive FVD scores of 545 on UCF-101 and 539 on MSR-VTT.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Based Observer Design: A Framework for Lightweight Sensor Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00630v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient observer design and accurate sensor fusion are key in state estimation. This work proposes an optimization-based methodology, termed Trajectory Based Optimization Design (TBOD), allowing the user to easily design observers for general nonlinear systems and multi-sensor setups. Starting from parametrized observer dynamics, the proposed method considers a finite set of pre-recorded measurement trajectories from the nominal plant and exploits them to tune the observer parameters through numerical optimization. This research hinges on the classic observer's theory and Moving Horizon Estimators methodology. Optimization is exploited to ease the observer's design, providing the user with a lightweight, general-purpose sensor fusion methodology. TBOD's main characteristics are the capability to handle general sensors efficiently and in a modular way and, most importantly, its straightforward tuning procedure. The TBOD's performance is tested on a terrestrial rover localization problem, combining IMU and ranging sensors provided by Ultra Wide Band antennas, and validated through a motion-capture system. Comparison with an Extended Kalman Filter is also provided, matching its position estimation accuracy and significantly improving in the orientation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Collaborative-Distilled Diffusion Models (CDDM) for Accelerated and Lightweight Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00627v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is a fundamental task in Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) and Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), supporting efficient motion planning and real-time traffic safety management. Diffusion models have recently demonstrated strong performance in probabilistic trajectory prediction, but their large model size and slow sampling process hinder real-world deployment. This paper proposes Collaborative-Distilled Diffusion Models (CDDM), a novel method for real-time and lightweight trajectory prediction. Built upon Collaborative Progressive Distillation (CPD), CDDM progressively transfers knowledge from a high-capacity teacher diffusion model to a lightweight student model, jointly reducing both the number of sampling steps and the model size across distillation iterations. A dual-signal regularized distillation loss is further introduced to incorporate guidance from both the teacher and ground-truth data, mitigating potential overfitting and ensuring robust performance. Extensive experiments on the ETH-UCY pedestrian benchmark and the nuScenes vehicle benchmark demonstrate that CDDM achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy. The well-distilled CDDM retains 96.2% and 95.5% of the baseline model's ADE and FDE performance on pedestrian trajectories, while requiring only 231K parameters and 4 or 2 sampling steps, corresponding to 161x compression, 31x acceleration, and 9 ms latency. Qualitative results further show that CDDM generates diverse and accurate trajectories under dynamic agent behaviors and complex social interactions. By bridging high-performing generative models with practical deployment constraints, CDDM enables resource-efficient probabilistic prediction for AVs and ITS.

Operational Competence Assessment for AI-Based Trajectory Planners](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00619v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated driving functions increasingly rely on machine learning for tasks like perception and trajectory planning, requiring large, relevant datasets. The performance of these algorithms depends on how closely the training data matches the task. To ensure reliable functioning, it is crucial to know what is included in the dataset to assess the trained model's operational risk. We aim to enhance the safe use of machine learning in automated driving by developing a method to recognize situations that an automated vehicle has not been sufficiently trained on. This method also improves explainability by describing the dataset at a human-understandable level. We propose modeling driving data as knowledge graphs, representing driving scenes with entities and their relationships. These graphs are queried for specific sub-scene configurations to check their occurrence in the dataset. We estimate a vehicle's competence in a driving scene by considering the coverage and complexity of sub-scene configurations in the training set. Higher complexity scenes require greater coverage for high competence. We apply this method to the NuPlan dataset, modeling it with knowledge graphs and analyzing the coverage of specific driving scenes. This approach helps monitor the competence of machine learning models trained on the dataset, which is essential for trustworthy AI to be deployed in automated driving.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in proceedings of the 2025 IEEE International Automated Vehicle Validation Conference</p></details> |
| **[From Human Hands to Robot Arms: Manipulation Skills Transfer via Trajectory Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00491v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning diverse manipulation skills for real-world robots is severely bottlenecked by the reliance on costly and hard-to-scale teleoperated demonstrations. While human videos offer a scalable alternative, effectively transferring manipulation knowledge is fundamentally hindered by the significant morphological gap between human and robotic embodiments. To address this challenge and facilitate skill transfer from human to robot, we introduce Traj2Action,a novel framework that bridges this embodiment gap by using the 3D trajectory of the operational endpoint as a unified intermediate representation, and then transfers the manipulation knowledge embedded in this trajectory to the robot's actions. Our policy first learns to generate a coarse trajectory, which forms an high-level motion plan by leveraging both human and robot data. This plan then conditions the synthesis of precise, robot-specific actions (e.g., orientation and gripper state) within a co-denoising framework. Extensive real-world experiments on a Franka robot demonstrate that Traj2Action boosts the performance by up to 27% and 22.25% over $\pi_0$ baseline on short- and long-horizon real-world tasks, and achieves significant gains as human data scales in robot policy learning. Our project website, featuring code and video demonstrations, is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/w/Traj2Action-4A45/.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic-TreeRPO: Breaking the Independent Trajectory Bottleneck with Structured Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23352v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of Reinforcement Learning (RL) into flow matching models for text-to-image (T2I) generation has driven substantial advances in generation quality. However, these gains often come at the cost of exhaustive exploration and inefficient sampling strategies due to slight variation in the sampling group. Building on this insight, we propose Dynamic-TreeRPO, which implements the sliding-window sampling strategy as a tree-structured search with dynamic noise intensities along depth. We perform GRPO-guided optimization and constrained Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) sampling within this tree structure. By sharing prefix paths of the tree, our design effectively amortizes the computational overhead of trajectory search. With well-designed noise intensities for each tree layer, Dynamic-TreeRPO can enhance the variation of exploration without any extra computational cost. Furthermore, we seamlessly integrate Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and RL paradigm within Dynamic-TreeRPO to construct our proposed LayerTuning-RL, reformulating the loss function of SFT as a dynamically weighted Progress Reward Model (PRM) rather than a separate pretraining method. By associating this weighted PRM with dynamic-adaptive clipping bounds, the disruption of exploration process in Dynamic-TreeRPO is avoided. Benefiting from the tree-structured sampling and the LayerTuning-RL paradigm, our model dynamically explores a diverse search space along effective directions. Compared to existing baselines, our approach demonstrates significant superiority in terms of semantic consistency, visual fidelity, and human preference alignment on established benchmarks, including HPS-v2.1, PickScore, and ImageReward. In particular, our model outperforms SoTA by $4.9\%$, $5.91\%$, and $8.66\%$ on those benchmarks, respectively, while improving the training efficiency by nearly $50\%$.</p></details> | Fig.3 updated |
| **[On the joint observability of flow fields and particle properties from Lagrangian trajectories: evidence from neural data assimilation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00479v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We numerically investigate the joint observability of flow states and unknown particle properties from Lagrangian particle tracking (LPT) data. LPT offers time-resolved, volumetric measurements of particle trajectories, but experimental tracks are spatially sparse, potentially noisy, and may be further complicated by inertial transport, raising the question of whether both Eulerian fields and particle characteristics can be reliably inferred. To address this, we develop a data assimilation framework that couples an Eulerian flow representation with Lagrangian particle models, enabling the simultaneous inference of carrier fields and particle properties under the governing equations of disperse multiphase flow. Using this approach, we establish empirical existence proofs of joint observability across three representative regimes. In a turbulent boundary layer with noisy tracer tracks (St to 0), flow states and true particle positions are jointly observable. In homogeneous isotropic turbulence seeded with inertial particles (St ~ 1-5), we demonstrate simultaneous recovery of flow states and particle diameters, showing the feasibility of implicit particle characterization. In a compressible, shock-dominated flow, we report the first joint reconstructions of velocity, pressure, density, and inertial particle properties (diameter and density), highlighting both the potential and certain limits of observability in supersonic regimes. Systematic sensitivity studies further reveal how seeding density, noise level, and Stokes number govern reconstruction accuracy, yielding practical guidelines for experimental design. Taken together, these results show that the scope of LPT could be broadened to multiphase and high-speed flows, in which tracer and measurement fidelity are limited.</p></details> |  |

However, existing agent benchmarks are showing a trend of rapid ceiling-hitting by newly developed agents, making it difficult to meet the demands for evaluating agent abilities. To address this problem, we propose the Trajectory-based Validated-by-Reproducing Agent-benchmark Complexity Evolution (TRACE) framework. This framework takes an original task from an existing benchmark and encourages agents to freely explore and evolve it into a new task with higher difficulty while recording validatable agent trajectories. The framework proceeds in three stages: (1) evolutionary proposal mining, which provides task evolution proposals through preliminary exploration and divergent thinking; (2) problem formation and free exploration, where proposals are conceptualized into feasible problem candidates and the agents then explore them freely while recording their execution trajectories; and (3) multi-level validation, which ensures that the evolved tasks are accompanied by validatable and reproducible trajectories.

| **[EgoTraj-Bench: Towards Robust Trajectory Prediction Under Ego-view Noisy Observations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00405v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reliable trajectory prediction from an ego-centric perspective is crucial for robotic navigation in human-centric environments. However, existing methods typically assume idealized observation histories, failing to account for the perceptual artifacts inherent in first-person vision, such as occlusions, ID switches, and tracking drift. This discrepancy between training assumptions and deployment reality severely limits model robustness. To bridge this gap, we introduce EgoTraj-Bench, the first real-world benchmark that grounds noisy, first-person visual histories in clean, bird's-eye-view future trajectories, enabling robust learning under realistic perceptual constraints. Building on this benchmark, we propose BiFlow, a dual-stream flow matching model that concurrently denoises historical observations and forecasts future motion by leveraging a shared latent representation. To better model agent intent, BiFlow incorporates our EgoAnchor mechanism, which conditions the prediction decoder on distilled historical features via feature modulation. Extensive experiments show that BiFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing minADE and minFDE by 10-15% on average and demonstrating superior robustness. We anticipate that our benchmark and model will provide a critical foundation for developing trajectory forecasting systems truly resilient to the challenges of real-world, ego-centric perception.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporally Smooth Mesh Extraction for Procedural Scenes with Long-Range Camera Trajectories using Spacetime Octrees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13306v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The procedural occupancy function is a flexible and compact representation for creating 3D scenes. For rasterization and other tasks, it is often necessary to extract a mesh that represents the shape. Unbounded scenes with long-range camera trajectories, such as flying through a forest, pose a unique challenge for mesh extraction. A single static mesh representing all the geometric detail necessary for the full camera path can be prohibitively large. Therefore, independent meshes can be extracted for different camera views, but this approach may lead to popping artifacts during transitions. We propose a temporally coherent method for extracting meshes suitable for long-range camera trajectories in unbounded scenes represented by an occupancy function. The key idea is to perform 4D mesh extraction using a new spacetime tree structure called a binary-octree. Experiments show that, compared to existing baseline methods, our method offers superior visual consistency at a comparable cost.

| **[The Trajectory Bundle Method: Unifying Sequential-Convex Programming and Sampling-Based Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26575v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a unified framework for solving trajectory optimization problems in a derivative-free manner through the use of sequential convex programming. Traditionally, nonconvex optimization problems are solved by forming and solving a sequence of convex optimization problems, where the cost and constraint functions are approximated locally through Taylor series expansions. This presents a challenge for functions where differentiation is expensive or unavailable. In this work, we present a derivative-free approach to form these convex approximations by computing samples of the dynamics, cost, and constraint functions and letting the solver interpolate between them. Our framework includes sample-based trajectory optimization techniques like model-predictive path integral (MPPI) control as a special case and generalizes them to enable features like multiple shooting and general equality and inequality constraints that are traditionally associated with derivative-based sequential convex programming methods. The resulting framework is simple, flexible, and capable of solving a wide variety of practical motion planning and control problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Analytic Conditions for Differentiable Collision Detection in Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26459v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimization-based methods are widely used for computing fast, diverse solutions for complex tasks such as collision-free movement or planning in the presence of contacts. However, most of these methods require enforcing non-penetration constraints between objects, resulting in a non-trivial and computationally expensive problem. This makes the use of optimization-based methods for planning and control challenging. In this paper, we present a method to efficiently enforce non-penetration of sets while performing optimization over their configuration, which is directly applicable to problems like collision-aware trajectory optimization. We introduce novel differentiable conditions with analytic expressions to achieve this. To enforce non-collision between non-smooth bodies using these conditions, we introduce a method to approximate polytopes as smooth semi-algebraic sets. We present several numerical experiments to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method and compare the performance with other baseline methods recently proposed in the literature.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 8 figures.

The majority of existing placement campaigns either follow standard `space-filling' designs or relatively ad-hoc expert opinions. A key challenge to applying principled active learning in this setting is that Lagrangian observers are continuously advected through the vector field, so they make measurements at different locations and times. It is, therefore, important to consider the likely future trajectories of placed observers to account for the utility of candidate placement locations. To this end, we present BALLAST: Bayesian Active Learning with Look-ahead Amendment for Sea-drifter Trajectories. We observe noticeable benefits of BALLAST-aided sequential observer placement strategies on both synthetic and high-fidelity ocean current models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Preemptive Spatiotemporal Trajectory Adjustment for Heterogeneous Vehicles in Highway Merging Zones](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25929v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aiming at the problem of driver's perception lag and low utilization efficiency of space-time resources in expressway ramp confluence area, based on the preemptive spatiotemporal trajectory Adjustment system, from the perspective of coordinating spatiotemporal resources, the reasonable value of safe space-time distance in trajectory pre-preparation is quantitatively analyzed. The minimum safety gap required for ramp vehicles to merge into the mainline is analyzed by introducing double positioning error and spatiotemporal trajectory tracking error. A merging control strategy for autonomous driving heterogeneous vehicles is proposed, which integrates vehicle type, driving intention, and safety spatiotemporal distance. The specific confluence strategies of ramp target vehicles and mainline cooperative vehicles under different vehicle types are systematically expounded. A variety of traffic flow and speed scenarios are used for full combination simulation. By comparing the time-position-speed diagram, the vehicle operation characteristics and the dynamic difference of confluence are qualitatively analyzed, and the average speed and average delay are used as the evaluation indices to quantitatively evaluate the performance advantages of the preemptive cooperative confluence control strategy. The results show that the maximum average delay improvement rates of mainline and ramp vehicles are 90.24 % and 74.24 %, respectively. The proposed strategy can effectively avoid potential vehicle conflicts and emergency braking behaviors, improve driving safety in the confluence area, and show significant advantages in driving stability and overall traffic efficiency optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vector sketch animation generation with differentialable motion trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25857v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sketching is a direct and inexpensive means of visual expression. Though image-based sketching has been well studied, video-based sketch animation generation is still very challenging due to the temporal coherence requirement. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end automatic generation approach for vector sketch animation. To solve the flickering issue, we introduce a Differentiable Motion Trajectory (DMT) representation that describes the frame-wise movement of stroke control points using differentiable polynomial-based trajectories. DMT enables global semantic gradient propagation across multiple frames, significantly improving the semantic consistency and temporal coherence, and producing high-framerate output. DMT employs a Bernstein basis to balance the sensitivity of polynomial parameters, thus achieving more stable optimization. Instead of implicit fields, we introduce sparse track points for explicit spatial modeling, which improves efficiency and supports long-duration video processing. Evaluations on DAVIS and LVOS datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach over SOTA methods. Cross-domain validation on 3D models and text-to-video data confirms the robustness and compatibility of our approach.</p></details> | 14 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Training-Free Reward-Guided Image Editing via Trajectory Optimal Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25845v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in diffusion and flow-matching models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in high-fidelity image synthesis. A prominent line of research involves reward-guided guidance, which steers the generation process during inference to align with specific objectives. However, leveraging this reward-guided approach to the task of image editing, which requires preserving the semantic content of the source image while enhancing a target reward, is largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for training-free, reward-guided image editing. We formulate the editing process as a trajectory optimal control problem where the reverse process of a diffusion model is treated as a controllable trajectory originating from the source image, and the adjoint states are iteratively updated to steer the editing process. Through extensive experiments across distinct editing tasks, we demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing inversion-based training-free guidance baselines, achieving a superior balance between reward maximization and fidelity to the source image without reward hacking.</p></details> | 18 pages, 5 figures |
| **[SSTP: Efficient Sample Selection for Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17385v3)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is a core task in autonomous driving. However, training advanced trajectory prediction models on existing large-scale datasets is both time-consuming and computationally expensive. More critically, these datasets are highly imbalanced in scenario density, with normal driving scenes (low-moderate traffic) overwhelmingly dominating the datasets, while high-density and safety-critical cases are underrepresented. As a result, models tend to overfit low/moderate-density scenarios and perform poorly in high-density scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose the SSTP framework, which constructs a compact yet density-balanced dataset tailored to trajectory prediction. SSTP consists of two main stages: (1)Extraction, where a baseline model is pretrained for a few epochs to obtain stable gradient estimates, and the dataset is partitioned by scenario density. (2)Selection, where gradient-based scores and a submodular objective select representative samples within each density category, while biased sampling emphasizes rare high-density interactions to avoid dominance by low-density cases. This approach significantly reduces the dataset size and mitigates scenario imbalance, without sacrificing prediction accuracy. Experiments on the Argoverse 1 and Argoverse 2 datasets with recent state-of-the-art models show that SSTP achieves comparable performance to full-dataset training using only half the data while delivering substantial improvements in high-density traffic scenes and significantly reducing training time. Robust trajectory prediction depends not only on data scale but also on balancing scene density to ensure reliable performance under complex multi agent interactions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Encryption Cooperative Salvo Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17341v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces the concept of trajectory encryption in cooperative simultaneous target interception, wherein heterogeneity in guidance principles across a team of unmanned autonomous systems is leveraged as a strategic design feature. By employing a mix of heterogeneous time-to-go formulations leading to a cooperative guidance strategy, the swarm of vehicles is able to generate diverse trajectory families. This diversity expands the feasible solution space for simultaneous target interception, enhances robustness under disturbances, and enables flexible time-to-go adjustments without predictable detouring. From an adversarial perspective, heterogeneity obscures the collective interception intent by preventing straightforward prediction of swarm dynamics, effectively acting as an encryption layer in the trajectory domain. Simulations demonstrate that the swarm of heterogeneous vehicles is able to intercept a moving target simultaneously from a diverse set of initial engagement configurations.</p></details> |  |
| **[LATTE: Latent Trajectory Embedding for Diffusion-Generated Image Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03054v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of diffusion-based image generators has made it increasingly difficult to distinguish generated from real images. This erodes trust in digital media, making it critical to develop generated image detectors that remain reliable across different generators. While recent approaches leverage diffusion denoising cues, they typically rely on single-step reconstruction errors and overlook the sequential nature of the denoising process. In this work, we propose LATTE - LATent Trajectory Embedding - a novel approach that models the evolution of latent embeddings across multiple denoising steps. Instead of treating each denoising step in isolation, LATTE captures the trajectory of these representations, revealing subtle and discriminative patterns that distinguish real from generated images. Experiments on several benchmarks, such as GenImage, Chameleon, and Diffusion Forensics, show that LATTE achieves superior performance, especially in challenging cross-generator and cross-dataset scenarios, highlighting the potential of latent trajectory modeling. The code is available on the following link: https://github.com/AnaMVasilcoiu/LATTE-Diffusion-Detector.</p></details> |  |
| **[TR2-D2: Tree Search Guided Trajectory-Aware Fine-Tuning for Discrete Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25171v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning with stochastic optimal control offers a promising framework for diffusion fine-tuning, where a pre-trained diffusion model is optimized to generate paths that lead to a reward-tilted distribution. While these approaches enable optimization without access to explicit samples from the optimal distribution, they require training on rollouts under the current fine-tuned model, making them susceptible to reinforcing sub-optimal trajectories that yield poor rewards. To overcome this challenge, we introduce TRee Search Guided TRajectory-Aware Fine-Tuning for Discrete Diffusion (TR2-D2), a novel framework that optimizes reward-guided discrete diffusion trajectories with tree search to construct replay buffers for trajectory-aware fine-tuning. These buffers are generated using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and subsequently used to fine-tune a pre-trained discrete diffusion model under a stochastic optimal control objective. We validate our framework on single- and multi-objective fine-tuning of biological sequence diffusion models, highlighting the overall effectiveness of TR2-D2 for reliable reward-guided fine-tuning in discrete sequence generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Hyperparameter Tuning via Trajectory Invariance Principle](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25049v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As hyperparameter tuning becomes increasingly costly at scale, efficient tuning methods are essential. Yet principles for guiding hyperparameter tuning remain limited. In this work, we seek to establish such principles by considering a broad range of hyperparameters, including batch size, learning rate, and weight decay. We identify a phenomenon we call trajectory invariance, where pre-training loss curves, gradient noise, and gradient norm exhibit invariance--closely overlapping--with respect to a quantity that combines learning rate and weight decay. This phenomenon effectively reduces the original two-dimensional hyperparameter space to one dimension, yielding an efficient tuning rule: follow the salient direction revealed by trajectory invariance. Furthermore, we refine previous scaling laws and challenge several existing viewpoints. Overall, our work proposes new principles for efficient tuning and inspires future research on scaling laws.</p></details> |  |

Drawing on the comprehensive OpenAlex dataset and employing fractional counting to avoid double attribution in co-authored work, the research maps the relative shares of AI publications across major global players. The analysis reveals a profound restructuring of the international AI research landscape. The US and the European Union (EU27), once the undisputed and established leaders, have experienced a notable decline in relative dominance, with their combined share of publications falling from over 57% in 2000 to less than 25% in 2025. In contrast, China has undergone a dramatic ascent, expanding its global share of AI publications from under 5% in 2000 to nearly 36% by 2025, thereby emerging as the single most dominant contributor. Alongside China, India has also risen substantially, consolidating a multipolar Asian research ecosystem. These empirical findings highlight the strategic implications of concentrated research output, particularly China's capacity to shape the future direction of AI innovation and standard-setting. While the study calculates the volume of AI publications (in percentage as global share) as a measure of research dominance, it also acknowledges limitations in capturing quality and impact, suggesting scholarly research areas for future work on high-impact AI scholarship.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

While stitching is historically a strength of offline reinforcement learning, recent generative behavioural cloning (BC) methods have also shown proficiency at stitching. However, the main factors behind this are poorly understood, hindering the development of new algorithms that can reliably stitch. Focusing on diffusion planners trained via BC, we find two properties are needed to compose: \emph{positional equivariance} and \emph{local receptiveness}. We use these two properties to explain architecture, data, and inference choices in existing generative BC methods based on diffusion planning, including replanning frequency, data augmentation, and data scaling. Experimental comparisions show that (1) while locality is more important than positional equivariance in creating a diffusion planner capable of composition, both are crucial (2) enabling these properties through relatively simple architecture choices can be competitive with more computationally expensive methods such as replanning or scaling data, and (3) simple inpainting-based guidance can guide architecturally compositional models to enable generalization in goal-conditioned settings.</p></details> | 9 Pages |
| **[Trajectory Prediction via Bayesian Intention Inference under Unknown Goals and Kinematics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24928v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work introduces an adaptive Bayesian algorithm for real-time trajectory prediction via intention inference, where a target's intentions and motion characteristics are unknown and subject to change. The method concurrently estimates two critical variables: the target's current intention, modeled as a Markovian latent state, and an intention parameter that describes the target's adherence to a shortest-path policy. By integrating this joint update technique, the algorithm maintains robustness against abrupt intention shifts and unknown motion dynamics. A sampling-based trajectory prediction mechanism then exploits these adaptive estimates to generate probabilistic forecasts with quantified uncertainty. We validate the framework through numerical experiments: Ablation studies of two cases, and a 500-trial Monte Carlo analysis; Hardware demonstrations on quadrotor and quadrupedal platforms. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms non-adaptive and partially adaptive methods. The method operates in real time around 270 Hz without requiring training or detailed prior knowledge of target behavior, showcasing its applicability in various robotic systems.</p></details> |  |

While these approaches make more realistic motions possible, they are limited by the amount of available motion data, and do not incorporate prior knowledge about the physical laws governing the system and its interactions with the environment. Thus they may violate such laws, leading to divergent trajectories and sliding contacts which limit real-world stability. We address such limitations via a two-pronged learning strategy which leverages the known physics of the system and fundamental control principles. First, we encode physics priors during supervised imitation learning to promote trajectory feasibility. Second, we minimize drift at inference time by applying a proportional-integral controller directly to the generated output state. We validate our method on various locomotion behaviors for the ergoCub humanoid robot, where a physics-informed loss encourages zero contact foot velocity. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach is compatible with multiple controllers on a real robot and significantly improves the accuracy and physical constraint conformity of generated trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication at the IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), Hangzhou, China, 2025</p></details> |

Finally, we tailor a flexible model architecture to accommodate a variety of trajectory tasks, effectively capturing complex movement patterns to support broad applicability. Extensive experiments across multiple tasks and real-world datasets demonstrate that UniTraj consistently outperforms existing methods, exhibiting superior scalability, adaptability, and generalization, with WorldTrace serving as an ideal yet non-exclusive training resource.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a research paper by NeurIPS'25</p></details> |

Trajectory control represents a user-friendly task in the field of controllable video generation. However, existing methods either require substantial training resources or are specifically designed for U-Net, do not take advantage of the superior performance of DiT. To address these issues, we propose DiTraj, a simple but effective training-free framework for trajectory control in text-to-video generation, tailored for DiT. Specifically, first, to inject the object's trajectory, we propose foreground-background separation guidance: we use the Large Language Model (LLM) to convert user-provided prompts into foreground and background prompts, which respectively guide the generation of foreground and background regions in the video. Then, we analyze 3D full attention and explore the tight correlation between inter-token attention scores and position embedding. Based on this, we propose inter-frame Spatial-Temporal Decoupled 3D-RoPE (STD-RoPE). By modifying only foreground tokens' position embedding, STD-RoPE eliminates their cross-frame spatial discrepancies, strengthening cross-frame attention among them and thus enhancing trajectory control. Additionally, we achieve 3D-aware trajectory control by regulating the density of position embedding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms previous methods in both video quality and trajectory controllability.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we provide a multilinguistic, large-scale assessment of this similarity by systematically comparing 16 publicly available pretrained LLMs with human brain responses during natural language processing tasks in both English and Chinese. Specifically, we use ridge regression to assess the representational similarity between LLM embeddings and electroencephalography (EEG) signals, and analyze the similarity between the "neural trajectory" and the "LLM latent trajectory." This method captures key dynamic patterns, such as magnitude, angle, uncertainty, and confidence. Our findings highlight both similarities and crucial differences in processing strategies: (1) We show that middle-to-high layers of LLMs are central to semantic integration and correspond to the N400 component observed in EEG; (2) The brain exhibits continuous and iterative processing during reading, whereas LLMs often show discrete, stage-end bursts of activity, which suggests a stark contrast in their real-time semantic processing dynamics. This study could offer new insights into LLMs and neural processing, and also establish a critical framework for future investigations into the alignment between artificial intelligence and biological intelligence.</p></details> |  |

We address this limitation by proposing a shape-wise potential that captures the geometric structure of parameter trajectories, and an easy-to-complex matching strategy that progressively addresses parameters based on their complexity.

Traditional numerical weather prediction models, though effective, are computationally intensive and prone to error due to the chaotic nature of atmospheric systems. This study proposes a machine learning (ML) approach to forecasting tropical cyclone trajectory and status using time series data from the National Hurricane Center, including recently added best track wind radii. A two-stage ML pipeline is developed: a regression model first predicts cyclone features maximum wind speed, minimum pressure, trajectory length, and directional change using a sliding window of historical data. These outputs are then input into classification models to predict the cyclone's categorical status. Gradient boosting regression and three classifiers random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and multilayer perceptron (MLP) are evaluated. After hyperparameter tuning and synthetic minority oversampling (SMOTE), the RF classifier achieves the highest performance with 93% accuracy, outperforming SVM and MLP across precision, recall, and F1 score. The RF model is particularly robust in identifying minority cyclone statuses and minimizing false negatives. Regression results yield low mean absolute errors, with pressure and wind predictions within about 2.2 mb and 2.4 kt, respectively. These findings demonstrate that ML models, especially ensemble-based classifiers, offer an effective, scalable alternative to traditional forecasting methods, with potential for real-time cyclone prediction and integration into decision support systems.</p></details> |  |

We introduce the GPSMasked Trajectory Transformer (GPS-MTM), a foundation model for large-scale mobility data that captures patterns of normalcy in human movement. Unlike prior approaches that flatten trajectories into coordinate streams, GPS-MTM decomposes mobility into two complementary modalities: states (point-of-interest categories) and actions (agent transitions). Leveraging a bi-directional Transformer with a self-supervised masked modeling objective, the model reconstructs missing segments across modalities, enabling it to learn rich semantic correlations without manual labels. Across benchmark datasets, including Numosim-LA, Urban Anomalies, and Geolife, GPS-MTM consistently outperforms on downstream tasks such as trajectory infilling and next-stop prediction. Its advantages are most pronounced in dynamic tasks (inverse and forward dynamics), where contextual reasoning is critical. These results establish GPS-MTM as a robust foundation model for trajectory analytics, positioning mobility data as a first-class modality for large-scale representation learning. Code is released for further reference.</p></details> | 4 pages, 2 figures |

Most models predict chronological age, an imperfect surrogate for biological aging, or generate synthetic MRIs that enhance data diversity but fail to capture subject-specific trajectories. Here, we present BrainPath, a 3D generative framework that learns longitudinal brain aging dynamics during training and, at inference, predicts anatomically faithful MRIs at arbitrary timepoints from a single baseline scan. BrainPath integrates an age calibration loss, a swap learning strategy, and an age perceptual loss to preserve subtle, biologically meaningful variations. Across held-out ADNI and an independent NACC dataset, BrainPath outperforms state-of-the-art reference models in structural similarity (SSIM), mean squared error (MSE), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and MRI age-difference accuracy, while capturing realistic and temporally consistent aging patterns. Beyond methodological innovation, BrainPath enables personalized mapping of brain aging, synthetic follow-up scan prediction, and trajectory-based analyses, providing a foundation for precision modeling of brain aging and supporting research into neurodegeneration and aging interventions.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, we first construct a differentiable atmospheric scattering model that decouples haze concentration from light degradation through a network with physical parameter estimation, enabling the learning of haze-mitigated feature representations. Second, we design an adaptive scanning state space model for feature extraction. Our adaptive Mamba variant achieves a 78% inference speed increase over native Mamba while preserving long-range dependency modeling. Finally, to efficiently model pedestrian relationships, we develop a heterogeneous graph attention network, using graph matrices to model multi-granularity interactions between pedestrians and groups, combined with a spatio-temporal fusion module to capture the collaborative evolution patterns of pedestrian movements. Furthermore, we constructed a new pedestrian trajectory prediction dataset based on ETH/UCY to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Experiments show that our method reduces the minADE / minFDE metrics by 37.2% and 41.5%, respectively, compared to the SOTA models in dense haze scenarios (visibility < 30m), providing a new modeling paradigm for reliable perception in intelligent transportation systems in adverse environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Taming Masked Diffusion Language Models via Consistency Trajectory Reinforcement Learning with Fewer Decoding Step](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23924v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) have recently emerged as a promising alternative to autoregressive (AR) language models, offering properties such as parallel decoding, flexible generation orders, and the potential for fewer inference steps. Despite these advantages, decoding strategies and reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms tailored for MDLMs remain underexplored. A naive approach is to directly transfer techniques well-established for AR models to MDLMs. However, this raises an immediate question: Is such a naive transfer truly optimal? For example, 1) Block-wise and semi-AR decoding strategies are not employed during the training of MDLMs, so why do they outperform full diffusion-style decoding during inference? 2) Applying RL algorithms designed for AR models directly to MDLMs exhibits a training-inference inconsistency, since MDLM decoding are non-causal (parallel). This results in inconsistencies between the rollout trajectory and the optimization trajectory. To address these challenges, we propose EOS Early Rejection (EOSER) and Ascending Step-Size (ASS) decoding scheduler, which unlock the potential of MDLMs to perform full diffusion-style decoding, achieving competitive performance with fewer decoding steps. Additionally, we introduce Consistency Trajectory Group Relative Policy Optimization (CJ-GRPO) for taming MDLMs, which emphasizes the consistency between rollout trajectory and optimization trajectory, and reduces the optimization errors caused by skip-step optimization. We conduct extensive experiments on reasoning tasks, such as mathematical and planning benchmarks, using LLaDA-8B-Instruct. The results demonstrate that the proposed EOSER and ASS mechanisms, together with CJ-GRPO, hold significant promise for effectively and efficiently taming MDLMs. Code: https://github.com/yjyddq/EOSER-ASS-RL.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, 7 tables.

However, guiding these models effectively in reactive, closed-loop environments remains a significant challenge. Simple conditioning often fails to provide sufficient guidance in complex and dynamic driving scenarios. Recent work attempts to use typical expert driving behaviors (i.e., anchors) to guide diffusion models but relies on a truncated schedule, which introduces theoretical inconsistencies and can compromise performance. To address this, we introduce BridgeDrive, a novel anchor-guided diffusion bridge policy for closed-loop trajectory planning. Our approach provides a principled diffusion framework that effectively translates anchors into fine-grained trajectory plans, appropriately responding to varying traffic conditions. Our planner is compatible with efficient ODE solvers, a critical factor for real-time autonomous driving deployment. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on the Bench2Drive benchmark, improving the success rate by 5% over prior arts.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 7 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[Improving the Efficiency of LLM Agent Systems through Trajectory Reduction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23586v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-turn agent systems based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have been increasingly popular for software engineering tasks. While LLM agents show decent effectiveness, the high computational cost of input tokens due to the ever-growing trajectory remains an efficiency concern for their applications. Efficiency is largely neglected in existing studies and agent products, and this paper fills the gap by introducing an inference-time trajectory reduction approach to reduce the cost of agents. Through analyzing existing agent trajectories, we demonstrate that useless, redundant, and expired information is widespread in all trajectories, which can be identified and reduced without harming the agent's performance. We then design a simple yet effective trajectory reduction approach, AgentDiet, which automatically removes such waste information. We implement AgentDiet on a top-performing coding agent, and the evaluation on two LLMs and two benchmarks shows that AgentDiet can reduce input tokens by 39.9% ~ 59.7%, or the final computational cost by 21.1% ~ 35.9%, while maintaining the same agent performance. This indicates that trajectory reduction is a promising direction for agent systems.</p></details> | 20 pages, 4 figures |
| **[TGRPO :Fine-tuning Vision-Language-Action Model via Trajectory-wise Group Relative Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08440v3)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated strong cross-scenario generalization capabilities in various robotic tasks through large-scale pre-training and task-specific fine-tuning. However, their training paradigm mainly relies on manually collected successful demonstrations, making it difficult to adapt to complex environments when encountering out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios or execution biases. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) provides a closed-loop optimization framework via active trial-and-error mechanism, it suffers from sparse rewards, high variance, and unstable optimization in long-horizon robotic tasks. To address these limitations, we propose Trajectory-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (TGRPO), an online RL-based training framework for VLA models. TGRPO leverages task analysis generated by a large language model to automatically construct dense reward functions, providing fine-grained feedback to accelerate convergence and improve credit assignment. The core of our method is a group-based strategy that samples and normalizes multiple trajectories in parallel, reducing variance through relative comparison. By integrating trajectory-level and step-level advantage estimation, TGRPO captures both global and local optimization signals without relying on a value network. Experiments on four task categories of the LIBERO benchmark demonstrate that TGRPO achieves an average success rate of 80.7\%, which is 4.2\% higher than that of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and outperforms other representative RL-based post-training methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[BEV-VLM: Trajectory Planning via Unified BEV Abstraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25249v1)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces BEV-VLM, a novel framework for trajectory planning in autonomous driving that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with Bird's-Eye View (BEV) feature maps as visual inputs. Unlike conventional approaches that rely solely on raw visual data such as camera images, our method utilizes highly compressed and informative BEV representations, which are generated by fusing multi-modal sensor data (e.g., camera and LiDAR) and aligning them with HD Maps. This unified BEV-HD Map format provides a geometrically consistent and rich scene description, enabling VLMs to perform accurate trajectory planning. Experimental results on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate 44.8% improvements in planning accuracy and complete collision avoidance. Our work highlights that VLMs can effectively interpret processed visual representations like BEV features, expanding their applicability beyond raw images in trajectory planning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Discrete Diffusion Trajectory Alignment via Stepwise Decomposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04832v2)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discrete diffusion models have demonstrated great promise in modeling various sequence data, ranging from human language to biological sequences. Inspired by the success of RL in language models, there is growing interest in further improving the models by alignment with a certain reward. In this work, we propose an offline preference optimization method to approach trajectory alignment for discrete diffusion models. Instead of applying the reward on the final output and backpropagating the gradient to the entire denoising process, we decompose the problem into a set of stepwise alignment objectives by matching the per-step posterior. This framework enables efficient diffusion optimization, is compatible with arbitrary reward functions, and importantly, yields an equivalent optimal solution under additive factorization of the trajectory reward. Experiments across multiple domains including DNA sequence design, protein inverse folding, and language modeling consistently demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Notably, it achieves an up to 12\% improvement over the most competitive RL-based baseline in terms of predicted activity on DNA sequence design, and further improves the GSM8K score from 78.6 to 81.2 on LLaDA-8B-Instruct for language modeling.</p></details> | 22 pages, 3 figures |
| **[From Evidence to Trajectory: Abductive Reasoning Path Synthesis for Training Retrieval-Augmented Generation Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23071v1)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation agents development is hindered by the lack of process-level supervision to effectively guide agentic capabilities like task decomposition, retriever invocation, and stepwise decision-making. While reinforcement learning offers a potential solution, it suffers from sparse rewards and the limited reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Meanwhile, existing data synthesis methods only produce chain-of-thought rationales and fail to model environmental interactions. In this paper, we propose EviPath, an evidence-anchored reasoning path synthesis paradigm for RAG agent development. EviPath comprises: (i) Abductive Subtask Planning, which decomposes the problem into sub-questions and iteratively plans an optimal solution path based on the dependencies between them; (ii) Faithful Sub-question Answering, which uses supporting evidence to construct a proxy environment to generate reasoning thoughts and answers for each sub-question; and (iii) Conversational Fine-Tuning, which formats the complete agent-environment interaction trajectory into a dialogue format suitable for Supervised Fine-Tuning. EviPath allows LLMs to learn complex reasoning and tool-use capabilities directly from synthesized data. Extensive experiments on widely-used question-answering benchmarks show that an 8B parameter model trained with EviPath-synthesized data significantly and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with a double-digit absolute EM gain of 14.7% in open-domain question answering.</p></details> |  |

With consideration of this, a number of recent neural network models leverage inductive biases from classical mechanics to encourage model interpretability and ensure forecasted states are physical. However, in general, these models are designed to capture the dynamics of a single system with fixed physical parameters, from state-space measurements of a known configuration space. In this paper we introduce Symplectic Phase Space GAN (SPS-GAN) which can capture the dynamics of multiple systems, and generalize to unseen physical parameters from. Moreover, SPS-GAN does not require prior knowledge of the system configuration space. In fact, SPS-GAN can discover the configuration space structure of the system from arbitrary measurement types (e.g., state-space measurements, video frames). To achieve physically plausible generation, we introduce a novel architecture which embeds a Hamiltonian neural network recurrent module in a conditional GAN backbone. To discover the structure of the configuration space, we optimize the conditional time-series GAN objective with an additional physically motivated term to encourages a sparse representation of the configuration space. We demonstrate the utility of SPS-GAN for trajectory prediction, video generation and symmetry discovery. Our approach captures multiple systems and achieves performance on par with supervised models designed for single systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[JointDiff: Bridging Continuous and Discrete in Multi-Agent Trajectory Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22522v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models often treat continuous data and discrete events as separate processes, creating a gap in modeling complex systems where they interact synchronously. To bridge this gap, we introduce JointDiff, a novel diffusion framework designed to unify these two processes by simultaneously generating continuous spatio-temporal data and synchronous discrete events. We demonstrate its efficacy in the sports domain by simultaneously modeling multi-agent trajectories and key possession events. This joint modeling is validated with non-controllable generation and two novel controllable generation scenarios: weak-possessor-guidance, which offers flexible semantic control over game dynamics through a simple list of intended ball possessors, and text-guidance, which enables fine-grained, language-driven generation. To enable the conditioning with these guidance signals, we introduce CrossGuid, an effective conditioning operation for multi-agent domains. We also share a new unified sports benchmark enhanced with textual descriptions for soccer and football datasets. JointDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating that joint modeling is crucial for building realistic and controllable generative models for interactive systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond the Proxy: Trajectory-Distilled Guidance for Offline GFlowNet Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20110v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) are effective at sampling diverse, high-reward objects, but in many real-world settings where new reward queries are infeasible, they must be trained from offline datasets. The prevailing proxy-based training methods are susceptible to error propagation, while existing proxy-free approaches often use coarse constraints that limit exploration. To address these issues, we propose Trajectory-Distilled GFlowNet (TD-GFN), a novel proxy-free training framework. TD-GFN learns dense, transition-level edge rewards from offline trajectories via inverse reinforcement learning to provide rich structural guidance for efficient exploration. Crucially, to ensure robustness, these rewards are used indirectly to guide the policy through DAG pruning and prioritized backward sampling of training trajectories. This ensures that final gradient updates depend only on ground-truth terminal rewards from the dataset, thereby preventing the error propagation. Experiments show that TD-GFN significantly outperforms a broad range of existing baselines in both convergence speed and final sample quality, establishing a more robust and efficient paradigm for offline GFlowNet training.</p></details> |  |
| **[AnchDrive: Bootstrapping Diffusion Policies with Hybrid Trajectory Anchors for End-to-End Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20253v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end multi-modal planning has become a transformative paradigm in autonomous driving, effectively addressing behavioral multi-modality and the generalization challenge in long-tail scenarios. We propose AnchDrive, a framework for end-to-end driving that effectively bootstraps a diffusion policy to mitigate the high computational cost of traditional generative models. Rather than denoising from pure noise, AnchDrive initializes its planner with a rich set of hybrid trajectory anchors. These anchors are derived from two complementary sources: a static vocabulary of general driving priors and a set of dynamic, context-aware trajectories. The dynamic trajectories are decoded in real-time by a Transformer that processes dense and sparse perceptual features. The diffusion model then learns to refine these anchors by predicting a distribution of trajectory offsets, enabling fine-grained refinement. This anchor-based bootstrapping design allows for efficient generation of diverse, high-quality trajectories. Experiments on the NAVSIM benchmark confirm that AnchDrive sets a new state-of-the-art and shows strong generalizability</p></details> |  |
| **[R-Stitch: Dynamic Trajectory Stitching for Efficient Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17307v4)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chain-of-thought (CoT) enhances the problem-solving ability of large language models (LLMs) but incurs substantial inference cost due to long autoregressive trajectories. Existing acceleration strategies either shorten traces via early stopping or compression, or adopt speculative decoding with a smaller model. However, speculative decoding provides limited gains when model agreement is low and rigidly enforces token-level consistency, overlooking the observation that some smaller models, when correct, produce significantly more concise reasoning traces that could reduce inference length. We introduce R-Stitch, a training-free hybrid decoding framework that leverages token-level entropy as an uncertainty proxy to delegate computation between a small language model (SLM) and an LLM. Our analysis shows that high-entropy tokens are more likely to induce errors, motivating an entropy-guided routing strategy that lets the SLM efficiently handle low-entropy tokens while delegating uncertain ones to the LLM, thereby avoiding full rollbacks and preserving answer quality. We further extend this design with R-Stitch$^{+}$, which learns an adaptive routing policy to adjust the token budget dynamically beyond fixed thresholds. By jointly reducing per-token decoding complexity and the number of generated tokens, our method achieves substantial acceleration with negligible accuracy loss. Concretely, it attains peak speedups of 3.00$\times$ on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, 3.85$\times$ on 14B, and 4.10$\times$ on QWQ-32B while maintaining accuracy comparable to full LLM decoding. Moreover, it naturally enables adaptive efficiency--accuracy trade-offs that can be tailored to diverse computational budgets without retraining.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Flexible Forward Trajectories for Masked Molecular Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16790v4)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have achieved notable progress in modeling discrete data, while their potential in molecular generation remains underexplored. In this work, we explore their potential and introduce the surprising result that naively applying standards MDMs severely degrades the performance. We identify the critical cause of this issue as a state-clashing problem-where the forward diffusion of distinct molecules collapse into a common state, resulting in a mixture of reconstruction targets that cannot be learned using typical reverse diffusion process with unimodal predictions. To mitigate this, we propose Masked Element-wise Learnable Diffusion (MELD) that orchestrates per-element corruption trajectories to avoid collision between distinct molecular graphs. This is achieved through a parameterized noise scheduling network that assigns distinct corruption rates to individual graph elements, i.e., atoms and bonds. Extensive experiments on diverse molecular benchmarks reveal that MELD markedly enhances overall generation quality compared to element-agnostic noise scheduling, increasing the chemical validity of vanilla MDMs on ZINC250K from 15% to 93%, Furthermore, it achieves state-of-the-art property alignment in conditional generation tasks.</p></details> |  |

In FedAVG multi-step scenarios, attackers observe only aggregated gradients, making data reconstruction challenging. Existing surrogate model methods like SME assume linear parameter trajectories, but we demonstrate this severely underestimates SGD's nonlinear complexity, fundamentally limiting attack effectiveness. We propose Non-Linear Surrogate Model Extension (NL-SME), the first method to introduce nonlinear parametric trajectory modeling for GIAs. Our approach replaces linear interpolation with learnable quadratic B\'ezier curves that capture SGD's curved characteristics through control points, combined with regularization and dvec scaling mechanisms for enhanced expressiveness. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100 and FEMNIST datasets show NL-SME significantly outperforms baselines across all metrics, achieving order-of-magnitude improvements in cosine similarity loss while maintaining computational efficiency.This work exposes heightened privacy vulnerabilities in FL's multi-step update paradigm and offers novel perspectives for developing robust defense strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[FAST: Foreground-aware Diffusion with Accelerated Sampling Trajectory for Segmentation-oriented Anomaly Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20295v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Industrial anomaly segmentation relies heavily on pixel-level annotations, yet real-world anomalies are often scarce, diverse, and costly to label. Segmentation-oriented industrial anomaly synthesis (SIAS) has emerged as a promising alternative; however, existing methods struggle to balance sampling efficiency and generation quality. Moreover, most approaches treat all spatial regions uniformly, overlooking the distinct statistical differences between anomaly and background areas. This uniform treatment hinders the synthesis of controllable, structure-specific anomalies tailored for segmentation tasks. In this paper, we propose FAST, a foreground-aware diffusion framework featuring two novel modules: the Anomaly-Informed Accelerated Sampling (AIAS) and the Foreground-Aware Reconstruction Module (FARM). AIAS is a training-free sampling algorithm specifically designed for segmentation-oriented industrial anomaly synthesis, which accelerates the reverse process through coarse-to-fine aggregation and enables the synthesis of state-of-the-art segmentation-oriented anomalies in as few as 10 steps. Meanwhile, FARM adaptively adjusts the anomaly-aware noise within the masked foreground regions at each sampling step, preserving localized anomaly signals throughout the denoising trajectory. Extensive experiments on multiple industrial benchmarks demonstrate that FAST consistently outperforms existing anomaly synthesis methods in downstream segmentation tasks. We release the code at: https://github.com/Chhro123/fast-foreground-aware-anomaly-synthesis.</p></details> |  |

Common maneuvers dominate datasets, while dangerous or rare scenarios are sparse. This imbalance can bias models toward the frequent cases and degrade performance on critical scenarios. To tackle this problem, we compare balancing strategies for sampling training data and find reweighting by trajectory pattern an effective approach. We then present FlowDrive, a flow-matching trajectory planner that learns a conditional rectified flow to map noise directly to trajectory distributions with few flow-matching steps. We further introduce moderated, in-the-loop guidance that injects small perturbation between flow steps to systematically increase trajectory diversity while remaining scene-consistent. On nuPlan and the interaction-focused interPlan benchmarks, FlowDrive achieves state-of-the-art results among learning-based planners and approaches methods with rule-based refinements. After adding moderated guidance and light post-processing (FlowDrive*), it achieves overall state-of-the-art performance across nearly all benchmark splits.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce a framework for generating moving sounds given text prompts in a controllable fashion. To enable training, we construct a synthetic dataset that records moving sounds in binaural format, their spatial trajectories, and text captions about the sound event and spatial motion. Using this dataset, we train a text-to-trajectory prediction model that outputs the three-dimensional trajectory of a moving sound source given text prompts. To generate spatial audio, we first fine-tune a pre-trained text-to-audio generative model to output temporally aligned mono sound with the trajectory. The spatial audio is then simulated using the predicted temporally-aligned trajectory. Experimental evaluation demonstrates reasonable spatial understanding of the text-to-trajectory model. This approach could be easily integrated into existing text-to-audio generative workflow and extended to moving sound generation in other spatial audio formats.</p></details> |  |
| **[Plan-R1: Safe and Feasible Trajectory Planning as Language Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17659v3)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safe and feasible trajectory planning is critical for real-world autonomous driving systems. However, existing learning-based planners rely heavily on expert demonstrations, which not only lack explicit safety awareness but also risk inheriting undesirable behaviors such as speeding from suboptimal human driving data. Inspired by the success of large language models, we propose Plan-R1, a two-stage trajectory planning framework that decouples principle alignment from behavior learning. In the first stage, a general trajectory predictor is pre-trained on expert data to capture diverse, human-like driving behaviors. In the second stage, the model is fine-tuned with rule-based rewards using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), explicitly aligning ego planning with principles such as safety, comfort, and traffic rule compliance. This two-stage paradigm retains human-like behaviors while enhancing safety awareness and discarding undesirable patterns from demonstrations. Furthermore, we identify a key limitation of directly applying GRPO to planning: group-wise normalization erases cross-group scale differences, causing rare, high-variance safety-violation groups to have similar advantages as abundant low-variance safe groups, thereby suppressing optimization for safety-critical objectives. To address this, we propose Variance-Decoupled GRPO (VD-GRPO), which replaces normalization with centering and fixed scaling to preserve absolute reward magnitudes, ensuring that safety-critical objectives remain dominant throughout training. Experiments on the nuPlan benchmark demonstrate that Plan-R1 significantly improves planning safety and feasibility, achieving state-of-the-art performance, particularly in realistic reactive settings.

Dataset augmentation by adding synthetically generated trajectory data is necessary to develop a more robust aircraft trajectory model and ensure that the trajectory dataset is sufficient and balanced. We propose a novel framework called ATRADA for aircraft trajectory dataset augmentation. In the proposed framework, a Transformer encoder learns the underlying patterns in the original trajectory dataset and converts each data point into a context vector in the learned latent space. The converted dataset is projected to reduced dimensions using principal component analysis (PCA), and a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is applied to fit the probability distribution of the data points in the reduced-dimensional space. Finally, new samples are drawn from the fitted GMM, the dimension of the samples is reverted to the original dimension, and the samples are decoded with a multi-layer perceptron (MLP). Several experiments demonstrate that the framework effectively generates new, high-quality synthetic aircraft trajectory data, which were compared to the results of several baselines.</p></details> |  |

Anticipating Future Motion by Generating Point Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21592v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of forecasting motion from a single image, i.e., predicting how objects in the world are likely to move, without the ability to observe other parameters such as the object velocities or the forces applied to them. We formulate this task as conditional generation of dense trajectory grids with a model that closely follows the architecture of modern video generators but outputs motion trajectories instead of pixels. This approach captures scene-wide dynamics and uncertainty, yielding more accurate and diverse predictions than prior regressors and generators. We extensively evaluate our method on simulated data, demonstrate its effectiveness on downstream applications such as robotics, and show promising accuracy on real-world intuitive physics datasets. Although recent state-of-the-art video generators are often regarded as world models, we show that they struggle with forecasting motion from a single image, even in simple physical scenarios such as falling blocks or mechanical object interactions, despite fine-tuning on such data. We show that this limitation arises from the overhead of generating pixels rather than directly modeling motion.</p></details> |  |

The framework extends traditional path planning from Euclidean position spaces to the Lie group $\mathrm{SE}(3)$, allowing joint learning of translational motion and rotational dynamics. A modified Bellman-based operator is introduced to support reinforcement learning (RL) policy updates while leveraging prior trajectory information for improved convergence. $\text{GMP}^{3}$ is designed as a distributed framework in which agents influence each other and share policy information along the trajectory: each agent refines its assigned segment and shares with its neighbors via a consensus-based scheme, enabling cooperative policy updates and convergence toward a path shaped globally even under kinematic constraints. We also propose DroneManager, a modular ground control software that interfaces the planner with real UAV platforms via the MAVLink protocol, supporting real-time deployment and feedback. Simulation studies and indoor flight experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in constrained 3D environments, demonstrating reliable obstacle avoidance and smooth, feasible trajectories across both position and orientation.

Existing approaches often attempt to learn these motions separately, which may lead to confusion regarding the relative motion between the camera and the objects. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that integrates both camera and object motions by converting them into the motion of corresponding pixels. Utilizing a stable diffusion network, we effectively learn reference motion maps in relation to the specified camera trajectory. These maps, along with an extracted semantic object prior, are then fed into an image-to-video network to generate the desired video that can accurately follow the designated camera trajectory while maintaining consistent object motions. Extensive experiments verify that our model outperforms SOTA methods by a large margin.</p></details> | ICME2025 |

However, we find that the perpendicular component of the pushing force from negative samples in contrastive learning is a double-edged sword: it contains rich supplementary information from negative samples, yet its unconstrained nature causes optimization trajectory drift and training instability. To address this, we propose Support Vector Regularization (SVR), a method that introduces an auxiliary support vector to control this perpendicular component, aiming to harness its rich information while mitigating the associated trajectory drift. The efficacy of SVR is critically governed by its semantic radius, for which we explore two unsupervised modeling strategies: direct parameterization and an adaptive radius predictor module enhanced with constraints to improve its predicting accuracy. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method surpasses widely used baselines like InfoNCE and SigLIP loss across classification, monolingual retrieval, and multilingual retrieval on standard audio-text datasets. Both the theoretical analysis and the experimental results on optimizing trajectory drift validate the correctness and effectiveness of our SVR method.</p></details> |  |

However, predicting multi-agent flight trajectories is inherently challenging. One of the major difficulties is modeling both the individual aircraft behaviors over time and the complex interactions between flights. Generating explainable prediction outcomes is also a challenge. Therefore, we propose a Multi-Agent Inverted Transformer, MAIFormer, as a novel neural architecture that predicts multi-agent flight trajectories. The proposed framework features two key attention modules: (i) masked multivariate attention, which captures spatio-temporal patterns of individual aircraft, and (ii) agent attention, which models the social patterns among multiple agents in complex air traffic scenes. We evaluated MAIFormer using a real-world automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast flight trajectory dataset from the terminal airspace of Incheon International Airport in South Korea. The experimental results show that MAIFormer achieves the best performance across multiple metrics and outperforms other methods. In addition, MAIFormer produces prediction outcomes that are interpretable from a human perspective, which improves both the transparency of the model and its practical utility in air traffic control.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, submitted for IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation System</p></details> |
| **[MemLens: Uncovering Memorization in LLMs with Activation Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20909v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are commonly evaluated on challenging benchmarks such as AIME and Math500, which are susceptible to contamination and risk of being memorized. Existing detection methods, which primarily rely on surface-level lexical overlap and perplexity, demonstrate low generalization and degrade significantly when encountering implicitly contaminated data. In this paper, we propose MemLens (An Activation Lens for Memorization Detection) to detect memorization by analyzing the probability trajectories of numeric tokens during generation. Our method reveals that contaminated samples exhibit ``shortcut'' behaviors, locking onto an answer with high confidence in the model's early layers, whereas clean samples show more gradual evidence accumulation across the model's full depth. We observe that contaminated and clean samples exhibit distinct and well-separated reasoning trajectories. To further validate this, we inject carefully designed samples into the model through LoRA fine-tuning and observe the same trajectory patterns as in naturally contaminated data. These results provide strong evidence that MemLens captures genuine signals of memorization rather than spurious correlations.</p></details> | <details><summary>20pag...</summary><p>20pages, 11 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

We address this problem by proposing the Joint Flow Trajectory Optimization (JFTO) framework for grasp pose generation and object trajectory imitation under the video-based Learning-from-Demonstration (LfD) paradigm. Rather than directly imitating human hand motions, our method treats demonstrations as object-centric guides, balancing three objectives: (i) selecting a feasible grasp pose, (ii) generating object trajectories consistent with demonstrated motions, and (iii) ensuring collision-free execution within robot kinematics. To capture the multimodal nature of demonstrations, we extend flow matching to $\SE(3)$ for probabilistic modeling of object trajectories, enabling density-aware imitation that avoids mode collapse. The resulting optimization integrates grasp similarity, trajectory likelihood, and collision penalties into a unified differentiable objective. We validate our approach in both simulation and real-world experiments across diverse real-world manipulation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReasonFlux-PRM: Trajectory-Aware PRMs for Long Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18896v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Process Reward Models (PRMs) have recently emerged as a powerful framework for supervising intermediate reasoning steps in large language models (LLMs). Previous PRMs are primarily trained on model final output responses and struggle to evaluate intermediate thinking trajectories robustly, especially in the emerging setting of trajectory-response outputs generated by frontier reasoning models like Deepseek-R1. In this work, we introduce ReasonFlux-PRM, a novel trajectory-aware PRM explicitly designed to evaluate the trajectory-response type of reasoning traces. ReasonFlux-PRM incorporates both step-level and trajectory-level supervision, enabling fine-grained reward assignment aligned with structured chain-of-thought data. We adapt ReasonFlux-PRM to support reward supervision under both offline and online settings, including (i) selecting high-quality model distillation data for downstream supervised fine-tuning of smaller models, (ii) providing dense process-level rewards for policy optimization during reinforcement learning, and (iii) enabling reward-guided Best-of-N test-time scaling. Empirical results on challenging downstream benchmarks such as AIME, MATH500, and GPQA-Diamond demonstrate that ReasonFlux-PRM-7B selects higher quality data than strong PRMs (e.g., Qwen2.5-Math-PRM-72B) and human-curated baselines. Furthermore, our derived ReasonFlux-PRM-7B yields consistent performance improvements, achieving average gains of 12.1% in supervised fine-tuning, 4.5% in reinforcement learning, and 6.3% in test-time scaling. We also release our efficient ReasonFlux-PRM-1.5B for resource-constrained applications and edge deployment.

However, they are computationally expensive because they sample a trajectory of trajectories: a diffusion$/$flow trajectory of action trajectories. They discard intermediate action trajectories, and must wait for the sampling process to complete before any actions can be executed on the robot. We simplify diffusion$/$flow policies by treating action trajectories as flow trajectories. Instead of starting from pure noise, our algorithm samples from a narrow Gaussian around the last action. Then, it incrementally integrates a velocity field learned via flow matching to produce a sequence of actions that constitute a single trajectory. This enables actions to be streamed to the robot on-the-fly during the flow sampling process, and is well-suited for receding horizon policy execution. Despite streaming, our method retains the ability to model multi-modal behavior. We train flows that stabilize around demonstration trajectories to reduce distribution shift and improve imitation learning performance. Streaming flow policy outperforms prior methods while enabling faster policy execution and tighter sensorimotor loops for learning-based robot control.

The many spatial and temporal constraints make finding an initial guess for a numerical solver difficult. Graphs of Convex Sets (GCS) and the recently developed Space-Time Graphs of Convex Sets (ST-GCS) enable us to generate minimum distance collision-free trajectories without providing an initial guess to the solver. We also explore the derivation of general GCS-compatible constraints and document an intuitive strategy for adapting general constraints to the framework. We show that ST-GCS produces equivalent trajectories to the standard GCS formulation when the environment is static, as well as globally optimal trajectories in cluttered dynamic environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages with references, 20 figures</p></details> |

Unlike prior approaches that rely on discretized ESDF grids with interpolation, our method directly optimizes smooth trajectories represented by fifth-order polynomials over a continuous neural ESDF, ensuring precise gradient information throughout the entire trajectory. The framework integrates a two-stage nonlinear optimization pipeline that balances efficiency, safety and smoothness. Experimental results demonstrate that C-3TO produces collision-aware and dynamically feasible trajectories. Moreover, its flexibility in defining local window sizes and optimization parameters enables straightforward adaptation to diverse user's needs without compromising performance. By combining continuous trajectory parameterization with a continuously updated neural ESDF, C-3TO establishes a robust and generalizable foundation for safe and efficient local replanning in aerial robotics.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, submitted to ICRA 2026</p></details> |

Existing corridor based planners which rely on decomposition of the free space into collision free subsets scale poorly with environmental complexity and require explicit allocations of time windows to trajectory segments. We introduce a new trajectory parameterization that represents trajectories in a nonconvex collision free corridor as being in a convex cartesian product of balls. This parameterization allows us to decouple problem size from geometric complexity of the solution and naturally avoids explicit time allocation by allowing trajectories to evolve continuously inside ellipsoidal corridors. Building on this representation, we formulate the Orthogonal Trust Region Problem (Orth-TRP), a specialized convex program with separable block constraints, and develop a solver that exploits this parallel structure and the unique structure of each parallel subproblem for efficient optimization. Experiments on a quadrotor trajectory planning benchmark show that our approach produces smoother trajectories and lower runtimes than state-of-the-art corridor based planners, especially in highly complicated environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Augmenting Multi-Agent Communication with State Delta Trajectory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19209v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent techniques such as role playing or multi-turn debates have been shown to be effective in improving the performance of large language models (LLMs) in downstream tasks. Despite their differences in workflows, existing multi-agent systems constructed from a single base LLM mostly use natural language for agent communication. While this is appealing for its simplicity and interpretability, it also introduces inevitable information loss as one model must down sample its continuous state vectors to discrete tokens before transferring them to the other model. Such losses are particularly significant when the information to transfer is not simple facts, but reasoning logics or abstractive thoughts. To tackle this problem, we propose a new communication protocol that transfers both natural language tokens and token-wise state transition trajectory from one agent to another. Particularly, compared to the actual state value, we find that the sequence of state changes in LLMs after generating each token can better reflect the information hidden behind the inference process. We propose a State Delta Encoding (SDE) method to represent state transition trajectories. The experimental results show that multi-agent systems with SDE achieve SOTA performance compared to other communication protocols, particularly in tasks that involve complex reasoning.</p></details> | 22 pages, 5 figures |

We identify a new vulnerability, LLMs generating convincing career trajectories in fake resumes and explore effective detection methods. To address this challenge, we construct a dataset of machine-generated career trajectories using LLMs and various methods, and demonstrate that conventional text-based detectors perform poorly on structured career data. We propose CareerScape, a novel heterogeneous, hierarchical multi-layer graph framework that models career entities and their relations in a unified global graph built from genuine resumes. Unlike conventional classifiers that treat each instance independently, CareerScape employs a structure-aware framework that augments user-specific subgraphs with trusted neighborhood information from a global graph, enabling the model to capture both global structural patterns and local inconsistencies indicative of synthetic career paths. Experimental results show that CareerScape outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 5.8-85.0% relatively, highlighting the importance of structure-aware detection for machine-generated content.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2025 Main</p></details> |
| **[Graph Enhanced Trajectory Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18386v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory anomaly detection is essential for identifying unusual and unexpected movement patterns in applications ranging from intelligent transportation systems to urban safety and fraud prevention. Existing methods only consider limited aspects of the trajectory nature and its movement space by treating trajectories as sequences of sampled locations, with sampling determined by positioning technology, e.g., GPS, or by high-level abstractions such as staypoints. Trajectories are analyzed in Euclidean space, neglecting the constraints and connectivity information of the underlying movement network, e.g., road or transit networks. The proposed Graph Enhanced Trajectory Anomaly Detection (GETAD) framework tightly integrates road network topology, segment semantics, and historical travel patterns to model trajectory data. GETAD uses a Graph Attention Network to learn road-aware embeddings that capture both physical attributes and transition behavior, and augments these with graph-based positional encodings that reflect the spatial layout of the road network. A Transformer-based decoder models sequential movement, while a multiobjective loss function combining autoregressive prediction and supervised link prediction ensures realistic and structurally coherent representations. To improve the robustness of anomaly detection, we introduce Confidence Weighted Negative Log Likelihood (CW NLL), an anomaly scoring function that emphasizes high-confidence deviations. Experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that GETAD achieves consistent improvements over existing methods, particularly in detecting subtle anomalies in road-constrained environments. These results highlight the benefits of incorporating graph structure and contextual semantics into trajectory modeling, enabling more precise and context-aware anomaly detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[ACTIVE: Continuous Similarity Search for Vessel Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01142v2)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Publicly available vessel trajectory data is emitted continuously from the global AIS system. Continuous trajectory similarity search on this data has applications in, e.g., maritime navigation and safety. Existing proposals typically assume an offline setting and focus on finding similarities between complete trajectories. Such proposals are less effective when applied to online scenarios, where similarity comparisons must be performed continuously as new trajectory data arrives and trajectories evolve. We therefore propose a real-time continuous trajectory similarity search method for vessels (ACTIVE). We introduce a novel similarity measure, object-trajectory real-time distance, that emphasizes the anticipated future movement trends of vessels, enabling more predictive and forward-looking comparisons. Next, we propose a segment-based vessel trajectory index structure that organizes historical trajectories into smaller and manageable segments, facilitating accelerated similarity computations. Leveraging this index, we propose an efficient continuous similar trajectory search (CSTS) algorithm together with a variety of search space pruning strategies that reduce unnecessary computations during the continuous similarity search, thereby further improving efficiency. Extensive experiments on two large real-world AIS datasets offer evidence that ACTIVE is capable of outperforming state-of-the-art methods considerably. ACTIVE significantly reduces index construction costs and index size while achieving a 70% reduction in terms of query time and a 60% increase in terms of hit rate.</p></details> |  |
| **[Equality Constrained Diffusion for Direct Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01939v2)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent success of diffusion-based generative models in image and natural language processing has ignited interest in diffusion-based trajectory optimization for nonlinear control systems. Existing methods cannot, however, handle the nonlinear equality constraints necessary for direct trajectory optimization. As a result, diffusion-based trajectory optimizers are currently limited to shooting methods, where the nonlinear dynamics are enforced by forward rollouts. This precludes many of the benefits enjoyed by direct methods, including flexible state constraints, reduced numerical sensitivity, and easy initial guess specification. In this paper, we present a method for diffusion-based optimization with equality constraints. This allows us to perform direct trajectory optimization, enforcing dynamic feasibility with constraints rather than rollouts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first diffusion-based optimization algorithm that supports the general nonlinear equality constraints required for direct trajectory optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACC 2...</summary><p>ACC 2025, fixed typo in equations (11)-(12)</p></details> |
| **[SocialTraj: Two-Stage Socially-Aware Trajectory Prediction for Autonomous Driving via Conditional Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17850v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate trajectory prediction of surrounding vehicles (SVs) is crucial for autonomous driving systems to avoid misguided decisions and potential accidents. However, achieving reliable predictions in highly dynamic and complex traffic scenarios remains a significant challenge. One of the key impediments lies in the limited effectiveness of current approaches to capture the multi-modal behaviors of drivers, which leads to predicted trajectories that deviate from actual future motions. To address this issue, we propose SocialTraj, a novel trajectory prediction framework integrating social psychology principles through social value orientation (SVO). By utilizing Bayesian inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) to estimate the SVO of SVs, we obtain the critical social context to infer the future interaction trend. To ensure modal consistency in predicted behaviors, the estimated SVOs of SVs are embedded into a conditional denoising diffusion model that aligns generated trajectories with historical driving styles. Additionally, the planned future trajectory of the ego vehicle (EV) is explicitly incorporated to enhance interaction modeling. Extensive experiments on NGSIM and HighD datasets demonstrate that SocialTraj is capable of adapting to highly dynamic and interactive scenarios while generating socially compliant and behaviorally consistent trajectory predictions, outperforming existing baselines. Ablation studies demonstrate that dynamic SVO estimation and explicit ego-planning components notably improve prediction accuracy and substantially reduce inference time.</p></details> |  |

Traditional control methods often fall short in such applications due to their inability to effectively handle these nonlinearities, while commonly used learning-based methods require extensive interactions with the environment, leading to inefficiency. To address these issues, we introduce EfficientTrack, a trajectory tracking method that integrates model-based learning to manage nonlinear dynamics and leverages closed-loop dynamics to improve learning efficiency, ultimately minimizing tracking errors. We validate our method through comprehensive experiments both in simulation and on a real-world excavator. Comparative experiments in simulation demonstrate that our method outperforms existing learning-based approaches, achieving the highest tracking precision and smoothness with the fewest interactions. Real-world experiments further show that our method remains effective under load conditions and possesses the ability for continual learning, highlighting its practical applicability.

Existing motion planning methods often require additional computational effort to generate the final trajectory by solving kinematic or dynamic equations. This paper highlights the strong potential of model-free reinforcement learning methods over model-based approaches for obstacle-free trajectory planning in joint space. We propose a fast trajectory planning system for manipulators that combines vision-based path planning in task space with reinforcement learning-based obstacle avoidance in joint space. We divide the framework into two key components. The first introduces an innovative vision-based trajectory planner in task space, leveraging the large-scale fast segment anything (FSA) model in conjunction with basis spline (B-spline)-optimized kinodynamic path searching. The second component enhances the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm by integrating action ensembles (AE) and policy feedback (PF), which greatly improve precision and stability in goal-reaching and obstacle avoidance within the joint space. These PPO enhancements increase the algorithm's adaptability across diverse robotic tasks, ensuring consistent execution of commands from the first component by the manipulator, while also enhancing both obstacle avoidance efficiency and reaching accuracy. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of PPO enhancements, as well as simulation-to-simulation (Sim-to-Sim) and simulation-to-reality (Sim-to-Real) transfer, in improving model robustness and planner efficiency in complex scenarios. These enhancements allow the robot to perform obstacle avoidance and real-time trajectory planning in obstructed environments.

Recent model merging-based methods have attracted significant attention, but they still struggle to effectively manage the trade-off between learning new knowledge and preventing forgetting, a challenge largely stemming from suboptimal number of merges and merging frequency. In this paper, we introduce Adaptive Iterative Model Merging (AimMerging), a novel CL framework that utilizes learning and forgetting signals from the training trajectory to dynamically monitor the model's training status. Guided by dynamic monitoring, the training trajectory-guided merge controller adaptively determines the timing and frequency of iterative fusion, while the rehearsal-based knowledge fusion module computes the merging weights and executes the fusion. Comprehensive experiments on three CL benchmarks with various model sizes (from 770M to 13B) demonstrate that AimMerging achieves significant performance improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods, with an average relative improvement of 80% and 59% on FWT and BWT, respectively.

Conventional mapping-planning-control pipelines incur high computational cost and propagate estimation errors. We present AERO-MPPI, a fully GPU-accelerated framework that unifies perception and planning through an anchor-guided ensemble of Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) optimizers. Specifically, we design a multi-resolution LiDAR point-cloud representation that rapidly extracts spatially distributed "anchors" as look-ahead intermediate endpoints, from which we construct polynomial trajectory guides to explore distinct homotopy path classes. At each planning step, we run multiple MPPI instances in parallel and evaluate them with a two-stage multi-objective cost that balances collision avoidance and goal reaching. Implemented entirely with NVIDIA Warp GPU kernels, AERO-MPPI achieves real-time onboard operation and mitigates the local-minima failures of single-MPPI approaches. Extensive simulations in forests, verticals, and inclines demonstrate sustained reliable flight above 7 m/s, with success rates above 80% and smoother trajectories compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Real-world experiments on a LiDAR-equipped quadrotor with NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX 16G confirm that AERO-MPPI runs in real time onboard and consistently achieves safe, agile, and robust flight in complex cluttered environments. The code will be open-sourced upon acceptance of the paper.</p></details> |  |

Trackers relying on these 2D cues are particularly unreliable in robotic environments, where dense targets and frequent occlusions are common. While depth information has the potential to alleviate these issues, most existing MOT datasets lack depth annotations, leading to its underexploited role in the domain. To unveil the potential of depth-informed trajectory refinement, we introduce DepTR-MOT, a DETR-based detector enhanced with instance-level depth information. Specifically, we propose two key innovations: (i) foundation model-based instance-level soft depth label supervision, which refines depth prediction, and (ii) the distillation of dense depth maps to maintain global depth consistency. These strategies enable DepTR-MOT to output instance-level depth during inference, without requiring foundation models and without additional computational cost. By incorporating depth cues, our method enhances the robustness of the TBD paradigm, effectively resolving occlusion and close-proximity challenges. Experiments on both the QuadTrack and DanceTrack datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving HOTA scores of 27.59 and 44.47, respectively. In particular, results on QuadTrack, a robotic platform MOT dataset, highlight the advantages of our method in handling occlusion and close-proximity challenges in robotic tracking.

Recent methods use diffusion on either graph embeddings or the discrete space of nodes and edges. However, simple changes to embeddings (say, adding noise) can mean uninterpretable changes in the graph. In discrete-space diffusion, each step may add or remove many nodes/edges. It is hard to predict what graph patterns we will observe after many diffusion steps. Our proposed method, called GraphWeave, takes a different approach. We separate pattern generation and graph construction. To find patterns in the training graphs, we see how they transform vectors during random walks. We then generate new graphs in two steps. First, we generate realistic random walk "trajectories" which match the learned patterns. Then, we find the optimal graph that fits these trajectories. The optimization infers all edges jointly, which improves robustness to errors. On four simulated and five real-world benchmark datasets, GraphWeave outperforms existing methods. The most significant differences are on large-scale graph structures such as PageRank, cuts, communities, degree distributions, and flows. GraphWeave is also 10x faster than its closest competitor. Finally, GraphWeave is simple, needing only a transformer and standard optimizers.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 4 figures.

This paper addresses fault-tolerant trajectory tracking of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) under thruster failures. We propose an adaptive Lyapunov-constrained model predictive control (LMPC) that guarantees stable trajectory tracking when the AUV switches between fault and normal modes. Particularly, we model different AUV thruster faults and build online failure identification based on Bayesian approach. This facilitates a soft switch between AUV status, and the identified and updated AUV failure model feeds LMPC controller for the control law derivation. The Lyapunov constrain in LMPC ensures that the trajectory tracking control remains stable during AUV status shifts, thus mitigating severe and fatal fluctuations when an AUV thruster occurs or recovers. We conduct numerical simulations on a four-thruster planar AUV using the proposed approach. The results demonstrate smooth transitions between thruster failure types and low trajectory tracking errors compared with the benchmark adaptive MPC and backstepping control with rapid failure identification and failure accommodation during the trajectory tracking.</p></details> |  |

Distillation on these pre-trained models can be viewed as the process of constructing advanced trajectories within the pair to accelerate sampling. For instance, consistency model distillation develops consistent projection functions to regulate trajectories, although sampling efficiency remains a concern. Rectified flow method enforces straight trajectories to enable faster sampling, yet relies on numerical ODE solvers, which may introduce approximation errors. In this work, we bridge the gap between the consistency model and the rectified flow method by proposing a Straight Consistent Trajectory~(SCoT) model. SCoT enjoys the benefits of both approaches for fast sampling, producing trajectories with consistent and straight properties simultaneously. These dual properties are strategically balanced by targeting two critical objectives: (1) regulating the gradient of SCoT's mapping to a constant, (2) ensuring trajectory consistency. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of SCoT.</p></details> |  |

Current solutions, whether traditional position-based control methods or reinforcement learning (RL) approaches, exhibit significant limitations. Model predictive control (MPC) is a prevalent approach for ordinary quadruped and biped robots. While MPC has demonstrated advantages in legged robots, existing studies often oversimplify the leg swing progress, relying merely on simple trajectory interpolation methods. This severely constrains the foot's environmental interaction capability, hindering tasks such as ball kicking. This study innovatively adapts the spatial-temporal trajectory planning method, which has been successful in drone applications, to bipedal robotic systems. The proposed approach autonomously generates foot trajectories that satisfy constraints on target kicking position, velocity, and acceleration while simultaneously optimizing swing phase duration. Experimental results demonstrate that the optimized trajectories closely mimic human kicking behavior, featuring a backswing motion. Simulation and hardware experiments confirm the algorithm's efficiency, with trajectory planning times under 1 ms, and its reliability, achieving nearly 100 % task completion accuracy when the soccer goal is within the range of -90{\deg} to 90{\deg}.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 8 figures, conference paper</p></details> |

We frame trajectory recovery as a proxy task, which requires models to reconstruct masked GPS traces, and introduce GLOBALTRACE, a dataset with over 4,000 real-world trajectories across diverse regions and transportation modes. Using road network as context, our prompting framework enables LLMs to generate valid paths without accessing any external navigation tools. Experiments show that LLMs outperform off-the-shelf baselines and specialized trajectory recovery models, with strong zero-shot generalization. Fine-grained analysis shows that LLMs have strong comprehension of the road network and coordinate systems, but also pose systematic biases with respect to regions and transportation modes. Finally, we demonstrate how LLMs can enhance navigation experiences by reasoning over maps in flexible ways to incorporate user preferences.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present Poutine, a method that uses an off-the-shelf 3B-parameter vision-language model (VLM) - without any additional components - to achieve robust end-to-end autonomous driving via a simple and scalable training recipe. To learn strong base driving capabilities, we first train Poutine-Base using self-supervised next-token prediction over vision, language, and trajectory (VLT) tokens, leveraging both nominal and long-tail driving data. In the second stage, we fine-tune Poutine-Base using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a small set of human preference-labeled examples. We evaluated our approach on the Waymo end-to-end driving benchmark curated for long-tail scenarios. The final Poutine model achieves an RFS of 7.99 on the test set, placing 1st in the 2025 Waymo Vision-Based End-to-End Driving Challenge by a significant margin. Our results suggest that handcrafted tokenizers or custom architectural components added to base VLMs in prior work are not necessary to achieve strong driving performance. Instead, this work highlights the potential of scalable VLT pretraining combined with lightweight RL fine-tuning to enable robust and generalizable autonomous driving.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data Selection for Fine-tuning Vision Language Models via Cross Modal Alignment Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01454v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data-efficient learning aims to eliminate redundancy in large training datasets by training models on smaller subsets of the most informative examples. While data selection has been extensively explored for vision models and large language models (LLMs), it remains underexplored for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Notably, none of existing methods can outperform random selection at different subset sizes. In this work, we propose the first principled method for data-efficient instruction tuning of LVLMs. We prove that examples with similar cross-modal attention matrices during instruction tuning have similar gradients. Thus, they influence model parameters in a similar manner and convey the same information to the model during training. Building on this insight, we propose XMAS, which clusters examples based on the trajectories of the top singular values of their attention matrices obtained from fine-tuning a small proxy LVLM. By sampling a balanced subset from these clusters, XMAS effectively removes redundancy in large-scale LVLM training data. Extensive experiments show that XMAS can discard 50% of the LLaVA-665k dataset and 85% of the Vision-Flan dataset while fully preserving performance of LLaVA-1.5-7B on 10 downstream benchmarks and speeding up its training by 1.2x. This is 30% more data reduction compared to the best baseline for LLaVA-665k.

Advances in robot performance have increased the hopping height to greater than 4 meters and opened up the possibility for more complex aerial trajectories (i.e., behaviors). However, currently hopping robots do not directly control their aerial trajectory or transition to flight, eliminating the efficiency benefits of a hopping system. Here we show a real-time, computationally efficiency, non-linear drag compensated, trajectory generation methodology and accompanying Lyapunov-based controller. The combined system can create and follow complex aerial trajectories from liftoff to touchdown on horizontal and vertical surfaces, while maintaining strick control over the orientation at touchdown. The computational efficiency provides broad applicability across all size scales of hopping robots while maintaining applicability to quadrotors in general.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[GoalFlow: Goal-Driven Flow Matching for Multimodal Trajectories Generation in End-to-End Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05689v6)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose GoalFlow, an end-to-end autonomous driving method for generating high-quality multimodal trajectories. In autonomous driving scenarios, there is rarely a single suitable trajectory. Recent methods have increasingly focused on modeling multimodal trajectory distributions. However, they suffer from trajectory selection complexity and reduced trajectory quality due to high trajectory divergence and inconsistencies between guidance and scene information. To address these issues, we introduce GoalFlow, a novel method that effectively constrains the generative process to produce high-quality, multimodal trajectories. To resolve the trajectory divergence problem inherent in diffusion-based methods, GoalFlow constrains the generated trajectories by introducing a goal point. GoalFlow establishes a novel scoring mechanism that selects the most appropriate goal point from the candidate points based on scene information. Furthermore, GoalFlow employs an efficient generative method, Flow Matching, to generate multimodal trajectories, and incorporates a refined scoring mechanism to select the optimal trajectory from the candidates. Our experimental results, validated on the Navsim\cite{Dauner2024_navsim}, demonstrate that GoalFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering robust multimodal trajectories for autonomous driving. GoalFlow achieved PDMS of 90.3, significantly surpassing other methods. Compared with other diffusion-policy-based methods, our approach requires only a single denoising step to obtain excellent performance.

However, they face challenges due to their high-dimensional and unstable dynamics, as well as the complex contact-rich nature of the tasks. Model-based optimal control methods offer flexibility to define precise motion but are limited by high computational complexity and accurate contact sensing. On the other hand, reinforcement learning (RL) handles high-dimensional spaces with strong robustness but suffers from inefficient learning, unnatural motion, and sim-to-real gaps. To address these challenges, we introduce Opt2Skill, an end-to-end pipeline that combines model-based trajectory optimization with RL to achieve robust whole-body loco-manipulation. Opt2Skill generates dynamic feasible and contact-consistent reference motions for the Digit humanoid robot using differential dynamic programming (DDP) and trains RL policies to track these optimal trajectories. Our results demonstrate that Opt2Skill outperforms baselines that rely on human demonstrations and inverse kinematics-based references, both in motion tracking and task success rates. Furthermore, we show that incorporating trajectories with torque information improves contact force tracking in contact-involved tasks, such as wiping a table. We have successfully transferred our approach to real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

We propose TrajVLM-Gen, a two-stage framework for physics-aware image-to-video generation. First, we employ a Vision Language Model to predict coarse-grained motion trajectories that maintain consistency with real-world physics. Second, these trajectories guide video generation through attention-based mechanisms for fine-grained motion refinement. We build a trajectory prediction dataset based on video tracking data with realistic motion patterns. Experiments on UCF-101 and MSR-VTT demonstrate that TrajVLM-Gen outperforms existing methods, achieving competitive FVD scores of 545 on UCF-101 and 539 on MSR-VTT.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Based Observer Design: A Framework for Lightweight Sensor Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00630v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient observer design and accurate sensor fusion are key in state estimation. This work proposes an optimization-based methodology, termed Trajectory Based Optimization Design (TBOD), allowing the user to easily design observers for general nonlinear systems and multi-sensor setups. Starting from parametrized observer dynamics, the proposed method considers a finite set of pre-recorded measurement trajectories from the nominal plant and exploits them to tune the observer parameters through numerical optimization. This research hinges on the classic observer's theory and Moving Horizon Estimators methodology. Optimization is exploited to ease the observer's design, providing the user with a lightweight, general-purpose sensor fusion methodology. TBOD's main characteristics are the capability to handle general sensors efficiently and in a modular way and, most importantly, its straightforward tuning procedure. The TBOD's performance is tested on a terrestrial rover localization problem, combining IMU and ranging sensors provided by Ultra Wide Band antennas, and validated through a motion-capture system. Comparison with an Extended Kalman Filter is also provided, matching its position estimation accuracy and significantly improving in the orientation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Collaborative-Distilled Diffusion Models (CDDM) for Accelerated and Lightweight Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00627v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is a fundamental task in Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) and Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), supporting efficient motion planning and real-time traffic safety management. Diffusion models have recently demonstrated strong performance in probabilistic trajectory prediction, but their large model size and slow sampling process hinder real-world deployment. This paper proposes Collaborative-Distilled Diffusion Models (CDDM), a novel method for real-time and lightweight trajectory prediction. Built upon Collaborative Progressive Distillation (CPD), CDDM progressively transfers knowledge from a high-capacity teacher diffusion model to a lightweight student model, jointly reducing both the number of sampling steps and the model size across distillation iterations. A dual-signal regularized distillation loss is further introduced to incorporate guidance from both the teacher and ground-truth data, mitigating potential overfitting and ensuring robust performance. Extensive experiments on the ETH-UCY pedestrian benchmark and the nuScenes vehicle benchmark demonstrate that CDDM achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy. The well-distilled CDDM retains 96.2% and 95.5% of the baseline model's ADE and FDE performance on pedestrian trajectories, while requiring only 231K parameters and 4 or 2 sampling steps, corresponding to 161x compression, 31x acceleration, and 9 ms latency. Qualitative results further show that CDDM generates diverse and accurate trajectories under dynamic agent behaviors and complex social interactions. By bridging high-performing generative models with practical deployment constraints, CDDM enables resource-efficient probabilistic prediction for AVs and ITS.

| **[What Did I Learn? Operational Competence Assessment for AI-Based Trajectory Planners](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00619v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated driving functions increasingly rely on machine learning for tasks like perception and trajectory planning, requiring large, relevant datasets. The performance of these algorithms depends on how closely the training data matches the task. To ensure reliable functioning, it is crucial to know what is included in the dataset to assess the trained model's operational risk. We aim to enhance the safe use of machine learning in automated driving by developing a method to recognize situations that an automated vehicle has not been sufficiently trained on. This method also improves explainability by describing the dataset at a human-understandable level. We propose modeling driving data as knowledge graphs, representing driving scenes with entities and their relationships. These graphs are queried for specific sub-scene configurations to check their occurrence in the dataset. We estimate a vehicle's competence in a driving scene by considering the coverage and complexity of sub-scene configurations in the training set. Higher complexity scenes require greater coverage for high competence. We apply this method to the NuPlan dataset, modeling it with knowledge graphs and analyzing the coverage of specific driving scenes. This approach helps monitor the competence of machine learning models trained on the dataset, which is essential for trustworthy AI to be deployed in automated driving.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in proceedings of the 2025 IEEE International Automated Vehicle Validation Conference</p></details> |
| **[From Human Hands to Robot Arms: Manipulation Skills Transfer via Trajectory Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00491v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning diverse manipulation skills for real-world robots is severely bottlenecked by the reliance on costly and hard-to-scale teleoperated demonstrations. While human videos offer a scalable alternative, effectively transferring manipulation knowledge is fundamentally hindered by the significant morphological gap between human and robotic embodiments. To address this challenge and facilitate skill transfer from human to robot, we introduce Traj2Action,a novel framework that bridges this embodiment gap by using the 3D trajectory of the operational endpoint as a unified intermediate representation, and then transfers the manipulation knowledge embedded in this trajectory to the robot's actions. Our policy first learns to generate a coarse trajectory, which forms an high-level motion plan by leveraging both human and robot data. This plan then conditions the synthesis of precise, robot-specific actions (e.g., orientation and gripper state) within a co-denoising framework. Extensive real-world experiments on a Franka robot demonstrate that Traj2Action boosts the performance by up to 27% and 22.25% over $\pi_0$ baseline on short- and long-horizon real-world tasks, and achieves significant gains as human data scales in robot policy learning. Our project website, featuring code and video demonstrations, is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/w/Traj2Action-4A45/.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic-TreeRPO: Breaking the Independent Trajectory Bottleneck with Structured Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23352v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of Reinforcement Learning (RL) into flow matching models for text-to-image (T2I) generation has driven substantial advances in generation quality. However, these gains often come at the cost of exhaustive exploration and inefficient sampling strategies due to slight variation in the sampling group. Building on this insight, we propose Dynamic-TreeRPO, which implements the sliding-window sampling strategy as a tree-structured search with dynamic noise intensities along depth. We perform GRPO-guided optimization and constrained Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) sampling within this tree structure. By sharing prefix paths of the tree, our design effectively amortizes the computational overhead of trajectory search. With well-designed noise intensities for each tree layer, Dynamic-TreeRPO can enhance the variation of exploration without any extra computational cost. Furthermore, we seamlessly integrate Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and RL paradigm within Dynamic-TreeRPO to construct our proposed LayerTuning-RL, reformulating the loss function of SFT as a dynamically weighted Progress Reward Model (PRM) rather than a separate pretraining method. By associating this weighted PRM with dynamic-adaptive clipping bounds, the disruption of exploration process in Dynamic-TreeRPO is avoided. Benefiting from the tree-structured sampling and the LayerTuning-RL paradigm, our model dynamically explores a diverse search space along effective directions. Compared to existing baselines, our approach demonstrates significant superiority in terms of semantic consistency, visual fidelity, and human preference alignment on established benchmarks, including HPS-v2.1, PickScore, and ImageReward. In particular, our model outperforms SoTA by $4.9\%$, $5.91\%$, and $8.66\%$ on those benchmarks, respectively, while improving the training efficiency by nearly $50\%$.</p></details> | Fig.3 updated |
| **[On the joint observability of flow fields and particle properties from Lagrangian trajectories: evidence from neural data assimilation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00479v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We numerically investigate the joint observability of flow states and unknown particle properties from Lagrangian particle tracking (LPT) data. LPT offers time-resolved, volumetric measurements of particle trajectories, but experimental tracks are spatially sparse, potentially noisy, and may be further complicated by inertial transport, raising the question of whether both Eulerian fields and particle characteristics can be reliably inferred. To address this, we develop a data assimilation framework that couples an Eulerian flow representation with Lagrangian particle models, enabling the simultaneous inference of carrier fields and particle properties under the governing equations of disperse multiphase flow. Using this approach, we establish empirical existence proofs of joint observability across three representative regimes. In a turbulent boundary layer with noisy tracer tracks (St to 0), flow states and true particle positions are jointly observable. In homogeneous isotropic turbulence seeded with inertial particles (St ~ 1-5), we demonstrate simultaneous recovery of flow states and particle diameters, showing the feasibility of implicit particle characterization. In a compressible, shock-dominated flow, we report the first joint reconstructions of velocity, pressure, density, and inertial particle properties (diameter and density), highlighting both the potential and certain limits of observability in supersonic regimes. Systematic sensitivity studies further reveal how seeding density, noise level, and Stokes number govern reconstruction accuracy, yielding practical guidelines for experimental design. Taken together, these results show that the scope of LPT could be broadened to multiphase and high-speed flows, in which tracer and measurement fidelity are limited.</p></details> |  |

However, existing agent benchmarks are showing a trend of rapid ceiling-hitting by newly developed agents, making it difficult to meet the demands for evaluating agent abilities. To address this problem, we propose the Trajectory-based Validated-by-Reproducing Agent-benchmark Complexity Evolution (TRACE) framework. This framework takes an original task from an existing benchmark and encourages agents to freely explore and evolve it into a new task with higher difficulty while recording validatable agent trajectories. The framework proceeds in three stages: (1) evolutionary proposal mining, which provides task evolution proposals through preliminary exploration and divergent thinking; (2) problem formation and free exploration, where proposals are conceptualized into feasible problem candidates and the agents then explore them freely while recording their execution trajectories; and (3) multi-level validation, which ensures that the evolved tasks are accompanied by validatable and reproducible trajectories. Experiments on the GAIA benchmark demonstrate that the TRACE framework consistently enhances task complexity while improving the reliability of correctness through validatable execution trajectories. This work marks a paradigm shift from static, manually curated benchmarks to dynamic, self-evolving evaluation systems, providing a sustainable and challenging runway for agent development.</p></details> | <details><summary>his i...</summary><p>his is a work in progress due to methodology refinement and further evaluation</p></details> |

However, existing methods typically assume idealized observation histories, failing to account for the perceptual artifacts inherent in first-person vision, such as occlusions, ID switches, and tracking drift. This discrepancy between training assumptions and deployment reality severely limits model robustness. To bridge this gap, we introduce EgoTraj-Bench, the first real-world benchmark that grounds noisy, first-person visual histories in clean, bird's-eye-view future trajectories, enabling robust learning under realistic perceptual constraints. Building on this benchmark, we propose BiFlow, a dual-stream flow matching model that concurrently denoises historical observations and forecasts future motion by leveraging a shared latent representation. To better model agent intent, BiFlow incorporates our EgoAnchor mechanism, which conditions the prediction decoder on distilled historical features via feature modulation. Extensive experiments show that BiFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing minADE and minFDE by 10-15% on average and demonstrating superior robustness. We anticipate that our benchmark and model will provide a critical foundation for developing trajectory forecasting systems truly resilient to the challenges of real-world, ego-centric perception.</p></details> |  |

For rasterization and other tasks, it is often necessary to extract a mesh that represents the shape. Unbounded scenes with long-range camera trajectories, such as flying through a forest, pose a unique challenge for mesh extraction. A single static mesh representing all the geometric detail necessary for the full camera path can be prohibitively large. Therefore, independent meshes can be extracted for different camera views, but this approach may lead to popping artifacts during transitions. We propose a temporally coherent method for extracting meshes suitable for long-range camera trajectories in unbounded scenes represented by an occupancy function. The key idea is to perform 4D mesh extraction using a new spacetime tree structure called a binary-octree. Experiments show that, compared to existing baseline methods, our method offers superior visual consistency at a comparable cost.

Traditionally, nonconvex optimization problems are solved by forming and solving a sequence of convex optimization problems, where the cost and constraint functions are approximated locally through Taylor series expansions. This presents a challenge for functions where differentiation is expensive or unavailable. In this work, we present a derivative-free approach to form these convex approximations by computing samples of the dynamics, cost, and constraint functions and letting the solver interpolate between them. Our framework includes sample-based trajectory optimization techniques like model-predictive path integral (MPPI) control as a special case and generalizes them to enable features like multiple shooting and general equality and inequality constraints that are traditionally associated with derivative-based sequential convex programming methods. The resulting framework is simple, flexible, and capable of solving a wide variety of practical motion planning and control problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Analytic Conditions for Differentiable Collision Detection in Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26459v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimization-based methods are widely used for computing fast, diverse solutions for complex tasks such as collision-free movement or planning in the presence of contacts. However, most of these methods require enforcing non-penetration constraints between objects, resulting in a non-trivial and computationally expensive problem. This makes the use of optimization-based methods for planning and control challenging. In this paper, we present a method to efficiently enforce non-penetration of sets while performing optimization over their configuration, which is directly applicable to problems like collision-aware trajectory optimization. We introduce novel differentiable conditions with analytic expressions to achieve this. To enforce non-collision between non-smooth bodies using these conditions, we introduce a method to approximate polytopes as smooth semi-algebraic sets. We present several numerical experiments to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method and compare the performance with other baseline methods recently proposed in the literature.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 8 figures.

The majority of existing placement campaigns either follow standard `space-filling' designs or relatively ad-hoc expert opinions. A key challenge to applying principled active learning in this setting is that Lagrangian observers are continuously advected through the vector field, so they make measurements at different locations and times. It is, therefore, important to consider the likely future trajectories of placed observers to account for the utility of candidate placement locations. To this end, we present BALLAST: Bayesian Active Learning with Look-ahead Amendment for Sea-drifter Trajectories. We observe noticeable benefits of BALLAST-aided sequential observer placement strategies on both synthetic and high-fidelity ocean current models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Preemptive Spatiotemporal Trajectory Adjustment for Heterogeneous Vehicles in Highway Merging Zones](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25929v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aiming at the problem of driver's perception lag and low utilization efficiency of space-time resources in expressway ramp confluence area, based on the preemptive spatiotemporal trajectory Adjustment system, from the perspective of coordinating spatiotemporal resources, the reasonable value of safe space-time distance in trajectory pre-preparation is quantitatively analyzed. The minimum safety gap required for ramp vehicles to merge into the mainline is analyzed by introducing double positioning error and spatiotemporal trajectory tracking error. A merging control strategy for autonomous driving heterogeneous vehicles is proposed, which integrates vehicle type, driving intention, and safety spatiotemporal distance. The specific confluence strategies of ramp target vehicles and mainline cooperative vehicles under different vehicle types are systematically expounded. A variety of traffic flow and speed scenarios are used for full combination simulation. By comparing the time-position-speed diagram, the vehicle operation characteristics and the dynamic difference of confluence are qualitatively analyzed, and the average speed and average delay are used as the evaluation indices to quantitatively evaluate the performance advantages of the preemptive cooperative confluence control strategy. The results show that the maximum average delay improvement rates of mainline and ramp vehicles are 90.24 % and 74.24 %, respectively. The proposed strategy can effectively avoid potential vehicle conflicts and emergency braking behaviors, improve driving safety in the confluence area, and show significant advantages in driving stability and overall traffic efficiency optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vector sketch animation generation with differentialable motion trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25857v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sketching is a direct and inexpensive means of visual expression. Though image-based sketching has been well studied, video-based sketch animation generation is still very challenging due to the temporal coherence requirement. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end automatic generation approach for vector sketch animation. To solve the flickering issue, we introduce a Differentiable Motion Trajectory (DMT) representation that describes the frame-wise movement of stroke control points using differentiable polynomial-based trajectories. DMT enables global semantic gradient propagation across multiple frames, significantly improving the semantic consistency and temporal coherence, and producing high-framerate output. DMT employs a Bernstein basis to balance the sensitivity of polynomial parameters, thus achieving more stable optimization. Instead of implicit fields, we introduce sparse track points for explicit spatial modeling, which improves efficiency and supports long-duration video processing. Evaluations on DAVIS and LVOS datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach over SOTA methods. Cross-domain validation on 3D models and text-to-video data confirms the robustness and compatibility of our approach.</p></details> | 14 pages, 12 figures |

A prominent line of research involves reward-guided guidance, which steers the generation process during inference to align with specific objectives. However, leveraging this reward-guided approach to the task of image editing, which requires preserving the semantic content of the source image while enhancing a target reward, is largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for training-free, reward-guided image editing. We formulate the editing process as a trajectory optimal control problem where the reverse process of a diffusion model is treated as a controllable trajectory originating from the source image, and the adjoint states are iteratively updated to steer the editing process. Through extensive experiments across distinct editing tasks, we demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing inversion-based training-free guidance baselines, achieving a superior balance between reward maximization and fidelity to the source image without reward hacking.</p></details> | 18 pages, 5 figures |
| **[SSTP: Efficient Sample Selection for Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17385v3)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is a core task in autonomous driving. However, training advanced trajectory prediction models on existing large-scale datasets is both time-consuming and computationally expensive. More critically, these datasets are highly imbalanced in scenario density, with normal driving scenes (low-moderate traffic) overwhelmingly dominating the datasets, while high-density and safety-critical cases are underrepresented. As a result, models tend to overfit low/moderate-density scenarios and perform poorly in high-density scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose the SSTP framework, which constructs a compact yet density-balanced dataset tailored to trajectory prediction. SSTP consists of two main stages: (1)Extraction, where a baseline model is pretrained for a few epochs to obtain stable gradient estimates, and the dataset is partitioned by scenario density. (2)Selection, where gradient-based scores and a submodular objective select representative samples within each density category, while biased sampling emphasizes rare high-density interactions to avoid dominance by low-density cases. This approach significantly reduces the dataset size and mitigates scenario imbalance, without sacrificing prediction accuracy. Experiments on the Argoverse 1 and Argoverse 2 datasets with recent state-of-the-art models show that SSTP achieves comparable performance to full-dataset training using only half the data while delivering substantial improvements in high-density traffic scenes and significantly reducing training time. Robust trajectory prediction depends not only on data scale but also on balancing scene density to ensure reliable performance under complex multi agent interactions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Encryption Cooperative Salvo Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17341v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces the concept of trajectory encryption in cooperative simultaneous target interception, wherein heterogeneity in guidance principles across a team of unmanned autonomous systems is leveraged as a strategic design feature. By employing a mix of heterogeneous time-to-go formulations leading to a cooperative guidance strategy, the swarm of vehicles is able to generate diverse trajectory families. This diversity expands the feasible solution space for simultaneous target interception, enhances robustness under disturbances, and enables flexible time-to-go adjustments without predictable detouring. From an adversarial perspective, heterogeneity obscures the collective interception intent by preventing straightforward prediction of swarm dynamics, effectively acting as an encryption layer in the trajectory domain. Simulations demonstrate that the swarm of heterogeneous vehicles is able to intercept a moving target simultaneously from a diverse set of initial engagement configurations.</p></details> |  |
| **[LATTE: Latent Trajectory Embedding for Diffusion-Generated Image Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03054v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of diffusion-based image generators has made it increasingly difficult to distinguish generated from real images. This erodes trust in digital media, making it critical to develop generated image detectors that remain reliable across different generators. While recent approaches leverage diffusion denoising cues, they typically rely on single-step reconstruction errors and overlook the sequential nature of the denoising process. In this work, we propose LATTE - LATent Trajectory Embedding - a novel approach that models the evolution of latent embeddings across multiple denoising steps. Instead of treating each denoising step in isolation, LATTE captures the trajectory of these representations, revealing subtle and discriminative patterns that distinguish real from generated images.

| **[TR2-D2: Tree Search Guided Trajectory-Aware Fine-Tuning for Discrete Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25171v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning with stochastic optimal control offers a promising framework for diffusion fine-tuning, where a pre-trained diffusion model is optimized to generate paths that lead to a reward-tilted distribution. While these approaches enable optimization without access to explicit samples from the optimal distribution, they require training on rollouts under the current fine-tuned model, making them susceptible to reinforcing sub-optimal trajectories that yield poor rewards. To overcome this challenge, we introduce TRee Search Guided TRajectory-Aware Fine-Tuning for Discrete Diffusion (TR2-D2), a novel framework that optimizes reward-guided discrete diffusion trajectories with tree search to construct replay buffers for trajectory-aware fine-tuning. These buffers are generated using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and subsequently used to fine-tune a pre-trained discrete diffusion model under a stochastic optimal control objective. We validate our framework on single- and multi-objective fine-tuning of biological sequence diffusion models, highlighting the overall effectiveness of TR2-D2 for reliable reward-guided fine-tuning in discrete sequence generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Hyperparameter Tuning via Trajectory Invariance Principle](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25049v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As hyperparameter tuning becomes increasingly costly at scale, efficient tuning methods are essential. Yet principles for guiding hyperparameter tuning remain limited. In this work, we seek to establish such principles by considering a broad range of hyperparameters, including batch size, learning rate, and weight decay. We identify a phenomenon we call trajectory invariance, where pre-training loss curves, gradient noise, and gradient norm exhibit invariance--closely overlapping--with respect to a quantity that combines learning rate and weight decay. This phenomenon effectively reduces the original two-dimensional hyperparameter space to one dimension, yielding an efficient tuning rule: follow the salient direction revealed by trajectory invariance. Furthermore, we refine previous scaling laws and challenge several existing viewpoints. Overall, our work proposes new principles for efficient tuning and inspires future research on scaling laws.</p></details> |  |

Drawing on the comprehensive OpenAlex dataset and employing fractional counting to avoid double attribution in co-authored work, the research maps the relative shares of AI publications across major global players. The analysis reveals a profound restructuring of the international AI research landscape. The US and the European Union (EU27), once the undisputed and established leaders, have experienced a notable decline in relative dominance, with their combined share of publications falling from over 57% in 2000 to less than 25% in 2025. In contrast, China has undergone a dramatic ascent, expanding its global share of AI publications from under 5% in 2000 to nearly 36% by 2025, thereby emerging as the single most dominant contributor. Alongside China, India has also risen substantially, consolidating a multipolar Asian research ecosystem. These empirical findings highlight the strategic implications of concentrated research output, particularly China's capacity to shape the future direction of AI innovation and standard-setting. While the study calculates the volume of AI publications (in percentage as global share) as a measure of research dominance, it also acknowledges limitations in capturing quality and impact, suggesting scholarly research areas for future work on high-impact AI scholarship.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

While stitching is historically a strength of offline reinforcement learning, recent generative behavioural cloning (BC) methods have also shown proficiency at stitching. However, the main factors behind this are poorly understood, hindering the development of new algorithms that can reliably stitch. Focusing on diffusion planners trained via BC, we find two properties are needed to compose: \emph{positional equivariance} and \emph{local receptiveness}. We use these two properties to explain architecture, data, and inference choices in existing generative BC methods based on diffusion planning, including replanning frequency, data augmentation, and data scaling. Experimental comparisions show that (1) while locality is more important than positional equivariance in creating a diffusion planner capable of composition, both are crucial (2) enabling these properties through relatively simple architecture choices can be competitive with more computationally expensive methods such as replanning or scaling data, and (3) simple inpainting-based guidance can guide architecturally compositional models to enable generalization in goal-conditioned settings.</p></details> | 9 Pages |
| **[Trajectory Prediction via Bayesian Intention Inference under Unknown Goals and Kinematics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24928v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work introduces an adaptive Bayesian algorithm for real-time trajectory prediction via intention inference, where a target's intentions and motion characteristics are unknown and subject to change. The method concurrently estimates two critical variables: the target's current intention, modeled as a Markovian latent state, and an intention parameter that describes the target's adherence to a shortest-path policy. By integrating this joint update technique, the algorithm maintains robustness against abrupt intention shifts and unknown motion dynamics. A sampling-based trajectory prediction mechanism then exploits these adaptive estimates to generate probabilistic forecasts with quantified uncertainty. We validate the framework through numerical experiments: Ablation studies of two cases, and a 500-trial Monte Carlo analysis; Hardware demonstrations on quadrotor and quadrupedal platforms. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms non-adaptive and partially adaptive methods. The method operates in real time around 270 Hz without requiring training or detailed prior knowledge of target behavior, showcasing its applicability in various robotic systems.</p></details> |  |

While these approaches make more realistic motions possible, they are limited by the amount of available motion data, and do not incorporate prior knowledge about the physical laws governing the system and its interactions with the environment. Thus they may violate such laws, leading to divergent trajectories and sliding contacts which limit real-world stability. We address such limitations via a two-pronged learning strategy which leverages the known physics of the system and fundamental control principles. First, we encode physics priors during supervised imitation learning to promote trajectory feasibility. Second, we minimize drift at inference time by applying a proportional-integral controller directly to the generated output state. We validate our method on various locomotion behaviors for the ergoCub humanoid robot, where a physics-informed loss encourages zero contact foot velocity. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach is compatible with multiple controllers on a real robot and significantly improves the accuracy and physical constraint conformity of generated trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication at the IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), Hangzhou, China, 2025</p></details> |

Despite its potential, data preparation, pre-training strategy development, and architectural design present significant challenges in constructing this model. Therefore, we introduce UniTraj, a Universal Trajectory foundation model that aims to address these limitations through three key innovations. First, we construct WorldTrace, an unprecedented dataset of 2.45 million trajectories with billions of GPS points spanning 70 countries, providing the diverse geographic coverage essential for region-independent modeling. Second, we develop novel pre-training strategies--Adaptive Trajectory Resampling and Self-supervised Trajectory Masking--that enable robust learning from heterogeneous trajectory data with varying sampling rates and quality. Finally, we tailor a flexible model architecture to accommodate a variety of trajectory tasks, effectively capturing complex movement patterns to support broad applicability. Extensive experiments across multiple tasks and real-world datasets demonstrate that UniTraj consistently outperforms existing methods, exhibiting superior scalability, adaptability, and generalization, with WorldTrace serving as an ideal yet non-exclusive training resource.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a research paper by NeurIPS'25</p></details> |

Trajectory control represents a user-friendly task in the field of controllable video generation. However, existing methods either require substantial training resources or are specifically designed for U-Net, do not take advantage of the superior performance of DiT. To address these issues, we propose DiTraj, a simple but effective training-free framework for trajectory control in text-to-video generation, tailored for DiT. Specifically, first, to inject the object's trajectory, we propose foreground-background separation guidance: we use the Large Language Model (LLM) to convert user-provided prompts into foreground and background prompts, which respectively guide the generation of foreground and background regions in the video. Then, we analyze 3D full attention and explore the tight correlation between inter-token attention scores and position embedding. Based on this, we propose inter-frame Spatial-Temporal Decoupled 3D-RoPE (STD-RoPE). By modifying only foreground tokens' position embedding, STD-RoPE eliminates their cross-frame spatial discrepancies, strengthening cross-frame attention among them and thus enhancing trajectory control. Additionally, we achieve 3D-aware trajectory control by regulating the density of position embedding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms previous methods in both video quality and trajectory controllability.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we provide a multilinguistic, large-scale assessment of this similarity by systematically comparing 16 publicly available pretrained LLMs with human brain responses during natural language processing tasks in both English and Chinese. Specifically, we use ridge regression to assess the representational similarity between LLM embeddings and electroencephalography (EEG) signals, and analyze the similarity between the "neural trajectory" and the "LLM latent trajectory." This method captures key dynamic patterns, such as magnitude, angle, uncertainty, and confidence. Our findings highlight both similarities and crucial differences in processing strategies: (1) We show that middle-to-high layers of LLMs are central to semantic integration and correspond to the N400 component observed in EEG; (2) The brain exhibits continuous and iterative processing during reading, whereas LLMs often show discrete, stage-end bursts of activity, which suggests a stark contrast in their real-time semantic processing dynamics. This study could offer new insights into LLMs and neural processing, and also establish a critical framework for future investigations into the alignment between artificial intelligence and biological intelligence.</p></details> |  |

We introduce two training-free, inference-time techniques that fully exploit explicit action parameters in diffusion-based robot video generation. Instead of treating action vectors as passive conditioning signals, our methods actively incorporate them to guide both the classifier-free guidance process and the initialization of Gaussian latents. First, action-scaled classifier-free guidance dynamically modulates guidance strength in proportion to action magnitude, enhancing controllability over motion intensity. Second, action-scaled noise truncation adjusts the distribution of initially sampled noise to better align with the desired motion dynamics. Experiments on real robot manipulation datasets demonstrate that these techniques significantly improve action coherence and visual quality across diverse robot environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, accepted to CoRL 2025 LSRW workshop</p></details> |

Dataset distillation offers a solution to address these challenges by synthesizing compact datasets that capture essential information from real, large medical datasets. Trajectory matching has emerged as a promising methodology for dataset distillation; however, existing methods primarily focus on terminal states, overlooking crucial information in intermediate optimization states. We address this limitation by proposing a shape-wise potential that captures the geometric structure of parameter trajectories, and an easy-to-complex matching strategy that progressively addresses parameters based on their complexity. Experiments on medical image classification tasks demonstrate that our method improves distillation performance while preserving privacy and maintaining model accuracy comparable to training on the original datasets.

| **[Evaluation of Machine and Deep Learning Techniques for Cyclone Trajectory Regression and Status Classification by Time Series Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24146v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate cyclone forecasting is essential for minimizing loss of life, infrastructure damage, and economic disruption. Traditional numerical weather prediction models, though effective, are computationally intensive and prone to error due to the chaotic nature of atmospheric systems. This study proposes a machine learning (ML) approach to forecasting tropical cyclone trajectory and status using time series data from the National Hurricane Center, including recently added best track wind radii. A two-stage ML pipeline is developed: a regression model first predicts cyclone features maximum wind speed, minimum pressure, trajectory length, and directional change using a sliding window of historical data. These outputs are then input into classification models to predict the cyclone's categorical status. Gradient boosting regression and three classifiers random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and multilayer perceptron (MLP) are evaluated. After hyperparameter tuning and synthetic minority oversampling (SMOTE), the RF classifier achieves the highest performance with 93% accuracy, outperforming SVM and MLP across precision, recall, and F1 score. The RF model is particularly robust in identifying minority cyclone statuses and minimizing false negatives. Regression results yield low mean absolute errors, with pressure and wind predictions within about 2.2 mb and 2.4 kt, respectively. These findings demonstrate that ML models, especially ensemble-based classifiers, offer an effective, scalable alternative to traditional forecasting methods, with potential for real-time cyclone prediction and integration into decision support systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[GPS-MTM: Capturing Pattern of Normalcy in GPS-Trajectories with self-supervised learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24031v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have driven remarkable progress in text, vision, and video understanding, and are now poised to unlock similar breakthroughs in trajectory modeling. We introduce the GPSMasked Trajectory Transformer (GPS-MTM), a foundation model for large-scale mobility data that captures patterns of normalcy in human movement. Unlike prior approaches that flatten trajectories into coordinate streams, GPS-MTM decomposes mobility into two complementary modalities: states (point-of-interest categories) and actions (agent transitions). Leveraging a bi-directional Transformer with a self-supervised masked modeling objective, the model reconstructs missing segments across modalities, enabling it to learn rich semantic correlations without manual labels. Across benchmark datasets, including Numosim-LA, Urban Anomalies, and Geolife, GPS-MTM consistently outperforms on downstream tasks such as trajectory infilling and next-stop prediction. Its advantages are most pronounced in dynamic tasks (inverse and forward dynamics), where contextual reasoning is critical. These results establish GPS-MTM as a robust foundation model for trajectory analytics, positioning mobility data as a first-class modality for large-scale representation learning. Code is released for further reference.</p></details> | 4 pages, 2 figures |
| **[BrainPath: Generating Subject-Specific Brain Aging Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16667v2)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantifying and forecasting individual brain aging trajectories is critical for understanding neurodegenerative disease and the heterogeneity of aging, yet current approaches remain limited. Most models predict chronological age, an imperfect surrogate for biological aging, or generate synthetic MRIs that enhance data diversity but fail to capture subject-specific trajectories. Here, we present BrainPath, a 3D generative framework that learns longitudinal brain aging dynamics during training and, at inference, predicts anatomically faithful MRIs at arbitrary timepoints from a single baseline scan. BrainPath integrates an age calibration loss, a swap learning strategy, and an age perceptual loss to preserve subtle, biologically meaningful variations. Across held-out ADNI and an independent NACC dataset, BrainPath outperforms state-of-the-art reference models in structural similarity (SSIM), mean squared error (MSE), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and MRI age-difference accuracy, while capturing realistic and temporally consistent aging patterns. Beyond methodological innovation, BrainPath enables personalized mapping of brain aging, synthetic follow-up scan prediction, and trajectory-based analyses, providing a foundation for precision modeling of brain aging and supporting research into neurodegeneration and aging interventions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hazy Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction via Physical Priors and Graph-Mamba](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24020v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To address the issues of physical information degradation and ineffective pedestrian interaction modeling in pedestrian trajectory prediction under hazy weather conditions, we propose a deep learning model that combines physical priors of atmospheric scattering with topological modeling of pedestrian relationships. Specifically, we first construct a differentiable atmospheric scattering model that decouples haze concentration from light degradation through a network with physical parameter estimation, enabling the learning of haze-mitigated feature representations. Second, we design an adaptive scanning state space model for feature extraction. Our adaptive Mamba variant achieves a 78% inference speed increase over native Mamba while preserving long-range dependency modeling. Finally, to efficiently model pedestrian relationships, we develop a heterogeneous graph attention network, using graph matrices to model multi-granularity interactions between pedestrians and groups, combined with a spatio-temporal fusion module to capture the collaborative evolution patterns of pedestrian movements. Furthermore, we constructed a new pedestrian trajectory prediction dataset based on ETH/UCY to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Experiments show that our method reduces the minADE / minFDE metrics by 37.2% and 41.5%, respectively, compared to the SOTA models in dense haze scenarios (visibility < 30m), providing a new modeling paradigm for reliable perception in intelligent transportation systems in adverse environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Taming Masked Diffusion Language Models via Consistency Trajectory Reinforcement Learning with Fewer Decoding Step](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23924v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) have recently emerged as a promising alternative to autoregressive (AR) language models, offering properties such as parallel decoding, flexible generation orders, and the potential for fewer inference steps. Despite these advantages, decoding strategies and reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms tailored for MDLMs remain underexplored. A naive approach is to directly transfer techniques well-established for AR models to MDLMs. However, this raises an immediate question: Is such a naive transfer truly optimal? For example, 1) Block-wise and semi-AR decoding strategies are not employed during the training of MDLMs, so why do they outperform full diffusion-style decoding during inference? 2) Applying RL algorithms designed for AR models directly to MDLMs exhibits a training-inference inconsistency, since MDLM decoding are non-causal (parallel). This results in inconsistencies between the rollout trajectory and the optimization trajectory. To address these challenges, we propose EOS Early Rejection (EOSER) and Ascending Step-Size (ASS) decoding scheduler, which unlock the potential of MDLMs to perform full diffusion-style decoding, achieving competitive performance with fewer decoding steps. Additionally, we introduce Consistency Trajectory Group Relative Policy Optimization (CJ-GRPO) for taming MDLMs, which emphasizes the consistency between rollout trajectory and optimization trajectory, and reduces the optimization errors caused by skip-step optimization. We conduct extensive experiments on reasoning tasks, such as mathematical and planning benchmarks, using LLaDA-8B-Instruct. The results demonstrate that the proposed EOSER and ASS mechanisms, together with CJ-GRPO, hold significant promise for effectively and efficiently taming MDLMs. Code: https://github.com/yjyddq/EOSER-ASS-RL.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, 7 tables.

However, guiding these models effectively in reactive, closed-loop environments remains a significant challenge. Simple conditioning often fails to provide sufficient guidance in complex and dynamic driving scenarios. Recent work attempts to use typical expert driving behaviors (i.e., anchors) to guide diffusion models but relies on a truncated schedule, which introduces theoretical inconsistencies and can compromise performance. To address this, we introduce BridgeDrive, a novel anchor-guided diffusion bridge policy for closed-loop trajectory planning. Our approach provides a principled diffusion framework that effectively translates anchors into fine-grained trajectory plans, appropriately responding to varying traffic conditions. Our planner is compatible with efficient ODE solvers, a critical factor for real-time autonomous driving deployment. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on the Bench2Drive benchmark, improving the success rate by 5% over prior arts.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 7 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

While LLM agents show decent effectiveness, the high computational cost of input tokens due to the ever-growing trajectory remains an efficiency concern for their applications. Efficiency is largely neglected in existing studies and agent products, and this paper fills the gap by introducing an inference-time trajectory reduction approach to reduce the cost of agents. Through analyzing existing agent trajectories, we demonstrate that useless, redundant, and expired information is widespread in all trajectories, which can be identified and reduced without harming the agent's performance. We then design a simple yet effective trajectory reduction approach, AgentDiet, which automatically removes such waste information. We implement AgentDiet on a top-performing coding agent, and the evaluation on two LLMs and two benchmarks shows that AgentDiet can reduce input tokens by 39.9% ~ 59.7%, or the final computational cost by 21.1% ~ 35.9%, while maintaining the same agent performance. This indicates that trajectory reduction is a promising direction for agent systems.</p></details> | 20 pages, 4 figures |

However, their training paradigm mainly relies on manually collected successful demonstrations, making it difficult to adapt to complex environments when encountering out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios or execution biases. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) provides a closed-loop optimization framework via active trial-and-error mechanism, it suffers from sparse rewards, high variance, and unstable optimization in long-horizon robotic tasks. To address these limitations, we propose Trajectory-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (TGRPO), an online RL-based training framework for VLA models. TGRPO leverages task analysis generated by a large language model to automatically construct dense reward functions, providing fine-grained feedback to accelerate convergence and improve credit assignment. The core of our method is a group-based strategy that samples and normalizes multiple trajectories in parallel, reducing variance through relative comparison. By integrating trajectory-level and step-level advantage estimation, TGRPO captures both global and local optimization signals without relying on a value network. Experiments on four task categories of the LIBERO benchmark demonstrate that TGRPO achieves an average success rate of 80.7\%, which is 4.2\% higher than that of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and outperforms other representative RL-based post-training methods.</p></details> |  |

Unlike conventional approaches that rely solely on raw visual data such as camera images, our method utilizes highly compressed and informative BEV representations, which are generated by fusing multi-modal sensor data (e.g., camera and LiDAR) and aligning them with HD Maps. This unified BEV-HD Map format provides a geometrically consistent and rich scene description, enabling VLMs to perform accurate trajectory planning. Experimental results on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate 44.8% improvements in planning accuracy and complete collision avoidance. Our work highlights that VLMs can effectively interpret processed visual representations like BEV features, expanding their applicability beyond raw images in trajectory planning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Discrete Diffusion Trajectory Alignment via Stepwise Decomposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04832v2)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discrete diffusion models have demonstrated great promise in modeling various sequence data, ranging from human language to biological sequences. Inspired by the success of RL in language models, there is growing interest in further improving the models by alignment with a certain reward. In this work, we propose an offline preference optimization method to approach trajectory alignment for discrete diffusion models. Instead of applying the reward on the final output and backpropagating the gradient to the entire denoising process, we decompose the problem into a set of stepwise alignment objectives by matching the per-step posterior. This framework enables efficient diffusion optimization, is compatible with arbitrary reward functions, and importantly, yields an equivalent optimal solution under additive factorization of the trajectory reward. Experiments across multiple domains including DNA sequence design, protein inverse folding, and language modeling consistently demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Notably, it achieves an up to 12\% improvement over the most competitive RL-based baseline in terms of predicted activity on DNA sequence design, and further improves the GSM8K score from 78.6 to 81.2 on LLaDA-8B-Instruct for language modeling.</p></details> | 22 pages, 3 figures |
| **[From Evidence to Trajectory: Abductive Reasoning Path Synthesis for Training Retrieval-Augmented Generation Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23071v1)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation agents development is hindered by the lack of process-level supervision to effectively guide agentic capabilities like task decomposition, retriever invocation, and stepwise decision-making. While reinforcement learning offers a potential solution, it suffers from sparse rewards and the limited reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Meanwhile, existing data synthesis methods only produce chain-of-thought rationales and fail to model environmental interactions. In this paper, we propose EviPath, an evidence-anchored reasoning path synthesis paradigm for RAG agent development. EviPath comprises: (i) Abductive Subtask Planning, which decomposes the problem into sub-questions and iteratively plans an optimal solution path based on the dependencies between them; (ii) Faithful Sub-question Answering, which uses supporting evidence to construct a proxy environment to generate reasoning thoughts and answers for each sub-question; and (iii) Conversational Fine-Tuning, which formats the complete agent-environment interaction trajectory into a dialogue format suitable for Supervised Fine-Tuning. EviPath allows LLMs to learn complex reasoning and tool-use capabilities directly from synthesized data. Extensive experiments on widely-used question-answering benchmarks show that an 8B parameter model trained with EviPath-synthesized data significantly and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with a double-digit absolute EM gain of 14.7% in open-domain question answering.</p></details> |  |

With consideration of this, a number of recent neural network models leverage inductive biases from classical mechanics to encourage model interpretability and ensure forecasted states are physical. However, in general, these models are designed to capture the dynamics of a single system with fixed physical parameters, from state-space measurements of a known configuration space. In this paper we introduce Symplectic Phase Space GAN (SPS-GAN) which can capture the dynamics of multiple systems, and generalize to unseen physical parameters from. Moreover, SPS-GAN does not require prior knowledge of the system configuration space. In fact, SPS-GAN can discover the configuration space structure of the system from arbitrary measurement types (e.g., state-space measurements, video frames). To achieve physically plausible generation, we introduce a novel architecture which embeds a Hamiltonian neural network recurrent module in a conditional GAN backbone. To discover the structure of the configuration space, we optimize the conditional time-series GAN objective with an additional physically motivated term to encourages a sparse representation of the configuration space. We demonstrate the utility of SPS-GAN for trajectory prediction, video generation and symmetry discovery. Our approach captures multiple systems and achieves performance on par with supervised models designed for single systems.</p></details> |  |

To bridge this gap, we introduce JointDiff, a novel diffusion framework designed to unify these two processes by simultaneously generating continuous spatio-temporal data and synchronous discrete events. We demonstrate its efficacy in the sports domain by simultaneously modeling multi-agent trajectories and key possession events. This joint modeling is validated with non-controllable generation and two novel controllable generation scenarios: weak-possessor-guidance, which offers flexible semantic control over game dynamics through a simple list of intended ball possessors, and text-guidance, which enables fine-grained, language-driven generation. To enable the conditioning with these guidance signals, we introduce CrossGuid, an effective conditioning operation for multi-agent domains.

| **[Beyond the Proxy: Trajectory-Distilled Guidance for Offline GFlowNet Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20110v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) are effective at sampling diverse, high-reward objects, but in many real-world settings where new reward queries are infeasible, they must be trained from offline datasets. The prevailing proxy-based training methods are susceptible to error propagation, while existing proxy-free approaches often use coarse constraints that limit exploration. To address these issues, we propose Trajectory-Distilled GFlowNet (TD-GFN), a novel proxy-free training framework. TD-GFN learns dense, transition-level edge rewards from offline trajectories via inverse reinforcement learning to provide rich structural guidance for efficient exploration. Crucially, to ensure robustness, these rewards are used indirectly to guide the policy through DAG pruning and prioritized backward sampling of training trajectories. This ensures that final gradient updates depend only on ground-truth terminal rewards from the dataset, thereby preventing the error propagation. Experiments show that TD-GFN significantly outperforms a broad range of existing baselines in both convergence speed and final sample quality, establishing a more robust and efficient paradigm for offline GFlowNet training.</p></details> |  |

We propose AnchDrive, a framework for end-to-end driving that effectively bootstraps a diffusion policy to mitigate the high computational cost of traditional generative models. Rather than denoising from pure noise, AnchDrive initializes its planner with a rich set of hybrid trajectory anchors. These anchors are derived from two complementary sources: a static vocabulary of general driving priors and a set of dynamic, context-aware trajectories. The dynamic trajectories are decoded in real-time by a Transformer that processes dense and sparse perceptual features. The diffusion model then learns to refine these anchors by predicting a distribution of trajectory offsets, enabling fine-grained refinement. This anchor-based bootstrapping design allows for efficient generation of diverse, high-quality trajectories. Experiments on the NAVSIM benchmark confirm that AnchDrive sets a new state-of-the-art and shows strong generalizability</p></details> |  |
| **[R-Stitch: Dynamic Trajectory Stitching for Efficient Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17307v4)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chain-of-thought (CoT) enhances the problem-solving ability of large language models (LLMs) but incurs substantial inference cost due to long autoregressive trajectories. Existing acceleration strategies either shorten traces via early stopping or compression, or adopt speculative decoding with a smaller model. However, speculative decoding provides limited gains when model agreement is low and rigidly enforces token-level consistency, overlooking the observation that some smaller models, when correct, produce significantly more concise reasoning traces that could reduce inference length. We introduce R-Stitch, a training-free hybrid decoding framework that leverages token-level entropy as an uncertainty proxy to delegate computation between a small language model (SLM) and an LLM. Our analysis shows that high-entropy tokens are more likely to induce errors, motivating an entropy-guided routing strategy that lets the SLM efficiently handle low-entropy tokens while delegating uncertain ones to the LLM, thereby avoiding full rollbacks and preserving answer quality. We further extend this design with R-Stitch$^{+}$, which learns an adaptive routing policy to adjust the token budget dynamically beyond fixed thresholds. By jointly reducing per-token decoding complexity and the number of generated tokens, our method achieves substantial acceleration with negligible accuracy loss. Concretely, it attains peak speedups of 3.00$\times$ on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, 3.85$\times$ on 14B, and 4.10$\times$ on QWQ-32B while maintaining accuracy comparable to full LLM decoding. Moreover, it naturally enables adaptive efficiency--accuracy trade-offs that can be tailored to diverse computational budgets without retraining.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Flexible Forward Trajectories for Masked Molecular Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16790v4)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have achieved notable progress in modeling discrete data, while their potential in molecular generation remains underexplored. In this work, we explore their potential and introduce the surprising result that naively applying standards MDMs severely degrades the performance. We identify the critical cause of this issue as a state-clashing problem-where the forward diffusion of distinct molecules collapse into a common state, resulting in a mixture of reconstruction targets that cannot be learned using typical reverse diffusion process with unimodal predictions. To mitigate this, we propose Masked Element-wise Learnable Diffusion (MELD) that orchestrates per-element corruption trajectories to avoid collision between distinct molecular graphs. This is achieved through a parameterized noise scheduling network that assigns distinct corruption rates to individual graph elements, i.e., atoms and bonds. Extensive experiments on diverse molecular benchmarks reveal that MELD markedly enhances overall generation quality compared to element-agnostic noise scheduling, increasing the chemical validity of vanilla MDMs on ZINC250K from 15% to 93%, Furthermore, it achieves state-of-the-art property alignment in conditional generation tasks.</p></details> |  |

In FedAVG multi-step scenarios, attackers observe only aggregated gradients, making data reconstruction challenging. Existing surrogate model methods like SME assume linear parameter trajectories, but we demonstrate this severely underestimates SGD's nonlinear complexity, fundamentally limiting attack effectiveness. We propose Non-Linear Surrogate Model Extension (NL-SME), the first method to introduce nonlinear parametric trajectory modeling for GIAs. Our approach replaces linear interpolation with learnable quadratic B\'ezier curves that capture SGD's curved characteristics through control points, combined with regularization and dvec scaling mechanisms for enhanced expressiveness. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100 and FEMNIST datasets show NL-SME significantly outperforms baselines across all metrics, achieving order-of-magnitude improvements in cosine similarity loss while maintaining computational efficiency.This work exposes heightened privacy vulnerabilities in FL's multi-step update paradigm and offers novel perspectives for developing robust defense strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[FAST: Foreground-aware Diffusion with Accelerated Sampling Trajectory for Segmentation-oriented Anomaly Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20295v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Industrial anomaly segmentation relies heavily on pixel-level annotations, yet real-world anomalies are often scarce, diverse, and costly to label. Segmentation-oriented industrial anomaly synthesis (SIAS) has emerged as a promising alternative; however, existing methods struggle to balance sampling efficiency and generation quality. Moreover, most approaches treat all spatial regions uniformly, overlooking the distinct statistical differences between anomaly and background areas. This uniform treatment hinders the synthesis of controllable, structure-specific anomalies tailored for segmentation tasks. In this paper, we propose FAST, a foreground-aware diffusion framework featuring two novel modules: the Anomaly-Informed Accelerated Sampling (AIAS) and the Foreground-Aware Reconstruction Module (FARM). AIAS is a training-free sampling algorithm specifically designed for segmentation-oriented industrial anomaly synthesis, which accelerates the reverse process through coarse-to-fine aggregation and enables the synthesis of state-of-the-art segmentation-oriented anomalies in as few as 10 steps. Meanwhile, FARM adaptively adjusts the anomaly-aware noise within the masked foreground regions at each sampling step, preserving localized anomaly signals throughout the denoising trajectory. Extensive experiments on multiple industrial benchmarks demonstrate that FAST consistently outperforms existing anomaly synthesis methods in downstream segmentation tasks. We release the code at: https://github.com/Chhro123/fast-foreground-aware-anomaly-synthesis.</p></details> |  |
| **[FlowDrive: moderated flow matching with data balancing for trajectory planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21961v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning-based planners are sensitive to the long-tailed distribution of driving data. Common maneuvers dominate datasets, while dangerous or rare scenarios are sparse. This imbalance can bias models toward the frequent cases and degrade performance on critical scenarios. To tackle this problem, we compare balancing strategies for sampling training data and find reweighting by trajectory pattern an effective approach. We then present FlowDrive, a flow-matching trajectory planner that learns a conditional rectified flow to map noise directly to trajectory distributions with few flow-matching steps. We further introduce moderated, in-the-loop guidance that injects small perturbation between flow steps to systematically increase trajectory diversity while remaining scene-consistent. On nuPlan and the interaction-focused interPlan benchmarks, FlowDrive achieves state-of-the-art results among learning-based planners and approaches methods with rule-based refinements. After adding moderated guidance and light post-processing (FlowDrive*), it achieves overall state-of-the-art performance across nearly all benchmark splits.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce a framework for generating moving sounds given text prompts in a controllable fashion. To enable training, we construct a synthetic dataset that records moving sounds in binaural format, their spatial trajectories, and text captions about the sound event and spatial motion. Using this dataset, we train a text-to-trajectory prediction model that outputs the three-dimensional trajectory of a moving sound source given text prompts. To generate spatial audio, we first fine-tune a pre-trained text-to-audio generative model to output temporally aligned mono sound with the trajectory. The spatial audio is then simulated using the predicted temporally-aligned trajectory. Experimental evaluation demonstrates reasonable spatial understanding of the text-to-trajectory model. This approach could be easily integrated into existing text-to-audio generative workflow and extended to moving sound generation in other spatial audio formats.</p></details> |  |
| **[Plan-R1: Safe and Feasible Trajectory Planning as Language Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17659v3)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safe and feasible trajectory planning is critical for real-world autonomous driving systems. However, existing learning-based planners rely heavily on expert demonstrations, which not only lack explicit safety awareness but also risk inheriting undesirable behaviors such as speeding from suboptimal human driving data. Inspired by the success of large language models, we propose Plan-R1, a two-stage trajectory planning framework that decouples principle alignment from behavior learning. In the first stage, a general trajectory predictor is pre-trained on expert data to capture diverse, human-like driving behaviors. In the second stage, the model is fine-tuned with rule-based rewards using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), explicitly aligning ego planning with principles such as safety, comfort, and traffic rule compliance. This two-stage paradigm retains human-like behaviors while enhancing safety awareness and discarding undesirable patterns from demonstrations. Furthermore, we identify a key limitation of directly applying GRPO to planning: group-wise normalization erases cross-group scale differences, causing rare, high-variance safety-violation groups to have similar advantages as abundant low-variance safe groups, thereby suppressing optimization for safety-critical objectives. To address this, we propose Variance-Decoupled GRPO (VD-GRPO), which replaces normalization with centering and fixed scaling to preserve absolute reward magnitudes, ensuring that safety-critical objectives remain dominant throughout training. Experiments on the nuPlan benchmark demonstrate that Plan-R1 significantly improves planning safety and feasibility, achieving state-of-the-art performance, particularly in realistic reactive settings. Our code is available at https://github.com/XiaolongTang23/Plan-R1.</p></details> |  |
| **[Aircraft Trajectory Dataset Augmentation in Latent Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07585v3)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aircraft trajectory modeling plays a crucial role in air traffic management (ATM) and is important for various downstream tasks, including conflict detection and landing time prediction. Dataset augmentation by adding synthetically generated trajectory data is necessary to develop a more robust aircraft trajectory model and ensure that the trajectory dataset is sufficient and balanced. We propose a novel framework called ATRADA for aircraft trajectory dataset augmentation. In the proposed framework, a Transformer encoder learns the underlying patterns in the original trajectory dataset and converts each data point into a context vector in the learned latent space. The converted dataset is projected to reduced dimensions using principal component analysis (PCA), and a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is applied to fit the probability distribution of the data points in the reduced-dimensional space. Finally, new samples are drawn from the fitted GMM, the dimension of the samples is reverted to the original dimension, and the samples are decoded with a multi-layer perceptron (MLP). Several experiments demonstrate that the framework effectively generates new, high-quality synthetic aircraft trajectory data, which were compared to the results of several baselines.</p></details> |  |

Anticipating Future Motion by Generating Point Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21592v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of forecasting motion from a single image, i.e., predicting how objects in the world are likely to move, without the ability to observe other parameters such as the object velocities or the forces applied to them. We formulate this task as conditional generation of dense trajectory grids with a model that closely follows the architecture of modern video generators but outputs motion trajectories instead of pixels. This approach captures scene-wide dynamics and uncertainty, yielding more accurate and diverse predictions than prior regressors and generators. We extensively evaluate our method on simulated data, demonstrate its effectiveness on downstream applications such as robotics, and show promising accuracy on real-world intuitive physics datasets. Although recent state-of-the-art video generators are often regarded as world models, we show that they struggle with forecasting motion from a single image, even in simple physical scenarios such as falling blocks or mechanical object interactions, despite fine-tuning on such data. We show that this limitation arises from the overhead of generating pixels rather than directly modeling motion.</p></details> |  |
| **[\LARGE GMP$^{3}$: Learning-Driven, Bellman-Guided Trajectory Planning for UAVs in Real-Time on SE(3)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21264v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose $\text{GMP}^{3}$, a multiphase global path planning framework that generates dynamically feasible three-dimensional trajectories for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) operating in cluttered environments. The framework extends traditional path planning from Euclidean position spaces to the Lie group $\mathrm{SE}(3)$, allowing joint learning of translational motion and rotational dynamics. A modified Bellman-based operator is introduced to support reinforcement learning (RL) policy updates while leveraging prior trajectory information for improved convergence. $\text{GMP}^{3}$ is designed as a distributed framework in which agents influence each other and share policy information along the trajectory: each agent refines its assigned segment and shares with its neighbors via a consensus-based scheme, enabling cooperative policy updates and convergence toward a path shaped globally even under kinematic constraints. We also propose DroneManager, a modular ground control software that interfaces the planner with real UAV platforms via the MAVLink protocol, supporting real-time deployment and feedback. Simulation studies and indoor flight experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in constrained 3D environments, demonstrating reliable obstacle avoidance and smooth, feasible trajectories across both position and orientation.

Existing approaches often attempt to learn these motions separately, which may lead to confusion regarding the relative motion between the camera and the objects. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that integrates both camera and object motions by converting them into the motion of corresponding pixels. Utilizing a stable diffusion network, we effectively learn reference motion maps in relation to the specified camera trajectory. These maps, along with an extracted semantic object prior, are then fed into an image-to-video network to generate the desired video that can accurately follow the designated camera trajectory while maintaining consistent object motions. Extensive experiments verify that our model outperforms SOTA methods by a large margin.</p></details> | ICME2025 |

However, we find that the perpendicular component of the pushing force from negative samples in contrastive learning is a double-edged sword: it contains rich supplementary information from negative samples, yet its unconstrained nature causes optimization trajectory drift and training instability. To address this, we propose Support Vector Regularization (SVR), a method that introduces an auxiliary support vector to control this perpendicular component, aiming to harness its rich information while mitigating the associated trajectory drift. The efficacy of SVR is critically governed by its semantic radius, for which we explore two unsupervised modeling strategies: direct parameterization and an adaptive radius predictor module enhanced with constraints to improve its predicting accuracy. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method surpasses widely used baselines like InfoNCE and SigLIP loss across classification, monolingual retrieval, and multilingual retrieval on standard audio-text datasets. Both the theoretical analysis and the experimental results on optimizing trajectory drift validate the correctness and effectiveness of our SVR method.</p></details> |  |

However, predicting multi-agent flight trajectories is inherently challenging. One of the major difficulties is modeling both the individual aircraft behaviors over time and the complex interactions between flights. Generating explainable prediction outcomes is also a challenge. Therefore, we propose a Multi-Agent Inverted Transformer, MAIFormer, as a novel neural architecture that predicts multi-agent flight trajectories. The proposed framework features two key attention modules: (i) masked multivariate attention, which captures spatio-temporal patterns of individual aircraft, and (ii) agent attention, which models the social patterns among multiple agents in complex air traffic scenes. We evaluated MAIFormer using a real-world automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast flight trajectory dataset from the terminal airspace of Incheon International Airport in South Korea. The experimental results show that MAIFormer achieves the best performance across multiple metrics and outperforms other methods. In addition, MAIFormer produces prediction outcomes that are interpretable from a human perspective, which improves both the transparency of the model and its practical utility in air traffic control.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, submitted for IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation System</p></details> |

Existing detection methods, which primarily rely on surface-level lexical overlap and perplexity, demonstrate low generalization and degrade significantly when encountering implicitly contaminated data. In this paper, we propose MemLens (An Activation Lens for Memorization Detection) to detect memorization by analyzing the probability trajectories of numeric tokens during generation. Our method reveals that contaminated samples exhibit ``shortcut'' behaviors, locking onto an answer with high confidence in the model's early layers, whereas clean samples show more gradual evidence accumulation across the model's full depth. We observe that contaminated and clean samples exhibit distinct and well-separated reasoning trajectories. To further validate this, we inject carefully designed samples into the model through LoRA fine-tuning and observe the same trajectory patterns as in naturally contaminated data. These results provide strong evidence that MemLens captures genuine signals of memorization rather than spurious correlations.</p></details> | <details><summary>20pag...</summary><p>20pages, 11 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

We address this problem by proposing the Joint Flow Trajectory Optimization (JFTO) framework for grasp pose generation and object trajectory imitation under the video-based Learning-from-Demonstration (LfD) paradigm. Rather than directly imitating human hand motions, our method treats demonstrations as object-centric guides, balancing three objectives: (i) selecting a feasible grasp pose, (ii) generating object trajectories consistent with demonstrated motions, and (iii) ensuring collision-free execution within robot kinematics. To capture the multimodal nature of demonstrations, we extend flow matching to $\SE(3)$ for probabilistic modeling of object trajectories, enabling density-aware imitation that avoids mode collapse. The resulting optimization integrates grasp similarity, trajectory likelihood, and collision penalties into a unified differentiable objective. We validate our approach in both simulation and real-world experiments across diverse real-world manipulation tasks.</p></details> |  |

Previous PRMs are primarily trained on model final output responses and struggle to evaluate intermediate thinking trajectories robustly, especially in the emerging setting of trajectory-response outputs generated by frontier reasoning models like Deepseek-R1. In this work, we introduce ReasonFlux-PRM, a novel trajectory-aware PRM explicitly designed to evaluate the trajectory-response type of reasoning traces. ReasonFlux-PRM incorporates both step-level and trajectory-level supervision, enabling fine-grained reward assignment aligned with structured chain-of-thought data. We adapt ReasonFlux-PRM to support reward supervision under both offline and online settings, including (i) selecting high-quality model distillation data for downstream supervised fine-tuning of smaller models, (ii) providing dense process-level rewards for policy optimization during reinforcement learning, and (iii) enabling reward-guided Best-of-N test-time scaling. Empirical results on challenging downstream benchmarks such as AIME, MATH500, and GPQA-Diamond demonstrate that ReasonFlux-PRM-7B selects higher quality data than strong PRMs (e.g., Qwen2.5-Math-PRM-72B) and human-curated baselines. Furthermore, our derived ReasonFlux-PRM-7B yields consistent performance improvements, achieving average gains of 12.1% in supervised fine-tuning, 4.5% in reinforcement learning, and 6.3% in test-time scaling.

However, they are computationally expensive because they sample a trajectory of trajectories: a diffusion$/$flow trajectory of action trajectories. They discard intermediate action trajectories, and must wait for the sampling process to complete before any actions can be executed on the robot. We simplify diffusion$/$flow policies by treating action trajectories as flow trajectories. Instead of starting from pure noise, our algorithm samples from a narrow Gaussian around the last action. Then, it incrementally integrates a velocity field learned via flow matching to produce a sequence of actions that constitute a single trajectory. This enables actions to be streamed to the robot on-the-fly during the flow sampling process, and is well-suited for receding horizon policy execution. Despite streaming, our method retains the ability to model multi-modal behavior. We train flows that stabilize around demonstration trajectories to reduce distribution shift and improve imitation learning performance. Streaming flow policy outperforms prior methods while enabling faster policy execution and tighter sensorimotor loops for learning-based robot control.

The framework integrates a two-stage nonlinear optimization pipeline that balances efficiency, safety and smoothness. Experimental results demonstrate that C-3TO produces collision-aware and dynamically feasible trajectories. Moreover, its flexibility in defining local window sizes and optimization parameters enables straightforward adaptation to diverse user's needs without compromising performance. By combining continuous trajectory parameterization with a continuously updated neural ESDF, C-3TO establishes a robust and generalizable foundation for safe and efficient local replanning in aerial robotics.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, submitted to ICRA 2026</p></details> |

Existing corridor based planners which rely on decomposition of the free space into collision free subsets scale poorly with environmental complexity and require explicit allocations of time windows to trajectory segments. We introduce a new trajectory parameterization that represents trajectories in a nonconvex collision free corridor as being in a convex cartesian product of balls. This parameterization allows us to decouple problem size from geometric complexity of the solution and naturally avoids explicit time allocation by allowing trajectories to evolve continuously inside ellipsoidal corridors. Building on this representation, we formulate the Orthogonal Trust Region Problem (Orth-TRP), a specialized convex program with separable block constraints, and develop a solver that exploits this parallel structure and the unique structure of each parallel subproblem for efficient optimization. Experiments on a quadrotor trajectory planning benchmark show that our approach produces smoother trajectories and lower runtimes than state-of-the-art corridor based planners, especially in highly complicated environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Augmenting Multi-Agent Communication with State Delta Trajectory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19209v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent techniques such as role playing or multi-turn debates have been shown to be effective in improving the performance of large language models (LLMs) in downstream tasks. Despite their differences in workflows, existing multi-agent systems constructed from a single base LLM mostly use natural language for agent communication. While this is appealing for its simplicity and interpretability, it also introduces inevitable information loss as one model must down sample its continuous state vectors to discrete tokens before transferring them to the other model. Such losses are particularly significant when the information to transfer is not simple facts, but reasoning logics or abstractive thoughts. To tackle this problem, we propose a new communication protocol that transfers both natural language tokens and token-wise state transition trajectory from one agent to another. Particularly, compared to the actual state value, we find that the sequence of state changes in LLMs after generating each token can better reflect the information hidden behind the inference process. We propose a State Delta Encoding (SDE) method to represent state transition trajectories. The experimental results show that multi-agent systems with SDE achieve SOTA performance compared to other communication protocols, particularly in tasks that involve complex reasoning.</p></details> | 22 pages, 5 figures |

| **[Graph Enhanced Trajectory Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18386v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory anomaly detection is essential for identifying unusual and unexpected movement patterns in applications ranging from intelligent transportation systems to urban safety and fraud prevention. Existing methods only consider limited aspects of the trajectory nature and its movement space by treating trajectories as sequences of sampled locations, with sampling determined by positioning technology, e.g., GPS, or by high-level abstractions such as staypoints. Trajectories are analyzed in Euclidean space, neglecting the constraints and connectivity information of the underlying movement network, e.g., road or transit networks. The proposed Graph Enhanced Trajectory Anomaly Detection (GETAD) framework tightly integrates road network topology, segment semantics, and historical travel patterns to model trajectory data. GETAD uses a Graph Attention Network to learn road-aware embeddings that capture both physical attributes and transition behavior, and augments these with graph-based positional encodings that reflect the spatial layout of the road network. A Transformer-based decoder models sequential movement, while a multiobjective loss function combining autoregressive prediction and supervised link prediction ensures realistic and structurally coherent representations. To improve the robustness of anomaly detection, we introduce Confidence Weighted Negative Log Likelihood (CW NLL), an anomaly scoring function that emphasizes high-confidence deviations. Experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that GETAD achieves consistent improvements over existing methods, particularly in detecting subtle anomalies in road-constrained environments. These results highlight the benefits of incorporating graph structure and contextual semantics into trajectory modeling, enabling more precise and context-aware anomaly detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[ACTIVE: Continuous Similarity Search for Vessel Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01142v2)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Publicly available vessel trajectory data is emitted continuously from the global AIS system. Continuous trajectory similarity search on this data has applications in, e.g., maritime navigation and safety. Existing proposals typically assume an offline setting and focus on finding similarities between complete trajectories. Such proposals are less effective when applied to online scenarios, where similarity comparisons must be performed continuously as new trajectory data arrives and trajectories evolve. We therefore propose a real-time continuous trajectory similarity search method for vessels (ACTIVE). We introduce a novel similarity measure, object-trajectory real-time distance, that emphasizes the anticipated future movement trends of vessels, enabling more predictive and forward-looking comparisons. Next, we propose a segment-based vessel trajectory index structure that organizes historical trajectories into smaller and manageable segments, facilitating accelerated similarity computations. Leveraging this index, we propose an efficient continuous similar trajectory search (CSTS) algorithm together with a variety of search space pruning strategies that reduce unnecessary computations during the continuous similarity search, thereby further improving efficiency. Extensive experiments on two large real-world AIS datasets offer evidence that ACTIVE is capable of outperforming state-of-the-art methods considerably. ACTIVE significantly reduces index construction costs and index size while achieving a 70% reduction in terms of query time and a 60% increase in terms of hit rate.</p></details> |  |
| **[Equality Constrained Diffusion for Direct Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01939v2)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent success of diffusion-based generative models in image and natural language processing has ignited interest in diffusion-based trajectory optimization for nonlinear control systems. Existing methods cannot, however, handle the nonlinear equality constraints necessary for direct trajectory optimization. As a result, diffusion-based trajectory optimizers are currently limited to shooting methods, where the nonlinear dynamics are enforced by forward rollouts. This precludes many of the benefits enjoyed by direct methods, including flexible state constraints, reduced numerical sensitivity, and easy initial guess specification. In this paper, we present a method for diffusion-based optimization with equality constraints. This allows us to perform direct trajectory optimization, enforcing dynamic feasibility with constraints rather than rollouts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first diffusion-based optimization algorithm that supports the general nonlinear equality constraints required for direct trajectory optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACC 2...</summary><p>ACC 2025, fixed typo in equations (11)-(12)</p></details> |
| **[SocialTraj: Two-Stage Socially-Aware Trajectory Prediction for Autonomous Driving via Conditional Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17850v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate trajectory prediction of surrounding vehicles (SVs) is crucial for autonomous driving systems to avoid misguided decisions and potential accidents. However, achieving reliable predictions in highly dynamic and complex traffic scenarios remains a significant challenge. One of the key impediments lies in the limited effectiveness of current approaches to capture the multi-modal behaviors of drivers, which leads to predicted trajectories that deviate from actual future motions. To address this issue, we propose SocialTraj, a novel trajectory prediction framework integrating social psychology principles through social value orientation (SVO). By utilizing Bayesian inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) to estimate the SVO of SVs, we obtain the critical social context to infer the future interaction trend. To ensure modal consistency in predicted behaviors, the estimated SVOs of SVs are embedded into a conditional denoising diffusion model that aligns generated trajectories with historical driving styles. Additionally, the planned future trajectory of the ego vehicle (EV) is explicitly incorporated to enhance interaction modeling. Extensive experiments on NGSIM and HighD datasets demonstrate that SocialTraj is capable of adapting to highly dynamic and interactive scenarios while generating socially compliant and behaviorally consistent trajectory predictions, outperforming existing baselines. Ablation studies demonstrate that dynamic SVO estimation and explicit ego-planning components notably improve prediction accuracy and substantially reduce inference time.</p></details> |  |
| **[High-Precision and High-Efficiency Trajectory Tracking for Excavators Based on Closed-Loop Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17387v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The complex nonlinear dynamics of hydraulic excavators, such as time delays and control coupling, pose significant challenges to achieving high-precision trajectory tracking. Traditional control methods often fall short in such applications due to their inability to effectively handle these nonlinearities, while commonly used learning-based methods require extensive interactions with the environment, leading to inefficiency. To address these issues, we introduce EfficientTrack, a trajectory tracking method that integrates model-based learning to manage nonlinear dynamics and leverages closed-loop dynamics to improve learning efficiency, ultimately minimizing tracking errors. We validate our method through comprehensive experiments both in simulation and on a real-world excavator. Comparative experiments in simulation demonstrate that our method outperforms existing learning-based approaches, achieving the highest tracking precision and smoothness with the fewest interactions. Real-world experiments further show that our method remains effective under load conditions and possesses the ability for continual learning, highlighting its practical applicability.

| **[Fast Trajectory Planner with a Reinforcement Learning-based Controller for Robotic Manipulators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17381v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating obstacle-free trajectories for robotic manipulators in unstructured and cluttered environments remains a significant challenge. Existing motion planning methods often require additional computational effort to generate the final trajectory by solving kinematic or dynamic equations. This paper highlights the strong potential of model-free reinforcement learning methods over model-based approaches for obstacle-free trajectory planning in joint space. We propose a fast trajectory planning system for manipulators that combines vision-based path planning in task space with reinforcement learning-based obstacle avoidance in joint space. We divide the framework into two key components. The first introduces an innovative vision-based trajectory planner in task space, leveraging the large-scale fast segment anything (FSA) model in conjunction with basis spline (B-spline)-optimized kinodynamic path searching. The second component enhances the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm by integrating action ensembles (AE) and policy feedback (PF), which greatly improve precision and stability in goal-reaching and obstacle avoidance within the joint space. These PPO enhancements increase the algorithm's adaptability across diverse robotic tasks, ensuring consistent execution of commands from the first component by the manipulator, while also enhancing both obstacle avoidance efficiency and reaching accuracy. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of PPO enhancements, as well as simulation-to-simulation (Sim-to-Sim) and simulation-to-reality (Sim-to-Real) transfer, in improving model robustness and planner efficiency in complex scenarios. These enhancements allow the robot to perform obstacle avoidance and real-time trajectory planning in obstructed environments.

| **[AIMMerging: Adaptive Iterative Model Merging Using Training Trajectories for Language Model Continual Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17348v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual learning (CL) is essential for deploying large language models (LLMs) in dynamic real-world environments without the need for costly retraining. Recent model merging-based methods have attracted significant attention, but they still struggle to effectively manage the trade-off between learning new knowledge and preventing forgetting, a challenge largely stemming from suboptimal number of merges and merging frequency. In this paper, we introduce Adaptive Iterative Model Merging (AimMerging), a novel CL framework that utilizes learning and forgetting signals from the training trajectory to dynamically monitor the model's training status. Guided by dynamic monitoring, the training trajectory-guided merge controller adaptively determines the timing and frequency of iterative fusion, while the rehearsal-based knowledge fusion module computes the merging weights and executes the fusion. Comprehensive experiments on three CL benchmarks with various model sizes (from 770M to 13B) demonstrate that AimMerging achieves significant performance improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods, with an average relative improvement of 80% and 59% on FWT and BWT, respectively.

Conventional mapping-planning-control pipelines incur high computational cost and propagate estimation errors. We present AERO-MPPI, a fully GPU-accelerated framework that unifies perception and planning through an anchor-guided ensemble of Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) optimizers. Specifically, we design a multi-resolution LiDAR point-cloud representation that rapidly extracts spatially distributed "anchors" as look-ahead intermediate endpoints, from which we construct polynomial trajectory guides to explore distinct homotopy path classes. At each planning step, we run multiple MPPI instances in parallel and evaluate them with a two-stage multi-objective cost that balances collision avoidance and goal reaching. Implemented entirely with NVIDIA Warp GPU kernels, AERO-MPPI achieves real-time onboard operation and mitigates the local-minima failures of single-MPPI approaches. Extensive simulations in forests, verticals, and inclines demonstrate sustained reliable flight above 7 m/s, with success rates above 80% and smoother trajectories compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Real-world experiments on a LiDAR-equipped quadrotor with NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX 16G confirm that AERO-MPPI runs in real time onboard and consistently achieves safe, agile, and robust flight in complex cluttered environments. The code will be open-sourced upon acceptance of the paper.</p></details> |  |

Trackers relying on these 2D cues are particularly unreliable in robotic environments, where dense targets and frequent occlusions are common. While depth information has the potential to alleviate these issues, most existing MOT datasets lack depth annotations, leading to its underexploited role in the domain. To unveil the potential of depth-informed trajectory refinement, we introduce DepTR-MOT, a DETR-based detector enhanced with instance-level depth information. Specifically, we propose two key innovations: (i) foundation model-based instance-level soft depth label supervision, which refines depth prediction, and (ii) the distillation of dense depth maps to maintain global depth consistency. These strategies enable DepTR-MOT to output instance-level depth during inference, without requiring foundation models and without additional computational cost. By incorporating depth cues, our method enhances the robustness of the TBD paradigm, effectively resolving occlusion and close-proximity challenges. Experiments on both the QuadTrack and DanceTrack datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving HOTA scores of 27.59 and 44.47, respectively. In particular, results on QuadTrack, a robotic platform MOT dataset, highlight the advantages of our method in handling occlusion and close-proximity challenges in robotic tracking.

Recent methods use diffusion on either graph embeddings or the discrete space of nodes and edges. However, simple changes to embeddings (say, adding noise) can mean uninterpretable changes in the graph. In discrete-space diffusion, each step may add or remove many nodes/edges. It is hard to predict what graph patterns we will observe after many diffusion steps. Our proposed method, called GraphWeave, takes a different approach. We separate pattern generation and graph construction. To find patterns in the training graphs, we see how they transform vectors during random walks. We then generate new graphs in two steps. First, we generate realistic random walk "trajectories" which match the learned patterns. Then, we find the optimal graph that fits these trajectories. The optimization infers all edges jointly, which improves robustness to errors. On four simulated and five real-world benchmark datasets, GraphWeave outperforms existing methods. The most significant differences are on large-scale graph structures such as PageRank, cuts, communities, degree distributions, and flows. GraphWeave is also 10x faster than its closest competitor. Finally, GraphWeave is simple, needing only a transformer and standard optimizers.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 4 figures.

This paper addresses fault-tolerant trajectory tracking of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) under thruster failures. We propose an adaptive Lyapunov-constrained model predictive control (LMPC) that guarantees stable trajectory tracking when the AUV switches between fault and normal modes. Particularly, we model different AUV thruster faults and build online failure identification based on Bayesian approach. This facilitates a soft switch between AUV status, and the identified and updated AUV failure model feeds LMPC controller for the control law derivation. The Lyapunov constrain in LMPC ensures that the trajectory tracking control remains stable during AUV status shifts, thus mitigating severe and fatal fluctuations when an AUV thruster occurs or recovers. We conduct numerical simulations on a four-thruster planar AUV using the proposed approach. The results demonstrate smooth transitions between thruster failure types and low trajectory tracking errors compared with the benchmark adaptive MPC and backstepping control with rapid failure identification and failure accommodation during the trajectory tracking.</p></details> |  |

However, most state-of-the-art large pretrained language models predict subword tokens of variable length. We investigate how to practically use such models to make accurate and efficient character predictions. Our algorithm for producing character predictions from a subword large language model (LLM) provides more accurate predictions than using a classification layer, a byte-level LLM, or an n-gram model. Additionally, we investigate a domain adaptation procedure based on a large dataset of sentences we curated based on scoring how useful each sentence might be for spoken or written AAC communication. We find our procedure further improves model performance on simple, conversational text.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in Findings of EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

However, real-world data are composites of heterogeneous cohorts with distinct conditional distributions. As models increase in scale and complexity and as more data is used for training, they become dominated by central distribution patterns, neglecting head and tail regions. This imbalance limits the model's learning ability and can result in inactive attention weights or dead neurons. In this paper, we reveal how the attention mechanism can play a key role in factorization machines for shared embedding selection, and propose to address this challenge by analyzing the substructures in the dataset and exposing those with strong distributional contrast through auxiliary learning. Unlike previous research, which heuristically applies weighted labels or multi-task heads to mitigate such biases, we leverage partially conflicting auxiliary labels to regularize the shared representation. This approach customizes the learning process of attention layers to preserve mutual information with minority cohorts while improving global performance. We evaluated C2AL on massive production datasets with billions of data points each for six SOTA models. Experiments show that the factorization machine is able to capture fine-grained user-ad interactions using the proposed method, achieving up to a 0.16% reduction in normalized entropy overall and delivering gains exceeding 0.30% on targeted minority cohorts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICLR 2026</p></details> |
| **[UpSafe$^\circ$C: Upcycling for Controllable Safety in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02194v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress across a wide range of tasks, but remain vulnerable to safety risks such as harmful content generation and jailbreak attacks. Existing safety techniques -- including external guardrails, inference-time guidance, and post-training alignment -- each face limitations in balancing safety, utility, and controllability. In this work, we propose UpSafe$^\circ$C, a unified framework for enhancing LLM safety through safety-aware upcycling. Our approach first identifies safety-critical layers and upcycles them into a sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) structure, where the router acts as a soft guardrail that selectively activates original MLPs and added safety experts. We further introduce a two-stage SFT strategy to strengthen safety discrimination while preserving general capabilities. To enable flexible control at inference time, we introduce a safety temperature mechanism, allowing dynamic adjustment of the trade-off between safety and utility. Experiments across multiple benchmarks, base model, and model scales demonstrate that UpSafe$^\circ$C achieves robust safety improvements against harmful and jailbreak inputs, while maintaining competitive performance on general tasks. Moreover, analysis shows that safety temperature provides fine-grained inference-time control that achieves the Pareto-optimal frontier between utility and safety. Our results highlight a new direction for LLM safety: moving from static alignment toward dynamic, modular, and inference-aware control.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Few Large Shifts: Layer-Inconsistency Based Minimal Overhead Adversarial Example Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12586v5)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks (DNNs) are highly susceptible to adversarial examples--subtle, imperceptible perturbations that can lead to incorrect predictions. While detection-based defenses offer a practical alternative to adversarial training, many existing methods depend on external models, complex architectures, or adversarial data, limiting their efficiency and generalizability. We introduce a lightweight, plug-in detection framework that leverages internal layer-wise inconsistencies within the target model itself, requiring only benign data for calibration. Our approach is grounded in the A Few Large Shifts Assumption, which posits that adversarial perturbations induce large, localized violations of layer-wise Lipschitz continuity in a small subset of layers. Building on this, we propose two complementary strategies--Recovery Testing (RT) and Logit-layer Testing (LT)--to empirically measure these violations and expose internal disruptions caused by adversaries. Evaluated on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet under both standard and adaptive threat models, our method achieves state-of-the-art detection performance with negligible computational overhead. Furthermore, our system-level analysis provides a practical method for selecting a detection threshold with a formal lower-bound guarantee on accuracy.

| **[On Predictability of Reinforcement Learning Dynamics for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00553v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) are largely driven by reinforcement learning (RL), yet the underlying parameter dynamics during RL training remain poorly understood. This work identifies two fundamental properties of RL-induced parameter updates in LLMs: (1) Rank-1 Dominance, where the top singular subspace of the parameter update matrix nearly fully determines reasoning improvements, recovering over 99\% of performance gains; and (2) Rank-1 Linear Dynamics, where this dominant subspace evolves linearly throughout training, enabling accurate prediction from early checkpoints. Extensive experiments across 8 LLMs and 7 algorithms validate the generalizability of these properties. More importantly, based on these findings, we propose AlphaRL, a plug-in acceleration framework that extrapolates the final parameter update using a short early training window, achieving up to 2.5 speedup while retaining \textgreater 96\% of reasoning performance without extra modules or hyperparameter tuning. This positions our finding as a versatile and practical tool for large-scale RL, opening a path toward principled, interpretable, and efficient training paradigm for LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>43 pa...</summary><p>43 pages, 28 figures; 43</p></details> |
| **[TrimTokenator: Towards Adaptive Visual Token Pruning for Large Multimodal Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00320v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved significant success across various tasks. These models usually encode visual inputs into dense token sequences, which are then concatenated with textual tokens and jointly processed by a language model. However, the increased token count substantially raises computational and memory costs during inference. Token pruning has emerged as a promising approach to address this issue. Existing token pruning methods often rely on costly calibration or suboptimal importance metrics, leading to redundant retained tokens. In this paper, we analyze the redundancy differences between visual and textual tokens and propose pruning exclusively on visual tokens. Based on this, we propose a visual token pruning strategy that explicitly preserves both cross-modal alignment and intra-modal informational diversity. We introduce a mutual information-based token pruning strategy that removes visual tokens semantically misaligned with textual tokens, effectively preserving the alignment between the visual and textual modalities. To further improve the representational quality of the retained tokens, we additionally prune redundant visual tokens by maximizing the expected pairwise distances in the embedding space, which is solved efficiently with a greedy algorithm. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method maintains strong performance while reducing tokens by 88.9% on models such as LLaVA-1.5-7B and LLaVA-NEXT-7B, resulting in a 56.7% improvement in inference speed.</p></details> | 15 pages |
| **[Large Language Models Inference Engines based on Spiking Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00133v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundational models based on the transformer architecture are currently the state-of-the-art in general language modeling, as well as in scientific areas such as material science and climate. However, training and deploying these models is computationally challenging as the time and space complexity has a quadratic relation to the input sequence length. Several efforts exploring efficient computational paradigms and model architectures to address these limitations have been made. In this work, we explore spiking neural networks (SNNs) to design transformer models. A challenge in training large-scale SNNs, using existing surrogate learning methods is inefficient and time-consuming. On the other hand, techniques to convert existing transformer-based models to their SNN equivalent are not scalable, as achieving optimal performance comes at the cost of a large number of spike time-steps, i.e. increased latency. To address this, we propose NeurTransformer, a methodology for designing transformer-based SNN for inference using a supervised fine-tuning approach with existing conversion methods. The proposed methodology works by: (1) replacing the self-attention mechanism with a spike-based self-attention (SSA), (2) converting the feed-forward block of the trained transformer model to its equivalent SNN, and (3) fine-tuning the SSA block using SNN-based surrogate learning algorithms. We benchmark the proposed methodology and demonstrate its accuracy and scalability using three variants of the GPT-2 model of increasing model size. We observe that the converted GPT-2 small models demonstrate a 5-12% loss in cosine similarity and a 9.7% reduction in perplexity. Finally, we demonstrate the energy efficiency of the SSA block compared to the ASA block and show between 64.71% and 85.28% reductions in estimated energy consumption when implementing the self-attention mechanism on a digital hardware.</p></details> |  |
| **[Flexible Feature Distillation for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10155v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge distillation (KD) has become a cornerstone for compressing large language models (LLMs). However, existing LLM-KD methods have primarily focused on logit-based approaches, which achieve good performance but overlook the rich internal representations of LLMs. Feature-level KD could leverage this structure to provide complementary benefits, yet it remains underexplored because current feature-KD approaches typically assume identical teacher-student hidden sizes, a restrictive and unrealistic assumption. A common workaround is to train a linear projector to align their feature spaces; however, this introduces additional parameters, distorts teacher embeddings, and often degrades downstream performance, especially in generative tasks. We propose Flex-KD, a parameter-free framework for task-driven feature distillation for LLMs. Instead of projecting the entire teacher representation, Flex-KD uses gradient-based scores to identify the most task-relevant dimensions of the teacher's hidden states and distills only this subspace into the student. This ensures that the student's limited capacity is allocated to informative components, while avoiding projector-induced distortion and extra parameters. Flex-KD integrates seamlessly with existing KD pipelines and supports differing teacher-student hidden sizes. Extensive experiments across both classification and generative tasks, i.e., instruction-following and summarization, show that Flex-KD consistently boosts student performance, achieving up to a 3.75 percent performance gain over the linear projection baseline.</p></details> |  |

This study takes a process-oriented approach, drawing on narratology to examine LLMs as computational authors. We introduce constraint-based decision-making as a lens for authorial creativity. Using controlled prompting to assign authorial personas, we analyze the creative preferences of the models. Our findings show that LLMs consistently emphasize Style over other elements, including Character, Event, and Setting. By also probing the reasoning the models provide for their choices, we show that distinctive profiles emerge across models and argue that our approach provides a novel systematic tool for analyzing AI's authorial creativity.</p></details> |  |

Existing accident data collection is largely manual, fragmented, and unreliable, resulting in underreporting and inconsistent records. This research proposes a fully automated system using Large Language Models (LLMs) and web scraping techniques to address these challenges. The pipeline consists of four components: automated web scraping code generation, news collection from online sources, accident news classification with structured data extraction, and duplicate removal. The system uses the multimodal generative LLM Gemini-2.0-Flash for seamless automation. The code generation module classifies webpages into pagination, dynamic, or infinite scrolling categories and generates suitable Python scripts for scraping. LLMs also classify and extract key accident information such as date, time, location, fatalities, injuries, road type, vehicle types, and pedestrian involvement. A deduplication algorithm ensures data integrity by removing duplicate reports. The system scraped 14 major Bangladeshi news sites over 111 days (Oct 1, 2024 - Jan 20, 2025), processing over 15,000 news articles and identifying 705 unique accidents. The code generation module achieved 91.3% calibration and 80% validation accuracy. Chittagong reported the highest number of accidents (80), fatalities (70), and injuries (115), followed by Dhaka, Faridpur, Gazipur, and Cox's Bazar. Peak accident times were morning (8-9 AM), noon (12-1 PM), and evening (6-7 PM). A public repository was also developed with usage instructions. This study demonstrates the viability of an LLM-powered, scalable system for accurate, low-effort accident data collection, providing a foundation for data-driven road safety policymaking in Bangladesh.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted for presentation in TRB annual meeting 2026.

Spatial structure is fundamental to effective geospatial intelligence systems; however, existing foundation models often lack the flexibility to reason about places, context-rich regions spanning multiple spatial granularities that may consist of many spatially and semantically related points of interest. To address this gap, we propose PlaceFM, a geospatial foundation model that captures place representations through a training-free, clustering-based approach. PlaceFM summarizes the entire point of interest graph constructed from U.S. Foursquare data, producing general-purpose region embeddings while automatically identifying places of interest. These embeddings can be directly integrated into geolocation data pipelines to support a variety of urban downstream tasks. Without the need for costly pre-training, PlaceFM provides a scalable and efficient solution for multi-granular geospatial analysis. Extensive experiments on two real-world prediction tasks, ZIP code-level population density and housing prices, demonstrate that PlaceFM not only outperforms most state-of-the-art graph-based geospatial foundation models but also achieves up to a 100x speedup in generating region-level representations on large-scale POI graphs.

Based on the proposed taxonomy, OntoURL systematically assesses three dimensions: understanding, reasoning, and learning through 15 distinct tasks comprising 57,303 questions derived from 40 ontologies across 8 domains. Experiments with 20 open-source LLMs reveal significant performance differences across models, tasks, and domains, with current LLMs showing capabilities in understanding ontological knowledge but weaknesses in reasoning and learning tasks. Further experiments with few-shot and chain-of-thought prompting illustrate how different prompting strategies affect model performance. Additionally, a human evaluation reveals that LLMs outperform humans in understanding and reasoning tasks but fall short in most learning tasks. These findings highlight both the potential and limitations of LLMs in processing symbolic knowledge and establish OntoURL as a critical benchmark for advancing the integration of LLMs with formal knowledge representations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Schema Generation for Large Knowledge Graphs Using Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04512v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Schemas play a vital role in ensuring data quality and supporting usability in the Semantic Web and natural language processing. Traditionally, their creation demands substantial involvement from knowledge engineers and domain experts. Leveraging the impressive capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in tasks like ontology engineering, we explore schema generation using LLMs. To bridge the resource gap, we introduce two datasets: YAGO Schema and Wikidata EntitySchema, along with novel evaluation metrics. The LLM-based pipelines utilize local and global information from knowledge graphs (KGs) to generate schemas in Shape Expressions (ShEx). Experiments demonstrate LLMs' strong potential in producing high-quality ShEx schemas, paving the way for scalable, automated schema generation for large KGs. Furthermore, our benchmark introduces a new challenge for structured generation, pushing the limits of LLMs on syntactically rich formalisms.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 Findings |

Recent works mitigates this cost by projecting gradients into low-dimensional subspaces using sophisticated update strategies. In this paper, we analyze the dynamics of gradient space and its underlying subspaces. We find that while a small subspace captures most gradient energy, a significant portion still resides in the residual bulk; moreover, the influence of the core subspace diminishes over time and in deeper layers. We also observe that the gradient space exhibits near-flat curvature, calling for algorithms that explicitly account for this geometry. Motivated by these insights, we introduce a suite of randomized algorithms, GrassWalk and GrassJump, which exploit subspace and achieve state-of-the-art memory savings while improving performance on LLaMA-1B and LLaMA-7B pretraining.</p></details> |  |
| **[Microscaling Floating Point Formats for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01863v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing computational and memory demands of large language models (LLMs) necessitate innovative approaches to optimize resource usage without compromising performance. This paper leverages microscaling floating-point formats, a novel technique designed to address these challenges by reducing the storage and computational overhead associated with numerical representations in LLMs. Unlike traditional floating-point representations that allocate a dedicated scale for each value, microscaling employs a shared scale across a block of values, enabling compact one-byte floating-point representations while maintaining an extended dynamic range. We explore the application of microscaling in the context of 8-bit floating-point formats to significantly reduce memory footprint and computational costs. We tested several configurations of microscaling floats within the GPT-2 LLM architecture, demonstrating that microscaling data formats can achieve competitive accuracy during training and inference, proving its efficacy as a resource-efficient alternative for deploying LLMs at scale.

The development of advanced control strategies for complex scenarios is hindered, however, by the lack of scalability and robustness of the existing methods, in particular, due to the need of an individual control for each agent. One possible solution involves controlling a system through a leader or a group of leaders, which other agents tend to follow. Using such an approach we develop an effective control strategy for a leader, combining reinforcement learning (RL) with artificial forces acting on the system. To describe the guidance of active particles by a leader we introduce the generalized Vicsek model. This novel method is then applied to the problem of the effective evacuation by a robot-rescuer (leader) of large groups of people from hazardous places. We demonstrate, that while a straightforward application of RL yields suboptimal results, even for advanced architectures, our approach provides a robust and efficient evacuation strategy. The source code supporting this study is publicly available at: https://github.com/cinemere/evacuation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust MPC for Large-scale Linear Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01794v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-of-the-art approaches of Robust Model Predictive Control (MPC) are restricted to linear systems of relatively small scale, i.e., with no more than about 5 states. The main reason is the computational burden of determining a robust positively invariant (RPI) set, whose complexity suffers from the curse of dimensionality. The recently proposed approach of Deadbeat Robust Model Predictive Control (DRMPC) is the first that does not rely on an RPI set. Yet it comes with the full set of essential system theoretic guarantees. DRMPC is hence a viable option, in particular, for large-scale systems. This paper introduces a detailed design procedure for DRMPC. It is shown that the optimal control problem generated for DRMPC has exactly the same computational complexity as Nominal MPC. A numerical study validates its applicability to randomly generated large-scale linear systems of various dimensions.</p></details> |  |
| **[LOBE-GS: Load-Balanced and Efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting for Large-Scale Scene Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01767v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has established itself as an efficient representation for real-time, high-fidelity 3D scene reconstruction. However, scaling 3DGS to large and unbounded scenes such as city blocks remains difficult. Existing divide-and-conquer methods alleviate memory pressure by partitioning the scene into blocks, but introduce new bottlenecks: (i) partitions suffer from severe load imbalance since uniform or heuristic splits do not reflect actual computational demands, and (ii) coarse-to-fine pipelines fail to exploit the coarse stage efficiently, often reloading the entire model and incurring high overhead. In this work, we introduce LoBE-GS, a novel Load-Balanced and Efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting framework, that re-engineers the large-scale 3DGS pipeline. LoBE-GS introduces a depth-aware partitioning method that reduces preprocessing from hours to minutes, an optimization-based strategy that balances visible Gaussians -- a strong proxy for computational load -- across blocks, and two lightweight techniques, visibility cropping and selective densification, to further reduce training cost. Evaluations on large-scale urban and outdoor datasets show that LoBE-GS consistently achieves up to $2\times$ faster end-to-end training time than state-of-the-art baselines, while maintaining reconstruction quality and enabling scalability to scenes infeasible with vanilla 3DGS.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fact Grounded Attention: Eliminating Hallucination in Large Language Models Through Attention Level Knowledge Integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25252v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>"The greatest enemy of knowledge is not ignorance, it is the illusion of knowledge." Large Language Models have conquered natural language but remain prisoners of their own probabilistic nature--confidently hallucinating facts they never truly knew. We present Fact Grounded Attention (FGA), a novel architectural modification that transforms unreliable language models into deterministic truth tellers by injecting verifiable knowledge directly into the attention mechanism. Unlike existing approaches that patch hallucinations after generation or prepend retrieved text, FGA intervenes at the mathematical heart of the transformer--the pre-softmax attention scores--creating a model that cannot hallucinate when facts exist in its knowledge base. Our experiments across 1,107 technical queries spanning smartphones, laptops, and electric vehicles demonstrate a transformation from 6.3% accuracy in vanilla Llama 3.2 to 99.7% accuracy with FGA. More critically, knowledge updates occur in under one second without retraining, compared to hours for parameter editing approaches. FGA doesn't just reduce hallucination--it eliminates it entirely for verifiable facts, marking a fundamental shift from probabilistic approximation to deterministic precision in neural language generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables.

Recently, adopting LLMs in text-attributed graphs (TAGs) has drawn increasing attention. However, the adoption of LLMs faces two major challenges: limited information on graph structure and unreliable responses. LLMs struggle with text attributes isolated from the graph topology. Worse still, they yield unreliable predictions due to both information insufficiency and the inherent weakness of LLMs (e.g., hallucination). Towards this end, this paper proposes a novel method named Dynamic Text Bundling Supervision (DENSE) that queries LLMs with bundles of texts to obtain bundle-level labels and uses these labels to supervise graph neural networks. Specifically, we sample a set of bundles, each containing a set of nodes with corresponding texts of close proximity. We then query LLMs with the bundled texts to obtain the label of each bundle. Subsequently, the bundle labels are used to supervise the optimization of graph neural networks, and the bundles are further refined to exclude noisy items. To justify our design, we also provide theoretical analysis of the proposed method. Extensive experiments across ten datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

However, existing methods, such as the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) and recently proposed kernel-based tests for large-scale data, are computationally intensive and/or ineffective for some common alternatives in high-dimensional data. In this paper, we propose a new test that exhibits high power across a wide range of alternatives. Furthermore, the new test is more robust to high dimensions than existing methods and does not require optimization procedures for choosing kernel bandwidth and other parameters through data splitting. Numerical studies demonstrate that the new approach performs well on both synthetic and real-world data.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, researchers designed gaming agents using Reinforcement Learning, Imitation Learning, or Large Language Models. However, these agents often neglect the diverse strategies employed by human players due to their different personalities, resulting in repetitive solutions in similar situations. Without mimicking varied gaming strategies, these agents struggle to trigger diverse in-game interactions or uncover edge cases. In this paper, we present MIMIC, a novel framework that integrates diverse personality traits into gaming agents, enabling them to adopt different gaming strategies for similar situations. By mimicking different playstyles, MIMIC can achieve higher test coverage and richer in-game interactions across different games. It also outperforms state-of-the-art agents in Minecraft by achieving a higher task completion rate and providing more diverse solutions. These results highlight MIMIC's significant potential for effective game testing.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 7 figures, 6 tables.

| **[LLM4Rec: Large Language Models for Multimodal Generative Recommendation with Causal Debiasing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01622v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contemporary generative recommendation systems face significant challenges in handling multimodal data, eliminating algorithmic biases, and providing transparent decision-making processes. This paper introduces an enhanced generative recommendation framework that addresses these limitations through five key innovations: multimodal fusion architecture, retrieval-augmented generation mechanisms, causal inference-based debiasing, explainable recommendation generation, and real-time adaptive learning capabilities. Our framework leverages advanced large language models as the backbone while incorporating specialized modules for cross-modal understanding, contextual knowledge integration, bias mitigation, explanation synthesis, and continuous model adaptation. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets (MovieLens-25M, Amazon-Electronics, Yelp-2023) demonstrate consistent improvements in recommendation accuracy, fairness, and diversity compared to existing approaches. The proposed framework achieves up to 2.3% improvement in NDCG@10 and 1.4% enhancement in diversity metrics while maintaining computational efficiency through optimized inference strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[PychoBench: Evaluating the Psychology Intelligence of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01611v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across a wide range of industries, primarily due to their impressive generative abilities. Yet, their potential in applications requiring cognitive abilities, such as psychological counseling, remains largely untapped. This paper investigates the key question: Can LLMs be effectively applied to psychological counseling? To determine whether an LLM can effectively take on the role of a psychological counselor, the first step is to assess whether it meets the qualifications required for such a role, namely the ability to pass the U.S. National Counselor Certification Exam (NCE). This is because, just as a human counselor must pass a certification exam to practice, an LLM must demonstrate sufficient psychological knowledge to meet the standards required for such a role. To address this, we introduce PsychoBench, a benchmark grounded in U.S.national counselor examinations, a licensure test for professional counselors that requires about 70% accuracy to pass. PsychoBench comprises approximately 2,252 carefully curated single-choice questions, crafted to require deep understanding and broad enough to cover various sub-disciplines of psychology. This benchmark provides a comprehensive assessment of an LLM's ability to function as a counselor. Our evaluation shows that advanced models such as GPT-4o, Llama3.3-70B, and Gemma3-27B achieve well above the passing threshold, while smaller open-source models (e.g., Qwen2.5-7B, Mistral-7B) remain far below it. These results suggest that only frontier LLMs are currently capable of meeting counseling exam standards, highlighting both the promise and the challenges of developing psychology-oriented LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging Collaborative Filtering and Large Language Models with Dynamic Alignment, Multimodal Fusion and Evidence-grounded Explanations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01606v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research has explored using Large Language Models for recommendation tasks by transforming user interaction histories and item metadata into text prompts, then having the LLM produce rankings or recommendations. A promising approach involves connecting collaborative filtering knowledge to LLM representations through compact adapter networks, which avoids expensive fine-tuning while preserving the strengths of both components. Yet several challenges persist in practice: collaborative filtering models often use static snapshots that miss rapidly changing user preferences; many real-world items contain rich visual and audio content beyond textual descriptions; and current systems struggle to provide trustworthy explanations backed by concrete evidence. Our work introduces \model{}, a framework that tackles these limitations through three key innovations. We develop an online adaptation mechanism that continuously incorporates new user interactions through lightweight modules, avoiding the need to retrain large models. We create a unified representation that seamlessly combines collaborative signals with visual and audio features, handling cases where some modalities may be unavailable. Finally, we design an explanation system that grounds recommendations in specific collaborative patterns and item attributes, producing natural language rationales users can verify. Our approach maintains the efficiency of frozen base models while adding minimal computational overhead, making it practical for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Reasoning Meets Compression: Understanding the Effects of LLMs Compression on Large Reasoning Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02010v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Compression methods, including quantization, distillation, and pruning, improve the computational efficiency of large reasoning models (LRMs). However, existing studies either fail to sufficiently compare all three compression methods on LRMs or lack in-depth interpretation analysis. In this paper, we investigate how the reasoning capabilities of LRMs are compromised during compression, through performance benchmarking and mechanistic interpretation. To uncover the effects of compression on reasoning performance, we benchmark quantized, distilled, and pruned DeepSeek-R1 models on four reasoning datasets (AIME 2024, FOLIO, Temporal Sequences, and MuSiQue). To precisely locate compression effects on model weights, we adapt difference of means and attribution patching techniques, focusing on the activation of every linear component in compressed LRMs, to interpret fine-grained causal relationships between weights and various reasoning capabilities. This fine-grained interpretation addresses a fundamental question of compression: which weights are the most important for reasoning? Overall, we find dynamically quantized 2.51-bit R1 reaches close-to-R1 performance. With empirical verification, we present three main findings that generalize across both Llama and Qwen: (1) Weight count has a greater impact on LRMs' knowledge memorization than reasoning, highlighting the risks of pruning and distillation; (2) The MLP up projection in the final layer of distilled LRMs is one of the most important components, offering a new perspective on locating critical weights - a fundamental problem in model compression; and (3) Current quantization methods overly compress the final-layer modules and MLP gate projections, so protecting just 2% of all weights that are excessively compressed can raise average accuracy by 6.57%, greatly surpassing the state-of-the-art.</p></details> |  |

However, these applications often default to comprehensive, lengthy descriptions regardless of context. This leads to inefficient exchanges, as users must go through irrelevant details rather than receiving the specific information they are likely to seek. To deliver more contextually-relevant information, we developed a system that draws on historical BLV users questions. When given an image, our system identifies similar past visual contexts from the VizWiz-LF dataset and uses the associated questions to guide the MLLM generate descriptions more relevant to BLV users. An evaluation with three human labelers who revised 92 context-aware and context-free descriptions showed that context-aware descriptions anticipated and answered users' questions in 76.1% of cases (70 out of 92) and were preferred in 54.4% of comparisons (50 out of 92).

| **[Rethinking and Benchmarking Large Language Models for Graph Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24260v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) for Graph Reasoning have been extensively studied over the past two years, involving enabling LLMs to understand graph structures and reason on graphs to solve various graph problems, with graph algorithm problems being the most prevalent. Recent studies underscore the potential of LLMs in handling graph reasoning tasks, but their performance is underwhelming. In this work, we point out issues with existing methods and benchmarks, and rethink the direction that LLMs for graph reasoning should strive toward. We find that base models, e.g., GPT-4o-mini, are largely underestimated due to improper reasoning focus. Base models with reasoning focus redirected from replicating graph algorithms to designing them can easily solve most graph reasoning tasks in existing benchmarks. To truly evaluate the graph reasoning capabilities of LLMs, we construct a more challenging GraphAlgorithm benchmark, comprising 239 different graph problems and 3,041 test instances collected from 4 competition platforms. Finally, we introduce a simple and strong baseline Simple-Reasoning-Then-Coding (Simple-RTC)-which guides LLMs to design graph algorithms first and then code to address graph reasoning tasks. Simple-RTC achieves near-perfect accuracy on existing benchmarks and significantly outperforms GPT-4o-mini and all prior methods on the GraphAlgorithm benchmark. This strong baseline encourages further advancements in LLMs for Graph Reasoning in the future.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large-Scale Bayesian Causal Discovery with Interventional Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01562v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inferring the causal relationships among a set of variables in the form of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) is an important but notoriously challenging problem. Recently, advancements in high-throughput genomic perturbation screens have inspired development of methods that leverage interventional data to improve model identification. However, existing methods still suffer poor performance on large-scale tasks and fail to quantify uncertainty. Here, we propose Interventional Bayesian Causal Discovery (IBCD), an empirical Bayesian framework for causal discovery with interventional data. Our approach models the likelihood of the matrix of total causal effects, which can be approximated by a matrix normal distribution, rather than the full data matrix. We place a spike-and-slab horseshoe prior on the edges and separately learn data-driven weights for scale-free and Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi structures from observational data, treating each edge as a latent variable to enable uncertainty-aware inference. Through extensive simulation, we show that IBCD achieves superior structure recovery compared to existing baselines. We apply IBCD to CRISPR perturbation (Perturb-seq) data on 521 genes, demonstrating that edge posterior inclusion probabilities enable identification of robust graph structures.</p></details> |  |

This matching requires researchers to know the exact wording that other researchers previously used, creating a challenging process that could lead to missing relevant data. Large Language Models (LLMs) could enhance data discovery by removing this requirement and allowing researchers to ask questions with natural language. However, we do not currently know if researchers would accept LLMs for data discovery. Using a human-centered artificial intelligence (HCAI) focus, we ran focus groups (N = 27) to understand researchers' perspectives towards LLMs for data discovery. Our conceptual model shows that the potential benefits are not enough for researchers to use LLMs instead of current technology. Barriers prevent researchers from fully accepting LLMs, but features around transparency could overcome them. Using our model will allow developers to incorporate features that result in an increased acceptance of LLMs for data discovery.</p></details> |  |

Yet their utility is often limited by lack of structure, semantic inconsistency, and fragmentation across devices and sessions. Extracting actionable CTI from logs therefore requires approaches that can reconcile noisy, heterogeneous data into coherent and interoperable representations. We introduce OntoLogX, an autonomous Artificial Intelligence (AI) agent that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform raw logs into ontology-grounded Knowledge Graphs (KGs). OntoLogX integrates a lightweight log ontology with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and iterative correction steps, ensuring that generated KGs are syntactically and semantically valid. Beyond event-level analysis, the system aggregates KGs into sessions and employs a LLM to predict MITRE ATT&CK tactics, linking low-level log evidence to higher-level adversarial objectives. We evaluate OntoLogX on both logs from a public benchmark and a real-world honeypot dataset, demonstrating robust KG generation across multiple KGs backends and accurate mapping of adversarial activity to ATT&CK tactics. Results highlight the benefits of retrieval and correction for precision and recall, the effectiveness of code-oriented models in structured log analysis, and the value of ontology-grounded representations for actionable CTI extraction.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 6 tables, 7 figures</p></details> |

There is also heightened interest in developing data-driven approaches, particularly neural network models, for effective prediction and analysis of scientific datasets. Traditional data-driven methods frequently involve extensive manual intervention, limiting their ability to scale effectively and generalize to diverse applications. In this study, we propose an innovative pipeline utilizing Large Language Model (LLM) agents to automate data-driven modeling and analysis, with a particular emphasis on regression tasks. We evaluate two LLM-agent frameworks: a multi-agent system featuring specialized collaborative agents, and a single-agent system based on the Reasoning and Acting (ReAct) paradigm. Both frameworks autonomously handle data preprocessing, neural network development, training, hyperparameter optimization, and uncertainty quantification (UQ). We validate our approach using a critical heat flux (CHF) prediction benchmark, involving approximately 25,000 experimental data points from the OECD/NEA benchmark dataset. Results indicate that our LLM-agent-developed model surpasses traditional CHF lookup tables and delivers predictive accuracy and UQ on par with state-of-the-art Bayesian optimized deep neural network models developed by human experts. These outcomes underscore the significant potential of LLM-based agents to automate complex engineering modeling tasks, greatly reducing human workload while meeting or exceeding existing standards of predictive performance.</p></details> |  |

Legato is the first large-scale pretrained OMR model capable of recognizing full-page or multi-page typeset music scores and the first to generate documents in ABC notation, a concise, human-readable format for symbolic music. Bringing together a pretrained vision encoder with an ABC decoder trained on a dataset of more than 214K images, our model exhibits the strong ability to generalize across various typeset scores. We conduct comprehensive experiments on a range of datasets and metrics and demonstrate that Legato outperforms the previous state of the art. On our most realistic dataset, we see a 68\% and 47.6\% absolute error reduction on the standard metrics TEDn and OMR-NED, respectively.</p></details> |  |

However, research in this area is often limited by the lack of large, representative, and highquality application datasets that can support empirical studies and the development of new approaches benefiting XR software processes. In this paper, we introduce XRZoo, a comprehensive and curated dataset of XR applications designed to bridge this gap. XRZoo contains 12,528 free XR applications, spanning nine app stores, across all XR techniques (i.e., AR, MR, and VR) and use cases, with detailed metadata on key aspects such as application descriptions, application categories, release dates, user review numbers, and hardware specifications, etc. By making XRZoo publicly available, we aim to foster reproducible XR software engineering and security research, enable cross-disciplinary investigations, and also support the development of advanced XR systems by providing examples to developers. Our dataset serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners interested in improving the scalability, usability, and effectiveness of XR applications. XRZoo will be released and actively maintained.</p></details> |  |

But our stress tests tell a different story. Leading systems often guess correctly even when key inputs like images are removed, flip answers under trivial prompt changes, and fabricate convincing yet flawed reasoning. These aren't glitches; they expose how today's benchmarks reward test-taking tricks over medical understanding. We evaluate six flagship models across six widely used benchmarks and find that high leaderboard scores hide brittleness and shortcut learning. Through clinician-guided rubric evaluation, we show that benchmarks vary widely in what they truly measure yet are treated interchangeably, masking failure modes. We caution that medical benchmark scores do not directly reflect real-world readiness. If we want AI to earn trust in healthcare, we must demand more than leaderboard wins and must hold systems accountable for robustness, sound reasoning, and alignment with real medical demands.</p></details> | 35 pages |
| **[CounselBench: A Large-Scale Expert Evaluation and Adversarial Benchmarking of Large Language Models in Mental Health Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08584v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical question answering (QA) benchmarks often focus on multiple-choice or fact-based tasks, leaving open-ended answers to real patient questions underexplored. This gap is particularly critical in mental health, where patient questions often mix symptoms, treatment concerns, and emotional needs, requiring answers that balance clinical caution with contextual sensitivity. We present CounselBench, a large-scale benchmark developed with 100 mental health professionals to evaluate and stress-test large language models (LLMs) in realistic help-seeking scenarios. The first component, CounselBench-EVAL, contains 2,000 expert evaluations of answers from GPT-4, LLaMA 3, Gemini, and human therapists on patient questions from the public forum CounselChat. Each answer is rated across six clinically grounded dimensions, with span-level annotations and written rationales. Expert evaluations show that while LLMs achieve high scores on several dimensions, they also exhibit recurring issues, including unconstructive feedback, overgeneralization, and limited personalization or relevance. Responses were frequently flagged for safety risks, most notably unauthorized medical advice. Follow-up experiments show that LLM judges systematically overrate model responses and overlook safety concerns identified by human experts. To probe failure modes more directly, we construct CounselBench-Adv, an adversarial dataset of 120 expert-authored mental health questions designed to trigger specific model issues. Evaluation of 3,240 responses from nine LLMs reveals consistent, model-specific failure patterns. Together, CounselBench establishes a clinically grounded framework for benchmarking LLMs in mental health QA.</p></details> |  |

Our method calculates a phylogenetic distance metric based on the similarity of LLMs' output. The resulting metric is then used to construct dendrograms, which satisfactorily capture known relationships across a set of 111 open-source and 45 closed models. Furthermore, our phylogenetic distance predicts performance in standard benchmarks, thus demonstrating its functional validity and paving the way for a time and cost-effective estimation of LLM capabilities. To sum up, by translating population genetic concepts to machine learning, we propose and validate a tool to evaluate LLM development, relationships and capabilities, even in the absence of transparent training information.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce the notion of a reasoning graph, extracted by clustering hidden-state representations at each reasoning step, and systematically analyze three key graph-theoretic properties: cyclicity, diameter, and small-world index, across multiple tasks (GSM8K, MATH500, AIME 2024). Our findings reveal that distilled reasoning models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B) exhibit significantly more recurrent cycles (about 5 per sample), substantially larger graph diameters, and pronounced small-world characteristics (about 6x) compared to their base counterparts. Notably, these structural advantages grow with task difficulty and model capacity, with cycle detection peaking at the 14B scale and exploration diameter maximized in the 32B variant, correlating positively with accuracy. Furthermore, we show that supervised fine-tuning on an improved dataset systematically expands reasoning graph diameters in tandem with performance gains, offering concrete guidelines for dataset design aimed at boosting reasoning capabilities. By bridging theoretical insights into reasoning graph structures with practical recommendations for data construction, our work advances both the interpretability and the efficacy of large reasoning models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Neurips 2025</p></details> |
| **[Towards Holistic Evaluation of Large Audio-Language Models: A Comprehensive Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15957v3)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With advancements in large audio-language models (LALMs), which enhance large language models (LLMs) with auditory capabilities, these models are expected to demonstrate universal proficiency across various auditory tasks. While numerous benchmarks have emerged to assess LALMs' performance, they remain fragmented and lack a structured taxonomy. To bridge this gap, we conduct a comprehensive survey and propose a systematic taxonomy for LALM evaluations, categorizing them into four dimensions based on their objectives: (1) General Auditory Awareness and Processing, (2) Knowledge and Reasoning, (3) Dialogue-oriented Ability, and (4) Fairness, Safety, and Trustworthiness. We provide detailed overviews within each category and highlight challenges in this field, offering insights into promising future directions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey specifically focused on the evaluations of LALMs, providing clear guidelines for the community. We will release the collection of the surveyed papers and actively maintain it to support ongoing advancements in the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 (Main).

This gap stems primarily from a critical data bottleneck: existing datasets lack the challenging, multi-hop questions and high-quality, video-grounded Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data necessary to effectively bootstrap RLVR. To address this, we introduce ReWatch, a large-scale dataset built to foster advanced video reasoning. We propose a novel multi-stage synthesis pipeline to synthesize its three components: ReWatch-Caption, ReWatch-QA, and ReWatch-CoT. A core innovation is our Multi-Agent ReAct framework for CoT synthesis, which simulates a human-like "re-watching" process to generate video-grounded reasoning traces by explicitly modeling information retrieval and verification. Building on this dataset, we develop ReWatch-R1 by post-training a strong baseline LVLM with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and our RLVR framework. This framework incorporates a novel Observation \& Reasoning (O\&R) reward mechanism that evaluates both the final answer's correctness and the reasoning's alignment with video content, directly penalizing hallucination. Our experiments show that ReWatch-R1 achieves state-of-the-art average performance on five challenging video reasoning benchmarks. Project Page: https://rewatch-r1.github.io</p></details> |  |
| **[An Efficient, Reliable and Observable Collective Communication Library in Large-scale GPU Training Clusters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00991v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale LLM training requires collective communication libraries to exchange data among distributed GPUs. As a company dedicated to building and operating large-scale GPU training clusters, we encounter several challenges when using NCCL in production, including 1) limited efficiency with costly and cumbersome P2P communication, 2) poor tolerance to frequent RNIC port failures, and 3) insufficient observability of transient collective communication anomalies. To address these issues, we propose ICCL, an efficient, reliable, and observable collective communication library in large-scale GPU training clusters. ICCL offloads the P2P communication from GPU kernels to CPU threads for minimal SM consumption, and removes the redundant memory copies irrelevant to the actual communicating process. ICCL also introduces a primary-backup QP mechanism to tolerate frequent NIC port failures, and designs a window-based monitor to observe network anomalies at O(us) level. We open-source ICCL and deploy it in production training clusters for several months, with results showing that compared to NCCL, ICCL achieves a 23.4%/28.5% improvement in P2P throughput/latency as well as a 6.02% increase in training throughput. We also share the operating experience of ICCL in large-scale clusters, hoping to give the communities more insights on production-level collective communication libraries in LLM training.</p></details> | 15 pages, 16 figures |
| **[Steering When Necessary: Flexible Steering Large Language Models with Backtracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17621v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across many generation tasks. Nevertheless, effectively aligning them with desired behaviors remains a significant challenge. Activation steering is an effective and cost-efficient approach that directly modifies the activations of LLMs during the inference stage, aligning their responses with the desired behaviors and avoiding the high cost of fine-tuning. Existing methods typically indiscriminately intervene to all generations or rely solely on the question to determine intervention, which limits the accurate assessment of the intervention strength. To this end, we propose the Flexible Activation Steering with Backtracking (FASB) framework, which dynamically determines both the necessity and strength of intervention by tracking the internal states of the LLMs during generation, considering both the question and the generated content. Since intervening after detecting a deviation from the desired behavior is often too late, we further propose the backtracking mechanism to correct the deviated tokens and steer the LLMs toward the desired behavior. Extensive experiments on the TruthfulQA dataset and six multiple-choice datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms baselines. Our code will be released at https://github.com/gjw185/FASB.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |
| **[Large Reasoning Models Learn Better Alignment from Flawed Thinking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00938v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large reasoning models (LRMs) "think" by generating structured chain-of-thought (CoT) before producing a final answer, yet they still lack the ability to reason critically about safety alignment and are easily biased when a flawed premise is injected into their thought process. We propose RECAP (Robust Safety Alignment via Counter-Aligned Prefilling), a principled reinforcement learning (RL) method for post-training that explicitly teaches models to override flawed reasoning trajectories and reroute to safe and helpful responses. RECAP trains on a mixture of synthetically generated counter-aligned CoT prefills and standard prompts, requires no additional training cost or modifications beyond vanilla reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), and substantially improves safety and jailbreak robustness, reduces overrefusal, and preserves core reasoning capability -- all while maintaining inference token budget. Extensive analysis shows that RECAP-trained models engage in self-reflection more frequently and remain robust under adaptive attacks, preserving safety even after repeated attempts to override their reasoning.</p></details> |  |

Large-scale analysis, however, has been constrained by the need for manual annotation due to the context-sensitive nature of metaphor. This study investigates the potential of large language models (LLMs) to automate metaphor identification in full texts. We compare three methods: (i) retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), where the model is provided with a codebook and instructed to annotate texts based on its rules and examples; (ii) prompt engineering, where we design task-specific verbal instructions; and (iii) fine-tuning, where the model is trained on hand-coded texts to optimize performance. Within prompt engineering, we test zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought strategies. Our results show that state-of-the-art closed-source LLMs can achieve high accuracy, with fine-tuning yielding a median F1 score of 0.79. A comparison of human and LLM outputs reveals that most discrepancies are systematic, reflecting well-known grey areas and conceptual challenges in metaphor theory. We propose that LLMs can be used to at least partly automate metaphor identification and can serve as a testbed for developing and refining metaphor identification protocols and the theory that underpins them.</p></details> |  |
| **[Addressing Moral Uncertainty using Large Language Models for Ethical Decision-Making](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05724v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present an ethical decision-making framework that refines a pre-trained reinforcement learning (RL) model using a task-agnostic ethical layer. Following initial training, the RL model undergoes ethical fine-tuning, where human feedback is replaced by feedback generated from a large language model (LLM). The LLM embodies consequentialist, deontological, virtue, social justice, and care ethics as moral principles to assign belief values to recommended actions during ethical decision-making. An ethical layer aggregates belief scores from multiple LLM-derived moral perspectives using Belief Jensen-Shannon Divergence and Dempster-Shafer Theory into probability scores that also serve as the shaping reward, steering the agent toward choices that align with a balanced ethical framework. This integrated learning framework helps the RL agent navigate moral uncertainty in complex environments and enables it to make morally sound decisions across diverse tasks. Our approach, tested across different LLM variants and compared with other belief aggregation techniques, demonstrates improved consistency, adaptability, and reduced reliance on handcrafted ethical rewards. This method is especially effective in dynamic scenarios where ethical challenges arise unexpectedly, making it well-suited for real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 5 figures.

| **[Introducing Large Language Models into the Design Flow of Time Sensitive Networking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26368v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing demand for real-time, safety-critical systems has significantly increased both the adoption and complexity of Time Sensitive Networking (TSN). Configuring an optimized TSN network is highly challenging, requiring careful planning, design, verification, validation, and deployment. Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong capabilities in solving complex tasks, positioning them as promising candidates for automating end-to-end TSN deployment, referred to as TSN orchestration. This paper outlines the steps involved in TSN orchestration and the associated challenges. To assess the capabilities of existing LLM models, we conduct an initial proof-of-concept case study focused on TSN configuration across multiple models. Building on these insights, we propose an LLM-assisted orchestration framework. Unlike prior research on LLMs in computer networks, which has concentrated on general configuration and management, TSN-specific orchestration has not yet been investigated. We present the building blocks for automating TSN using LLMs, describe the proposed pipeline, and analyze opportunities and limitations for real-world deployment. Finally, we highlight key challenges and research directions, including the development of TSN-focused datasets, standardized benchmark suites, and the integration of external tools such as Network Calculus (NC) engines and simulators. This work provides the first roadmap toward assessing the feasibility of LLM-assisted TSN orchestration.</p></details> |  |

However, existing simulators suffer from limited scalability, hardwired algorithms, lack of real-time monitoring, and inability to generate datasets suitable for modern machine learning approaches. We present CGSim, a simulation framework for large-scale distributed computing environments that addresses these limitations. Built upon the validated SimGrid simulation framework, CGSim provides high-level abstractions for modeling heterogeneous grid environments while maintaining accuracy and scalability. Key features include a modular plugin mechanism for testing custom workflow scheduling and data movement policies, interactive real-time visualization dashboards, and automatic generation of event-level datasets suitable for AI-assisted performance modeling. We demonstrate CGSim's capabilities through a comprehensive evaluation using production ATLAS PanDA workloads, showing significant calibration accuracy improvements across WLCG computing sites. Scalability experiments show near-linear scaling for multi-site simulations, with distributed workloads achieving 6x better performance compared to single-site execution. The framework enables researchers to simulate WLCG-scale infrastructures with hundreds of sites and thousands of concurrent jobs within practical time budget constraints on commodity hardware.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been accepted at PMBS workshop SC25</p></details> |

Machine Unlearning (MU), as an effective strategy for forgetting specific knowledge in training data, has been widely used in privacy protection. However, MU for safety in MLLM has yet to be fully explored. To address this issue, we propose SAFEERASER, a safety unlearning benchmark for MLLMs, consisting of 3,000 images and 28.8K VQA pairs. We comprehensively evaluate unlearning methods from two perspectives: forget quality and model utility. Our findings show that existing MU methods struggle to maintain model performance while implementing the forget operation and often suffer from over-forgetting. Hence, we introduce Prompt Decouple (PD) Loss to alleviate over-forgetting through decouple prompt during unlearning process. To quantitatively measure over-forgetting mitigated by PD Loss, we propose a new metric called Safe Answer Refusal Rate (SARR). Experimental results demonstrate that combining PD Loss with existing unlearning methods can effectively prevent over-forgetting and achieve a decrease of 79.5% in the SARR metric of LLaVA-7B and LLaVA-13B, while maintaining forget quality and model utility. Our code and dataset will be released upon acceptance. Warning: This paper contains examples of harmful language and images, and reader discretion is recommended.</p></details> |  |

However, as the time horizons at which these models can operate grow exponentially, it becomes increasingly difficult to know how much progress the model is making on a task, making it challenging for users to set appropriate expectations about completion time. By probing the internal representations of Large Language Models (LLMs), we find evidence that their reasoning progress can be quantified, with simple linear probes achieving 30\% accuracy over 10 progress classes and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 1.75. Rooted in this insight, we propose a two-stage fine-tuning method that trains existing reasoning models to explicitly generate progress estimates (0-100\%) during their reasoning process. We find that the predictions of our best fine-tuned language model for sequences below 16K tokens are on average 10\% from the true label.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond one-hot encoding? Journey into compact encoding for large multi-class segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00667v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work presents novel methods to reduce computational and memory requirements for medical image segmentation with a large number of classes. We curiously observe challenges in maintaining state-of-the-art segmentation performance with all of the explored options. Standard learning-based methods typically employ one-hot encoding of class labels. The computational complexity and memory requirements thus increase linearly with the number of classes. We propose a family of binary encoding approaches instead of one-hot encoding to reduce the computational complexity and memory requirements to logarithmic in the number of classes. In addition to vanilla binary encoding, we investigate the effects of error-correcting output codes (ECOCs), class weighting, hard/soft decoding, class-to-codeword assignment, and label embedding trees. We apply the methods to the use case of whole brain parcellation with 108 classes based on 3D MRI images. While binary encodings have proven efficient in so-called extreme classification problems in computer vision, we faced challenges in reaching state-of-the-art segmentation quality with binary encodings. Compared to one-hot encoding (Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) = 82.4 (2.8)), we report reduced segmentation performance with the binary segmentation approaches, achieving DSCs in the range from 39.3 to 73.8. Informative negative results all too often go unpublished. We hope that this work inspires future research of compact encoding strategies for large multi-class segmentation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at EMA4MICCAI 2025 Workshop</p></details> |

Unlike final outputs, reasoning traces are often assumed to be internal and safe. We challenge this assumption by showing that reasoning traces frequently contain sensitive user data, which can be extracted via prompt injections or accidentally leak into outputs. Through probing and agentic evaluations, we demonstrate that test-time compute approaches, particularly increased reasoning steps, amplify such leakage. While increasing the budget of those test-time compute approaches makes models more cautious in their final answers, it also leads them to reason more verbosely and leak more in their own thinking. This reveals a core tension: reasoning improves utility but enlarges the privacy attack surface. We argue that safety efforts must extend to the model's internal thinking, not just its outputs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 (Main)</p></details> |

In contrast, editorial fashion presents garments through dynamic poses, diverse locations, and carefully crafted visual narratives. We introduce the task of virtual fashion photo-shoot, which seeks to capture this richness by transforming standardized garment images into contextually grounded editorial imagery. To enable this new direction, we construct the first large-scale dataset of garment-lookbook pairs, bridging the gap between e-commerce and fashion media. Because such pairs are not readily available, we design an automated retrieval pipeline that aligns garments across domains, combining visual-language reasoning with object-level localization. We construct a dataset with three garment-lookbook pair accuracy levels: high quality (10,000 pairs), medium quality (50,000 pairs), and low quality (300,000 pairs). This dataset offers a foundation for models that move beyond catalog-style generation and toward fashion imagery that reflects creativity, atmosphere, and storytelling.</p></details> |  |

An open question is whether their predictions are influenced by the order of answer choices, which would indicate a form of selection bias and undermine their reliability. In this paper, we identify and analyze this problem in LALMs. We demonstrate that no model is immune to this bias through extensive experiments on six LALMs across three widely used benchmarks and their spoken counterparts. Shuffling the order of answer options can cause performance fluctuations of up to 24% and even change model rankings, raising concerns about the reliability of current evaluation practices. We also study permutation-based strategies and show that they can mitigate bias in most cases. Our work represents the first systematic investigation of this issue in LALMs, and we hope it raises awareness and motivates further research in this direction.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contributed equally.

We investigate how irrelevant audio, such as silence, synthetic noise, and environmental sounds, affects text reasoning tasks where audio is unnecessary. Across three text-based benchmarks, we find that even non-informative audio reduces accuracy and increases prediction volatility; the severity of interference scales with longer durations, higher amplitudes, and elevated decoding temperatures. Silence, often assumed neutral, destabilizes outputs as strongly as synthetic noise. While larger models show greater resilience, vulnerabilities persist across all evaluated systems. We further test mitigation strategies and find that prompting shows limited effectiveness, whereas self-consistency improves stability at the cost of increased computation. Our results reveal cross-modal interference as a key robustness challenge and highlight the need for efficient fusion strategies that preserve reasoning performance in the presence of irrelevant inputs.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages; submitted to ICASSP 2026</p></details> |

A key obstacle is self-repair, a phenomenon where networks compensate for reduced signal in one component by amplifying others, masking the true importance of the ablated component. While prior work attributes self-repair to layer normalization and back-up components that compensate for ablated components, we identify a novel form occurring within the attention mechanism, where softmax redistribution conceals the influence of important attention scores. This leads traditional ablation and gradient-based methods to underestimate the significance of all components contributing to these attention scores. We introduce Gradient Interaction Modifications (GIM), a technique that accounts for self-repair during backpropagation. Extensive experiments across multiple large language models (Gemma 2B/9B, LLAMA 1B/3B/8B, Qwen 1.5B/3B) and diverse tasks demonstrate that GIM significantly improves faithfulness over existing circuit identification and feature attribution methods. Our work is a significant step toward better understanding the inner mechanisms of LLMs, which is crucial for improving them and ensuring their safety.

In a graphon particle system, the interactions among particles are characterized by the coupled mean field terms through an underlying graphon and the randomness of the coefficients comes from exogenous stochastic processes. By constructing two-level approximated sequences converging in 2-Wasserstein distance, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the system. Besides, by constructing two-level approximated functions converging to the graphon mean field terms, we establish the law of large numbers, which reveals that if the number of particles tends to infinity and the discretization step tends to zero, then the discrete-time interacting particle system over a large-scale network converges to the graphon particle system. As a byproduct, we discover that the graphon particle system can describe the limiting dynamics of the distributed stochastic gradient descent algorithm over the large-scale network and prove that if the gradients of the local cost functions are Lipschitz continuous, then the graphon particle system can be regarded as the spatio-temporal approximation of the discrete-time distributed stochastic gradient descent algorithm as the number of network nodes tends to infinity and the algorithm step size tends to zero.</p></details> |  |

A Dataset for Chinese Internet Meme Explanation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00567v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are trained on vast amounts of text from the Internet, but do they truly understand the viral content that rapidly spreads online -- commonly known as memes? In this paper, we introduce CHIME, a dataset for CHinese Internet Meme Explanation. The dataset comprises popular phrase-based memes from the Chinese Internet, annotated with detailed information on their meaning, origin, example sentences, types, etc. To evaluate whether LLMs understand these memes, we designed two tasks. In the first task, we assessed the models' ability to explain a given meme, identify its origin, and generate appropriate example sentences. The results show that while LLMs can explain the meanings of some memes, their performance declines significantly for culturally and linguistically nuanced meme types. Additionally, they consistently struggle to provide accurate origins for the memes. In the second task, we created a set of multiple-choice questions (MCQs) requiring LLMs to select the most appropriate meme to fill in a blank within a contextual sentence. While the evaluated models were able to provide correct answers, their performance remains noticeably below human levels. We have made CHIME public and hope it will facilitate future research on computational meme understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 Main Conference. 22 pages, 3 figures, 13 tables.

Recent works have attempted to improve efficiency by compressing visual tokens during training, either through modifications to model components or by introducing additional parameters. However, they often overlook the increased learning difficulty caused by such compression, as the model's parameter space struggles to quickly adapt to the substantial perturbations in the feature space induced by token compression. In this work, we propose to develop Efficient MLLMs via Progressive Consistency Distillation (EPIC), a progressive learning framework. Specifically, by decomposing the feature space perturbations introduced by token compression along the token-wise and layer-wise dimensions, we introduce token consistency distillation and layer consistency distillation, respectively, aiming to reduce the training difficulty by leveraging guidance from a teacher model and following a progressive learning trajectory. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior effectiveness, robustness, and generalization capabilities of our proposed framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

We observe an inverse correlation between response copying degree and context-unfaithful hallucinations on RAGTruth, suggesting that higher copying degrees reduce hallucinations by fostering genuine contextual belief. We propose CopyPasteLLM, obtained through two-stage high-copying response preference training. We design three prompting methods to enhance copying degree, demonstrating that high-copying responses achieve superior contextual faithfulness and hallucination control. These approaches enable a fully automated pipeline that transforms generated responses into high-copying preference data for training CopyPasteLLM. On FaithEval, ConFiQA and PubMedQA, CopyPasteLLM achieves best performance in both counterfactual and original contexts, remarkably with 12.2% to 24.5% accuracy improvements on FaithEval over the best baseline, while requiring only 365 training samples -- 1/50th of baseline data. To elucidate CopyPasteLLM's effectiveness, we propose the Context-Parameter Copying Capturing algorithm. Interestingly, this reveals that CopyPasteLLM recalibrates reliance on internal parametric knowledge rather than external knowledge during generation.

Artificial Bad Intelligence Triggered by Merely a Single-Bit Flip in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00490v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Bit-Flip Attack (BFA) has garnered widespread attention for its ability to compromise software system integrity remotely through hardware fault injection. With the widespread distillation and deployment of large language models (LLMs) into single file .gguf formats, their weight spaces have become exposed to an unprecedented hardware attack surface. This paper is the first to systematically discover and validate the existence of single-bit vulnerabilities in LLM weight files: in mainstream open-source models (e.g., DeepSeek and QWEN) using .gguf quantized formats, flipping just single bit can induce three types of targeted semantic level failures Artificial Flawed Intelligence (outputting factual errors), Artificial Weak Intelligence (degradation of logical reasoning capability), and Artificial Bad Intelligence (generating harmful content). By building an information theoretic weight sensitivity entropy model and a probabilistic heuristic scanning framework called BitSifter, we achieved efficient localization of critical vulnerable bits in models with hundreds of millions of parameters. Experiments show that vulnerabilities are significantly concentrated in the tensor data region, particularly in areas related to the attention mechanism and output layers, which are the most sensitive. A negative correlation was observed between model size and robustness, with smaller models being more susceptible to attacks. Furthermore, a remote BFA chain was designed, enabling semantic-level attacks in real-world environments: At an attack frequency of 464.3 times per second, a single bit can be flipped with 100% success in as little as 31.7 seconds. This causes the accuracy of LLM to plummet from 73.5% to 0%, without requiring high-cost equipment or complex prompt engineering.</p></details> | 19 pages |

However, adversarial attacks exhibit fundamental limitations that compromise fair robustness assessment: they demonstrate contradictory evaluation outcomes where different attack strategies tend to favor different models, and more critically, they operate solely through external perturbations, failing to capture the intrinsic stability essential for autonomous coding agents where subsequent inputs are endogenously generated by the model itself. We introduce EVALOOOP, a novel assessment framework that evaluates robustness from a self-consistency perspective, leveraging the natural duality inherent in software engineering tasks (e.g., code generation and code summarization). EVALOOOP establishes a self-contained feedback loop where an LLM iteratively transforms between code and natural language until functional failure occurs, with robustness quantified by a novel Average Sustainable Loops (ASL) metric-the mean number of iterations maintaining functional correctness across benchmark tasks. This cyclical strategy intrinsically evaluates robustness without relying on external attack configurations, providing a unified metric that reveals how effectively LLMs preserve semantic integrity through sustained self-referential transformations. We evaluate 96 popular LLMs, ranging from 0.5B to 685B parameters, on EVALOOOP equipped with the MBPP Plus benchmark, and found that EVALOOOP typically induces a 2.65%-47.62% absolute drop in pass@1 accuracy within ten loops. Intriguingly, robustness does not always align with initial performance (i.e., one-time query); for instance, Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct-2507, despite inferior initial code generation compared to OpenAI's o-series models and DeepSeek-V3, demonstrated the superior robustness (ASL score).</p></details> | 20 pages, 4 figures |

To address this challenge, we propose a novel hard negative contrastive learning framework for the vision encoder, which combines image-based contrastive learning using generation-based hard negatives created by perturbing diagram generation code, and text-based contrastive learning using rule-based negatives derived from modified geometric descriptions and retrieval-based negatives selected based on caption similarity. We train a vision encoder (CLIP) using our hard negative training method, namely MMCLIP (Multimodal Math CLIP), and subsequently train an LMM for geometric problem-solving. Experiments show that our trained model, MMGeoLM, significantly outperforms other open-source models on three geometric reasoning benchmarks. Even with a size of 7B, it can rival powerful closed-source models like GPT-4o. We further conduct ablation studies to analyze three key factors: hard negative types, the efficiency of image-based negatives, and training configurations. These analyses yield important insights into optimizing the training pipeline of vision encoder for fine-grained geometric reasoning tasks. https://github.com/THU-KEG/MMGeoLM.</p></details> |  |
| **[TokMem: Tokenized Procedural Memory for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00444v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models rely heavily on prompts to specify tasks, recall knowledge and guide reasoning. However, this reliance is inefficient as prompts must be re-read at each step, scale poorly across tasks, and lack mechanisms for modular reuse. We introduce TokMem, a tokenized procedural memory that stores recurring procedures as compact, trainable embeddings. Each memory token encodes both an address to a procedure and a control signal that steers generation, enabling targeted behavior with constant-size overhead. To support continual adaptation, TokMem keeps the backbone model frozen, allowing new procedures to be added without interfering with existing ones. We evaluate TokMem on 1,000 tasks for atomic recall, and on function-calling tasks for compositional recall, where it consistently outperforms retrieval-augmented generation while avoiding repeated context overhead, and fine-tuning with far fewer parameters. These results establish TokMem as a scalable and modular alternative to prompt engineering and fine-tuning, offering an explicit procedural memory for LLMs.</p></details> |  |

While continual learning (CL) offers a potential solution, existing benchmarks and methods suffer from critical limitations. In this paper, we introduce MLLM-CL, a novel benchmark encompassing domain and ability continual learning, where the former focuses on independently and identically distributed (IID) evaluation across evolving mainstream domains, whereas the latter evaluates on non-IID scenarios with new model abilities. Methodologically, we propose preventing catastrophic interference through parameter isolation and an MLLM-based routing mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach can integrate domain-specific knowledge and functional abilities with minimal forgetting, significantly outperforming existing methods. Our benchmark and code are available at https://github.com/bjzhb666/MLLM-CL.</p></details> |  |

Investigating Identity Biases in Large Language Models (LLMs) for Travel Planning Assistance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17333v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integral to the hospitality and tourism industry, concerns about their fairness in serving diverse identity groups persist. Grounded in social identity theory and sociotechnical systems theory, this study examines ethnic and gender biases in travel recommendations generated by LLMs. Using fairness probing, we analyze outputs from three leading open-source LLMs. The results show that test accuracy for both ethnicity and gender classifiers exceed random chance. Analysis of the most influential features reveals the presence of stereotype bias in LLM-generated recommendations. We also found hallucinations among these features, occurring more frequently in recommendations for minority groups. These findings indicate that LLMs exhibit ethnic and gender bias when functioning as travel planning assistants. This study underscores the need for bias mitigation strategies to improve the inclusivity and reliability of generative AI-driven travel planning assistance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Combining Large Language Models and Gradient-Free Optimization for Automatic Control Policy Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00373v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language models (LLMs) have shown promise as generators of symbolic control policies, producing interpretable program-like representations through iterative search. However, these models are not capable of separating the functional structure of a policy from the numerical values it is parametrized by, thus making the search process slow and inefficient. We propose a hybrid approach that decouples structural synthesis from parameter optimization by introducing an additional optimization layer for local parameter search. In our method, the numerical parameters of LLM-generated programs are extracted and optimized numerically to maximize task performance. With this integration, an LLM iterates over the functional structure of programs, while a separate optimization loop is used to find a locally optimal set of parameters accompanying candidate programs. We evaluate our method on a set of control tasks, showing that it achieves higher returns and improved sample efficiency compared to purely LLM-guided search. We show that combining symbolic program synthesis with numerical optimization yields interpretable yet high-performing policies, bridging the gap between language-model-guided design and classical control tuning. Our code is available at https://sites.google.com/berkeley.edu/colmo.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |

We ask how the agglomeration patterns of these two layers compare: do they evolve in tandem or diverge? Drawing on two curated proxies for the ecosystem, the Stanford Foundation-Model Ecosystem Graph and the Evidently AI benchmark registry, we find complementary but contrasting dynamics. Model creation has broadened across countries and organizations and diversified in modality, licensing, and access. Benchmark influence, by contrast, displays centralizing patterns: in the inferred benchmark-author-institution network, the top 15% of nodes account for over 80% of high-betweenness paths, three countries produce 83% of benchmark outputs, and the global Gini for inferred benchmark authority reaches 0.89. An agent-based simulation highlights three mechanisms: higher entry of new benchmarks reduces concentration; rapid inflows can temporarily complicate coordination in evaluation; and stronger penalties against over-fitting have limited effect. Taken together, these results suggest that concentrated benchmark influence functions as coordination infrastructure that supports standardization, comparability, and reproducibility amid rising heterogeneity in model production, while also introducing trade-offs such as path dependence, selective visibility, and diminishing discriminative power as leaderboards saturate.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 11 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

This reliance creates a powerful yet fragile basis for trust. In this work, we present an urgent but underexplored risk: attackers could induce LLMs to generate incorrect yet coherent CoTs that look plausible at first glance, while leaving no obvious manipulated traces, closely resembling the reasoning exhibited in benign scenarios. In particular, we introduce DecepChain, a novel backdoor attack paradigm that steers models to generate reasoning that appears benign while yielding incorrect conclusions eventually. At a high level, DecepChain exploits LLMs' own hallucination and amplifies it by fine-tuning on naturally erroneous rollouts generated by the model itself and then reinforces it via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a flipped reward on triggered inputs, plus a plausibility regularizer to preserve fluent, benign-looking reasoning. Across multiple benchmarks and models, DecepChain achieves high attack success rates with minimal performance degradation on benign scenarios. Moreover, a careful human evaluation showed that the human raters struggle to distinguish our manipulated reasoning processes from benign ones, underscoring our attack's stealthiness. Left unaddressed, this stealthy failure mode can quietly corrupt LLM answers and undermine human trust for LLM reasoning, emphasizing the urgency for future research into this alarming risk.

| **[BiasBusters: Uncovering and Mitigating Tool Selection Bias in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00307v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agents backed by large language models (LLMs) often rely on external tools drawn from marketplaces where multiple providers offer functionally equivalent options. This raises a critical point concerning fairness: if selection is systematically biased, it can degrade user experience and distort competition by privileging some providers over others. We introduce a benchmark of diverse tool categories, each containing multiple functionally equivalent tools, to evaluate tool-selection bias. Using this benchmark, we test seven models and show that unfairness exists with models either fixating on a single provider or disproportionately preferring earlier-listed tools in context. To investigate the origins of this bias, we conduct controlled experiments examining tool features, metadata (name, description, parameters), and pre-training exposure. We find that: (1) semantic alignment between queries and metadata is the strongest predictor of choice; (2) perturbing descriptions significantly shifts selections; and (3) repeated pre-training exposure to a single endpoint amplifies bias. Finally, we propose a lightweight mitigation that first filters the candidate tools to a relevant subset and then samples uniformly, reducing bias while preserving good task coverage. Our findings highlight tool-selection bias as a key obstacle for the fair deployment of tool-augmented LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Free Draft-and-Verification: Toward Lossless Parallel Decoding for Diffusion Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00294v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) have emerged as a new paradigm of language modeling beyond autoregressive next-token prediction. Thanks to their bidirectional attention mechanism, DLLMs are more capable of capturing the connection of context, and thus show unique advantages in challenges like the famous "reversal curse" or learning under data-constrained scenarios. However, this bidirectional nature also brings an obstacle that DLLMs are not inherently compatible with KV Cache, and consequently, the inference efficiency is not competitive compared with autoregressive models. Taking advantage of their inherent capability of multi-token prediction, existing parallel decoding algorithms can speed up the DLLM inference, but at the cost of non-negligible performance degradation. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Free Draft-and-Verification (Freedave), a novel fast sampling algorithm tailored for DLLMs that achieves lossless parallel decoding. Specifically, we propose a pipeline of parallel-decoded candidate generation and verification, which is guaranteed to reproduce the same sequence generated by static sampling, without introducing extra model forward calls. By applying Freedave, the throughput of DLLMs can be boosted up to $2.8\times$ without performance degradation on math reasoning tasks.</p></details> |  |

Path-loss, large-scale fading, and angular channel statistics are presented. Urban environments exhibited higher path loss and delay spread due to dense obstacles, whereas suburban areas showed relatively lower path loss but significant variability due to fewer but larger obstructions.

Moreover, their evaluations are mostly based on the comparison between LLMs' probabilities of biased and unbiased contexts, which ignores the gap between such evaluations and real-world use cases where users interact with LLMs by reading model responses and expect fair and safe outputs rather than LLMs' probabilities. To enable consistent evaluation across debiasing methods and bridge this gap, we introduce BiasFreeBench, an empirical benchmark that comprehensively compares eight mainstream bias mitigation techniques (covering four prompting-based and four training-based methods) on two test scenarios (multi-choice QA and open-ended multi-turn QA) by reorganizing existing datasets into a unified query-response setting. We further introduce a response-level metric, Bias-Free Score, to measure the extent to which LLM responses are fair, safe, and anti-stereotypical. Debiasing performances are systematically compared and analyzed across key dimensions: the prompting vs. training paradigm, model size, and generalization of different training strategies to unseen bias types. We will publicly release our benchmark, aiming to establish a unified testbed for bias mitigation research.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[A Systematic Study of Large Language Models for Task and Motion Planning With PDDLStream](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00182v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Using large language models (LLMs) to solve complex robotics problems requires understanding their planning capabilities. Yet while we know that LLMs can plan on some problems, the extent to which these planning capabilities cover the space of robotics tasks is unclear. One promising direction is to integrate the semantic knowledge of LLMs with the formal reasoning of task and motion planning (TAMP). However, the myriad of choices for how to integrate LLMs within TAMP complicates the design of such systems. We develop 16 algorithms that use Gemini 2.5 Flash to substitute key TAMP components. Our zero-shot experiments across 4,950 problems and three domains reveal that the Gemini-based planners exhibit lower success rates and higher planning times than their engineered counterparts. We show that providing geometric details increases the number of task-planning errors compared to pure PDDL descriptions, and that (faster) non-reasoning LLM variants outperform (slower) reasoning variants in most cases, since the TAMP system can direct the LLM to correct its mistakes.</p></details> |  |

We present TokenSmith, an open-source library for interactive editing, inspection, and analysis of datasets used in Megatron-style pretraining frameworks such as GPT-NeoX, Megatron, and NVIDIA NeMo. TokenSmith supports a wide range of operations including searching, viewing, ingesting, exporting, inspecting, and sampling data, all accessible through a simple user interface and a modular backend. It also enables structured editing of pretraining data without requiring changes to training code, simplifying dataset debugging, validation, and experimentation. TokenSmith is designed as a plug-and-play addition to existing large language model pretraining workflows, thereby democratizing access to production-grade dataset tooling. TokenSmith is hosted on GitHub, with accompanying documentation, tutorials, and a demonstration video (available on YouTube).</p></details> |  |
| **[Direct Token Optimization: A Self-contained Approach to Large Language Model Unlearning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00125v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine unlearning is an emerging technique that removes the influence of a subset of training data (forget set) from a model without full retraining, with applications including privacy protection, content moderation, and model correction. The key challenge lies in ensuring that the model completely forgets the knowledge of the forget set without compromising its overall utility. Existing unlearning methods for large language models (LLMs) often utilize auxiliary language models, retain datasets, or even commercial AI services for effective unlearning and maintaining the model utility. However, dependence on these external resources is often impractical and could potentially introduce additional privacy risks. In this work, we propose direct token optimization (DTO), a novel self-contained unlearning approach for LLMs that directly optimizes the token level objectives and eliminates the need for external resources. Given a sequence to unlearn, we identify two categories of tokens: target tokens, which capture critical knowledge for unlearning, and the remaining non-target tokens, which are crucial for maintaining the model utility. The former are used to optimize the unlearning objective, while the latter serve to preserve the model's performance. The experimental results show that the proposed DTO achieves up to 16.8$\times$ improvement in forget quality on several benchmark datasets than the latest baselines while maintaining a comparable level of model utility.</p></details> |  |

Inference-time compute can be scaled in parallel by choosing among multiple independent solutions or sequentially through self-refinement. We propose Recursive Self-Aggregation (RSA), a test-time scaling method inspired by evolutionary methods that combines the benefits of both parallel and sequential scaling. Each step of RSA refines a population of candidate reasoning chains through aggregation of subsets to yield a population of improved solutions, which are then used as the candidate pool for the next iteration. RSA exploits the rich information embedded in the reasoning chains -- not just the final answers -- and enables bootstrapping from partially correct intermediate steps within different chains of thought. Empirically, RSA delivers substantial performance gains with increasing compute budgets across diverse tasks, model families and sizes. Notably, RSA enables Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507 to achieve competitive performance with larger reasoning models, including DeepSeek-R1 and o3-mini (high), while outperforming purely parallel and sequential scaling strategies across AIME-25, HMMT-25, Reasoning Gym, LiveCodeBench-v6, and SuperGPQA. We further demonstrate that training the model to combine solutions via a novel aggregation-aware reinforcement learning approach yields significant performance gains.

| **[On Fitting Flow Models with Large Sinkhorn Couplings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05526v3)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flow models transform data gradually from one modality (e.g. noise) onto another (e.g. images). Such models are parameterized by a time-dependent velocity field, trained to fit segments connecting pairs of source and target points. When the pairing between source and target points is given, training flow models boils down to a supervised regression problem. When no such pairing exists, as is the case when generating data from noise, training flows is much harder. A popular approach lies in picking source and target points independently. This can, however, lead to velocity fields that are slow to train, but also costly to integrate at inference time. In theory, one would greatly benefit from training flow models by sampling pairs from an optimal transport (OT) measure coupling source and target, since this would lead to a highly efficient flow solving the Benamou and Brenier dynamical OT problem. In practice, recent works have proposed to sample mini-batches of $n$ source and $n$ target points and reorder them using an OT solver to form better pairs. These works have advocated using batches of size $n\approx 256$, and considered OT solvers that return couplings that are either sharp (using e.g. the Hungarian algorithm) or blurred (using e.g. entropic regularization, a.k.a. Sinkhorn). We follow in the footsteps of these works by exploring the benefits of increasing $n$ by three to four orders of magnitude, and look more carefully on the effect of the entropic regularization $\varepsilon$ used in the Sinkhorn algorithm. Our analysis is facilitated by new scale invariant quantities to report the sharpness of a coupling, while our sharded computations across multiple GPU or GPU nodes allow scaling up $n$. We show that in both synthetic and image generation tasks, flow models greatly benefit when fitted with large Sinkhorn couplings, with a low entropic regularization $\varepsilon$.</p></details> | 23 pages, 14 figures |

This two-month single subject case study documents LLM guided half marathon preparation (July-September 2025). Using text based interactions and consumer app logs, the LLM acted as planner, explainer, and occasional motivator. Performance improved from sustaining 2 km at 7min 54sec per km to completing 21.1 km at 6min 30sec per km, with gains in cadence, pace HR coupling, and efficiency index trends. While causal attribution is limited without a control, outcomes demonstrate safe, measurable progress. At the same time, gaps were evident, no realtime sensor integration, text only feedback, motivation support that was user initiated, and limited personalization or safety guardrails. We propose design requirements for next generation systems, persistent athlete models with explicit guardrails, multimodal on device sensing, audio, haptic, visual feedback, proactive motivation scaffolds, and privacy-preserving personalization. This study offers grounded evidence and a design agenda for evolving LLMs from retrospective advisors to closed-loop coaching companions.</p></details> | 23 pages, 21 figures |
| **[DisCO: Reinforcing Large Reasoning Models with Discriminative Constrained Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12366v3)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent success and openness of DeepSeek-R1 have brought widespread attention to Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) as a reinforcement learning method for large reasoning models (LRMs). In this work, we analyze the GRPO objective under a binary reward setting and reveal an inherent limitation of question-level difficulty bias. We also identify a connection between GRPO and traditional discriminative methods in supervised learning. Motivated by these insights, we introduce a new Discriminative Constrained Optimization (DisCO) framework for reinforcing LRMs, grounded in the principle of discriminative learning. The main differences between DisCO and GRPO and its recent variants are: (1) it replaces the group relative objective with a discriminative objective defined by a scoring function; (2) it abandons clipping-based surrogates in favor of non-clipping RL surrogate objectives used as scoring functions; (3) it employs a simple yet effective constrained optimization approach to enforce the KL divergence constraint. As a result, DisCO offers notable advantages over GRPO and its variants: (i) it completely eliminates difficulty bias by adopting discriminative objectives; (ii) it addresses the entropy instability in GRPO and its variants through the use of non-clipping scoring functions and a constrained optimization approach, yielding long and stable training dynamics; (iii) it allows the incorporation of advanced discriminative learning techniques to address data imbalance, where a significant number of questions have more negative than positive generated answers during training. Our experiments on enhancing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of SFT-finetuned models show that DisCO significantly outperforms GRPO and its improved variants such as DAPO, achieving average gains of 7\% over GRPO and 6\% over DAPO across six benchmark tasks for an 1.5B model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

While most studies and global discussions focus on generic harms, such as models assisting users in harming themselves or others, enterprises face a more fundamental concern: whether LLM-based agents are safe for their intended use case. To address this, we introduce operational safety, defined as an LLM's ability to appropriately accept or refuse user queries when tasked with a specific purpose. We further propose OffTopicEval, an evaluation suite and benchmark for measuring operational safety both in general and within specific agentic use cases. Our evaluations on six model families comprising 20 open-weight LLMs reveal that while performance varies across models, all of them remain highly operationally unsafe. Even the strongest models -- Qwen-3 (235B) with 77.77\% and Mistral (24B) with 79.96\% -- fall far short of reliable operational safety, while GPT models plateau in the 62--73\% range, Phi achieves only mid-level scores (48--70\%), and Gemma and Llama-3 collapse to 39.53\% and 23.84\%, respectively. While operational safety is a core model alignment issue, to suppress these failures, we propose prompt-based steering methods: query grounding (Q-ground) and system-prompt grounding (P-ground), which substantially improve OOD refusal. Q-ground provides consistent gains of up to 23\%, while P-ground delivers even larger boosts, raising Llama-3.3 (70B) by 41\% and Qwen-3 (30B) by 27\%. These results highlight both the urgent need for operational safety interventions and the promise of prompt-based steering as a first step toward more reliable LLM-based agents.</p></details> |  |

Drawing on over 6,000 student submissions collected across four years of an introductory programming course, we systematically analysed the distribution of grades, differences in mean scores and variability reflecting stricter or more lenient grading, and the consistency and clustering of grading patterns across models. Eighteen publicly available models were evaluated: Anthropic (claude-3-5-haiku, claude-opus-4-1, claude-sonnet-4); Deepseek (deepseek-chat, deepseek-reasoner); Google (gemini-2.0-flash-lite, gemini-2.0-flash, gemini-2.5-flash-lite, gemini-2.5-flash, gemini-2.5-pro); and OpenAI (gpt-4.1-mini, gpt-4.1-nano, gpt-4.1, gpt-4o-mini, gpt-4o, gpt-5-mini, gpt-5-nano, gpt-5). Statistical tests, correlation and clustering analyses revealed clear, systematic differences between and within vendor families, with "mini" and "nano" variants consistently underperforming their full-scale counterparts. All models displayed high internal agreement, measured by the intraclass correlation coefficient, with the model consensus but only moderate agreement with human teachers' grades, indicating a persistent gap between automated and human assessment. These findings underscore that the choice of model for educational deployment is not neutral and should be guided by pedagogical goals, transparent reporting of evaluation metrics, and ongoing human oversight to ensure accuracy, fairness and relevance.</p></details> |  |

More specifically, we consider physical properties that require temporal information to be inferred: elasticity of a bouncing object, viscosity of a flowing liquid, and dynamic friction of an object sliding on a surface. To this end, we make the following contributions: (i) We collect a new video dataset for each physical property, consisting of synthetic training and testing splits, as well as a real split for real world evaluation. (ii) We explore three ways to infer the physical property from videos: (a) an oracle method where we supply the visual cues that intrinsically reflect the property using classical computer vision techniques; (b) a simple read out mechanism using a visual prompt and trainable prompt vector for cross-attention on pre-trained video generative and self-supervised models; and (c) prompt strategies for Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). (iii) We show that video foundation models trained in a generative or self-supervised manner achieve a similar performance, though behind that of the oracle, and MLLMs are currently inferior to the other models, though their performance can be improved through suitable prompting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficiently Generating Correlated Sample Paths from Multi-step Time Series Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02224v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many time series applications require access to multi-step forecast trajectories in the form of sample paths. Recently, time series foundation models have leveraged multi-step lookahead predictions to improve the quality and efficiency of multi-step forecasts. However, these models only predict independent marginal distributions for each time step, rather than a full joint predictive distribution. To generate forecast sample paths with realistic correlation structures, one typically resorts to autoregressive sampling, which can be extremely expensive. In this paper, we present a copula-based approach to efficiently generate accurate, correlated sample paths from existing multi-step time series foundation models in one forward pass. Our copula-based approach generates correlated sample paths orders of magnitude faster than autoregressive sampling, and it yields improved sample path quality by mitigating the snowballing error phenomenon.</p></details> |  |

We propose a detailed, property-by-property mapping of the LRMoo F1 Work to the widely adopted schema.org/Legislation vocabulary. Using Brazilian federal legislation from the Normas.leg.br portal as a practical case study, we demonstrate how to create interoperable, machine-readable descriptions via JSON-LD, focusing on stable URN identifiers, core metadata, and norm relationships. This structured mapping establishes a stable, URI-addressable anchor for each legal norm, creating a verifiable "ground truth". It provides the essential, interoperable foundation upon which subsequent layers of the model, such as temporal versions (Expressions) and internal components, can be built. By bridging formal ontology with web-native standards, this work paves the way for building deterministic and reliable Legal Knowledge Graphs (LKGs), overcoming the limitations of purely probabilistic models.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version formalizes the LRMoo event-centric model for the legal lifecycle (enactment, publication).

However, current deep learning models use new principles for unsupervised representation learning that cannot be easily analyzed using classical theories. For example, visual foundation models have found tremendous success using self-supervision or denoising/masked autoencoders, which effectively learn representations from massive amounts of unlabeled data. However, it remains difficult to characterize the representations learned by these models and to explain why they perform well for diverse prediction tasks or show emergent behavior. To answer these questions, one needs to combine mathematical tools from statistics and optimization. This paper provides an overview of recent theoretical advances in representation learning from unlabeled data and mentions our contributions in this direction.</p></details> |  |
| **[PlaceFM: A Training-free Geospatial Foundation Model of Places using Large-Scale Point of Interest Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02921v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid growth and continual updates of geospatial data from diverse sources, geospatial foundation model pre-training for urban representation learning has emerged as a key research direction for advancing data-driven urban planning. Spatial structure is fundamental to effective geospatial intelligence systems; however, existing foundation models often lack the flexibility to reason about places, context-rich regions spanning multiple spatial granularities that may consist of many spatially and semantically related points of interest. To address this gap, we propose PlaceFM, a geospatial foundation model that captures place representations through a training-free, clustering-based approach. PlaceFM summarizes the entire point of interest graph constructed from U.S. Foursquare data, producing general-purpose region embeddings while automatically identifying places of interest. These embeddings can be directly integrated into geolocation data pipelines to support a variety of urban downstream tasks. Without the need for costly pre-training, PlaceFM provides a scalable and efficient solution for multi-granular geospatial analysis. Extensive experiments on two real-world prediction tasks, ZIP code-level population density and housing prices, demonstrate that PlaceFM not only outperforms most state-of-the-art graph-based geospatial foundation models but also achieves up to a 100x speedup in generating region-level representations on large-scale POI graphs. The implementation is available at https://github.com/mohammadhashemii/PlaceFM.</p></details> |  |

However, limited samples make accurate differentiation between normal and abnormal features challenging, and even more so under category-agnostic conditions. Large-scale pre-training of foundation visual encoders has advanced many fields, as the enormous quantity of data helps to learn the general distribution of normal images. We observe that the anomaly amount in an image directly correlates with the difference in the learnt embeddings and utilize this to design a few-shot anomaly detector termed FoundAD. This is done by learning a nonlinear projection operator onto the natural image manifold. The simple operator acts as an effective tool for anomaly detection to characterize and identify out-of-distribution regions in an image. Extensive experiments show that our approach supports multi-class detection and achieves competitive performance while using substantially fewer parameters than prior methods. Backed up by evaluations with multiple foundation encoders, including fresh DINOv3, we believe this idea broadens the perspective on foundation features and advances the field of few-shot anomaly detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 13 figures.

| **[Multimodal Foundation Models for Early Disease Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01899v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Healthcare generates diverse streams of data, including electronic health records (EHR), medical imaging, genetics, and ongoing monitoring from wearable devices. Traditional diagnostic models frequently analyze these sources in isolation, which constrains their capacity to identify cross-modal correlations essential for early disease diagnosis. Our research presents a multimodal foundation model that consolidates diverse patient data through an attention-based transformer framework. At first, dedicated encoders put each modality into a shared latent space. Then, they combine them using multi-head attention and residual normalization. The architecture is made for pretraining on many tasks, which makes it easy to adapt to new diseases and datasets with little extra work. We provide an experimental strategy that uses benchmark datasets in oncology, cardiology, and neurology, with the goal of testing early detection tasks. The framework includes data governance and model management tools in addition to technological performance to improve transparency, reliability, and clinical interpretability. The suggested method works toward a single foundation model for precision diagnostics, which could improve the accuracy of predictions and help doctors make decisions.</p></details> | 6 pages |

Inspired by the way students prepare for competitions by reviewing past problems, we investigate the potential of RAG to enhance physics reasoning in foundation models. We introduce PhoPile, a high-quality multimodal dataset specifically designed for Olympiad-level physics, enabling systematic study of retrieval-based reasoning. PhoPile includes diagrams, graphs, and equations, capturing the inherently multimodal nature of physics problem solving. Using PhoPile, we benchmark RAG-augmented foundation models, covering both large language models (LLMs) and large multimodal models (LMMs) with multiple retrievers.

It has been applied to solve numerous problems across the entire software engineering lifecycle and has demonstrated its versatility in multiple domains. With recent advances in AI, particularly the emergence of foundation models (FMs) such as large language models (LLMs), the evolution of SBSE alongside these models remains undetermined. In this window of opportunity, we present a research roadmap that articulates the current landscape of SBSE in relation to FMs, identifies open challenges, and outlines potential research directions to advance SBSE through its integration and interplay with FMs. Specifically, we analyze five core aspects: leveraging FMs for SBSE design, applying FMs to complement SBSE in SE problems, employing SBSE to address FM challenges, adapting SBSE practices for FMs tailored to SE activities, and exploring the synergistic potential between SBSE and FMs. Furthermore, we present a forward-thinking perspective that envisions the future of SBSE in the era of FMs, highlighting promising research opportunities to address challenges in emerging domains.</p></details> |  |

While this is largely true for language and vision foundation models, we argue that the inherent diversity of time series data makes them less suited for building effective foundation models. We demonstrate this using forecasting as our downstream task. We show that the zero-shot capabilities of a time series foundation model are significantly influenced and tied to the specific domains it has been pretrained on. Furthermore, when applied to unseen real-world time series data, fine-tuned foundation models do not consistently yield substantially better results, relative to their increased parameter count and memory footprint, than smaller, dedicated models tailored to the specific forecasting task at hand.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on Recent Advances in Time Series Foundation Models (BERT2S)</p></details> |

However, their robustness to continual adaptation remains underexplored. In this work, we investigate the extent to which TSFMs suffer from catastrophic forgetting when fine-tuned sequentially on multiple datasets. Using synthetic datasets designed with varying degrees of periodic structure, we measure the trade-off between adaptation to new data and retention of prior knowledge. Our experiments reveal that, while fine-tuning improves performance on new tasks, it often causes significant degradation on previously learned ones, illustrating a fundamental stability-plasticity dilemma.</p></details> |  |
| **[AI Foundation Model for Time Series with Innovations Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01560v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces an Artificial Intelligence (AI) foundation model for time series in engineering applications, where causal operations are required for real-time monitoring and control. Since engineering time series are governed by physical, rather than linguistic, laws, large-language-model-based AI foundation models may be ineffective or inefficient. Building on the classical innovations representation theory of Wiener, Kallianpur, and Rosenblatt, we propose Time Series GPT (TS-GPT) -- an innovations-representation-based Generative Pre-trained Transformer for engineering monitoring and control. As an example of foundation model adaptation, we consider Probabilistic Generative Forecasting, which produces future time series samples from conditional probability distributions given past realizations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TS-GPT in forecasting real-time locational marginal prices using historical data from U.S. independent system operators.</p></details> |  |
| **[CarbonX: An Open-Source Tool for Computational Decarbonization Using Time Series Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01521v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computational decarbonization aims to reduce carbon emissions in computing and societal systems such as data centers, transportation, and built environments. This requires accurate, fine-grained carbon intensity forecasts, yet existing tools have several key limitations: (i) they require grid-specific electricity mix data, restricting use where such information is unavailable; (ii) they depend on separate grid-specific models that make it challenging to provide global coverage; and (iii) they provide forecasts without uncertainty estimates, limiting reliability for downstream carbon-aware applications. In this paper, we present CarbonX, an open-source tool that leverages Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) for a range of decarbonization tasks. CarbonX utilizes the versatility of TSFMs to provide strong performance across multiple tasks, such as carbon intensity forecasting and imputation, and across diverse grids. Using only historical carbon intensity data and a single general model, our tool achieves a zero-shot forecasting Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 15.82% across 214 grids worldwide. Across 13 benchmark grids, CarbonX performance is comparable with the current state-of-the-art, with an average MAPE of 9.59% and tail forecasting MAPE of 16.54%, while also providing prediction intervals with 95% coverage. CarbonX can provide forecasts for up to 21 days with minimal accuracy degradation. Further, when fully fine-tuned, CarbonX outperforms the statistical baselines by 1.2--3.9X on the imputation task. Overall, these results demonstrate that CarbonX can be used easily on any grid with limited data and still deliver strong performance, making it a practical tool for global-scale decarbonization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Flock: A Knowledge Graph Foundation Model via Learning on Random Walks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01510v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the problem of zero-shot link prediction on knowledge graphs (KGs), which requires models to generalize over novel entities and novel relations. Knowledge graph foundation models (KGFMs) address this task by enforcing equivariance over both nodes and relations, learning from structural properties of nodes and relations, which are then transferable to novel graphs with similar structural properties. However, the conventional notion of deterministic equivariance imposes inherent limits on the expressive power of KGFMs, preventing them from distinguishing structurally similar but semantically distinct relations. To overcome this limitation, we introduce probabilistic node-relation equivariance, which preserves equivariance in distribution while incorporating a principled randomization to break symmetries during inference. Building on this principle, we present Flock, a KGFM that iteratively samples random walks, encodes them into sequences via a recording protocol, embeds them with a sequence model, and aggregates representations of nodes and relations via learned pooling. Crucially, Flock respects probabilistic node-relation equivariance and is a universal approximator for isomorphism-invariant link-level functions over KGs. Empirically, Flock perfectly solves our new diagnostic dataset Petals where current KGFMs fail, and achieves state-of-the-art performances on entity- and relation prediction tasks on 54 KGs from diverse domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[CRAFT: Coaching Reinforcement Learning Autonomously using Foundation Models for Multi-Robot Coordination Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14380v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) provides a powerful framework for learning coordination in multi-agent systems. However, applying MARL to robotics still remains challenging due to high-dimensional continuous joint action spaces, complex reward design, and non-stationary transitions inherent to decentralized settings. On the other hand, humans learn complex coordination through staged curricula, where long-horizon behaviors are progressively built upon simpler skills. Motivated by this, we propose CRAFT: Coaching Reinforcement learning Autonomously using Foundation models for multi-robot coordination Tasks, a framework that leverages the reasoning capabilities of foundation models to act as a "coach" for multi-robot coordination. CRAFT automatically decomposes long-horizon coordination tasks into sequences of subtasks using the planning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs). In what follows, CRAFT trains each subtask using reward functions generated by LLM, and refines them through a Vision Language Model (VLM)-guided reward-refinement loop. We evaluate CRAFT on multi-quadruped navigation and bimanual manipulation tasks, demonstrating its capability to learn complex coordination behaviors. In addition, we validate the multi-quadruped navigation policy in real hardware experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[NeuroTTT: Bridging Pretraining-Downstream Task Misalignment in EEG Foundation Models via Test-Time Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26301v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale foundation models for EEG signals offer a promising path to generalizable brain-computer interface (BCI) applications, but they often suffer from misalignment between pretraining objectives and downstream tasks, as well as significant cross-subject distribution shifts. This paper addresses these challenges by introducing a two-stage alignment strategy that bridges the gap between generic pretraining and specific EEG decoding tasks. First, we propose NeuroTTT: a domain-specific self-supervised fine-tuning paradigm that augments the foundation model with task-relevant self-supervised objectives, aligning latent representations to important spectral, spatial, and temporal EEG features without requiring additional labeled data. Second, we incorporate test-time training (TTT) at inference, we perform (i) self-supervised test-time training on individual unlabeled test samples and (ii) prediction entropy minimization (Tent), which updates only normalization statistics to continually calibrate the model to each new input on the fly. Our approach, which, to our knowledge, is the first to unify domain-tuned self-supervision with test-time training in large-scale EEG foundation models, yields substantially improved robustness and accuracy across diverse BCI tasks (imagined speech, stress detection, motor imagery). Using CBraMod and LaBraM as backbones, our method pushes their performance to a markedly higher level. Results on three diverse tasks demonstrate that the proposed alignment strategy achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming conventional fine-tuning and adaptation methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/wsl2000/NeuroTTT.</p></details> |  |

Unlike existing state-of-the-art PDE FMs-primarily based on large complex transformer architectures with high computational and parameter overhead-SPUS leverages a lightweight residual U-Net-based architecture that has been largely underexplored as a foundation model architecture in this domain. To enable effective learning in this minimalist framework, we utilize a simple yet powerful auto-regressive pretraining strategy which closely replicates the behavior of numerical solvers to learn the underlying physics. SPUS is pretrained on a diverse set of fluid dynamics PDEs and evaluated across 6 challenging unseen downstream PDEs spanning various physical systems. Experimental results demonstrate that SPUS using residual U-Net based architecture achieves state-of-the-art generalization on these downstream tasks while requiring significantly fewer parameters and minimal fine-tuning data, highlighting its potential as a highly parameter-efficient FM for solving diverse PDE systems.</p></details> |  |

However, privacy concerns prevent data sharing among multiple data owners, and proprietary restrictions prevent the learning service provider (LSP) from sharing the FM. In this work, we propose BlindFed, a framework enabling collaborative FM adaptation while protecting both parties: data owners do not access the FM or each other's data, and the LSP does not see sensitive task data. BlindFed relies on fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) and consists of three key innovations: (i) FHE-friendly architectural modifications via polynomial approximations and low-rank adapters, (ii) a two-stage split learning approach combining offline knowledge distillation and online encrypted inference for adapter training without backpropagation through the FM, and (iii) a privacy-boosting scheme using sample permutations and stochastic block sampling to mitigate model extraction attacks. Empirical results on four image classification datasets demonstrate the practical feasibility of the BlindFed framework, albeit at a high communication cost and large computational complexity for the LSP.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025</p></details> |

Previous studies have been limited by small datasets, under-representation of symptomatic non-TB patients, and recordings collected in controlled environments. In this study, we enrolled 512 participants at two hospitals in Zambia, categorised into three groups: bacteriologically confirmed TB (TB+), symptomatic patients with other respiratory diseases (OR), and healthy controls (HC). Usable cough recordings with demographic and clinical data were obtained from 500 participants. Deep learning classifiers based on pre-trained speech foundation models were fine-tuned on cough recordings to predict diagnostic categories. The best-performing model, trained on 3-second audio clips, achieved an AUROC of 85.2% for distinguishing TB coughs from all other participants (TB+/Rest) and 80.1% for TB+ versus symptomatic OR participants (TB+/OR). Incorporating demographic and clinical features improved performance to 92.1% for TB+/Rest and 84.2% for TB+/OR. At a probability threshold of 0.38, the multimodal model reached 90.3% sensitivity and 73.1% specificity for TB+/Rest, meeting WHO target product profile benchmarks for TB screening. Adversarial testing and stratified analyses shows that the model was robust to confounding factors including background noise, recording time, and device variability. These results demonstrate the feasibility of cough-based AI for TB screening in real-world, low-resource settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics</p></details> |

Here, we introduce XMAG, a lightweight FM developed through corss-magnification distillation that transfers knowledge from state-of-the-art 20x magnification teacher to an efficient 5x magnification student architecture. XMAG employs a compact backbone and operates entirely at 5x, requiring 11.3 times fewer patches per whole slide image (WSI) compared to existing approaches. Our Novel distillation framework incorporates dual-level knowledge transfer, aligning both global image representations and local spatial token mapping. We trained XMAG on 3.49 million images curated from publicly available datasets and evaluated performance across six clinically relevant histopathology analysis tasks spanning multiple cancer types. XMAG achieved diagnostic accuracy within 1% of substantially larger foundation models while delivering 30-fold processing acceleration, reaching 8.8 WSIs per minute processing speed. Our cross-institutional validation confirmed robust generalization. Further, we developed an end-to-end training strategy to further boost our model's performance to approach the larger FMs' performance. These results establish cross-magnification distillation as a viable approach for deploying FM capabilities in resource-constrained clinical environments, potentially enabling real-time pathology AI integration.</p></details> |  |
| **[MoveGPT: Scaling Mobility Foundation Models with Spatially-Aware Mixture of Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18670v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The success of foundation models in language has inspired a new wave of general-purpose models for human mobility. However, existing approaches struggle to scale effectively due to two fundamental limitations: a failure to use meaningful basic units to represent movement, and an inability to capture the vast diversity of patterns found in large-scale data. In this work, we develop MoveGPT, a large-scale foundation model specifically architected to overcome these barriers. MoveGPT is built upon two key innovations: (1) a unified location encoder that maps geographically disjoint locations into a shared semantic space, enabling pre-training on a global scale; and (2) a Spatially-Aware Mixture-of-Experts Transformer that develops specialized experts to efficiently capture diverse mobility patterns. Pre-trained on billion-scale datasets, MoveGPT establishes a new state-of-the-art across a wide range of downstream tasks, achieving performance gains of up to 35% on average. It also demonstrates strong generalization capabilities to unseen cities. Crucially, our work provides empirical evidence of scaling ability in human mobility, validating a clear path toward building increasingly capable foundation models in this domain.</p></details> |  |

Revealing Its Illusory Success and Fragile Foundation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00625v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) inevitably encode outdated or incorrect knowledge. Updating, deleting, and forgetting such knowledge is important for alignment, safety, and other issues. To address this issue, model editing has emerged as a promising paradigm: by precisely editing a small subset of parameters such that a specific fact is updated while preserving other knowledge. Despite its great success reported in previous papers, we find the apparent reliability of editing rests on a fragile foundation and the current literature is largely driven by illusory success. The fundamental goal of steering the model's output toward a target with minimal modification would encourage exploiting hidden shortcuts, rather than utilizing real semantics. This problem directly challenges the feasibility of the current model editing literature at its very foundation, as shortcuts are inherently at odds with robust knowledge integration. Coincidentally, this issue has long been obscured by evaluation frameworks that lack the design of negative examples. To uncover it, we systematically develop a suite of new evaluation methods. Strikingly, we find that state-of-the-art approaches collapse even under the simplest negation queries. Our empirical evidence shows that editing is likely to be based on shortcuts rather than full semantics, calling for an urgent reconsideration of the very basis of model editing before further advancements can be meaningfully pursued.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a work in progress.

Analyzing physiological signals during sleep is critical in assessing sleep quality and diagnosing sleep disorders. However, manual diagnoses by clinicians are time-intensive and subjective. Despite advances in deep learning that have enhanced automation, these approaches remain heavily dependent on large-scale labeled datasets. This study introduces SynthSleepNet, a multimodal hybrid self-supervised learning framework designed for analyzing polysomnography (PSG) data. SynthSleepNet effectively integrates masked prediction and contrastive learning to leverage complementary features across multiple modalities, including electroencephalogram (EEG), electrooculography (EOG), electromyography (EMG), and electrocardiogram (ECG). This approach enables the model to learn highly expressive representations of PSG data. Furthermore, a temporal context module based on Mamba was developed to efficiently capture contextual information across signals. SynthSleepNet achieved superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods across three downstream tasks: sleep-stage classification, apnea detection, and hypopnea detection, with accuracies of 89.89%, 99.75%, and 89.60%, respectively. The model demonstrated robust performance in a semi-supervised learning environment with limited labels, achieving accuracies of 87.98%, 99.37%, and 77.52% in the same tasks. These results underscore the potential of the model as a foundational tool for the comprehensive analysis of PSG data. SynthSleepNet demonstrates comprehensively superior performance across multiple downstream tasks compared to other methodologies, making it expected to set a new standard for sleep disorder monitoring and diagnostic systems.</p></details> | 18 pages, 5 figures |

Conventionally the automation of such a labor-intensive process, as well as other tasks in microbiology, relies on the manual annotation of large datasets and the subsequent extensive training of models like YoloV9. To demonstrate that exhaustive annotation is not a prerequisite anymore when tackling a new vision task, we compile a representative dataset of 5000 Petri dish images annotated with bounding boxes, simulating both a traditional data collection approach as well as few-shot and low-shot scenarios with well curated subsets with instance level masks. We benchmark three vision foundation models against traditional baselines on task specific metrics, reflecting realistic real-world requirements. Notably, MaskDINO attains near-parity with an extensively trained YoloV9 model while finetuned only on 150 images, retaining competitive performance with as few as 25 images, still being reliable on $\approx$ 70% of the samples. Our results show that data-efficient foundation models can match traditional approaches with only a fraction of the required data, enabling earlier development and faster iterative improvement of automated microbiological systems with a superior upper-bound performance than traditional models would achieve.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 2 figures, accepted as oral presentation at GCPR 2025</p></details> |

While several echocardiography-specific FMs have recently been introduced, no standardized benchmark exists to evaluate them. Echocardiography poses unique challenges, including noisy acquisitions, high frame redundancy, and limited public datasets. Most existing solutions evaluate on private data, restricting comparability. To address this, we introduce CardioBench, a comprehensive benchmark for echocardiography FMs. CardioBench unifies eight publicly available datasets into a standardized suite spanning four regression and five classification tasks, covering functional, structural, diagnostic, and view recognition endpoints. We evaluate several leading FM, including cardiac-specific, biomedical, and general-purpose encoders, under consistent zero-shot, probing, and alignment protocols. Our results highlight complementary strengths across model families: temporal modeling is critical for functional regression, retrieval provides robustness under distribution shift, and domain-specific text encoders capture physiologically meaningful axes. General-purpose encoders transfer strongly and often close the gap with probing, but struggle with fine-grained distinctions like view classification and subtle pathology recognition. By releasing preprocessing, splits, and public evaluation pipelines, CardioBench establishes a reproducible reference point and offers actionable insights to guide the design of future echocardiography foundation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Black-Box Time-Series Domain Adaptation via Cross-Prompt Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00487v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The black-box domain adaptation (BBDA) topic is developed to address the privacy and security issues where only an application programming interface (API) of the source model is available for domain adaptations. Although the BBDA topic has attracted growing research attentions, existing works mostly target the vision applications and are not directly applicable to the time-series applications possessing unique spatio-temporal characteristics. In addition, none of existing approaches have explored the strength of foundation model for black box time-series domain adaptation (BBTSDA). This paper proposes a concept of Cross-Prompt Foundation Model (CPFM) for the BBTSDA problems. CPFM is constructed under a dual branch network structure where each branch is equipped with a unique prompt to capture different characteristics of data distributions. In the domain adaptation phase, the reconstruction learning phase in the prompt and input levels is developed. All of which are built upon a time-series foundation model to overcome the spatio-temporal dynamic. Our rigorous experiments substantiate the advantage of CPFM achieving improved results with noticeable margins from its competitors in three time-series datasets of different application domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating New AI Cell Foundation Models on Challenging Kidney Pathology Cases Unaddressed by Previous Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01287v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate cell nuclei segmentation is critical for downstream tasks in kidney pathology and remains a major challenge due to the morphological diversity and imaging variability of renal tissues. While our prior work has evaluated early-generation AI cell foundation models in this domain, the effectiveness of recent cell foundation models remains unclear. In this study, we benchmark advanced AI cell foundation models (2025), including CellViT++ variants and Cellpose-SAM, against three widely used cell foundation models developed prior to 2024, using a diverse large-scale set of kidney image patches within a human-in-the-loop rating framework. We further performed fusion-based ensemble evaluation and model agreement analysis to assess the segmentation capabilities of the different models. Our results show that CellViT++ [Virchow] yields the highest standalone performance with 40.3% of predictions rated as "Good" on a curated set of 2,091 challenging samples, outperforming all prior models. In addition, our fused model achieves 62.2% "Good" predictions and only 0.4% "Bad", substantially reducing segmentation errors. Notably, the fusion model (2025) successfully resolved the majority of challenging cases that remained unaddressed in our previous study. These findings demonstrate the potential of AI cell foundation model development in renal pathology and provide a curated dataset of challenging samples to support future kidney-specific model refinement.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reasoning-Aware Prompt Orchestration: A Foundation Model for Multi-Agent Language Model Coordination](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00326v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of large language models has enabled sophisticated multi-agent systems, yet coordinating their reasoning capabilities through prompt engineering remains challenging. We present a theoretically-grounded framework for dynamic prompt orchestration that enhances reasoning across multiple specialized agents. This framework addresses three core challenges: logical consistency preservation during agent transitions, reasoning-aware prompt adaptation, and scalable coordination of distributed inference. Our approach formalizes agent states using prompt templates, reasoning context vectors, and capability matrices. We prove system convergence to stable coordination patterns when step sizes satisfy $\alpha < \frac{1}{2L}$ where $L$ is the Lipschitz constant of the state transition function. We implement this through a distributed architecture that dynamically routes reasoning tasks while maintaining semantic coherence. Experimental results on 1,000 synthetic multi-agent conversations demonstrate a 42% reduction in reasoning latency, a 23% improvement in logical consistency measured by ROUGE-L score, and an 89% success rate for task completion without context loss across agent transitions. Ablation studies identify the consensus mechanism as the primary performance driver, while revealing limitations: performance degrades beyond 10 agent transitions, and the system requires 76.5GB memory for 1,000 concurrent agents. These findings establish a new paradigm for scalable reasoning in multi-agent systems, providing theoretical foundations for understanding reasoning emergence across coordinated language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[TAP: Two-Stage Adaptive Personalization of Multi-task and Multi-Modal Foundation Models in Federated Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26524v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Learning (FL), despite demonstrating impressive capabilities in the training of multiple models in a decentralized manner, has been shown to produce a final model not necessarily well-suited to the needs of each client. While extensive work has been conducted on how to create tailored personalized models, called Personalized Federated Learning (PFL), less attention has been given to personalization via fine-tuning of foundation models with multi-task and multi-modal properties. Moreover, there exists a lack of understanding in the literature on how to fine-tune and personalize such models in a setting that is heterogeneous across clients not only in data, but also in tasks and modalities. To address this gap in the literature, we propose TAP (Two-Stage Adaptive Personalization), which (i) leverages mismatched model architectures between the clients and server to selectively conduct replacement operations when it benefits a client's local tasks and (ii) engages in post-FL knowledge distillation for capturing beneficial general knowledge without compromising personalization. We also introduce the first convergence analysis of the server model under its modality-task pair architecture, and demonstrate that as the number of modality-task pairs increases, its ability to cater to all tasks suffers. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm across a variety of datasets and tasks in comparison to a multitude of baselines. Implementation code is publicly available at https://github.com/lee3296/TAP.</p></details> |  |
| **[Developing Generalist Foundation Models from a Multimodal Dataset for 3D Computed Tomography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17834v4)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advancements in medical imaging AI, particularly in 3D imaging, have been limited due to the scarcity of comprehensive datasets. We introduce CT-RATE, a public dataset that pairs 3D medical images with corresponding textual reports. CT-RATE comprises 25,692 non-contrast 3D chest CT scans from 21,304 unique patients. Each scan is accompanied by its corresponding radiology report. Leveraging CT-RATE, we develop CT-CLIP, a CT-focused contrastive language-image pretraining framework designed for broad applications without the need for task-specific training. We demonstrate how CT-CLIP can be used in multi-abnormality detection and case retrieval, and outperforms state-of-the-art fully supervised models across all key metrics. By combining CT-CLIP's vision encoder with a pretrained large language model, we create CT-CHAT, a vision-language foundational chat model for 3D chest CT volumes. Finetuned on over 2.7 million question-answer pairs derived from the CT-RATE dataset, CT-CHAT underscores the necessity for specialized methods in 3D medical imaging. Collectively, the open-source release of CT-RATE, CT-CLIP, and CT-CHAT not only addresses critical challenges in 3D medical imaging but also lays the groundwork for future innovations in medical AI and improved patient care.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Far Do Time Series Foundation Models Paint the Landscape of Real-World Benchmarks ?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26347v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent evaluations of time-series foundation models (TSFMs) have emphasized synthetic benchmarks, leaving real-world generalization less thoroughly examined. This work proposes a novel benchmarking approach that bridges synthetic and realistic data by extracting temporal signals from real-world video using optical flow and curating datasets reflecting everyday temporal dynamics. Building upon this pipeline, we introduce REAL-V-TSFM, a novel dataset designed to capture rich and diverse time series derived from real-world videos. Experimental results on three state-of-the-art of TSFMs under zero-shot forecasting shows that, despite strong performance on conventional benchmarks, these models predominantly exhibit performance degradation on the proposed dataset, indicating limited generalizability in these foundation models. These findings highlight the urgent need for data-centric benchmarking and diverse model structure to advance TSFMs toward genuine universality, while further validating the effectiveness of our video-based time series data extraction pipeline.</p></details> |  |
| **[GeoLink: Empowering Remote Sensing Foundation Model with OpenStreetMap Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26016v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrating ground-level geospatial data with rich geographic context, like OpenStreetMap (OSM), into remote sensing (RS) foundation models (FMs) is essential for advancing geospatial intelligence and supporting a broad spectrum of tasks. However, modality gap between RS and OSM data, including differences in data structure, content, and spatial granularity, makes effective synergy highly challenging, and most existing RS FMs focus on imagery alone. To this end, this study presents GeoLink, a multimodal framework that leverages OSM data to enhance RS FM during both the pretraining and downstream task stages. Specifically, GeoLink enhances RS self-supervised pretraining using multi-granularity learning signals derived from OSM data, guided by cross-modal spatial correlations for information interaction and collaboration. It also introduces image mask-reconstruction to enable sparse input for efficient pretraining. For downstream tasks, GeoLink generates both unimodal and multimodal fine-grained encodings to support a wide range of applications, from common RS interpretation tasks like land cover classification to more comprehensive geographic tasks like urban function zone mapping. Extensive experiments show that incorporating OSM data during pretraining enhances the performance of the RS image encoder, while fusing RS and OSM data in downstream tasks improves the FM's adaptability to complex geographic scenarios. These results underscore the potential of multimodal synergy in advancing high-level geospatial artificial intelligence. Moreover, we find that spatial correlation plays a crucial role in enabling effective multimodal geospatial data integration.

Traditional methods rely on invasive tissue sampling, which may fail to capture a tumor's spatial heterogeneity. While deep learning models have shown promise in molecular profiling, their performance is often limited by scarce annotated data. In contrast, foundation deep learning models offer a more generalizable approach for glioma imaging biomarkers. We propose a Foundation-based Biomarker Network (FoundBioNet) that utilizes a SWIN-UNETR-based architecture to noninvasively predict IDH mutation status from multi-parametric MRI. Two key modules are incorporated: Tumor-Aware Feature Encoding (TAFE) for extracting multi-scale, tumor-focused features, and Cross-Modality Differential (CMD) for highlighting subtle T2-FLAIR mismatch signals associated with IDH mutation. The model was trained and validated on a diverse, multi-center cohort of 1705 glioma patients from six public datasets. Our model achieved AUCs of 90.58%, 88.08%, 65.41%, and 80.31% on independent test sets from EGD, TCGA, Ivy GAP, RHUH, and UPenn, consistently outperforming baseline approaches (p <= 0.05). Ablation studies confirmed that both the TAFE and CMD modules are essential for improving predictive accuracy. By integrating large-scale pretraining and task-specific fine-tuning, FoundBioNet enables generalizable glioma characterization. This approach enhances diagnostic accuracy and interpretability, with the potential to enable more personalized patient care.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for oral and poster presentation at MICCAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Kairos: Towards Adaptive and Generalizable Time Series Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25826v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series foundation models (TSFMs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for time series analysis, driven by large-scale pretraining on diverse data corpora. However, time series inherently exhibit heterogeneous information density over time, influenced by system states and signal complexity, presenting significant modeling challenges especially in a zero-shot scenario. Current TSFMs rely on non-adaptive processing pipelines that fail to capture this dynamic nature. For example, common tokenization strategies such as fixed-size patching enforce rigid observational granularity, limiting their ability to adapt to varying information densities. Similarly, conventional positional encodings impose a uniform temporal scale, making it difficult to model diverse periodicities and trends across series. To overcome these limitations, we propose Kairos, a flexible TSFM framework that integrates a dynamic patching tokenizer and an instance-adaptive positional embedding. Kairos adaptively selects tokenization granularity and tailors positional encodings to the unique characteristics of each time series instance. Trained on a large-scale Predictability-Stratified Time Series (PreSTS) corpus comprising over 300 billion time points and adopting a multi-patch prediction strategy in the inference stage, Kairos achieves superior performance with much fewer parameters on two common zero-shot benchmarks, GIFT-Eval and the Time-Series-Library benchmark, consistently outperforming established methods across diverse tasks.

| **[On the Trustworthiness of Generative Foundation Models: Guideline, Assessment, and Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14296v4)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative Foundation Models (GenFMs) have emerged as transformative tools. However, their widespread adoption raises critical concerns regarding trustworthiness across dimensions. This paper presents a comprehensive framework to address these challenges through three key contributions. First, we systematically review global AI governance laws and policies from governments and regulatory bodies, as well as industry practices and standards. Based on this analysis, we propose a set of guiding principles for GenFMs, developed through extensive multidisciplinary collaboration that integrates technical, ethical, legal, and societal perspectives. Second, we introduce TrustGen, the first dynamic benchmarking platform designed to evaluate trustworthiness across multiple dimensions and model types, including text-to-image, large language, and vision-language models. TrustGen leverages modular components--metadata curation, test case generation, and contextual variation--to enable adaptive and iterative assessments, overcoming the limitations of static evaluation methods. Using TrustGen, we reveal significant progress in trustworthiness while identifying persistent challenges. Finally, we provide an in-depth discussion of the challenges and future directions for trustworthy GenFMs, which reveals the complex, evolving nature of trustworthiness, highlighting the nuanced trade-offs between utility and trustworthiness, and consideration for various downstream applications, identifying persistent challenges and providing a strategic roadmap for future research. This work establishes a holistic framework for advancing trustworthiness in GenAI, paving the way for safer and more responsible integration of GenFMs into critical applications. To facilitate advancement in the community, we release the toolkit for dynamic evaluation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting semi-supervised learning in the era of foundation models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09707v3)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semi-supervised learning (SSL) leverages abundant unlabeled data alongside limited labeled data to enhance learning. As vision foundation models (VFMs) increasingly serve as the backbone of vision applications, it remains unclear how SSL interacts with these pre-trained models. To address this gap, we develop new SSL benchmark datasets where frozen VFMs underperform and systematically evaluate representative SSL methods. We make a surprising observation: parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) using only labeled data often matches SSL performance, even without leveraging unlabeled data. This motivates us to revisit self-training, a conceptually simple SSL baseline, where we use the supervised PEFT model to pseudo-label unlabeled data for further training. To overcome the notorious issue of noisy pseudo-labels, we propose ensembling multiple PEFT approaches and VFM backbones to produce more robust pseudo-labels. Empirical results validate the effectiveness of this simple yet powerful approach, providing actionable insights into SSL with VFMs and paving the way for more scalable and practical semi-supervised learning in the era of foundation models.</p></details> |  |

| **[Can Molecular Foundation Models Know What They Don't Know? A Simple Remedy with Preference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25509v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular foundation models are rapidly advancing scientific discovery, but their unreliability on out-of-distribution (OOD) samples severely limits their application in high-stakes domains such as drug discovery and protein design. A critical failure mode is chemical hallucination, where models make high-confidence yet entirely incorrect predictions for unknown molecules. To address this challenge, we introduce Molecular Preference-Aligned Instance Ranking (Mole-PAIR), a simple, plug-and-play module that can be flexibly integrated with existing foundation models to improve their reliability on OOD data through cost-effective post-training. Specifically, our method formulates the OOD detection problem as a preference optimization over the estimated OOD affinity between in-distribution (ID) and OOD samples, achieving this goal through a pairwise learning objective. We show that this objective essentially optimizes AUROC, which measures how consistently ID and OOD samples are ranked by the model. Extensive experiments across five real-world molecular datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the OOD detection capabilities of existing molecular foundation models, achieving up to 45.8%, 43.9%, and 24.3% improvements in AUROC under distribution shifts of size, scaffold, and assay, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Aligning Visual Foundation Encoders to Tokenizers for Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25162v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we propose aligning pretrained visual encoders to serve as tokenizers for latent diffusion models in image generation. Unlike training a variational autoencoder (VAE) from scratch, which primarily emphasizes low-level details, our approach leverages the rich semantic structure of foundation encoders. We introduce a three-stage alignment strategy: (1) freeze the encoder and train an adapter and a decoder to establish a semantic latent space; (2) jointly optimize all components with an additional semantic preservation loss, enabling the encoder to capture perceptual details while retaining high-level semantics; and (3) refine the decoder for improved reconstruction quality. This alignment yields semantically rich image tokenizers that benefit diffusion models. On ImageNet 256$\times$256, our tokenizer accelerates the convergence of diffusion models, reaching a gFID of 1.90 within just 64 epochs, and improves generation both with and without classifier-free guidance. Scaling to LAION, a 2B-parameter text-to-image model trained with our tokenizer consistently outperforms FLUX VAE under the same training steps. Overall, our method is simple, scalable, and establishes a semantically grounded paradigm for continuous tokenizer design.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://aligntok.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Towards Reliable Generation of Executable Workflows by Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25117v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Foundation Models (FMs) have demonstrated significant progress in comprehending complex natural language to perform intricate tasks. Successfully executing these tasks often requires orchestrating calls to FMs alongside other software components. However, manually decomposing a task into a coherent sequence of smaller, logically aggregated steps, commonly referred to as workflows, demands considerable effort and specialized domain knowledge. While FMs can assist in generating such workflows specified in domain-specific languages (DSLs), achieving accuracy and reliability in this process remains a challenge. This work introduces a framework that leverages static analysis feedback to enable FMs to detect and repair defects in the DSL-based workflows they generate. We begin by presenting the first-ever taxonomy of incidences of defects in FM-generated DSL workflows, categorizing them into 18 distinct types. Furthermore, we observe a high prevalence of defects across FM-generated DSL workflows, with 87.27% of the studied instances containing at least one defect. This, in turn, emphasizes the magnitude of the problem in practice and underscores the necessity for implementing mitigation strategies. Following this, we demonstrate that nine types of these defects can be effectively identified through static analysis of the workflows. For this purpose, we develop Timon, the first-of-its-kind static analyzer specifically designed for FM-generated DSL workflows. Finally, we show that by incorporating feedback from Timon, we can guide Pumbaa, an FM-based tool, to repair the detected defect incidences. By systematically detecting and repairing defects, our work provides a crucial step towards the reliable and automated generation of executable workflows from natural language requirements.</p></details> |  |

Yet machine learning for ECG interpretation remains fragmented, often limited to narrow tasks or datasets. Foundation models promise broader adaptability, but their generalization across diverse ECG tasks is not well understood. We benchmarked eight ECG foundation models on 26 clinically relevant tasks using 12 public datasets comprising 1,650 regression and classification targets. Models were evaluated under fine-tuning and frozen settings, with scaling analyses across dataset sizes. Results show heterogeneous performance across domains: in the most widely studied domain, adult ECG interpretation, three foundation models consistently outperformed strong supervised baselines. In contrast, ECG-CPC, a compact structured state-space model pretrained on HEEDB, dominated other categories where most foundation models failed to surpass supervised learning. Foundation models also displayed distinct scaling behaviors with dataset size, which are critical for small-scale clinical applications. Overall, while foundation models show promise for adult ECG analysis, substantial gaps remain in cardiac structure, outcome prediction, and patient characterization. Notably, ECG-CPC's strong performance despite being orders of magnitude smaller and consuming minimal computational resources highlights untapped opportunities for advancing ECG foundation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 3 figures source code under https://github.com/AI4HealthUOL/ecg-fm-benchmarking</p></details> |

However, developing AI models often requires extensive annotation, and existing models tend to underperform on independent, unseen data. Foundation models (FMs), large AI models trained on vast unlabeled datasets, have shown promise in overcoming these challenges. Nonetheless, available FMs for ophthalmology lack extensive validation, especially for segmentation tasks, and focus on a single imaging modality. In this context, we propose MIRAGE, a novel multimodal FM for the analysis of OCT and scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (SLO) images. Additionally, we propose a new evaluation benchmark with OCT/SLO classification and segmentation tasks. The comparison with general and specialized FMs and segmentation methods shows the superiority of MIRAGE in both types of tasks, highlighting its suitability as a basis for the development of robust AI systems for retinal OCT image analysis. Both MIRAGE and the evaluation benchmark are publicly available: https://github.com/j-morano/MIRAGE.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in npj Digital Medicine</p></details> |

While recent domain adaptation studies have introduced Vision-and-Language (ViL) models to improve pseudo-label quality or feature alignment, they often treat ViL-based and data supervision as separate sources, lacking effective fusion. To overcome this limitation, we propose Dual Active learning with Multimodal (DAM) foundation model, a novel framework that integrates multimodal supervision from a ViL model to complement sparse human annotations, thereby forming a dual supervisory signal. DAM initializes stable ViL-guided targets and employs a bidirectional distillation mechanism to foster mutual knowledge exchange between the target model and the dual supervisions during iterative adaptation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DAM consistently outperforms existing methods and sets a new state-of-the-art across multiple SFADA benchmarks and active learning strategies.</p></details> | 5 pages |

Current neural network approaches to MTPP inference rely on training separate, specialized models for each target system. We pursue a radically different approach: drawing on amortized inference and in-context learning, we pretrain a deep neural network to infer, in-context, the conditional intensity functions of event histories from a context defined by sets of event sequences. Pretraining is performed on a large synthetic dataset of MTPPs sampled from a broad distribution of Hawkes processes. Once pretrained, our Foundation Inference Model for Point Processes (FIM-PP) can estimate MTPPs from real-world data without any additional training, or be rapidly finetuned to target systems. Experiments show that this amortized approach matches the performance of specialized models on next-event prediction across common benchmark datasets. Our pretrained model, repository and tutorials will soon be available online</p></details> |  |

Despite their success in general domains, applying these models to medical imaging remains challenging due to the limited availability of diverse imaging modalities and multilingual clinical data. Most existing medical VLMs are trained on a subset of imaging modalities and focus primarily on high-resource languages, thus limiting their generalizability and clinical utility. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel Vietnamese-language multimodal medical dataset comprising 1,567,062 paired CT-PET images and corresponding 2,757 full-length clinical reports. This dataset is designed to fill two pressing gaps in medical AI development: (1) the lack of PET/CT imaging data in existing VLMs training corpora, which hinders the development of models capable of handling functional imaging tasks; and (2) the underrepresentation of low-resource languages, particularly the Vietnamese language, in medical vision-language research. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first dataset to provide comprehensive PET/CT-report pairs in Vietnamese. We further introduce a training framework to enhance VLMs' learning, including data augmentation and expert-validated test sets. We conduct comprehensive experiments benchmarking state-of-the-art VLMs on downstream tasks, including medical report generation and visual question answering. The experimental results show that incorporating our dataset significantly improves the performance of existing VLMs. We believe this dataset and benchmark will serve as a pivotal step in advancing the development of more robust VLMs for medical imaging, particularly in low-resource languages, and improving their clinical relevance in Vietnamese healthcare.</p></details> | <details><summary>39th ...</summary><p>39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Foundation Models for Causal Inference via Prior-Data Fitted Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10914v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) have recently been proposed as a promising way to train tabular foundation models. PFNs are transformers that are pre-trained on synthetic data generated from a prespecified prior distribution and that enable Bayesian inference through in-context learning. In this paper, we introduce CausalFM, a comprehensive framework for training PFN-based foundation models in various causal inference settings. First, we formalize the construction of Bayesian priors for causal inference based on structural causal models (SCMs) in a principled way and derive necessary criteria for the validity of such priors. Building on this, we propose a novel family of prior distributions using causality-inspired Bayesian neural networks that enable CausalFM to perform Bayesian causal inference in various settings, including for back-door, front-door, and instrumental variable adjustment. Finally, we instantiate CausalFM and explicitly train models to perform in-context learning in these settings. We show that CausalFM achieves competitive in-context learning performance even when compared to baselines that are specifically trained for the task at hand. In sum, our framework can be used as a general recipe to train foundation models for various causal inference settings. In contrast to the current state-of-the-art in causal inference, CausalFM offers a novel paradigm with the potential to fundamentally change how practitioners perform causal inference in medicine, economics, and other disciplines.</p></details> |  |

We introduce GIT-BO, a Gradient-Informed BO framework that couples TabPFN v2, a tabular foundation model that performs zero-shot Bayesian inference in context, with an active-subspace mechanism computed from the model's own predictive-mean gradients. This aligns exploration to an intrinsic low-dimensional subspace via a Fisher-information estimate and selects queries with a UCB acquisition, requiring no online retraining. Across 60 problem variants spanning 20 benchmarks-nine scalable synthetic families and ten real-world tasks (e.g., power systems, Rover, MOPTA08, Mazda)-up to 500 dimensions, GIT-BO delivers a stronger performance-time trade-off than state-of-the-art GP-based methods (SAASBO, TuRBO, Vanilla BO, BAxUS), ranking highest in performance and with runtime advantages that grow with dimensionality. Limitations include memory footprint and dependence on the capacity of the underlying TFM.</p></details> |  |

However, such solutions are not yet available for Tetun, making it difficult to find relevant documents for search queries in this language. To address this gap, we investigate Tetun text retrieval with a focus on the ad-hoc retrieval task. The study begins with the development of essential language resources -- including a list of stopwords, a stemmer, and a test collection -- that serve as a foundation for Tetun text retrieval. Various strategies are evaluated using document titles and content. The results show that retrieving document titles, after removing hyphens and apostrophes but without applying stemming, improves performance compared to the baseline.

Despite its potential, data preparation, pre-training strategy development, and architectural design present significant challenges in constructing this model. Therefore, we introduce UniTraj, a Universal Trajectory foundation model that aims to address these limitations through three key innovations. First, we construct WorldTrace, an unprecedented dataset of 2.45 million trajectories with billions of GPS points spanning 70 countries, providing the diverse geographic coverage essential for region-independent modeling. Second, we develop novel pre-training strategies--Adaptive Trajectory Resampling and Self-supervised Trajectory Masking--that enable robust learning from heterogeneous trajectory data with varying sampling rates and quality. Finally, we tailor a flexible model architecture to accommodate a variety of trajectory tasks, effectively capturing complex movement patterns to support broad applicability. Extensive experiments across multiple tasks and real-world datasets demonstrate that UniTraj consistently outperforms existing methods, exhibiting superior scalability, adaptability, and generalization, with WorldTrace serving as an ideal yet non-exclusive training resource.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a research paper by NeurIPS'25</p></details> |

However, there is limited understanding of why and when TTT is effective. Earlier explanations mostly focused on the observation that TTT may help when applied to out-of-distribution adaptation or used with privileged data. However, the growing scale of foundation models with most test data being in-distribution questions these explanations. We instead posit that foundation models remain globally underparameterized, with TTT providing a mechanism for specialization after generalization, focusing capacity on concepts relevant to the test task. Specifically, under the linear representation hypothesis, we propose a model in which TTT achieves a substantially smaller in-distribution test error than global training. We empirically validate our model's key assumptions by training a sparse autoencoder on ImageNet, showing that semantically related data points are explained by only a few shared concepts. Finally, we perform scaling studies across image and language tasks that confirm the practical implications of our model, identifying the regimes where specialization is most effective.</p></details> |  |
| **[DART: Differentiable Dynamic Adaptive Region Tokenizer for Vision Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10390v3)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The content-agnostic, fixed-grid tokenizers used by standard large-scale vision models like Vision Transformer (ViT) and Vision Mamba (Vim) represent a fundamental performance bottleneck, creating a trade-off between capturing fine-grained detail and suffering from redundant computation. To resolve this dilemma, we introduce DART, a fully differentiable Dynamic Adaptive Region Tokenizer. DART employs learnable region scores and quantile-based partitioning to create content-aware patches of varying sizes, intelligently allocating a higher token density to information-rich regions. The impact of this approach is profound: it unlocks a more intelligent scaling paradigm, where a DART-equipped DeiT-Small (22M parameters) matches the performance of a DeiT-Base (86M) with nearly double the inference speed by efficiently capturing high-resolution details in key regions. Furthermore, the principle of adaptive tokenization proves its generality with clear benefits in dense prediction and spatiotemporal video tasks. We argue that by resolving the tokenizer bottleneck at its source, adaptive tokenization is a key component for building the next generation of more efficient and capable foundation models for multimodal AI, robotics, and content generation.

However, existing methods, whether based on handcrafted feature engineering or standard deep learning, face two major challenges: 1) the lack of large-scale EEG-AD datasets for robust representation learning, and 2) the absence of a dedicated deep learning pipeline for subject-level detection, which is more clinically meaningful than the commonly used sample-level detection. To address these gaps, we have curated the world's largest EEG-AD corpus to date, comprising 2,255 subjects. Leveraging this unique data corpus, we propose LEAD, the first large-scale foundation model for EEG analysis in dementia. Our approach provides an innovative framework for subject-level AD detection, including: 1) a comprehensive preprocessing pipeline such as artifact removal, resampling, and filtering, and a newly proposed multi-scale segmentation strategy, 2) a subject-regularized spatio-temporal transformer trained with a novel subject-level cross-entropy loss and an indices group-shuffling algorithm, and 3) AD-guided contrastive pre-training. We pre-train on 12 datasets (3 AD-related and 9 non-AD) and fine-tune/test on 4 AD datasets. Compared with 10 baselines, LEAD consistently obtains superior subject-level detection performance under the challenging subject-independent cross-validation protocol. On the benchmark ADFTD dataset, our model achieves an impressive subject-level Sensitivity of 90.91% under the leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) setting. These results strongly validate the effectiveness of our method for real-world EEG-based AD detection. Source code: https://github.com/DL4mHealth/LEAD</p></details> |  |
| **[DINOReg: Strong Point Cloud Registration with Vision Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24370v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Point cloud registration is a fundamental task in 3D computer vision. Most existing methods rely solely on geometric information for feature extraction and matching. Recently, several studies have incorporated color information from RGB-D data into feature extraction. Although these methods achieve remarkable improvements, they have not fully exploited the abundant texture and semantic information in images, and the feature fusion is performed in an image-lossy manner, which limit their performance. In this paper, we propose DINOReg, a registration network that sufficiently utilizes both visual and geometric information to solve the point cloud registration problem. Inspired by advances in vision foundation models, we employ DINOv2 to extract informative visual features from images, and fuse visual and geometric features at the patch level. This design effectively combines the rich texture and global semantic information extracted by DINOv2 with the detailed geometric structure information captured by the geometric backbone. Additionally, a mixed positional embedding is proposed to encode positional information from both image space and point cloud space, which enhances the model's ability to perceive spatial relationships between patches. Extensive experiments on the RGBD-3DMatch and RGBD-3DLoMatch datasets demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art geometry-only and multi-modal registration methods, with a 14.2% increase in patch inlier ratio and a 15.7% increase in registration recall. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/ccjccjccj/DINOReg.</p></details> |  |

However, effective analysis is hindered by scarce annotations, severe noise, and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we take the first step towards foundation models for cryo-ET subtomograms. First, we introduce CryoEngine, a large-scale synthetic data generator that produces over 904k subtomograms from 452 particle classes for pretraining. Second, we design an Adaptive Phase Tokenization-enhanced Vision Transformer (APT-ViT), which incorporates adaptive phase tokenization as an equivariance-enhancing module that improves robustness to both geometric and semantic variations. Third, we introduce a Noise-Resilient Contrastive Learning (NRCL) strategy to stabilize representation learning under severe noise conditions. Evaluations across 24 synthetic and real datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on all three major subtomogram tasks and strong generalization to unseen datasets, advancing scalable and robust subtomogram analysis in cryo-ET.</p></details> |  |
| **[G-reasoner: Foundation Models for Unified Reasoning over Graph-structured Knowledge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24276v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning but remain limited by static and incomplete parametric knowledge. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates this by incorporating external knowledge, yet existing RAGs struggle with knowledge-intensive tasks due to fragmented information and weak modeling of knowledge structure. Graphs offer a natural way to model relationships within knowledge, but LLMs are inherently unstructured and cannot effectively reason over graph-structured data. Recent graph-enhanced RAG (GraphRAG) attempts to bridge this gap by constructing tailored graphs and enabling LLMs to reason on them. However, these methods often depend on ad-hoc graph designs, heuristic search, or costly agent pipelines, which hinder scalability and generalization. To address these challenges, we present G-reasoner, a unified framework that integrates graph and language foundation models for reasoning over diverse graph-structured knowledge. Central to our approach is QuadGraph, a standardized four-layer abstraction that unifies heterogeneous knowledge sources into a common graph representation. Building on this, we introduce a 34M-parameter graph foundation model (GFM) that jointly captures graph topology and textual semantics, and is integrated with LLMs to enhance reasoning in downstream applications. To ensure scalability and efficiency, mixed-precision training and distributed message-passing are implemented to scale GFM with more GPUs. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks show that G-reasoner consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, significantly enhances LLM reasoning, and achieves strong efficiency and cross-graph generalization.</p></details> | 22 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Graph Foundation Models: Bridging Language Model Paradigms and Graph Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24256v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The pretrain-transfer paradigm, which underpins the success of large language models (LLMs), has demonstrated the immense power of creating foundation models that learn generalizable representations from vast datasets. However, extending this paradigm to Operations Research (OR) problems on graph structures remains challenging due to the fundamental conflict between the statistical flexibility of language and the strict combinatorial constraints of graphs. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Graph Foundation Model (GFM), the first framework capable of solving all distance-based optimization problems on graph structures. By introducing the LLM-like self-supervised pre-training paradigm on the paths generated from random walks in the graph, GFM is compelled to internalize the graph's complex topological and combinatorial rules, where the connectivity of the structure itself can be treated as the supervisory signal. Unlike existing neural methods that learn complex and task-specific solving policies, our approach leverages the pre-trained GFM as a foundational model of the graph's intrinsic structure, which in turn enables a simple generative heuristic to tackle a diverse range of optimization challenges effectively. Comprehensive experiments on networks ranging from 20 to 893 nodes demonstrate that GFM achieves competitive performance against specialized solvers across a variety of distinct optimization task classes, while maintaining significantly faster inference times. Our work establishes a new paradigm of adapting the pretrain-transfer framework to graph optimization, opening the door for applying foundation model innovations to OR.</p></details> |  |

To address this gap, we present EVLF-FM, a multimodal vision-language foundation model (VLM) designed to unify broad diagnostic capability with fine-grain explainability. The development and testing of EVLF-FM encompassed over 1.3 million total samples from 23 global datasets across eleven imaging modalities related to six clinical specialties: dermatology, hepatology, ophthalmology, pathology, pulmonology, and radiology. External validation employed 8,884 independent test samples from 10 additional datasets across five imaging modalities. Technically, EVLF-FM is developed to assist with multiple disease diagnosis and visual question answering with pixel-level visual grounding and reasoning capabilities. In internal validation for disease diagnostics, EVLF-FM achieved the highest average accuracy (0.858) and F1-score (0.797), outperforming leading generalist and specialist models. In medical visual grounding, EVLF-FM also achieved stellar performance across nine modalities with average mIOU of 0.743 and Acc@0.5 of 0.837. External validations further confirmed strong zero-shot and few-shot performance, with competitive F1-scores despite a smaller model size. Through a hybrid training strategy combining supervised and visual reinforcement fine-tuning, EVLF-FM not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy but also exhibits step-by-step reasoning, aligning outputs with visual evidence. EVLF-FM is an early multi-disease VLM model with explainability and reasoning capabilities that could advance adoption of and trust in foundation models for real-world clinical deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uni-NTFM: A Unified Foundation Model for EEG Signal Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24222v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models pretrained on various and unlabeled data have demonstrated significant success in natural language and vision, but their application to electroencephalography (EEG) remains challenged due to the signal's unique properties. Existing brain foundation models that inherit architectures designed for text or images lead to three limitations in pre-training: 1) conflating time-domain waveform patterns with frequency-domain rhythmic features in a single processing stream, 2) ignoring the critical spatial topology of electrodes with different standards, and 3) reliance on the inflexible, dense network to process functionally distinct EEG patterns. To address these challenges, we introduce the Unified Neural Topological Foundation Model (Uni-NTFM), which is designed based on neuroscience principles to produce universal and interpretable representations. Uni-NTFM integrates three core innovations: 1) a decoupled architecture parallelly encodes time, frequency, and raw signal representations before performing cross-domain feature integration; 2) a topological embedding mechanism to unify electrodes from different international standards and generate structured input sequences for brain regions; and 3) a Mixture-of-Experts neural Transformer that efficiently scales model capacity by routing signal patterns to specialized subnetworks. The largest model, Uni-NTFM$_{large}$, has a record-breaking 1.9B parameters and was pretrained on over 28,000 hours of diverse EEG data via a dual-domain masked reconstruction objective. Uni-NTFM significantly outperforms existing task-specific methods and foundation models across nine distinct downstream tasks under both linear probing and fine-tuning settings, demonstrating a superior ability to learn universal representations of brain activity.</p></details> |  |

FoG is characterized by sudden episodes where walking cannot start or is interrupted, occurring exclusively during standing or walking, and never while sitting or lying down. Current FoG detection systems require extensive patient-specific training data and lack generalization, limiting clinical deployment. To address these issues, we introduce FM-FoG, a real-time foundation model-based wearable system achieving FoG detection in unseen patients without patient-specific training. Our approach combines self-supervised pretraining on diverse Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) datasets with sensor context integration. Since FoG occurs only during ambulatory activities, a lightweight CNN-LSTM activity classifier selectively activates the foundation model only during walking or standing, avoiding unnecessary computation. Evaluated on the VCU FoG-IMU dataset with 23 PD patients, FM-FoG achieves a 98.5% F1-score when tested on previously unseen patients, substantially outperforming competitive baseline methods. Deployed on a Google Pixel 8a smartphone, the system extends battery life by up to 72% while maintaining sub-20ms intervention latency. The results indicate that our FM-FoG can enable practical, energy-efficient healthcare applications that generalize across patients without individual training requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a preprint version, 12 pages, 7 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

However, existing game benchmarks fall short of practical needs: they lack evaluations of diverse LLM capabilities across various game genres, studies of agentic modules crucial for complex gameplay, and fine-tuning datasets for aligning pre-trained LLMs into gaming agents. To fill these gaps, we present Orak, a foundational benchmark designed to train and evaluate LLM agents across diverse real-world video games. Unlike existing benchmarks, Orak includes 12 popular video games spanning all major genres, enabling comprehensive studies of LLM capabilities and agentic modules essential for intricate game scenarios. To support consistent evaluation of LLMs, we introduce a plug-and-play interface based on Model Context Protocol (MCP) that enables LLMs to seamlessly connect with games and manipulate agentic modules. Additionally, we propose a fine-tuning dataset, consisting of LLM gameplay trajectories across diverse game genres. Orak offers a comprehensive evaluation framework, encompassing general game score leaderboards, LLM battle arenas, and in-depth analyses of visual input state, agentic strategies, and fine-tuning effects, establishing a foundation towards building generic gaming agents.

It is commonly the first-line imaging in neurologic emergencies given its rapidity of image acquisition, safety, cost, and ubiquity. Deep learning models may facilitate detection of a wide range of diseases. However, the scarcity of high-quality labels and annotations, particularly among less common conditions, significantly hinders the development of powerful models. To address this challenge, we introduce FM-CT: a Foundation Model for Head CT for generalizable disease detection, trained using self-supervised learning. Our approach pre-trains a deep learning model on a large, diverse dataset of 361,663 non-contrast 3D head CT scans without the need for manual annotations, enabling the model to learn robust, generalizable features. To investigate the potential of self-supervised learning in head CT, we employed both discrimination with self-distillation and masked image modeling, and we construct our model in 3D rather than at the slice level (2D) to exploit the structure of head CT scans more comprehensively and efficiently. The model's downstream classification performance is evaluated using internal and three external datasets, encompassing both in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Our results demonstrate that the self-supervised foundation model significantly improves performance on downstream diagnostic tasks compared to models trained from scratch and previous 3D CT foundation models on scarce annotated datasets. This work highlights the effectiveness of self-supervised learning in medical imaging and sets a new benchmark for head CT image analysis in 3D, enabling broader use of artificial intelligence for head CT-based diagnosis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Review Preprint</p></details> |

However, obtaining large-scale labeled datasets for 360 depth estimation remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose RPG360, a training-free robust 360 monocular depth estimation method that leverages perspective foundation models and graph optimization. Our approach converts 360 images into six-face cubemap representations, where a perspective foundation model is employed to estimate depth and surface normals. To address depth scale inconsistencies across different faces of the cubemap, we introduce a novel depth scale alignment technique using graph-based optimization, which parameterizes the predicted depth and normal maps while incorporating an additional per-face scale parameter. This optimization ensures depth scale consistency across the six-face cubemap while preserving 3D structural integrity. Furthermore, as foundation models exhibit inherent robustness in zero-shot settings, our method achieves superior performance across diverse datasets, including Matterport3D, Stanford2D3D, and 360Loc. We also demonstrate the versatility of our depth estimation approach by validating its benefits in downstream tasks such as feature matching 3.2 ~ 5.4% and Structure from Motion 0.2 ~ 9.7% in AUC@5.</p></details> |  |

While recent advances in deep learning and foundation models have led to substantial improvements in general time series forecasting, most existing approaches fail to capture the complex spatial interdependencies and uncertainty inherent in electricity markets. In this paper, we address these limitations by introducing a comprehensive and up-to-date dataset across 24 European countries (38 regions), spanning from 2022-01-01 to 2025-01-01. Building on this groundwork, we propose PriceFM, a spatiotemporal foundation model that integrates graph-based inductive biases to capture spatial interdependencies across interconnected electricity markets. The model is designed for multi-region, multi-timestep, and multi-quantile probabilistic electricity price forecasting. Extensive experiments and ablation studies confirm the model's effectiveness, consistently outperforming competitive baselines and highlighting the importance of spatial context in electricity markets.

Prevailing foundation models for TSAD predominantly rely on reconstruction-based objectives, which suffer from a fundamental objective mismatch: they struggle to identify subtle anomalies while often misinterpreting complex normal patterns, leading to high rates of false negatives and positives. To overcome these limitations, we introduce \texttt{TimeRCD}, a novel foundation model for TSAD built upon a new pre-training paradigm: Relative Context Discrepancy (RCD). Instead of learning to reconstruct inputs, \texttt{TimeRCD} is explicitly trained to identify anomalies by detecting significant discrepancies between adjacent time windows. This relational approach, implemented with a standard Transformer architecture, enables the model to capture contextual shifts indicative of anomalies that reconstruction-based methods often miss. To facilitate this paradigm, we develop a large-scale, diverse synthetic corpus with token-level anomaly labels, providing the rich supervisory signal necessary for effective pre-training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \texttt{TimeRCD} significantly outperforms existing general-purpose and anomaly-specific foundation models in zero-shot TSAD across diverse datasets. Our results validate the superiority of the RCD paradigm and establish a new, effective path toward building robust and generalizable foundation models for time series anomaly detection.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods are mostly designed for RGB imagery, leaving a significant gap in modeling synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. SAR, with its all-day, all-weather imaging capabilities, plays an irreplaceable role in remote sensing scene understanding. To address this gap, this paper proposes SAR-KnowLIP, the first universal SAR multimodal foundational model, along with reusable data and evaluation baselines. Specifically: (1) This work introduces the critical yet long-overlooked attribute of geographic information into remote sensing research, constructing SAR-GEOVL-1M (the first large-scale SAR dataset with complete geographic projection properties), covering multiple satellite platforms, 120,000 images, and 135 cities. (2) Aligned structured text is generated through a hierarchical cognitive chain-of-thought (HCoT), providing more than one million multi-dimensional semantic annotations of landforms, regional functions, target attributes, and spatial relationships. (3) We design a Self-Consistent Iterative Optimization mechanism that continuously enhances cross-modal alignment through a self-supervised closed loop of contrastive, matching, and reconstruction learning on a transferable multimodal encoder. (4) A unified evaluation benchmark is established across 11 representative downstream vision and vision-language tasks, with comparisons against 14 leading foundation models, where SAR-KnowLIP demonstrates leading performance, particularly in object counting and land-cover classification. We expect that SAR-KnowLIP's large-scale multimodal data, transferable model architecture, and comprehensive experimental benchmark will significantly advance the development of SAR multimodal baseline models.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we fine-tune Silurian AI's 1.5B-parameter WFM, Generative Forecasting Transformer (GFT), on a rich archive of Hydro-Qu\'ebec asset observations--including transmission-line weather stations, wind-farm met-mast streams, and icing sensors--to deliver hyper-local, asset-level forecasts for five grid-critical variables: surface temperature, precipitation, hub-height wind speed, wind-turbine icing risk, and rime-ice accretion on overhead conductors. Across 6-72 h lead times, the tailored model surpasses state-of-the-art NWP benchmarks, trimming temperature mean absolute error (MAE) by 15%, total-precipitation MAE by 35%, and lowering wind speed MAE by 15%. Most importantly, it attains an average precision score of 0.72 for day-ahead rime-ice detection, a capability absent from existing operational systems, which affords several hours of actionable warning for potentially catastrophic outage events. These results show that WFMs, when post-trained with small amounts of high-fidelity, can serve as a practical foundation for next-generation grid-resilience intelligence.</p></details> | 31 pages, 22 figures |

With the growing number of TSFMs, efficiently identifying the best model for downstream fine-tuning becomes increasingly challenging. In this work, we introduce TimeTic, a transferability estimation framework that recasts model selection as an in-context-learning problem: given observations on known (source) datasets, it predicts how a TSFM will perform after fine-tuning on a downstream (target) dataset. TimeTic flexibly organizes the observed model-data relationships as contextual information, allowing it to adapt seamlessly to various test-time scenarios. Leveraging the natural tabular structure formed by dataset meta-features, model characteristics, and fine-tuned performance, we employ tabular foundation models to serve as in-context learners. We further introduce a novel model characterization based on entropy evolution across model layers, capturing embedding-space distinctions and enabling TimeTic to generalize across arbitrary model sets. We establish a comprehensive benchmark for transferability estimation including 10 datasets, 10 foundation models, and 3 forecasting tasks. On this benchmark, TimeTic's estimation demonstrates strong alignment with actual fine-tuned performance for previously unseen datasets, achieving a mean rank correlation of approximately 0.6 and a 30% improvement compared to using zero-shot performance as the transferability score.</p></details> |  |

While unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) addresses this challenge for single tasks, existing multi-task UDA methods primarily rely on adversarial learning approaches that are less effective than recent self-training techniques. In this paper, we introduce FAMDA, a simple yet effective UDA framework that bridges this gap by leveraging Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) as powerful teachers. Our approach integrates Segmentation and Depth foundation models into a self-training paradigm to generate high-quality pseudo-labels for the target domain, effectively distilling their robust generalization capabilities into a single, efficient student network. Extensive experiments show that FAMDA achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on standard synthetic-to-real UDA multi-task learning (MTL) benchmarks and a challenging new day-to-night adaptation task. Our framework enables the training of highly efficient models; a lightweight variant achieves SOTA accuracy while being more than 10$\times$ smaller than foundation models, highlighting FAMDA's suitability for creating domain-adaptive and efficient models for resource-constrained robotics applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[StefaLand: An Efficient Geoscience Foundation Model That Improves Dynamic Land-Surface Predictions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17942v2)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stewarding natural resources, mitigating floods, droughts, wildfires, and landslides, and meeting growing demands require models that can predict climate-driven land-surface responses and human feedback with high accuracy. Traditional impact models, whether process-based, statistical, or machine learning, struggle with spatial generalization due to limited observations and concept drift. Recently proposed vision foundation models trained on satellite imagery demand massive compute and are ill-suited for dynamic land-surface prediction. We introduce StefaLand, a generative spatiotemporal earth foundation model centered on landscape interactions. StefaLand improves predictions on four tasks and five datasets: streamflow, soil moisture, and soil composition, compared to prior state-of-the-art. Results highlight its ability to generalize across diverse, data-scarce regions and support broad land-surface applications. The model builds on a masked autoencoder backbone that learns deep joint representations of landscape attributes, with a location-aware architecture fusing static and time-series inputs, attribute-based representations that drastically reduce compute, and residual fine-tuning adapters that enhance transfer. While inspired by prior methods, their alignment with geoscience and integration in one model enables robust performance on dynamic land-surface tasks. StefaLand can be pretrained and finetuned on academic compute yet outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and even fine-tuned vision foundation models. To our knowledge, this is the first geoscience land-surface foundation model that demonstrably improves dynamic land-surface interaction predictions and supports diverse downstream applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Constrained Decoding for Robotics Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01728v3)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in the development of robotic foundation models have led to promising end-to-end and general-purpose capabilities in robotic systems. Trained on vast datasets of simulated and real-world trajectories, these models map multimodal observations directly to action sequences for physical execution. Despite promising real-world capabilities, these models are still data-driven and, therefore, lack explicit notions of behavioral correctness. We address this gap by introducing SafeDec, a constrained decoding framework for autoregressive, robot foundation models that enforces invariant safety specifications on candidate action trajectories. Task-specific safety rules are expressed as Signal Temporal Logic (STL) formulas and are enforced at inference time with minimal overhead. Our method ensures that generated actions provably satisfy STL specifications under assumed dynamics at runtime without retraining , while remaining agnostic of the underlying policy. We evaluate SafeDec on tasks from the CHORES benchmark for state-of-the-art generalist policies (e.g., SPOC, Flare, PoliFormer) across hundreds of procedurally generated environments and show that our decoding-time interventions are useful not only for filtering unsafe actions but also for conditional action generation.

Yet, while self-supervised speech representation learning from raw waveforms has been remarkably successful, these approaches have not achieved similar feats for general-purpose audio representation learning from waveforms. Here, we propose WavJEPA, a waveform-based version of the Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture. WavJEPA leverages high-level semantic representation learning to tackle the shortcomings of representation learning at the speech unit or token level. We show that this approach substantially outperforms state-of-the-art time-domain audio foundation models across a wide variety of downstream benchmark tasks, while requiring considerably fewer computational resources. Additionally, to overcome the performance drop that time-domain models typically exhibit in noisy and reverberant real-world acoustic environments, we present WavJEPA-Nat. WavJEPA-Nat is a multi-channel extension of the WavJEPA architecture trained on simulated naturalistic scenes. We find that WavJEPA-Nat is highly robust to reverberation and noise. These results highlight the feasibility and computational efficiency of general-purpose audio representation learning from raw waveforms, showcasing the potential for low-latency, robust time-domain audio foundation models for real-world applications.</p></details> | Still under review |

Different from existing efforts, we analyze the models through a three-part evaluation: Embedding Geometry Analysis to assess representation space utilization, Metric Alignment Assessment to measure correspondence with domain-expert features, and Causal Sensitivity Testing to evaluate robustness to protocol perturbations. Using five diverse network datasets spanning controlled and real-world environments, we evaluate four state-of-the-art NFMs, revealing that they all exhibit significant anisotropy, inconsistent feature sensitivity patterns, an inability to separate the high-level context, payload dependency, and other properties. Our work identifies numerous limitations across all models and demonstrates that addressing them can significantly improve model performance (by up to +0.35 $F_1$ score without architectural changes).</p></details> |  |

However, obtaining large-scale labeled ground-truth data for event-based vision tasks remains challenging and costly. In this paper, we present ControlEvents, a diffusion-based generative model designed to synthesize high-quality event data guided by diverse control signals such as class text labels, 2D skeletons, and 3D body poses. Our key insight is to leverage the diffusion prior from foundation models, such as Stable Diffusion, enabling high-quality event data generation with minimal fine-tuning and limited labeled data. Our method streamlines the data generation process and significantly reduces the cost of producing labeled event datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by synthesizing event data for visual recognition, 2D skeleton estimation, and 3D body pose estimation. Our experiments show that the synthesized labeled event data enhances model performance in all tasks. Additionally, our approach can generate events based on unseen text labels during training, illustrating the powerful text-based generation capabilities inherited from foundation models.</p></details> |  |

While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer powerful semantic reasoning, they lack the innate understanding of spatio-temporal statistics required for generating physically plausible mobility trajectories. To address these gaps, we propose MoveFM-R, a novel framework that unlocks the full potential of mobility foundation models by leveraging language-driven semantic reasoning capabilities. It tackles two key challenges: the vocabulary mismatch between continuous geographic coordinates and discrete language tokens, and the representation gap between the latent vectors of MFMs and the semantic world of LLMs. MoveFM-R is built on three core innovations: a semantically enhanced location encoding to bridge the geography-language gap, a progressive curriculum to align the LLM's reasoning with mobility patterns, and an interactive self-reflection mechanism for conditional trajectory generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoveFM-R significantly outperforms existing MFM-based and LLM-based baselines. It also shows robust generalization in zero-shot settings and excels at generating realistic trajectories from natural language instructions. By synthesizing the statistical power of MFMs with the deep semantic understanding of LLMs, MoveFM-R pioneers a new paradigm that enables a more comprehensive, interpretable, and powerful modeling of human mobility. The implementation of MoveFM-R is available online at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MoveFM-R-CDE7/.</p></details> |  |

Existing datasets are limited in size and diversity, making it difficult to study such vulnerabilities. In this paper, we introduce SCAM, the largest and most diverse dataset of real-world typographic attack images to date, containing 1162 images across hundreds of object categories and attack words. Through extensive benchmarking of Vision-Language Models on SCAM, we demonstrate that typographic attacks significantly degrade performance, and identify that training data and model architecture influence the susceptibility to these attacks. Our findings indicate that typographic attacks remain effective against state-of-the-art Large Vision-Language Models, especially those employing vision encoders inherently vulnerable to such attacks. However, employing larger Large Language Model backbones reduces this vulnerability while simultaneously enhancing typographic understanding. Additionally, we demonstrate that synthetic attacks closely resemble real-world (handwritten) attacks, validating their use in research. Our work provides a comprehensive resource and empirical insights to facilitate future research toward robust and trustworthy multimodal AI systems. Finally, we publicly release the datasets introduced in this paper, along with the code for evaluations under www.bliss.berlin/research/scam.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2025 Workshop EVAL-FoMo-2</p></details> |

Unfortunately, existing screening techniques require expensive and intrusive medical procedures, not globally available, resulting in too many lost would-be-saved lives. We present CATCH-FM, CATch Cancer early with Healthcare Foundation Models, a cancer pre-screening methodology that identifies high-risk patients for further screening solely based on their historical medical records. With millions of electronic healthcare records (EHR), we establish the scaling law of EHR foundation models pretrained on medical code sequences, pretrain compute-optimal foundation models of up to 2.4 billion parameters, and finetune them on clinician-curated cancer risk prediction cohorts. In our retrospective evaluation comprising of thirty thousand patients, CATCH-FM achieves strong efficacy, with 50% sensitivity in predicting first cancer risks at 99% specificity cutoff, and outperforming feature-based tree models and both general and medical LLMs by up to 20% AUPRC. Despite significant demographic, healthcare system, and EHR coding differences, CATCH-FM achieves state-of-the-art pancreatic cancer risk prediction on the EHRSHOT few-shot leaderboard, outperforming EHR foundation models pretrained using on-site patient data. Our analysis demonstrates the robustness of CATCH-FM in various patient distributions, the benefits of operating in the ICD code space, and its ability to capture non-trivial cancer risk factors. Our code will be open-sourced.</p></details> |  |
| **[Task-Adaptive Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning for Weather Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22020v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While recent advances in machine learning have equipped Weather Foundation Models (WFMs) with substantial generalization capabilities across diverse downstream tasks, the escalating computational requirements associated with their expanding scale increasingly hinder practical deployment. Current Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, designed for vision or language tasks, fail to address the unique challenges of weather downstream tasks, such as variable heterogeneity, resolution diversity, and spatiotemporal coverage variations, leading to suboptimal performance when applied to WFMs. To bridge this gap, we introduce WeatherPEFT, a novel PEFT framework for WFMs incorporating two synergistic innovations. First, during the forward pass, Task-Adaptive Dynamic Prompting (TADP) dynamically injects the embedding weights within the encoder to the input tokens of the pre-trained backbone via internal and external pattern extraction, enabling context-aware feature recalibration for specific downstream tasks. Furthermore, during backpropagation, Stochastic Fisher-Guided Adaptive Selection (SFAS) not only leverages Fisher information to identify and update the most task-critical parameters, thereby preserving invariant pre-trained knowledge, but also introduces randomness to stabilize the selection. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of WeatherPEFT on three downstream tasks, where existing PEFT methods show significant gaps versus Full-Tuning, and WeatherPEFT achieves performance parity with Full-Tuning using fewer trainable parameters. The code of this work will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial Reasoning in Foundation Models: Benchmarking Object-Centric Spatial Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21922v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial understanding is a critical capability for vision foundation models. While recent advances in large vision models or vision-language models (VLMs) have expanded recognition capabilities, most benchmarks emphasize localization accuracy rather than whether models capture how objects are arranged and related within a scene. This gap is consequential; effective scene understanding requires not only identifying objects, but reasoning about their relative positions, groupings, and depth. In this paper, we present a systematic benchmark for object-centric spatial reasoning in foundation models. Using a controlled synthetic dataset, we evaluate state-of-the-art vision models (e.g., GroundingDINO, Florence-2, OWLv2) and large VLMs (e.g., InternVL, LLaVA, GPT-4o) across three tasks: spatial localization, spatial reasoning, and downstream retrieval tasks. We find a stable trade-off: detectors such as GroundingDINO and OWLv2 deliver precise boxes with limited relational reasoning, while VLMs like SmolVLM and GPT-4o provide coarse layout cues and fluent captions but struggle with fine-grained spatial context. Our study highlights the gap between localization and true spatial understanding, and pointing toward the need for spatially-aware foundation models in the community.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, NeurIPS Workshop SpaVLE</p></details> |
| **[Towards a Physics Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13805v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have revolutionized natural language processing through a ``train once, deploy anywhere'' paradigm, where a single pre-trained model adapts to countless downstream tasks without retraining. Access to a Physics Foundation Model (PFM) would be transformative -- democratizing access to high-fidelity simulations, accelerating scientific discovery, and eliminating the need for specialized solver development. Yet current physics-aware machine learning approaches remain fundamentally limited to single, narrow domains and require retraining for each new system. We present the General Physics Transformer (GPhyT), trained on 1.8 TB of diverse simulation data, that demonstrates foundation model capabilities are achievable for physics. Our key insight is that transformers can learn to infer governing dynamics from context, enabling a single model to simulate fluid-solid interactions, shock waves, thermal convection, and multi-phase dynamics without being told the underlying equations. GPhyT achieves three critical breakthroughs: (1) superior performance across multiple physics domains, outperforming specialized architectures by up to 29x, (2) zero-shot generalization to entirely unseen physical systems through in-context learning, and (3) stable long-term predictions through 50-timestep rollouts. By establishing that a single model can learn generalizable physical principles from data alone, this work opens the path toward a universal PFM that could transform computational science and engineering.</p></details> |  |
| **[QoNext: Towards Next-generation QoE for Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21889v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing evaluations of foundation models, including recent human-centric approaches, fail to capture what truly matters: user's experience during interaction. Current methods treat evaluation as a matter of output correctness alone, overlooking that user satisfaction emerges from the interplay between response quality and interaction, which limits their ability to account for the mechanisms underlying user experience. To address this gap, we introduce QoNext, the first framework that adapts Quality of Experience (QoE) principles from networking and multimedia to the assessment of foundation models. QoNext identifies experiential factors that shape user experience and incorporates them into controlled experiments, where human ratings are collected under varied configurations. From these studies we construct a QoE-oriented database and train predictive models that estimate perceived user experience from measurable system parameters. Our results demonstrate that QoNext not only enables proactive and fine-grained evaluation but also provides actionable guidance for productized services of optimizing foundation models in practice.</p></details> |  |
| **[MolSpectLLM: A Molecular Foundation Model Bridging Spectroscopy, Molecule Elucidation, and 3D Structure Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21861v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in molecular foundation models have shown impressive performance in molecular property prediction and de novo molecular design, with promising applications in areas such as drug discovery and reaction prediction. Nevertheless, most existing approaches rely exclusively on SMILES representations and overlook both experimental spectra and 3D structural information-two indispensable sources for capturing molecular behavior in real-world scenarios. This limitation reduces their effectiveness in tasks where stereochemistry, spatial conformation, and experimental validation are critical. To overcome these challenges, we propose MolSpectLLM, a molecular foundation model pretrained on Qwen2.5-7B that unifies experimental spectroscopy with molecular 3D structure. By explicitly modeling molecular spectra, MolSpectLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on spectrum-related tasks, with an average accuracy of 0.53 across NMR, IR, and MS benchmarks. MolSpectLLM also shows strong performance on the spectra analysis task, obtaining 15.5% sequence accuracy and 41.7% token accuracy on Spectra-to-SMILES, substantially outperforming large general-purpose LLMs. More importantly, MolSpectLLM not only achieves strong performance on molecular elucidation tasks, but also generates accurate 3D molecular structures directly from SMILES or spectral inputs, bridging spectral analysis, molecular elucidation, and molecular design.</p></details> |  |
| **[Expanding Reasoning Potential in Foundation Model by Learning Diverse Chains of Thought Patterns](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21124v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in large reasoning models for challenging mathematical reasoning has been driven by reinforcement learning (RL). Incorporating long chain-of-thought (CoT) data during mid-training has also been shown to substantially improve reasoning depth. However, current approaches often utilize CoT data indiscriminately, leaving open the critical question of which data types most effectively enhance model reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we define the foundation model's reasoning potential for the first time as the inverse of the number of independent attempts required to correctly answer the question, which is strongly correlated with the final model performance. We then propose utilizing diverse data enriched with high-value reasoning patterns to expand the reasoning potential. Specifically, we abstract atomic reasoning patterns from CoT sequences, characterized by commonality and inductive capabilities, and use them to construct a core reference set enriched with valuable reasoning patterns. Furthermore, we propose a dual-granularity algorithm involving chains of reasoning patterns and token entropy, efficiently selecting high-value CoT data (CoTP) from the data pool that aligns with the core set, thereby training models to master reasoning effectively. Only 10B-token CoTP data enables the 85A6B Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model to improve by 9.58% on the challenging AIME 2024 and 2025, and to raise the upper bound of downstream RL performance by 7.81%.</p></details> |  |
| **[ChaosNexus: A Foundation Model for Universal Chaotic System Forecasting with Multi-scale Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21802v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately forecasting chaotic systems, prevalent in domains such as weather prediction and fluid dynamics, remains a significant scientific challenge. The inherent sensitivity of these systems to initial conditions, coupled with a scarcity of observational data, severely constrains traditional modeling approaches. Since these models are typically trained for a specific system, they lack the generalization capacity necessary for real-world applications, which demand robust zero-shot or few-shot forecasting on novel or data-limited scenarios. To overcome this generalization barrier, we propose ChaosNexus, a foundation model pre-trained on a diverse corpus of chaotic dynamics. ChaosNexus employs a novel multi-scale architecture named ScaleFormer augmented with Mixture-of-Experts layers, to capture both universal patterns and system-specific behaviors. The model demonstrates state-of-the-art zero-shot generalization across both synthetic and real-world benchmarks. On a large-scale testbed comprising over 9,000 synthetic chaotic systems, it improves the fidelity of long-term attractor statistics by more than 40% compared to the leading baseline. This robust performance extends to real-world applications with exceptional data efficiency. For instance, in 5-day global weather forecasting, ChaosNexus achieves a competitive zero-shot mean error below 1 degree, a result that further improves with few-shot fine-tuning. Moreover, experiments on the scaling behavior of ChaosNexus provide a guiding principle for scientific foundation models: cross-system generalization stems from the diversity of training systems, rather than sheer data volume.</p></details> |  |

Thorough empirical studies on SpectrumBench with 18 cutting-edge multimodal LLMs reveal critical limitations of current approaches. We hope SpectrumLab will serve as a crucial foundation for future advancements in deep learning-driven spectroscopy.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Status of Foundation Models for SAR Imagery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21722v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work we investigate the viability of foundational AI/ML models for Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) object recognition tasks. We are inspired by the tremendous progress being made in the wider community, particularly in the natural image domain where frontier labs are training huge models on web-scale datasets with unprecedented computing budgets. It has become clear that these models, often trained with Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), will transform how we develop AI/ML solutions for object recognition tasks - they can be adapted downstream with very limited labeled data, they are more robust to many forms of distribution shift, and their features are highly transferable out-of-the-box. For these reasons and more, we are motivated to apply this technology to the SAR domain. In our experiments we first run tests with today's most powerful visual foundational models, including DINOv2, DINOv3 and PE-Core and observe their shortcomings at extracting semantically-interesting discriminative SAR target features when used off-the-shelf. We then show that Self-Supervised finetuning of publicly available SSL models with SAR data is a viable path forward by training several AFRL-DINOv2s and setting a new state-of-the-art for SAR foundation models, significantly outperforming today's best SAR-domain model SARATR-X. Our experiments further analyze the performance trade-off of using different backbones with different downstream task-adaptation recipes, and we monitor each model's ability to overcome challenges within the downstream environments (e.g., extended operating conditions and low amounts of labeled data). We hope this work will inform and inspire future SAR foundation model builders, because despite our positive results, we still have a long way to go.</p></details> |  |

Yet most existing foundation models focus primarily on classifying common daily activities such as locomotion and exercise, limiting their applicability to the broader range of tasks that rely on other signal characteristics. We present SlotFM, an accelerometer foundation model that generalizes across diverse downstream tasks. SlotFM uses Time-Frequency Slot Attention, an extension of Slot Attention that processes both time and frequency representations of the raw signals. It generates multiple small embeddings (slots), each capturing different signal components, enabling task-specific heads to focus on the most relevant parts of the data. We also introduce two loss regularizers that capture local structure and frequency patterns, which improve reconstruction of fine-grained details and helps the embeddings preserve task-relevant information. We evaluate SlotFM on 16 classification and regression downstream tasks that extend beyond standard human activity recognition. It outperforms existing self-supervised approaches on 13 of these tasks and achieves comparable results to the best performing approaches on the remaining tasks. On average, our method yields a 4.5% performance gain, demonstrating strong generalization for sensing foundation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[MORPH: Shape-agnostic PDE Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21670v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce MORPH, a shape-agnostic, autoregressive foundation model for partial differential equations (PDEs). MORPH is built on a convolutional vision transformer backbone that seamlessly handles heterogeneous spatiotemporal datasets of varying data dimensionality (1D--3D) at different resolutions, multiple fields with mixed scalar and vector components. The architecture combines (i) component-wise convolution, which jointly processes scalar and vector channels to capture local interactions, (ii) inter-field cross-attention, which models and selectively propagates information between different physical fields, (iii) axial attentions, which factorizes full spatiotemporal self-attention along individual spatial and temporal axes to reduce computational burden while retaining expressivity. We pretrain multiple model variants on a diverse collection of heterogeneous PDE datasets and evaluate transfer to a range of downstream prediction tasks. Using both full-model fine-tuning and parameter-efficient low-rank adapters (LoRA), MORPH outperforms models trained from scratch in both zero-shot and full-shot generalization. Across extensive evaluations, MORPH matches or surpasses strong baselines and recent state-of-the-art models. Collectively, these capabilities present a flexible and powerful backbone for learning from heterogeneous and multimodal nature of scientific observations, charting a path toward scalable and data-efficient scientific machine learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[GraphPFN: A Prior-Data Fitted Graph Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21489v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models pretrained on large-scale datasets have transformed such fields as natural language processing and computer vision, but their application to graph data remains limited. Recently emerged graph foundation models, such as G2T-FM, utilize tabular foundation models for graph tasks and were shown to significantly outperform prior attempts to create GFMs. However, these models primarily rely on hand-crafted graph features, limiting their ability to learn complex graph-specific patterns. In this work, we propose GraphPFN: a prior-data fitted network for node-level prediction. First, we design a prior distribution of synthetic attributed graphs. For graph structure generation, we use a novel combination of multiple stochastic block models and a preferential attachment process. We then apply graph-aware structured causal models to generate node attributes and targets. This procedure allows us to efficiently generate a wide range of realistic graph datasets. Then, we augment the tabular foundation model LimiX with attention-based graph neighborhood aggregation layers and train it on synthetic graphs sampled from our prior, allowing the model to capture graph structural dependencies not present in tabular data. On diverse real-world graph datasets with up to 50,000 nodes, GraphPFN shows strong in-context learning performance and achieves state-of-the-art results after finetuning, outperforming both G2T-FM and task-specific GNNs trained from scratch on most datasets. More broadly, our work demonstrates that pretraining on synthetic graphs from a well-designed prior distribution is an effective strategy for building graph foundation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[HEIST: A Graph Foundation Model for Spatial Transcriptomics and Proteomics Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11152v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Single-cell transcriptomics and proteomics have become a great source for data-driven insights into biology, enabling the use of advanced deep learning methods to understand cellular heterogeneity and gene expression at the single-cell level. With the advent of spatial-omics data, we have the promise of characterizing cells within their tissue context as it provides both spatial coordinates and intra-cellular transcriptional or protein counts. Proteomics offers a complementary view by directly measuring proteins, which are the primary effectors of cellular function and key therapeutic targets. However, existing models either ignore the spatial information or the complex genetic and proteomic programs within cells. Thus they cannot infer how cell internal regulation adapts to microenvironmental cues. Furthermore, these models often utilize fixed gene vocabularies, hindering their generalizability unseen genes. In this paper, we introduce HEIST, a hierarchical graph transformer foundation model for spatial transcriptomics and proteomics. HEIST models tissues as hierarchical graphs. The higher level graph is a spatial cell graph, and each cell in turn, is represented by its lower level gene co-expression network graph. HEIST achieves this by performing both intra-level and cross-level message passing to utilize the hierarchy in its embeddings and can thus generalize to novel datatypes including spatial proteomics without retraining. HEIST is pretrained on 22.3M cells from 124 tissues across 15 organs using spatially-aware contrastive and masked autoencoding objectives. Unsupervised analysis of HEIST embeddings reveals spatially informed subpopulations missed by prior models. Downstream evaluations demonstrate generalizability to proteomics data and state-of-the-art performance in clinical outcome prediction, cell type annotation, and gene imputation across multiple technologies.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we describe a new foundation model using the Prithvi-EO Vision Transformer architecture which has been pre-trained to reconstruct data from the Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI). We evaluate the model by fine-tuning on two downstream marine earth observation tasks. We first assess model performance compared to current baseline models used to quantify chlorophyll concentration. We then evaluate the FMs ability to refine remote sensing-based estimates of ocean primary production. Our results demonstrate the utility of self-trained FMs for marine monitoring, in particular for making use of small amounts of high quality labelled data and in capturing detailed spatial patterns of ocean colour whilst matching point observations. We conclude that this new generation of geospatial AI models has the potential to provide more robust, data-driven insights into ocean ecosystems and their role in global climate processes.</p></details> | 15 pages, 8 figures |

While EEG foundation models (EFMs) have emerged to address the scalability issues of task-specific models, current approaches still yield clinically uninterpretable and weakly discriminative representations, inefficiently capture global dependencies, and neglect important local neural events. We present CodeBrain, a two-stage EFM designed to fill this gap. In the first stage, we introduce the TFDual-Tokenizer, which decouples heterogeneous temporal and frequency EEG signals into discrete tokens, quadratically expanding the representation space to enhance discriminative power and offering domain-specific interpretability by suggesting potential links to neural events and spectral rhythms. In the second stage, we propose the multi-scale EEGSSM architecture, which combines structured global convolution with sliding window attention to efficiently capture both sparse long-range and local dependencies, reflecting the brain's small-world topology. Pretrained on the largest public EEG corpus, CodeBrain achieves strong generalization across 8 downstream tasks and 10 datasets under distribution shifts, supported by comprehensive ablations, scaling-law analyses, and interpretability evaluations. Both code and pretraining weights will be released in the future version.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present Decipher-MR, a 3D MRI-specific vision-language foundation model trained on a large-scale dataset comprising 200,000 MRI series from over 22,000 studies spanning diverse anatomical regions, sequences, and pathologies. Decipher-MR integrates self-supervised vision learning with report-guided text supervision to build robust, generalizable representations, enabling effective adaptation across broad applications. To enable robust and diverse clinical tasks with minimal computational overhead, Decipher-MR supports a modular design that enables tuning of lightweight, task-specific decoders attached to a frozen pretrained encoder. Following this setting, we evaluate Decipher-MR across diverse benchmarks including disease classification, demographic prediction, anatomical localization, and cross-modal retrieval, demonstrating consistent performance gains over existing foundation models and task-specific approaches. Our results establish Decipher-MR as a scalable and versatile foundation for MRI-based AI, facilitating efficient development across clinical and research domains.</p></details> |  |
