| **[STOAT: Spatial-Temporal Probabilistic Causal Inference Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09544v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial-temporal causal time series (STC-TS) involve region-specific temporal observations driven by causally relevant covariates and interconnected across geographic or network-based spaces. Existing methods often model spatial and temporal dynamics independently and overlook causality-driven probabilistic forecasting, limiting their predictive power. To address this, we propose STOAT (Spatial-Temporal Probabilistic Causal Inference Network), a novel framework for probabilistic forecasting in STC-TS. The proposed method extends a causal inference approach by incorporating a spatial relation matrix that encodes interregional dependencies (e.g. proximity or connectivity), enabling spatially informed causal effect estimation. The resulting latent series are processed by deep probabilistic models to estimate the parameters of the distributions, enabling calibrated uncertainty modeling. We further explore multiple output distributions (e.g., Gaussian, Student's-$t$, Laplace) to capture region-specific variability. Experiments on COVID-19 data across six countries demonstrate that STOAT outperforms state-of-the-art probabilistic forecasting models (DeepAR, DeepVAR, Deep State Space Model, etc.) in key metrics, particularly in regions with strong spatial dependencies. By bridging causal inference and geospatial probabilistic forecasting, STOAT offers a generalizable framework for complex spatial-temporal tasks, such as epidemic management.</p></details> |  |

In view of the required computational efficiency, recursive $O(n)$-algorithms were proposed to this end. Aiming at compact yet efficient formulations, a Lie group formulation was recently proposed, making use of body-fixed and hybrid representation of twists and wrenches. In this paper a formulation is introduced using the spatial representation. The second-order inverse dynamics algorithm is accompanied by a fourth-order forward and inverse kinematics algorithm. An advantage of all Lie group formulations is that they can be parameterized in terms of vectorial quantities that are readily available. The method is demonstrated for the 7 DOF Franka Emika Panda robot.</p></details> |  |
| **[Description and Discussion on DCASE 2025 Challenge Task 4: Spatial Semantic Segmentation of Sound Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10676v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial Semantic Segmentation of Sound Scenes (S5) aims to enhance technologies for sound event detection and separation from multi-channel input signals that mix multiple sound events with spatial information. This is a fundamental basis of immersive communication. The ultimate goal is to separate sound event signals with 6 Degrees of Freedom (6DoF) information into dry sound object signals and metadata about the object type (sound event class) and representing spatial information, including direction. However, because several existing challenge tasks already provide some of the subset functions, this task for this year focuses on detecting and separating sound events from multi-channel spatial input signals. This paper outlines the S5 task setting of the Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events (DCASE) 2025 Challenge Task 4 and the DCASE2025 Task 4 Dataset, newly recorded and curated for this task. We also report experimental results for an S5 system trained and evaluated on this dataset. The full version of this paper will be published after the challenge results are made public.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semantic-decoupled Spatial Partition Guided Point-supervised Oriented Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10601v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent remote sensing tech advancements drive imagery growth, making oriented object detection rapid development, yet hindered by labor-intensive annotation for high-density scenes. Oriented object detection with point supervision offers a cost-effective solution for densely packed scenes in remote sensing, yet existing methods suffer from inadequate sample assignment and instance confusion due to rigid rule-based designs. To address this, we propose SSP (Semantic-decoupled Spatial Partition), a unified framework that synergizes rule-driven prior injection and data-driven label purification. Specifically, SSP introduces two core innovations: 1) Pixel-level Spatial Partition-based Sample Assignment, which compactly estimates the upper and lower bounds of object scales and mines high-quality positive samples and hard negative samples through spatial partitioning of pixel maps. 2) Semantic Spatial Partition-based Box Extraction, which derives instances from spatial partitions modulated by semantic maps and reliably converts them into bounding boxes to form pseudo-labels for supervising the learning of downstream detectors. Experiments on DOTA-v1.0 and others demonstrate SSP\' s superiority: it achieves 45.78% mAP under point supervision, outperforming SOTA method PointOBB-v2 by 4.10%. Furthermore, when integrated with ORCNN and ReDet architectures, the SSP framework achieves mAP values of 47.86% and 48.50%, respectively. The code is available at https://github.com/antxinyuan/ssp.</p></details> |  |
| **[FSATFusion: Frequency-Spatial Attention Transformer for Infrared and Visible Image Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10366v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The infrared and visible images fusion (IVIF) is receiving increasing attention from both the research community and industry due to its excellent results in downstream applications. Existing deep learning approaches often utilize convolutional neural networks to extract image features. However, the inherently capacity of convolution operations to capture global context can lead to information loss, thereby restricting fusion performance. To address this limitation, we propose an end-to-end fusion network named the Frequency-Spatial Attention Transformer Fusion Network (FSATFusion). The FSATFusion contains a frequency-spatial attention Transformer (FSAT) module designed to effectively capture discriminate features from source images. This FSAT module includes a frequency-spatial attention mechanism (FSAM) capable of extracting significant features from feature maps. Additionally, we propose an improved Transformer module (ITM) to enhance the ability to extract global context information of vanilla Transformer. We conducted both qualitative and quantitative comparative experiments, demonstrating the superior fusion quality and efficiency of FSATFusion compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, our network was tested on two additional tasks without any modifications, to verify the excellent generalization capability of FSATFusion. Finally, the object detection experiment demonstrated the superiority of FSATFusion in downstream visual tasks. Our code is available at https://github.com/Lmmh058/FSATFusion.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforcing Spatial Reasoning in Vision-Language Models with Interwoven Thinking and Visual Drawing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09965v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As textual reasoning with large language models (LLMs) has advanced significantly, there has been growing interest in enhancing the multimodal reasoning capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs). However, existing methods primarily approach multimodal reasoning in a straightforward, text-centric manner, where both reasoning and answer derivation are conducted purely through text, with the only difference being the presence of multimodal input. As a result, these methods often encounter fundamental limitations in spatial reasoning tasks that demand precise geometric understanding and continuous spatial tracking-capabilities that humans achieve through mental visualization and manipulation. To address the limitations, we propose drawing to reason in space, a novel paradigm that enables LVLMs to reason through elementary drawing operations in the visual space. By equipping models with basic drawing operations, including annotating bounding boxes and drawing auxiliary lines, we empower them to express and analyze spatial relationships through direct visual manipulation, meanwhile avoiding the performance ceiling imposed by specialized perception tools in previous tool-integrated reasoning approaches. To cultivate this capability, we develop a three-stage training framework: cold-start training with synthetic data to establish basic drawing abilities, reflective rejection sampling to enhance self-reflection behaviors, and reinforcement learning to directly optimize for target rewards. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model, named VILASR, consistently outperforms existing methods across diverse spatial reasoning benchmarks, involving maze navigation, static spatial reasoning, video-based reasoning, and multi-view-based reasoning tasks, with an average improvement of 18.4%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Traveling Waves Integrate Spatial Information Through Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06034v4)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traveling waves of neural activity are widely observed in the brain, but their precise computational function remains unclear. One prominent hypothesis is that they enable the transfer and integration of spatial information across neural populations. However, few computational models have explored how traveling waves might be harnessed to perform such integrative processing. Drawing inspiration from the famous "Can one hear the shape of a drum?" problem -- which highlights how normal modes of wave dynamics encode geometric information -- we investigate whether similar principles can be leveraged in artificial neural networks. Specifically, we introduce convolutional recurrent neural networks that learn to produce traveling waves in their hidden states in response to visual stimuli, enabling spatial integration. By then treating these wave-like activation sequences as visual representations themselves, we obtain a powerful representational space that outperforms local feed-forward networks on tasks requiring global spatial context. In particular, we observe that traveling waves effectively expand the receptive field of locally connected neurons, supporting long-range encoding and communication of information. We demonstrate that models equipped with this mechanism solve visual semantic segmentation tasks demanding global integration, significantly outperforming local feed-forward models and rivaling non-local U-Net models with fewer parameters. As a first step toward traveling-wave-based communication and visual representation in artificial networks, our findings suggest wave-dynamics may provide efficiency and training stability benefits, while simultaneously offering a new framework for connecting models to biological recordings of neural activity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Nonstationary Spatial Process Models with Spatially Varying Covariance Kernels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.11873v3)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Building spatial process models that capture nonstationary behavior while delivering computationally efficient inference is challenging. Nonstationary spatially varying kernels (see, e.g., Paciorek, 2003) offer flexibility and richness, but computation is impeded by high-dimensional parameter spaces resulting from spatially varying process parameters. Matters are exacerbated if the number of locations recording measurements is massive. With limited theoretical tractability, obviating computational bottlenecks requires synergy between model construction and algorithm development. We build a class of scalable nonstationary spatial process models using spatially varying covariance kernels. We implement a Bayesian modeling framework using Hybrid Monte Carlo with nested interweaving. We conduct experiments on synthetic data sets to explore model selection and parameter identifiability, and assess inferential improvements accrued from nonstationary modeling. We illustrate strengths and pitfalls with a data set on remote sensed normalized difference vegetation index.</p></details> |  |
| **[HSENet: Hybrid Spatial Encoding Network for 3D Medical Vision-Language Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09634v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated 3D CT diagnosis empowers clinicians to make timely, evidence-based decisions by enhancing diagnostic accuracy and workflow efficiency. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit promising performance in visual-language understanding, existing methods mainly focus on 2D medical images, which fundamentally limits their ability to capture complex 3D anatomical structures. This limitation often leads to misinterpretation of subtle pathologies and causes diagnostic hallucinations. In this paper, we present Hybrid Spatial Encoding Network (HSENet), a framework that exploits enriched 3D medical visual cues by effective visual perception and projection for accurate and robust vision-language understanding. Specifically, HSENet employs dual-3D vision encoders to perceive both global volumetric contexts and fine-grained anatomical details, which are pre-trained by dual-stage alignment with diagnostic reports. Furthermore, we propose Spatial Packer, an efficient multimodal projector that condenses high-resolution 3D spatial regions into a compact set of informative visual tokens via centroid-based compression. By assigning spatial packers with dual-3D vision encoders, HSENet can seamlessly perceive and transfer hybrid visual representations to LLM's semantic space, facilitating accurate diagnostic text generation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D language-visual retrieval (39.85% of R@100, +5.96% gain), 3D medical report generation (24.01% of BLEU-4, +8.01% gain), and 3D visual question answering (73.60% of Major Class Accuracy, +1.99% gain), confirming its effectiveness. Our code is available at https://github.com/YanzhaoShi/HSENet.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 9 figures. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2410.14200 by other authors</p></details> |
| **[V2I-Calib++: A Multi-terminal Spatial Calibration Approach in Urban Intersections for Collaborative Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11008v3)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban intersections, dense with pedestrian and vehicular traffic and compounded by GPS signal obstructions from high-rise buildings, are among the most challenging areas in urban traffic systems. Traditional single-vehicle intelligence systems often perform poorly in such environments due to a lack of global traffic flow information and the ability to respond to unexpected events. Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) technology, through real-time communication between vehicles (V2V) and vehicles to infrastructure (V2I), offers a robust solution. However, practical applications still face numerous challenges. Calibration among heterogeneous vehicle and infrastructure endpoints in multi-end LiDAR systems is crucial for ensuring the accuracy and consistency of perception system data. Most existing multi-end calibration methods rely on initial calibration values provided by positioning systems, but the instability of GPS signals due to high buildings in urban canyons poses severe challenges to these methods. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel multi-end LiDAR system calibration method that does not require positioning priors to determine initial external parameters and meets real-time requirements. Our method introduces an innovative multi-end perception object association technique, utilizing a new Overall Distance metric (oDist) to measure the spatial association between perception objects, and effectively combines global consistency search algorithms with optimal transport theory. By this means, we can extract co-observed targets from object association results for further external parameter computation and optimization. Extensive comparative and ablation experiments conducted on the simulated dataset V2X-Sim and the real dataset DAIR-V2X confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of our method. The code for this method can be accessed at: https://github.com/MassimoQu/v2i-calib.</p></details> |  |
| **[Extensive Database of Spatial Ballistic Captures with Application to Lunar Trailblazer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09584v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For low-energy missions to the Moon and beyond, Ballistic Capture has proven to be a valuable technique for enabling orbital insertion while alleviating propulsion system requirements. This approach offers two key advantages. First, it extends the insertion window, allowing multiple maneuver opportunities to mitigate potential failures at the nominal insertion point. Second, it enables the required insertion maneuver to be distributed across multiple revolutions, reducing propulsion system constraints in terms of single-burn thrust. Prior research introduced the concept of Energy Transition Domain to support the creation of a comprehensive database of Ballistic Captures in the planar Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem. However, to apply these trajectories to a real mission scenario, a three-dimensional, spatial analysis and transition to an ephemeris model are necessary. This paper first extends the Energy Transition Domain framework to the spatial case, constructing an extensive database of spatial Ballistic Captures. Then, using Lunar Trailblazer as a case study, a subset of the trajectories is filtered using a mission-specific distance metric, and transitioned into an ephemeris model. Finally, interesting features of this subset are analyzed, and sample high-fidelity trajectories are selected as potential backup options for Lunar Trailblazer.</p></details> |  |
| **[BiCo-Fusion: Bidirectional Complementary LiDAR-Camera Fusion for Semantic- and Spatial-Aware 3D Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19048v3)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D object detection is an important task that has been widely applied in autonomous driving. To perform this task, a new trend is to fuse multi-modal inputs, i.e., LiDAR and camera. Under such a trend, recent methods fuse these two modalities by unifying them in the same 3D space. However, during direct fusion in a unified space, the drawbacks of both modalities (LiDAR features struggle with detailed semantic information and the camera lacks accurate 3D spatial information) are also preserved, diluting semantic and spatial awareness of the final unified representation. To address the issue, this letter proposes a novel bidirectional complementary LiDAR-camera fusion framework, called BiCo-Fusion that can achieve robust semantic- and spatial-aware 3D object detection. The key insight is to fuse LiDAR and camera features in a bidirectional complementary way to enhance the semantic awareness of the LiDAR and the 3D spatial awareness of the camera. The enhanced features from both modalities are then adaptively fused to build a semantic- and spatial-aware unified representation. Specifically, we introduce Pre-Fusion consisting of a Voxel Enhancement Module (VEM) to enhance the semantic awareness of voxel features from 2D camera features and Image Enhancement Module (IEM) to enhance the 3D spatial awareness of camera features from 3D voxel features. We then introduce Unified Fusion (U-Fusion) to adaptively fuse the enhanced features from the last stage to build a unified representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our BiCo-Fusion against the prior arts.

| **[Disentangling Spatial and Structural Drivers of Housing Prices through Bayesian Networks: A Case Study of Madrid, Barcelona, and Valencia](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09539v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding how housing prices respond to spatial accessibility, structural attributes, and typological distinctions is central to contemporary urban research and policy. In cities marked by affordability stress and market segmentation, models that offer both predictive capability and interpretive clarity are increasingly needed. This study applies discrete Bayesian networks to model residential price formation across Madrid, Barcelona, and Valencia using over 180,000 geo-referenced housing listings. The resulting probabilistic structures reveal distinct city-specific logics. Madrid exhibits amenity-driven stratification, Barcelona emphasizes typology and classification, while Valencia is shaped by spatial and structural fundamentals. By enabling joint inference, scenario simulation, and sensitivity analysis within a transparent framework, the approach advances housing analytics toward models that are not only accurate but actionable, interpretable, and aligned with the demands of equitable urban governance.</p></details> |  |
| **[MIMO: Controllable Character Video Synthesis with Spatial Decomposed Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16160v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Character video synthesis aims to produce realistic videos of animatable characters within lifelike scenes. As a fundamental problem in the computer vision and graphics community, 3D works typically require multi-view captures for per-case training, which severely limits their applicability of modeling arbitrary characters in a short time. Recent 2D methods break this limitation via pre-trained diffusion models, but they struggle for pose generality and scene interaction. To this end, we propose MIMO, a novel framework which can not only synthesize character videos with controllable attributes (i.e., character, motion and scene) provided by simple user inputs, but also simultaneously achieve advanced scalability to arbitrary characters, generality to novel 3D motions, and applicability to interactive real-world scenes in a unified framework. The core idea is to encode the 2D video to compact spatial codes, considering the inherent 3D nature of video occurrence. Concretely, we lift the 2D frame pixels into 3D using monocular depth estimators, and decompose the video clip to three spatial components (i.e., main human, underlying scene, and floating occlusion) in hierarchical layers based on the 3D depth. These components are further encoded to canonical identity code, structured motion code and full scene code, which are utilized as control signals of synthesis process. The design of spatial decomposed modeling enables flexible user control, complex motion expression, as well as 3D-aware synthesis for scene interactions. Experimental results demonstrate effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://menyifang.github.io/projects/MIMO/index.html</p></details> |
| **[Evidential Deep Learning with Spectral-Spatial Uncertainty Disentanglement for Open-Set Hyperspectral Domain Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09460v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-set domain generalization(OSDG) for hyperspectral image classification presents significant challenges due to the presence of unknown classes in target domains and the need for models to generalize across multiple unseen domains without target-specific adaptation. Existing domain adaptation methods assume access to target domain data during training and fail to address the fundamental issue of domain shift when unknown classes are present, leading to negative transfer and reduced classification performance. To address these limitations, we propose a novel open-set domain generalization framework that combines four key components: Spectrum-Invariant Frequency Disentanglement (SIFD) for domain-agnostic feature extraction, Dual-Channel Residual Network (DCRN) for robust spectral-spatial feature learning, Evidential Deep Learning (EDL) for uncertainty quantification, and Spectral-Spatial Uncertainty Disentanglement (SSUD) for reliable open-set classification. The SIFD module extracts domain-invariant spectral features in the frequency domain through attention-weighted frequency analysis and domain-agnostic regularization, while DCRN captures complementary spectral and spatial information via parallel pathways with adaptive fusion. EDL provides principled uncertainty estimation using Dirichlet distributions, enabling the SSUD module to make reliable open-set decisions through uncertainty-aware pathway weighting and adaptive rejection thresholding. Experimental results on three cross-scene hyperspectral classification tasks show that our approach achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods while requiring no access to the target domain during training. The implementation will be made available at https://github.com/amir-khb/SSUDOSDG upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial-RAG: Spatial Retrieval Augmented Generation for Real-World Geospatial Reasoning Questions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18470v5)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Answering real-world geospatial questions--such as finding restaurants along a travel route or amenities near a landmark--requires reasoning over both geographic relationships and semantic user intent. However, existing large language models (LLMs) lack spatial computing capabilities and access to up-to-date, ubiquitous real-world geospatial data, while traditional geospatial systems fall short in interpreting natural language. To bridge this gap, we introduce Spatial-RAG, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework designed for geospatial question answering. Spatial-RAG integrates structured spatial databases with LLMs via a hybrid spatial retriever that combines sparse spatial filtering and dense semantic matching. It formulates the answering process as a multi-objective optimization over spatial and semantic relevance, identifying Pareto-optimal candidates and dynamically selecting the best response based on user intent. Experiments across multiple tourism and map-based QA datasets show that Spatial-RAG significantly improves accuracy, precision, and ranking performance over strong baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learnable Spatial-Temporal Positional Encoding for Link Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08309v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate predictions rely on the expressiveness power of graph deep learning frameworks like graph neural networks and graph transformers, where a positional encoding mechanism has become much more indispensable in recent state-of-the-art works to record the canonical position information. However, the current positional encoding is limited in three aspects: (1) most positional encoding methods use pre-defined, and fixed functions, which are inadequate to adapt to the complex attributed graphs; (2) a few pioneering works proposed the learnable positional encoding but are still limited to the structural information, not considering the real-world time-evolving topological and feature information; (3) most positional encoding methods are equipped with transformers' attention mechanism to fully leverage their capabilities, where the dense or relational attention is often unaffordable on large-scale structured data. Hence, we aim to develop Learnable Spatial-Temporal Positional Encoding in an effective and efficient manner and propose a simple temporal link prediction model named L-STEP. Briefly, for L-STEP, we (1) prove the proposed positional learning scheme can preserve the graph property from the spatial-temporal spectral viewpoint, (2) verify that MLPs can fully exploit the expressiveness and reach transformers' performance on that encoding, (3) change different initial positional encoding inputs to show robustness, (4) analyze the theoretical complexity and obtain less empirical running time than SOTA, and (5) demonstrate its temporal link prediction out-performance on 13 classic datasets and with 10 algorithms in both transductive and inductive settings using 3 different sampling strategies. Also, L-STEP obtains the leading performance in the newest large-scale TGB benchmark. Our code is available at https://github.com/kthrn22/L-STEP.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICML 2025. 28 pages, 1 figures, 22 tables</p></details> |
| **[Change-Points Detection and Support Recovery for Spatially Indexed Functional Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07206v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large volumes of spatiotemporal data, characterized by high spatial and temporal variability, may experience structural changes over time. Unlike traditional change-point problems, each sequence in this context consists of function-valued curves observed at multiple spatial locations, with typically only a small subset of locations affected. This paper addresses two key issues: detecting the global change-point and identifying the spatial support set, within a unified framework tailored to spatially indexed functional data. By leveraging a weakly separable cross-covariance structure -- an extension beyond the restrictive assumption of space-time separability -- we incorporate functional principal component analysis into the change-detection methodology, while preserving common temporal features across locations. A kernel-based test statistic is further developed to integrate spatial clustering pattern into the detection process, and its local variant, combined with the estimated change-point, is employed to identify the subset of locations contributing to the mean shifts. To control the false discovery rate in multiple testing, we introduce a functional symmetrized data aggregation approach that does not rely on pointwise p-values and effectively pools spatial information. We establish the asymptotic validity of the proposed change detection and support recovery method under mild regularity conditions. The efficacy of our approach is demonstrated through simulations, with its practical usefulness illustrated in an application to China's precipitation data.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Spectral Confounder Adjustment for Spatial Regression with Multiple Exposures and Outcomes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09325v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unmeasured spatial confounding complicates exposure effect estimation in environmental health studies. This problem is exacerbated in studies with multiple health outcomes and environmental exposure variables, as the source and magnitude of confounding bias may differ across exposure/outcome pairs. We propose to mitigate the effects of spatial confounding in multivariate studies by projecting to the spectral domain to separate relationships by the spatial scale and assuming that the confounding bias dissipates at more local scales. Under this assumption and some reasonable conditions, the random effect is uncorrelated with the exposures in local scales, ensuring causal interpretation of the regression coefficients. Our model for the exposure effects is a three-way tensor over exposure, outcome, and spatial scale. We use a canonical polyadic decomposition and shrinkage priors to encourage sparsity and borrow strength across the dimensions of the tensor. We demonstrate the performance of our method in an extensive simulation study and data analysis to understand the relationship between disaster resilience and the incidence of chronic diseases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hyperspectral Image Classification via Transformer-based Spectral-Spatial Attention Decoupling and Adaptive Gating](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08324v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks face several challenges in hyperspectral image classification, including high-dimensional data, sparse distribution of ground objects, and spectral redundancy, which often lead to classification overfitting and limited generalization capability. To more effectively extract and fuse spatial context with fine spectral information in hyperspectral image (HSI) classification, this paper proposes a novel network architecture called STNet. The core advantage of STNet stems from the dual innovative design of its Spatial-Spectral Transformer module: first, the fundamental explicit decoupling of spatial and spectral attention ensures targeted capture of key information in HSI; second, two functionally distinct gating mechanisms perform intelligent regulation at both the fusion level of attention flows (adaptive attention fusion gating) and the internal level of feature transformation (GFFN). This characteristic demonstrates superior feature extraction and fusion capabilities compared to traditional convolutional neural networks, while reducing overfitting risks in small-sample and high-noise scenarios. STNet enhances model representation capability without increasing network depth or width. The proposed method demonstrates superior performance on IN, UP, and KSC datasets, outperforming mainstream hyperspectral image classification approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2504.15155, arXiv:2504.13045, arXiv:2503.23472</p></details> |
| **[Consistent Infill Estimability of the Regression Slope Between Gaussian Random Fields Under Spatial Confounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09267v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The problem of estimating the slope parameter in regression between two spatial processes under confounding by an unmeasured spatial process has received widespread attention in the recent statistical literature. Yet, a fundamental question remains unsolved: when is this slope consistently estimable under spatial confounding, with existing insights being largely empirical or estimator-specific. In this manuscript, we characterize conditions for consistent estimability of the regression slope between Gaussian random fields (GRFs). Under fixed-domain (infill) asymptotics, we give sufficient conditions for consistent estimability using a novel characterization of the regression slope as the ratio of principal irregular terms of covariances, dictating the relative local behavior of the exposure and confounder processes. When estimability holds, we provide consistent estimators of the slope using local differencing (taking discrete differences or Laplacians of the processes of suitable order). Using functional analysis results on Paley-Wiener spaces, we then provide an easy-to-verify necessary condition for consistent estimability of the slope in terms of the relative spectral tail decays of the confounder and exposure. As a by-product, we establish a novel and general spectral condition on the equivalence of measures on the paths of multivariate GRFs with component fields of varying smoothnesses, a result of independent importance. We show that for the Mat\'ern, power-exponential, generalized Cauchy, and coregionalization families, the necessary and sufficient conditions become identical, thereby providing a complete characterization of consistent estimability of the slope under spatial confounding. The results are extended to accommodate measurement error using local-averaging-and-differencing based estimators. Finite sample behavior is explored via numerical experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial Reasoning with Denoising Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21075v2)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Spatial Reasoning Models (SRMs), a framework to perform reasoning over sets of continuous variables via denoising generative models. SRMs infer continuous representations on a set of unobserved variables, given observations on observed variables. Current generative models on spatial domains, such as diffusion and flow matching models, often collapse to hallucination in case of complex distributions. To measure this, we introduce a set of benchmark tasks that test the quality of complex reasoning in generative models and can quantify hallucination. The SRM framework allows to report key findings about importance of sequentialization in generation, the associated order, as well as the sampling strategies during training. It demonstrates, for the first time, that order of generation can successfully be predicted by the denoising network itself. Using these findings, we can increase the accuracy of specific reasoning tasks from <1% to >50%.

Current large multimodal models (LMMs), however, lack of this capability of 3D spatial reasoning. This limitation stems from the scarcity of 3D training data and the bias in current model designs toward 2D data. In this paper, we systematically study the impact of 3D-informed data, architecture, and training setups, introducing SpatialLLM, a large multi-modal model with advanced 3D spatial reasoning abilities. To address data limitations, we develop two types of 3D-informed training datasets: (1) 3D-informed probing data focused on object's 3D location and orientation, and (2) 3D-informed conversation data for complex spatial relationships. Notably, we are the first to curate VQA data that incorporate 3D orientation relationships on real images. Furthermore, we systematically integrate these two types of training data with the architectural and training designs of LMMs, providing a roadmap for optimal design aimed at achieving superior 3D reasoning capabilities. Our SpatialLLM advances machines toward highly capable 3D-informed reasoning, surpassing GPT-4o performance by 8.7%. Our systematic empirical design and the resulting findings offer valuable insights for future research in this direction.

Recent studies explore data-driven approaches and achieve enhanced spatial reasoning performance by fine-tuning models on 3D-related visual question-answering data. However, these methods typically perform spatial reasoning in an implicit manner and often fail on questions that are trivial to humans, even with long chain-of-thought reasoning. In this work, we introduce SpatialReasoner, a novel large vision-language model (LVLM) that addresses 3D spatial reasoning with explicit 3D representations shared between multiple stages--3D perception, computation, and reasoning. Explicit 3D representations provide a coherent interface that supports advanced 3D spatial reasoning and improves the generalization ability to novel question types. Furthermore, by analyzing the explicit 3D representations in multi-step reasoning traces of SpatialReasoner, we study the factual errors and identify key shortcomings of current LVLMs. Results show that our SpatialReasoner achieves improved performance on a variety of spatial reasoning benchmarks, outperforming Gemini 2.0 by 9.2% on 3DSRBench, and generalizes better when evaluating on novel 3D spatial reasoning questions. Our study bridges the 3D parsing capabilities of prior visual foundation models with the powerful reasoning abilities of large language models, opening new directions for 3D spatial reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://spatial-reasoner.github.io</p></details> |

Due to the high cost of data acquisition, large-scale spatial transcriptomics data remain challenging to obtain. In this study, we develop a contrastive learning-based deep learning method to predict spatially resolved gene expression from whole-slide images. Evaluation across six different disease datasets demonstrates that, compared to existing studies, our method improves Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) in the prediction of highly expressed genes, highly variable genes, and marker genes by 6.27%, 6.11%, and 11.26% respectively. Further analysis indicates that our method preserves gene-gene correlations and applies to datasets with limited samples. Additionally, our method exhibits potential in cancer tissue localization based on biomarker expression.</p></details> | 20 pages, 7 figures |

However, existing PointMamba-based methods depend on complex token ordering and random masking, which disrupt spatial continuity and local semantic correlations. We propose ZigzagPointMamba to tackle these challenges. The core of our approach is a simple zigzag scan path that globally sequences point cloud tokens, enhancing spatial continuity by preserving the proximity of spatially adjacent point tokens. Nevertheless, random masking undermines local semantic modeling in self-supervised learning. To address this, we introduce a Semantic-Siamese Masking Strategy (SMS), which masks semantically similar tokens to facilitate reconstruction by integrating local features of original and similar tokens. This overcomes the dependence on isolated local features and enables robust global semantic modeling. Our pre-trained ZigzagPointMamba weights significantly improve downstream tasks, achieving a 1.59% mIoU gain on ShapeNetPart for part segmentation, a 0.4% higher accuracy on ModelNet40 for classification, and 0.19%, 1.22%, and 0.72% higher accuracies respectively for the classification tasks on the OBJ-BG, OBJ-ONLY, and PB-T50-RS subsets of ScanObjectNN.</p></details> |  |

We introduce HSG-12M, the first large-scale dataset of $\textbf{spatial multigraphs}-$graphs embedded in a metric space where multiple geometrically distinct trajectories between two nodes are retained as separate edges. HSG-12M contains 11.6 million static and 5.1 million dynamic $\textit{Hamiltonian spectral graphs}$ across 1401 characteristic-polynomial classes, derived from 177 TB of spectral potential data. Each graph encodes the full geometry of a 1-D crystal's energy spectrum on the complex plane, producing diverse, physics-grounded topologies that transcend conventional node-coordinate datasets. To enable future extensions, we release $\texttt{Poly2Graph}$: a high-performance, open-source pipeline that maps arbitrary 1-D crystal Hamiltonians to spectral graphs. Benchmarks with popular GNNs expose new challenges in learning from multi-edge geometry at scale. Beyond its practical utility, we show that spectral graphs serve as universal topological fingerprints of polynomials, vectors, and matrices, forging a new algebra-to-graph link. HSG-12M lays the groundwork for geometry-aware graph learning and new opportunities of data-driven scientific discovery in condensed matter physics and beyond.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, 13 figures, 3 tables.

We derive non-asymptotic bounds that lead to convergence rates, addressing both temporal and spatial dependence in the observed measurements. By accounting for dependencies across time and space, our models better reflect the complexities of real-world data, enhancing both predictive performance and theoretical robustness. We also tackle the curse of dimensionality by modeling the data on a manifold, exploring the intrinsic dimensionality of high-dimensional data. We broaden existing theoretical findings of temporal-spatial analysis by applying them to neural networks in more general contexts and demonstrate that our proof techniques are effective for models with short-range dependence. Our empirical simulations across various synthetic response functions underscore the superior performance of our method, outperforming established approaches in the existing literature. These findings provide valuable insights into the strong capabilities of dense neural networks (Dense NN) for temporal-spatial modeling across a broad range of function classes.</p></details> |  |
| **[SpaCE-10: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Multimodal Large Language Models in Compositional Spatial Intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07966v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in various multimodal tasks. To pursue higher intelligence in space, MLLMs require integrating multiple atomic spatial capabilities to handle complex and dynamic tasks. However, existing benchmarks struggle to comprehensively evaluate the spatial intelligence of common MLLMs from the atomic level to the compositional level. To fill this gap, we present SpaCE-10, a comprehensive benchmark for compositional spatial evaluations. In SpaCE-10, we define 10 atomic spatial capabilities, which are combined to form 8 compositional capabilities. Based on these definitions, we propose a novel hierarchical annotation pipeline to generate high-quality and diverse question-answer (QA) pairs. With over 150+ hours of human expert effort, we obtain over 5k QA pairs for 811 real indoor scenes in SpaCE-10, which covers various evaluation settings like point cloud input and multi-choice QA. We conduct an extensive evaluation of common MLLMs on SpaCE-10 and find that even the most advanced MLLM still lags behind humans by large margins. Through our careful study, we also draw several significant findings that benefit the MLLM community. For example, we reveal that the shortcoming of counting capability greatly limits the compositional spatial capabilities of existing MLLMs. The evaluation code and benchmark datasets are available at https://github.com/Cuzyoung/SpaCE-10.</p></details> |  |

However, addressing challenges presents both theoretical and practical difficulties. We introduce a novel multi-view probabilistic approach that aggregates view-specific slots to capture *invariant content* information while simultaneously learning disentangled global *viewpoint-level* information. Unlike prior single-view methods, our approach resolves spatial ambiguities, provides theoretical guarantees for identifiability, and requires *no viewpoint annotations*. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks and novel complex datasets validate our method's robustness and scalability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Blind Super-Resolution Network for Spatial-Specific and Spatial-Agnostic Degradations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07705v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prior methodologies have disregarded the diversities among distinct degradation types during image reconstruction, employing a uniform network model to handle multiple deteriorations. Nevertheless, we discover that prevalent degradation modalities, including sampling, blurring, and noise, can be roughly categorized into two classes. We classify the first class as spatial-agnostic dominant degradations, less affected by regional changes in image space, such as downsampling and noise degradation. The second class degradation type is intimately associated with the spatial position of the image, such as blurring, and we identify them as spatial-specific dominant degradations. We introduce a dynamic filter network integrating global and local branches to address these two degradation types. This network can greatly alleviate the practical degradation problem. Specifically, the global dynamic filtering layer can perceive the spatial-agnostic dominant degradation in different images by applying weights generated by the attention mechanism to multiple parallel standard convolution kernels, enhancing the network's representation ability. Meanwhile, the local dynamic filtering layer converts feature maps of the image into a spatially specific dynamic filtering operator, which performs spatially specific convolution operations on the image features to handle spatial-specific dominant degradations. By effectively integrating both global and local dynamic filtering operators, our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art blind super-resolution algorithms in both synthetic and real image datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON IMAGE PROCESSING</p></details> |
| **[Integrating Project Spatial Coordinates into Pavement Management Prioritization](http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.03437v2)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To date, pavement management software products and studies on optimizing the prioritization of pavement maintenance and rehabilitation (M&R) have been mainly focused on three parameters; the pre-treatment pavement condition, the rehabilitation cost, and the available budget. Yet, the role of the candidate projects' spatial characteristics in the decision-making process has not been deeply considered. Such a limitation, predominately, allows the recommended M&R projects' schedule to involve simultaneously running but spatially scattered construction sites, which are very challenging to monitor and manage. This study introduces a novel approach to integrate pavement segments' spatial coordinates into the M&R prioritization analysis. The introduced approach aims at combining the pavement segments with converged spatial coordinates to be repaired in the same timeframe without compromising the allocated budget levels or the overall target Pavement Condition Index (PCI). Such a combination would result in minimizing the routing of crews, materials and other equipment among the construction sites and would provide better collaborations and communications between the pavement maintenance teams. Proposed herein is a novel spatial clustering algorithm that automatically finds the projects within a certain budget and spatial constrains. The developed algorithm was successfully validated using 1,800 pavement maintenance projects from two real-life examples of the City of Milton, GA and the City of Tyler, TX.</p></details> |  |

Aiming at its further realization, the DCASE 2025 Challenge has recently introduced a task for spatial semantic segmentation of sound scenes (S5), which focuses on detecting and separating sound events in spatial sound scenes. In this paper, we explore methods for addressing the S5 task. Specifically, we present baseline S5 systems that combine audio tagging (AT) and label-queried source separation (LSS) models. We investigate two LSS approaches based on the ResUNet architecture: a) extracting a single source for each detected event and b) querying multiple sources concurrently. Since each separated source in S5 is identified by its sound event class label, we propose new class-aware metrics to evaluate both the sound sources and labels simultaneously. Experimental results on first-order ambisonics spatial audio demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed systems and confirm the efficacy of the metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EUSIPCO2025</p></details> |

However, existing multimodal mathematics benchmarks mainly focus on plane geometry and largely ignore solid geometry, which requires spatial reasoning and is more challenging than plane geometry. To address this critical gap, we introduce SolidGeo, the first large-scale benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the performance of MLLMs on mathematical reasoning tasks in solid geometry. SolidGeo consists of 3,113 real-world K-12 and competition-level problems, each paired with visual context and annotated with difficulty levels and fine-grained solid geometry categories. Our benchmark covers a wide range of 3D reasoning subjects such as projection, unfolding, spatial measurement, and spatial vector, offering a rigorous testbed for assessing solid geometry. Through extensive experiments, we observe that MLLMs encounter substantial challenges in solid geometry math tasks, with a considerable performance gap relative to human capabilities on SolidGeo. Moreover, we analyze the performance, inference efficiency and error patterns of various models, offering insights into the solid geometric mathematical reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. We hope SolidGeo serves as a catalyst for advancing MLLMs toward deeper geometric reasoning and spatial intelligence.</p></details> |  |

This paper integrates FA with the receive spatial modulation (RSM) scheme and proposes a novel FA-empowered RSM (FA-RSM) system. In this system, the transmitter is equipped with an FA that simultaneously activates multiple ports to transmit precoded signals. We address three key challenges in the FA-RSM system: port selection, theoretical analysis, and detection. First, for port selection, an optimal algorithm from a capacity maximization perspective are proposed, followed by two low-complexity alternatives. Second, for theoretical analysis, performance evaluation metrics are provided for port selection, which demonstrate that increasing the number of activated ports enhances system performance. Third, regarding detection, two low-complexity detectors are proposed. Simulation results confirm that the FA-RSM system significantly outperforms the conventional RSM system. The proposed low-complexity port selection algorithms facilitate minimal performance degradation. Moreover, while activating additional ports improves performance, the gain gradually saturates due to inherent spatial correlation, highlighting the importance of effective port selection in reducing system complexity and cost. Finally, both proposed detectors achieve near-optimal detection performance with low computational complexity, emphasizing the receiver-friendly nature of the FA-RSM system.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, submitted to IEEE Journal</p></details> |

However, models like YOLO struggle with occlusions, irregular structures, and background noise, reducing detection accuracy. While Spatial Transformer Networks (STNs) improve spatial invariance through learned transformations, affine mappings are insufficient for non-rigid deformations such as bent leaves and overlaps. We propose CBAM-STN-TPS-YOLO, a model integrating Thin-Plate Splines (TPS) into STNs for flexible, non-rigid spatial transformations that better align features. Performance is further enhanced by the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), which suppresses background noise and emphasizes relevant spatial and channel-wise features. On the occlusion-heavy Plant Growth and Phenotyping (PGP) dataset, our model outperforms STN-YOLO in precision, recall, and mAP. It achieves a 12% reduction in false positives, highlighting the benefits of improved spatial flexibility and attention-guided refinement. We also examine the impact of the TPS regularization parameter in balancing transformation smoothness and detection performance. This lightweight model improves spatial awareness and supports real-time edge deployment, making it ideal for smart farming applications requiring accurate and efficient monitoring.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Diffusion-Driven Temporal Super-Resolution and Spatial Consistency Enhancement Framework for 4D MRI imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04116v2)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In medical imaging, 4D MRI enables dynamic 3D visualization, yet the trade-off between spatial and temporal resolution requires prolonged scan time that can compromise temporal fidelity--especially during rapid, large-amplitude motion. Traditional approaches typically rely on registration-based interpolation to generate intermediate frames. However, these methods struggle with large deformations, resulting in misregistration, artifacts, and diminished spatial consistency. To address these challenges, we propose TSSC-Net, a novel framework that generates intermediate frames while preserving spatial consistency. To improve temporal fidelity under fast motion, our diffusion-based temporal super-resolution network generates intermediate frames using the start and end frames as key references, achieving 6x temporal super-resolution in a single inference step. Additionally, we introduce a novel tri-directional Mamba-based module that leverages long-range contextual information to effectively resolve spatial inconsistencies arising from cross-slice misalignment, thereby enhancing volumetric coherence and correcting cross-slice errors. Extensive experiments were performed on the public ACDC cardiac MRI dataset and a real-world dynamic 4D knee joint dataset. The results demonstrate that TSSC-Net can generate high-resolution dynamic MRI from fast-motion data while preserving structural fidelity and spatial consistency.</p></details> |  |

VORTEX employs MMOCR, a PyTorch-based Optical Character Recognition (OCR) toolbox, to extract telemetry variables from drone Heads Up Display (HUD) recordings, utilizing advanced image preprocessing techniques, including CLAHE enhancement and adaptive thresholding. The study optimizes spatial accuracy and computational efficiency through systematic investigation of temporal sampling rates (1s, 5s, 10s, 15s, 20s) and coordinate processing methods. Results demonstrate that the 5-second sampling rate, utilizing 4.07% of available frames, provides the optimal balance with a point retention rate of 64% and mean speed accuracy within 4.2% of the 1-second baseline while reducing computational overhead by 80.5%. Comparative analysis of coordinate processing methods reveals that while UTM Zone 33N projection and Haversine calculations provide consistently similar results (within 0.1% difference), raw WGS84 coordinates underestimate distances by 15-30% and speeds by 20-35%. Altitude measurements showed unexpected resilience to sampling rate variations, with only 2.1% variation across all intervals. This research is the first of its kind, providing quantitative benchmarks for establishing a robust framework for drone telemetry extraction and analysis using open-source tools and spatial libraries.</p></details> |  |
| **[ST-USleepNet: A Spatial-Temporal Coupling Prominence Network for Multi-Channel Sleep Staging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11884v3)** | 2025-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sleep staging is critical to assess sleep quality and diagnose disorders. Despite advancements in artificial intelligence enabling automated sleep staging, significant challenges remain: (1) Simultaneously extracting prominent temporal and spatial sleep features from multi-channel raw signals, including characteristic sleep waveforms and salient spatial brain networks. (2) Capturing the spatial-temporal coupling patterns essential for accurate sleep staging. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework named ST-USleepNet, comprising a spatial-temporal graph construction module (ST) and a U-shaped sleep network (USleepNet). The ST module converts raw signals into a spatial-temporal graph based on signal similarity, temporal, and spatial relationships to model spatial-temporal coupling patterns. The USleepNet employs a U-shaped structure for both the temporal and spatial streams, mirroring its original use in image segmentation to isolate significant targets. Applied to raw sleep signals and graph data from the ST module, USleepNet effectively segments these inputs, simultaneously extracting prominent temporal and spatial sleep features. Testing on three datasets demonstrates that ST-USleepNet outperforms existing baselines, and model visualizations confirm its efficacy in extracting prominent sleep features and temporal-spatial coupling patterns across various sleep stages.

Existing benchmarks focus predominantly on 2D spatial understanding and lack a framework to comprehensively evaluate 6D spatial reasoning across varying complexities. To address this limitation, we present Spatial457, a scalable and unbiased synthetic dataset designed with 4 key capability for spatial reasoning: multi-object recognition, 2D location, 3D location, and 3D orientation.

Building on the insight of this undecidability-lessening effect, we introduce Object-Spatial Programming (OSP), a novel programming model that extends Object-Oriented Programming by introducing topologically-aware class constructs called archetypes. OSP fundamentally inverts the traditional relationship between data and computation, enabling computation to move to data through four specialized archetypes: object classes, node classes (discrete data locations), edge classes (first-class relationships), and walker classes (mobile computational entities). By making topological relationships and traversal patterns explicit at the language level, OSP transforms previously opaque program behaviors into observable, optimizable patterns. This semantic enhancement enables runtime systems to make informed decisions about data locality, parallel execution, and distribution strategies based on explicit topology, while providing programmers with intuitive abstractions for modeling complex systems where connection topology is central to the computational model. The paradigm addresses fundamental limitations in traditional programming models when representing agent-based systems, social networks, neural networks, distributed systems, finite state machines, and other spatially-oriented computational problems, demonstrating how thoughtful abstraction design can simultaneously enhance programmer expressiveness and enable sophisticated system-level optimizations across the computing stack.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 45 pages with appendix</p></details> |

However, previous approaches remain disconnected from environment mapping, lack the spatial precision of geometric maps, or neglect additional modality information beyond vision. To address this, we propose multimodal spatial language maps as a spatial map representation that fuses pretrained multimodal features with a 3D reconstruction of the environment. We build these maps autonomously using standard exploration. We present two instances of our maps, which are visual-language maps (VLMaps) and their extension to audio-visual-language maps (AVLMaps) obtained by adding audio information. When combined with large language models (LLMs), VLMaps can (i) translate natural language commands into open-vocabulary spatial goals (e.g., "in between the sofa and TV") directly localized in the map, and (ii) be shared across different robot embodiments to generate tailored obstacle maps on demand. Building upon the capabilities above, AVLMaps extend VLMaps by introducing a unified 3D spatial representation integrating audio, visual, and language cues through the fusion of features from pretrained multimodal foundation models. This enables robots to ground multimodal goal queries (e.g., text, images, or audio snippets) to spatial locations for navigation. Additionally, the incorporation of diverse sensory inputs significantly enhances goal disambiguation in ambiguous environments. Experiments in simulation and real-world settings demonstrate that our multimodal spatial language maps enable zero-shot spatial and multimodal goal navigation and improve recall by 50% in ambiguous scenarios. These capabilities extend to mobile robots and tabletop manipulators, supporting navigation and interaction guided by visual, audio, and spatial cues.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted to International Journal of Robotics Research (IJRR). 24 pages, 18 figures.

However, the complexity of surgical scenes, characterized by high variability in different surgical activity scenarios and confused image features between targets and the background, presents challenges for surgical environment understanding. Traditional deep learning models often struggle with cross-activity interference, leading to suboptimal performance in each downstream task. To address this limitation, we explore multi-task learning, which utilizes the interrelated features between tasks to enhance overall task performance. In this paper, we propose EndoARSS, a novel multi-task learning framework specifically designed for endoscopy surgery activity recognition and semantic segmentation. Built upon the DINOv2 foundation model, our approach integrates Low-Rank Adaptation to facilitate efficient fine-tuning while incorporating Task Efficient Shared Low-Rank Adapters to mitigate gradient conflicts across diverse tasks. Additionally, we introduce the Spatially-Aware Multi-Scale Attention that enhances feature representation discrimination by enabling cross-spatial learning of global information. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of our framework, we present three novel datasets, MTLESD, MTLEndovis and MTLEndovis-Gen, tailored for endoscopic surgery scenarios with detailed annotations for both activity recognition and semantic segmentation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EndoARSS achieves remarkable performance across multiple benchmarks, significantly improving both accuracy and robustness in comparison to existing models. These results underscore the potential of EndoARSS to advance AI-driven endoscopic surgical systems, offering valuable insights for enhancing surgical safety and efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Advanced Intelligent Systems</p></details> |

The study investigates issues of accessibility to shelters during the Palisades and Eaton Fires which started in January 2025 in Southern California that led to over 180,000 displacements and the loss of 16,000 structures. Despite coordinated efforts of many organizations' emergency assistance, shelter shortages left many evacuees without safety or accessible refuge. This research aims to measure shelter accessibility during the fires' peak, evaluate whether existing shelter capacity met the demand, and identify spatial disparities in access. Results reveal severe shelter shortages and pronounced inequities in access to shelters, particularly in geographically isolated regions and mountainous areas. Our simulations of shelter placement strategies using a capacity-based algorithm and a proximity-based approach demonstrate potential improvements in both shelter accessibility and equitable access to shelters. The findings underscore the critical need for strategic shelter planning and infrastructure development to enhance disaster readiness and reduce vulnerability in regions that frequently experience wildfires.</p></details> | 35 pages, 11 figures |

To address this gap, we develop SPHERE (Spatial Perception and Hierarchical Evaluation of REasoning), a hierarchical evaluation framework supported by a new human-annotated dataset. SPHERE systematically probes models across increasing levels of complexity, from fundamental skills to multi-skill integration and high-level reasoning that combines spatial, visual, and logical understanding. Benchmark evaluation of state-of-the-art models reveals significant deficiencies, especially in reasoning about distance and proximity, understanding both egocentric and allocentric perspectives, and applying spatial logic in physical contexts. These findings expose critical blind spots in existing models and underscore the need for more advanced spatial reasoning techniques, driving the development of vision-language models that align more closely with human spatial cognition.

| **[Enhancing Situational Awareness in Underwater Robotics with Multi-modal Spatial Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06476v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) and Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs) demand robust spatial perception capabilities, including Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), to support both remote and autonomous tasks. Vision-based systems have been integral to these advancements, capturing rich color and texture at low cost while enabling semantic scene understanding. However, underwater conditions -- such as light attenuation, backscatter, and low contrast -- often degrade image quality to the point where traditional vision-based SLAM pipelines fail. Moreover, these pipelines typically rely on monocular or stereo inputs, limiting their scalability to the multi-camera configurations common on many vehicles. To address these issues, we propose to leverage multi-modal sensing that fuses data from multiple sensors-including cameras, inertial measurement units (IMUs), and acoustic devices-to enhance situational awareness and enable robust, real-time SLAM. We explore both geometric and learning-based techniques along with semantic analysis, and conduct experiments on the data collected from a work-class ROV during several field deployments in the Trondheim Fjord. Through our experimental results, we demonstrate the feasibility of real-time reliable state estimation and high-quality 3D reconstructions in visually challenging underwater conditions. We also discuss system constraints and identify open research questions, such as sensor calibration, limitations with learning-based methods, that merit further exploration to advance large-scale underwater operations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging Perception and Action: Spatially-Grounded Mid-Level Representations for Robot Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06196v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we investigate how spatially grounded auxiliary representations can provide both broad, high-level grounding as well as direct, actionable information to improve policy learning performance and generalization for dexterous tasks. We study these mid-level representations across three critical dimensions: object-centricity, pose-awareness, and depth-awareness. We use these interpretable mid-level representations to train specialist encoders via supervised learning, then feed them as inputs to a diffusion policy to solve dexterous bimanual manipulation tasks in the real world. We propose a novel mixture-of-experts policy architecture that combines multiple specialized expert models, each trained on a distinct mid-level representation, to improve policy generalization. This method achieves an average success rate that is 11% higher than a language-grounded baseline and 24 percent higher than a standard diffusion policy baseline on our evaluation tasks. Furthermore, we find that leveraging mid-level representations as supervision signals for policy actions within a weighted imitation learning algorithm improves the precision with which the policy follows these representations, yielding an additional performance increase of 10%. Our findings highlight the importance of grounding robot policies not only with broad perceptual tasks but also with more granular, actionable representations.

However, can advanced AI image generators plan scenes with similar 3D spatial awareness when creating images from text or image prompts? We present GenSpace, a novel benchmark and evaluation pipeline to comprehensively assess the spatial awareness of current image generation models. Furthermore, standard evaluations using general Vision-Language Models (VLMs) frequently fail to capture the detailed spatial errors. To handle this challenge, we propose a specialized evaluation pipeline and metric, which reconstructs 3D scene geometry using multiple visual foundation models and provides a more accurate and human-aligned metric of spatial faithfulness. Our findings show that while AI models create visually appealing images and can follow general instructions, they struggle with specific 3D details like object placement, relationships, and measurements. We summarize three core limitations in the spatial perception of current state-of-the-art image generation models: 1) Object Perspective Understanding, 2) Egocentric-Allocentric Transformation and 3) Metric Measurement Adherence, highlighting possible directions for improving spatial intelligence in image generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial Process Mining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06081v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a new framework that focuses on on-site entities in the digital twin, a pairing of the real world and digital space. Characteristics include active sensing to generate event logs, spatial and temporal partitioning of complex processes, and visualization and analysis of processes that can be scaled in space and time. As a specific example, a cell production system is composed of connected manufacturing spaces called cells in a manufacturing process. A cell is sensed by ceiling cameras to generate a Gantt chart that provides a bird's-eye view of the process according to the cycle of events that occur in the cell. This Gantt chart is easy to understand for experienced operators, but we also propose a method for finding the focus of causes of deviations from the usual process without special experience or knowledge. This method captures the characteristics of the processes occurring in a cell by using our own event node ranking algorithm, a modification of HITS (Hypertext Induced Topic Selection), which scores web pages against a complex network generated from a process model.</p></details> |  |
| **[SVD: Spatial Video Dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06037v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stereoscopic video has long been the subject of research due to its capacity to deliver immersive three-dimensional content across a wide range of applications, from virtual and augmented reality to advanced human-computer interaction. The dual-view format inherently provides binocular disparity cues that enhance depth perception and realism, making it indispensable for fields such as telepresence, 3D mapping, and robotic vision. Until recently, however, end-to-end pipelines for capturing, encoding, and viewing high-quality 3D video were neither widely accessible nor optimized for consumer-grade devices. Today's smartphones, such as the iPhone Pro, and modern Head-Mounted Displays (HMDs), like the Apple Vision Pro (AVP), offer built-in support for stereoscopic video capture, hardware-accelerated encoding, and seamless playback on devices like the Apple Vision Pro and Meta Quest 3, requiring minimal user intervention. Apple refers to this streamlined workflow as spatial video. Making the full stereoscopic video process available to everyone has made new applications possible. Despite these advances, there remains a notable absence of publicly available datasets that include the complete spatial video pipeline. In this paper, we introduce SVD, a spatial video dataset comprising 300 five-second video sequences, 150 captured using an iPhone Pro and 150 with an AVP. Additionally, 10 longer videos with a minimum duration of 2 minutes have been recorded. The SVD dataset is publicly released under an open-access license to facilitate research in codec performance evaluation, subjective and objective quality of experience (QoE) assessment, depth-based computer vision, stereoscopic video streaming, and other emerging 3D applications such as neural rendering and volumetric capture.

| **[Spatially-Embedded Lens Visualization: A Design Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23441v2)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lens visualization has been a prominent research area in the visualization community, fueled by the continuous need to mitigate visual clutter and occlusion resulting from the increase in data volume. Interactive lenses for spatial data, particularly, challenge designers to conceive design strategies to support the analysis of high-density, multifaceted data with spatial referents. Despite their relevance, there is a lack of systematic understanding regarding the various design elements that compose spatially-embedded lens visualizations. To fill in this gap, we unify these components under a common hood in the form of a design space, which we propose in this paper. Building our knowledge on top of the initial insights gained from Tominski et al.'s survey [57], we construct a design space spanning 7 dimensions through our analysis of 45 papers published in the visualization community over the past 15 years. We describe each design dimension through representative examples and examine the range of design choices available within each, discussing their benefits and pitfalls that affect lens performance and usability. In doing so, we offer a cohesive catalog of considerations for designers-both when examining existing lenses and when conceptualizing novel spatially-embedded lens visualizations. We conclude by shedding light on regions of the design space that remain largely understudied, revealing open opportunities for future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Long-Range Navigation with Spatially-Enhanced Recurrent Memory via End-to-End Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05997v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in robot navigation, especially with end-to-end learning approaches like reinforcement learning (RL), have shown remarkable efficiency and effectiveness. Yet, successful navigation still relies on two key capabilities: mapping and planning, whether explicit or implicit. Classical approaches use explicit mapping pipelines to register ego-centric observations into a coherent map frame for the planner. In contrast, end-to-end learning achieves this implicitly, often through recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that fuse current and past observations into a latent space for planning. While architectures such as LSTM and GRU capture temporal dependencies, our findings reveal a key limitation: their inability to perform effective spatial memorization. This skill is essential for transforming and integrating sequential observations from varying perspectives to build spatial representations that support downstream planning. To address this, we propose Spatially-Enhanced Recurrent Units (SRUs), a simple yet effective modification to existing RNNs, designed to enhance spatial memorization capabilities. We introduce an attention-based architecture with SRUs, enabling long-range navigation using a single forward-facing stereo camera. Regularization techniques are employed to ensure robust end-to-end recurrent training via RL. Experimental results show our approach improves long-range navigation by 23.5% compared to existing RNNs. Furthermore, with SRU memory, our method outperforms the RL baseline with explicit mapping and memory modules, achieving a 29.6% improvement in diverse environments requiring long-horizon mapping and memorization. Finally, we address the sim-to-real gap by leveraging large-scale pretraining on synthetic depth data, enabling zero-shot transfer to diverse and complex real-world environments.</p></details> | 21 pages |

To address this, we introduce MapEval, a benchmark designed to assess foundation models across three distinct tasks - textual, API-based, and visual reasoning - through 700 multiple-choice questions spanning 180 cities and 54 countries, covering spatial relationships, navigation, travel planning, and real-world map interactions. Unlike prior benchmarks that focus on simple location queries, MapEval requires models to handle long-context reasoning, API interactions, and visual map analysis, making it the most comprehensive evaluation framework for geospatial AI. On evaluation of 30 foundation models, including Claude-3.5-Sonnet, GPT-4o, and Gemini-1.5-Pro, none surpass 67% accuracy, with open-source models performing significantly worse and all models lagging over 20% behind human performance. These results expose critical gaps in spatial inference, as models struggle with distances, directions, route planning, and place-specific reasoning, highlighting the need for better geospatial AI to bridge the gap between foundation models and real-world navigation.

While combining physical knowledge with computational approaches has enabled detailed modeling of physical systems' evolution, understanding the emergence of patterns and structures remains limited. Correlations between quantities are the most reliable approach to describe relationships between different variables. However, for complex patterns, directly searching for correlations is often impractical, as complexity and spatial inhomogeneity can obscure correlations. We discovered that the key is to search for correlations in local regions and developed a new method, adjacent correlation analysis, to extract such correlations and represent them in phase space. When multiple observations are available, a useful way to study a system is to analyze distributions in phase space using the Probability Density Function (PDF). Adjacent correlation analysis evaluates vectors representing local correlations, which can be overlaid on the PDF plot to form the adjacent correlation plot. These correlation vectors often exhibit remarkably regular patterns and may lead to the discovery of new laws. The vectors we derive are equivalent to the vector field in dynamical systems on the attracting manifold. By efficiently representing spatial patterns as correlation vectors in phase space, our approach opens avenues for classification, prediction, parameter fitting, and forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code avaliable at https://github.com/gxli/Adjacent-Correlation-Analysis</p></details> |

In this work, we introduce visual trace prompting, a simple yet effective approach to facilitate VLA models' spatial-temporal awareness for action prediction by encoding state-action trajectories visually. We develop a new TraceVLA model by finetuning OpenVLA on our own collected dataset of 150K robot manipulation trajectories using visual trace prompting. Evaluations of TraceVLA across 137 configurations in SimplerEnv and 4 tasks on a physical WidowX robot demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, outperforming OpenVLA by 10% on SimplerEnv and 3.5x on real-robot tasks and exhibiting robust generalization across diverse embodiments and scenarios. To further validate the effectiveness and generality of our method, we present a compact VLA model based on 4B Phi-3-Vision, pretrained on the Open-X-Embodiment and finetuned on our dataset, rivals the 7B OpenVLA baseline while significantly improving inference efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[DualSpec: Text-to-spatial-audio Generation via Dual-Spectrogram Guided Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18952v2)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-audio (TTA), which generates audio signals from textual descriptions, has received huge attention in recent years. However, recent works focused on text to monaural audio only. As we know, spatial audio provides more immersive auditory experience than monaural audio, e.g. in virtual reality. To address this issue, we propose a text-to-spatial-audio (TTSA) generation framework named DualSpec. Specifically, it first trains variational autoencoders (VAEs) for extracting the latent acoustic representations from sound event audio. Then, given text that describes sound events and event directions, the proposed method uses the encoder of a pretrained large language model to transform the text into text features. Finally, it trains a diffusion model from the latent acoustic representations and text features for the spatial audio generation. In the inference stage, only the text description is needed to generate spatial audio. Particularly, to improve the synthesis quality and azimuth accuracy of the spatial sound events simultaneously, we propose to use two kinds of acoustic features. One is the Mel spectrograms which is good for improving the synthesis quality, and the other is the short-time Fourier transform spectrograms which is good at improving the azimuth accuracy. We provide a pipeline of constructing spatial audio dataset with text prompts, for the training of the VAEs and diffusion model. We also introduce new spatial-aware evaluation metrics to quantify the azimuth errors of the generated spatial audio recordings. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can generate spatial audio with high directional and event consistency.</p></details> |  |

Top-down information influences visual processing through attention. We designed a neural network model inspired by aspects of human visual attention. This model consists of two networks: one serves as a basic processor performing a simple task, while the other processes contextual information and guides the first network through attention to adapt to more complex tasks. After training the model and visualizing the learned attention response, we discovered that the model's emergent attention patterns corresponded to spatial and feature-based attention. This similarity between human visual attention and attention in computer vision suggests a promising direction for studying human cognition using neural network models.</p></details> | 6 pages, 9 figures |

It can be naturally divided into two subtasks: object generation and layout generation. While recent generative models have significantly advanced object-level quality and controllability, layout generation remains challenging due to limited datasets. Existing methods either overfit to these datasets or rely on predefined constraints to optimize numerical layout that sacrifice flexibility. As a result, they fail to generate scenes that are both open-vocabulary and aligned with fine-grained user instructions. We introduce DirectLayout, a framework that directly generates numerical 3D layouts from text descriptions using generalizable spatial reasoning of large language models (LLMs). DirectLayout decomposes the generation into three stages: producing a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) layout, lifting it into 3D space, and refining object placements. To enable explicit spatial reasoning and help the model grasp basic principles of object placement, we employ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Activation based on the 3D-Front dataset. Additionally, we design CoT-Grounded Generative Layout Reward to enhance generalization and spatial planning. During inference, DirectLayout addresses asset-layout mismatches via Iterative Asset-Layout Alignment through in-context learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DirectLayout achieves impressive semantic consistency, generalization and physical plausibility.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://directlayout.github.io/</p></details> |

Due to limited temporal context window sizes, these models often struggle to maintain scene consistency during revisits, leading to severe forgetting of previously generated environments. Inspired by the mechanisms of human memory, we introduce a novel framework to enhancing long-term consistency of video world models through a geometry-grounded long-term spatial memory. Our framework includes mechanisms to store and retrieve information from the long-term spatial memory and we curate custom datasets to train and evaluate world models with explicitly stored 3D memory mechanisms. Our evaluations show improved quality, consistency, and context length compared to relevant baselines, paving the way towards long-term consistent world generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://spmem.github.io/</p></details> |

As for the motion-transfer task, current methods mainly use two-stage Low-Rank Adaptations (LoRAs) finetuning to obtain better performance. However, existing adaptation-based motion transfer still suffers from motion inconsistency and tuning inefficiency when applied to large video diffusion transformers. Naive two-stage LoRA tuning struggles to maintain motion consistency between generated and input videos due to the inherent spatial-temporal coupling in the 3D attention operator. Additionally, they require time-consuming fine-tuning processes in both stages. To tackle these issues, we propose Follow-Your-Motion, an efficient two-stage video motion transfer framework that finetunes a powerful video diffusion transformer to synthesize complex motion.Specifically, we propose a spatial-temporal decoupled LoRA to decouple the attention architecture for spatial appearance and temporal motion processing. During the second training stage, we design the sparse motion sampling and adaptive RoPE to accelerate the tuning speed. To address the lack of a benchmark for this field, we introduce MotionBench, a comprehensive benchmark comprising diverse motion, including creative camera motion, single object motion, multiple object motion, and complex human motion. We show extensive evaluations on MotionBench to verify the superiority of Follow-Your-Motion.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: https://follow-your-motion.github.io/</p></details> |

FIA produces estimates of area averages and totals for plot-measured forest variables through design-based inference, assuming a fixed population and a probability sample of field plot locations. The fixed-population assumption and characteristics of the FIA sampling scheme make it difficult to estimate change in forest variables over time using design-based inference. We propose spatial-temporal models based on Gaussian processes as a flexible tool for forest inventory data, capable of inferring forest variables and change thereof over arbitrary spatial and temporal domains. It is shown to be beneficial for the covariance function governing the latent Gaussian process to account for variation at multiple scales, separating spatially local variation from ecosystem-scale variation. We demonstrate a model for forest biomass density, inferring 20 years of biomass change within two US National Forests.</p></details> |  |

Building on a spatial network calculus, a prior extension of network calculus to spatial settings, we propose a generalized framework by introducing regulations for stationary marked point processes. The regulations correspond to two key constraints: the total transmit power of all transmitters within a spatial region and the cumulative received power at a receiver, which we refer to as ball regulation and shot-noise regulation, respectively. Then we prove the equivalence of ball regulation and shot-noise regulation for stationary marked point processes and establish a universal lower bound on the performance of all network links under these constraints. This framework is applicable to diverse network scenarios, as demonstrated by the analysis of performance guarantees for networks with multi-class users. In addition, we propose an SINR-based power control scheme adapted to user traffic, which ensures differentiated quality of service (QoS) for different user classes.</p></details> | 13 pages, 8 figures |

However, current approaches either address partial embryo evaluation lacking holistic quality assessment or target clinical outcomes inevitably confounded by extra-embryonic factors, both limiting clinical utility. To bridge this gap, we propose a new task called Video-Based Embryo Grading - the first paradigm that directly utilizes full-length time-lapse monitoring (TLM) videos to predict embryologists' overall quality assessments. To support this task, we curate a real-world clinical dataset comprising over 2,500 TLM videos, each annotated with a grading label indicating the overall quality of embryos. Grounded in clinical decision-making principles, we propose a Complementary Spatial-Temporal Pattern Mining (CoSTeM) framework that conceptually replicates embryologists' evaluation process. The CoSTeM comprises two branches: (1) a morphological branch using a Mixture of Cross-Attentive Experts layer and a Temporal Selection Block to select discriminative local structural features, and (2) a morphokinetic branch employing a Temporal Transformer to model global developmental trajectories, synergistically integrating static and dynamic determinants for grading embryos. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our design. This work provides a valuable methodological framework for AI-assisted embryo selection. The dataset and source code will be publicly available upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |

Recent video generation models, such as Sora and Vidu, further highlight the power of transformers in long-range feature extraction and holistic spatiotemporal modeling. However, directly applying these models to real-world video super-resolution (VSR) is challenging, as VSR demands pixel-level precision, which can be compromised by tokenization and sequential attention mechanisms. While recent transformer-based VSR models attempt to address these issues using smaller patches and local attention, they still face limitations such as restricted receptive fields and dependence on optical flow-based alignment, which can introduce inaccuracies in real-world settings. To overcome these issues, we propose Dual Axial Spatial$\times$Temporal Transformer for Real-World Video Super-Resolution (DualX-VSR), which introduces a novel dual axial spatial$\times$temporal attention mechanism that integrates spatial and temporal information along orthogonal directions. DualX-VSR eliminates the need for motion compensation, offering a simplified structure that provides a cohesive representation of spatiotemporal information. As a result, DualX-VSR achieves high fidelity and superior performance in real-world VSR task.</p></details> | 15 pages, 9 figures |

When applied to spatially referenced data, these models must account for spatial dependence, a challenge that has yet to be thoroughly explored within the penalized DLNM framework. This gap is mainly due to the complex model structure and high computational demands, particularly when dealing with large spatio-temporal datasets. To address this, we propose a novel Bayesian DLNM-Laplacian-P-splines (DLNM-LPS) approach that incorporates spatial dependence using conditional autoregressive (CAR) priors, a method commonly applied in disease mapping. Our approach offers a flexible framework for capturing nonlinear associations while accounting for spatial dependence. It uses the Laplace approximation to approximate the conditional posterior distribution of the regression parameters, eliminating the need for Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, often used in Bayesian inference, thus improving computational efficiency. The methodology is evaluated through simulation studies and applied to analyze the relationship between temperature and mortality in London.</p></details> |  |

However, existing AI benchmarks primarily assess verbal reasoning, neglecting the complexities of non-verbal, multi-step visual simulation. We introduce STARE(Spatial Transformations and Reasoning Evaluation), a benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate multimodal large language models on tasks better solved through multi-step visual simulation. STARE features 4K tasks spanning foundational geometric transformations (2D and 3D), integrated spatial reasoning (cube net folding and tangram puzzles), and real-world spatial reasoning (perspective and temporal reasoning), reflecting practical cognitive challenges like object assembly, mechanical diagram interpretation, and everyday spatial navigation. Our evaluations show that models excel at reasoning over simpler 2D transformations, but perform close to random chance on more complex tasks like 3D cube net folding and tangram puzzles that require multi-step visual simulations. Humans achieve near-perfect accuracy but take considerable time (up to 28.9s) on complex tasks, significantly speeding up (down by 7.5 seconds on average) with intermediate visual simulations. In contrast, models exhibit inconsistent performance gains from visual simulations, improving on most tasks but declining in specific cases like tangram puzzles (GPT-4o, o1) and cube net folding (Claude-3.5, Gemini-2.0 Flash), indicating that models may not know how to effectively leverage intermediate visual information.</p></details> | <details><summary>STARE...</summary><p>STARE is available at https://github.com/STARE-bench/STARE</p></details> |

We introduce SAVVY-Bench, the first benchmark for 3D spatial reasoning in dynamic scenes with synchronized spatial audio. SAVVY-Bench is comprised of thousands of relationships involving static and moving objects, and requires fine-grained temporal grounding, consistent 3D localization, and multi-modal annotation. To tackle this challenge, we propose SAVVY, a novel training-free reasoning pipeline that consists of two stages: (i) Egocentric Spatial Tracks Estimation, which leverages AV-LLMs as well as other audio-visual methods to track the trajectories of key objects related to the query using both visual and spatial audio cues, and (ii) Dynamic Global Map Construction, which aggregates multi-modal queried object trajectories and converts them into a unified global dynamic map. Using the constructed map, a final QA answer is obtained through a coordinate transformation that aligns the global map with the queried viewpoint. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that SAVVY substantially enhances performance of state-of-the-art AV-LLMs, setting a new standard and stage for approaching dynamic 3D spatial reasoning in AV-LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website with demo videos: https://zijuncui02.github.io/SAVVY/</p></details> |

However, even with the powerful pretrained vision language models (VLMs), recent approaches are still not qualified to accurately understand the complex 3D scenes and dynamically reason about the instruction-indicated locations for interaction. To this end, we propose RoboRefer, a 3D-aware VLM that can first achieve precise spatial understanding by integrating a disentangled but dedicated depth encoder via supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Moreover, RoboRefer advances generalized multi-step spatial reasoning via reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), with metric-sensitive process reward functions tailored for spatial referring tasks. To support SFT and RFT training, we introduce RefSpatial, a large-scale dataset of 20M QA pairs (2x prior), covering 31 spatial relations (vs. 15 prior) and supporting complex reasoning processes (up to 5 steps). In addition, we introduce RefSpatial-Bench, a challenging benchmark filling the gap in evaluating spatial referring with multi-step reasoning. Experiments show that SFT-trained RoboRefer achieves state-of-the-art spatial understanding, with an average success rate of 89.6%.

| **[Struct2D: A Perception-Guided Framework for Spatial Reasoning in Large Multimodal Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04220v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unlocking spatial reasoning in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) is crucial for enabling intelligent interaction with 3D environments. While prior efforts often rely on explicit 3D inputs or specialized model architectures, we ask: can LMMs reason about 3D space using only structured 2D representations derived from perception? We introduce Struct2D, a perception-guided prompting framework that combines bird's-eye-view (BEV) images with object marks and object-centric metadata, optionally incorporating egocentric keyframes when needed. Using Struct2D, we conduct an in-depth zero-shot analysis of closed-source LMMs (e.g., GPT-o3) and find that they exhibit surprisingly strong spatial reasoning abilities when provided with structured 2D inputs, effectively handling tasks such as relative direction estimation and route planning. Building on these insights, we construct Struct2D-Set, a large-scale instruction tuning dataset with 200K fine-grained QA pairs across eight spatial reasoning categories, generated automatically from 3D indoor scenes. We fine-tune an open-source LMM (Qwen2.5VL) on Struct2D-Set, achieving competitive performance on multiple benchmarks, including 3D question answering, dense captioning, and object grounding. Our approach demonstrates that structured 2D inputs can effectively bridge perception and language reasoning in LMMs-without requiring explicit 3D representations as input. We will release both our code and dataset to support future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/neu-vi/struct2d</p></details> |
| **[Evaluating Large Language Model Capabilities in Assessing Spatial Econometrics Research](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06377v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates Large Language Models (LLMs) ability to assess the economic soundness and theoretical consistency of empirical findings in spatial econometrics. We created original and deliberately altered "counterfactual" summaries from 28 published papers (2005-2024), which were evaluated by a diverse set of LLMs. The LLMs provided qualitative assessments and structured binary classifications on variable choice, coefficient plausibility, and publication suitability. The results indicate that while LLMs can expertly assess the coherence of variable choices (with top models like GPT-4o achieving an overall F1 score of 0.87), their performance varies significantly when evaluating deeper aspects such as coefficient plausibility and overall publication suitability. The results further revealed that the choice of LLM, the specific characteristics of the paper and the interaction between these two factors significantly influence the accuracy of the assessment, particularly for nuanced judgments. These findings highlight LLMs' current strengths in assisting with initial, more surface-level checks and their limitations in performing comprehensive, deep economic reasoning, suggesting a potential assistive role in peer review that still necessitates robust human oversight.</p></details> |  |

The dataset contains meteorological forcings, as well as ancillary information on soil, rock, land cover, and orography. The data is harmonized to a regular 9km times 9km grid and contains daily values that span from October 1981 to September 2011.

| **[SEM: Enhancing Spatial Understanding for Robust Robot Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16196v2)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A key challenge in robot manipulation lies in developing policy models with strong spatial understanding, the ability to reason about 3D geometry, object relations, and robot embodiment. Existing methods often fall short: 3D point cloud models lack semantic abstraction, while 2D image encoders struggle with spatial reasoning. To address this, we propose SEM (Spatial Enhanced Manipulation model), a novel diffusion-based policy framework that explicitly enhances spatial understanding from two complementary perspectives. A spatial enhancer augments visual representations with 3D geometric context, while a robot state encoder captures embodiment-aware structure through graphbased modeling of joint dependencies. By integrating these modules, SEM significantly improves spatial understanding, leading to robust and generalizable manipulation across diverse tasks that outperform existing baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial Understanding from Videos: Structured Prompts Meet Simulation Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03642v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual-spatial understanding, the ability to infer object relationships and layouts from visual input, is fundamental to downstream tasks such as robotic navigation and embodied interaction. However, existing methods face spatial uncertainty and data scarcity, limiting the 3D spatial reasoning capability of pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs). To address these challenges, we present a unified framework for enhancing 3D spatial reasoning in pre-trained VLMs without modifying their architecture. This framework combines SpatialMind, a structured prompting strategy that decomposes complex scenes and questions into interpretable reasoning steps, with ScanForgeQA, a scalable question-answering dataset built from diverse 3D simulation scenes through an automated construction process designed for fine-tuning. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate the individual and combined effectiveness of our prompting and fine-tuning strategies, and yield insights that may inspire future research on visual-spatial understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimizing FPGA and Wafer Test Coverage with Spatial Sampling and Machine Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03556v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In semiconductor manufacturing, testing costs remain significantly high, especially during wafer and FPGA testing. To reduce the number of required tests while maintaining predictive accuracy, this study investigates three baseline sampling strategies: Random Sampling, Stratified Sampling, and k-means Clustering Sampling. To further enhance these methods, this study proposes a novel algorithm that improves the sampling quality of each approach. This research is conducted using real industrial production data from wafer-level tests and silicon measurements from various FPGAs. This study introduces two hybrid strategies: Stratified with Short Distance Elimination (S-SDE) and k-means with Short Distance Elimination (K-SDE). Their performance is evaluated within the framework of Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) for predicting wafer and FPGA test data. At the core of our proposed approach is the Short Distance Elimination (SDE) algorithm, which excludes spatially proximate candidate points during sampling, thereby ensuring a more uniform distribution of training data across the physical domain. A parameter sweep was conducted over the (alpha, beta) thresholds, where alpha and beta are in the range {0, 1, 2, 3, 4} and not both zero, to identify the optimal combination that minimizes RMSD. Experimental results on a randomly selected wafer file reveal that (alpha, beta) equal (2, 2) yields the lowest RMSD. Accordingly, all subsequent experiments adopt this parameter configuration. The results demonstrate that the proposed SDE-based strategies enhance predictive accuracy: K-SDE improves upon k-means sampling by 16.26 percent (wafer) and 13.07 percent (FPGA), while S-SDE improves upon stratified sampling by 16.49 percent (wafer) and 8.84 percent (FPGA).</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Fourier Neural Operators with Local Spatial Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17797v2)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Partial Differential Equation (PDE) problems often exhibit strong local spatial structures, and effectively capturing these structures is critical for approximating their solutions. Recently, the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) has emerged as an efficient approach for solving these PDE problems. By using parametrization in the frequency domain, FNOs can efficiently capture global patterns. However, this approach inherently overlooks the critical role of local spatial features, as frequency-domain parameterized convolutions primarily emphasize global interactions without encoding comprehensive localized spatial dependencies. Although several studies have attempted to address this limitation, their extracted Local Spatial Features (LSFs) remain insufficient, and computational efficiency is often compromised. To address this limitation, we introduce a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based feature pre-extractor to capture LSFs directly from input data, resulting in a hybrid architecture termed \textit{Conv-FNO}. Furthermore, we introduce two novel resizing schemes to make our Conv-FNO resolution invariant. In this work, we focus on demonstrating the effectiveness of incorporating LSFs into FNOs by conducting both a theoretical analysis and extensive numerical experiments. Our findings show that this simple yet impactful modification enhances the representational capacity of FNOs and significantly improves performance on challenging PDE benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[DistRAG: Towards Distance-Based Spatial Reasoning in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03424v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many real world tasks where Large Language Models (LLMs) can be used require spatial reasoning, like Point of Interest (POI) recommendation and itinerary planning. However, on their own LLMs lack reliable spatial reasoning capabilities, especially about distances. To address this problem, we develop a novel approach, DistRAG, that enables an LLM to retrieve relevant spatial information not explicitly learned during training. Our method encodes the geodesic distances between cities and towns in a graph and retrieves a context subgraph relevant to the question. Using this technique, our method enables an LLM to answer distance-based reasoning questions that it otherwise cannot answer. Given the vast array of possible places an LLM could be asked about, DistRAG offers a flexible first step towards providing a rudimentary `world model' to complement the linguistic knowledge held in LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[ROC Curves for Spatial Point Patterns and Presence-Absence Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03414v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves have recently been used to evaluate the performance of models for spatial presence-absence or presence-only data. Applications include species distribution modelling and mineral prospectivity analysis. We clarify the interpretation of the ROC curve in this context. Contrary to statements in the literature, ROC does not measure goodness-of-fit of a spatial model, and its interpretation as a measure of predictive ability is weak; it is a measure of ranking ability, insensitive to the precise form of the model. To gain insight we draw connections between ROC and existing statistical techniques for spatial point pattern data. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) is related to hypothesis tests of the null hypothesis that the explanatory variables have no effect. The shape of the ROC curve has a diagnostic interpretation. This suggests several new techniques, which extend the scope of application of ROC curves for spatial data, to support variable selection and model selection, analysis of segregation between different types of points, adjustment for a baseline, and analysis of spatial case-control data. The new techniques are illustrated with several real example datasets. Open source R code implementing the techniques is available in the development version of our package spatstat [Baddeley and Turner, 2005, Baddeley et al., 2015] and will be included in the next public release.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Foundation Model for Spatial Proteomics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03373v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have begun to transform image analysis by acting as pretrained generalist backbones that can be adapted to many tasks even when post-training data are limited, yet their impact on spatial proteomics, imaging that maps proteins at single-cell resolution, remains limited. Here, we introduce KRONOS, a foundation model built for spatial proteomics. KRONOS was trained in a self-supervised manner on over 47 million image patches covering 175 protein markers, 16 tissue types, and 8 fluorescence-based imaging platforms. We introduce key architectural adaptations to address the high-dimensional, multi-channel, and heterogeneous nature of multiplex imaging. We demonstrate that KRONOS learns biologically meaningful representations across multiple scales, ranging from cellular and microenvironment to tissue levels, enabling it to address diverse downstream tasks, including cell phenotyping, region classification, and patient stratification. Evaluated across 11 independent cohorts, KRONOS achieves state-of-the-art performance across cell phenotyping, treatment response prediction, and retrieval tasks, and is highly data-efficient. KRONOS also introduces the paradigm of segmentation-free patch-level processing for efficient and scalable spatial proteomics analysis, allowing cross-institutional comparisons, and as an image reverse search engine for spatial patterns. Together, these results position KRONOS as a flexible and scalable tool for spatial proteomics. The model is publicly accessible at https://github.com/mahmoodlab/KRONOS.</p></details> |  |
| **[Urban Visibility Hotspots: Quantifying Building Vertex Visibility from Connected Vehicle Trajectories using Spatial Indexing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03365v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective placement of Out-of-Home advertising and street furniture requires accurate identification of locations offering maximum visual exposure to target audiences, particularly vehicular traffic. Traditional site selection methods often rely on static traffic counts or subjective assessments. This research introduces a data-driven methodology to objectively quantify location visibility by analyzing large-scale connected vehicle trajectory data (sourced from Compass IoT) within urban environments. We model the dynamic driver field-of-view using a forward-projected visibility area for each vehicle position derived from interpolated trajectories. By integrating this with building vertex locations extracted from OpenStreetMap, we quantify the cumulative visual exposure, or ``visibility count'', for thousands of potential points of interest near roadways. The analysis reveals that visibility is highly concentrated, identifying specific ``visual hotspots'' that receive disproportionately high exposure compared to average locations. The core technical contribution involves the construction of a BallTree spatial index over building vertices. This enables highly efficient (O(logN) complexity) radius queries to determine which vertices fall within the viewing circles of millions of trajectory points across numerous trips, significantly outperforming brute-force geometric checks. Analysis reveals two key findings: 1) Visibility is highly concentrated, identifying distinct 'visual hotspots' receiving disproportionately high exposure compared to average locations. 2) The aggregated visibility counts across vertices conform to a Log-Normal distribution.</p></details> |  |

Near-miss events captured through vehicle telematics and transmitted in real-time by connected vehicles reveal a unique potential of prevention due to their high frequency nature and driving engagement on the road. There is currently a lack of understanding of the high potential of near-miss data in real-time to proactively detect potential risky driving areas, in advance of a fatal collision. This paper aims to spatially identify clusters of reported accidents (A) versus high-severity near-misses (High-G) within an urban environment (Sydney, Australia) and showcase how the presence of near-misses can significantly lead to future crashes in identified risky hotspots. First, by utilizing a 400m grid framework, we identify significant crash hotspots using the Getis-Ord $G_i^*$ statistical approach. Second, we employ a Bivariate Local Moran's I (LISA) approach to assess and map the spatial concordance and discordance between official crash counts (A) and High-G counts from nearmiss data (High-G). Third, we classify areas based on their joint spatial patterns into: a) High-High (HH) as the most riskiest areas in both historical logs and nearmiss events, High-Low (HL) for high crash logs but low nearmiss records, c) Low-High (LH) for low past crash records but high nearmiss events, and d) Low-Low (LL) for safe areas. Finally, we run a feature importance ranking on all area patterns by using a contextual Point of Interest (POI) count features and we showcase which factors are the most critical to the occurrence of crash blackspots.</p></details> |  |

Studying this critical stage of the developing human brain, therefore, requires accurate brain models-referred to as atlases-of high spatial and temporal resolution. To meet these demands, established traditional atlases and recently proposed deep learning-based methods rely on large and comprehensive datasets. This poses a major challenge for studying brains in the presence of pathologies for which data remains scarce. We address this limitation with CINeMA (Conditional Implicit Neural Multi-Modal Atlas), a novel framework for creating high-resolution, spatio-temporal, multimodal brain atlases, suitable for low-data settings. Unlike established methods, CINeMA operates in latent space, avoiding compute-intensive image registration and reducing atlas construction times from days to minutes. Furthermore, it enables flexible conditioning on anatomical features including GA, birth age, and pathologies like ventriculomegaly (VM) and agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC). CINeMA supports downstream tasks such as tissue segmentation and age prediction whereas its generative properties enable synthetic data creation and anatomically informed data augmentation. Surpassing state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, efficiency, and versatility, CINeMA represents a powerful tool for advancing brain research. We release the code and atlases at https://github.com/m-dannecker/CINeMA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work currently under revision for IEEE TMI</p></details> |

Genesis employs a two-stage architecture that integrates a DiT-based video diffusion model with 3D-VAE encoding, and a BEV-aware LiDAR generator with NeRF-based rendering and adaptive sampling. Both modalities are directly coupled through a shared latent space, enabling coherent evolution across visual and geometric domains. To guide the generation with structured semantics, we introduce DataCrafter, a captioning module built on vision-language models that provides scene-level and instance-level supervision. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that Genesis achieves state-of-the-art performance across video and LiDAR metrics (FVD 16.95, FID 4.24, Chamfer 0.611), and benefits downstream tasks including segmentation and 3D detection, validating the semantic fidelity and practical utility of the generated data.</p></details> |  |
| **[STAMImputer: Spatio-Temporal Attention MoE for Traffic Data Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08054v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic data imputation is fundamentally important to support various applications in intelligent transportation systems such as traffic flow prediction. However, existing time-to-space sequential methods often fail to effectively extract features in block-wise missing data scenarios. Meanwhile, the static graph structure for spatial feature propagation significantly constrains the models flexibility in handling the distribution shift issue for the nonstationary traffic data. To address these issues, this paper proposes a SpatioTemporal Attention Mixture of experts network named STAMImputer for traffic data imputation. Specifically, we introduce a Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework to capture latent spatio-temporal features and their influence weights, effectively imputing block missing. A novel Low-rank guided Sampling Graph ATtention (LrSGAT) mechanism is designed to dynamically balance the local and global correlations across road networks. The sampled attention vectors are utilized to generate dynamic graphs that capture real-time spatial correlations. Extensive experiments are conducted on four traffic datasets for evaluation. The result shows STAMImputer achieves significantly performance improvement compared with existing SOTA approaches. Our codes are available at https://github.com/RingBDStack/STAMImupter.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables.

Current memory systems often grapple with fundamental limitations in structural flexibility, temporal awareness, and the ability to synthesize higher-level insights from raw interaction data. This paper introduces Cognitive Weave, a novel memory framework centered around a multi-layered spatio-temporal resonance graph (STRG). This graph manages information as semantically rich insight particles (IPs), which are dynamically enriched with resonance keys, signifiers, and situational imprints via a dedicated semantic oracle interface (SOI). These IPs are interconnected through typed relational strands, forming an evolving knowledge tapestry. A key component of Cognitive Weave is the cognitive refinement process, an autonomous mechanism that includes the synthesis of insight aggregates (IAs) condensed, higher-level knowledge structures derived from identified clusters of related IPs. We present comprehensive experimental results demonstrating Cognitive Weave's marked enhancement over existing approaches in long-horizon planning tasks, evolving question-answering scenarios, and multi-session dialogue coherence. The system achieves a notable 34% average improvement in task completion rates and a 42% reduction in mean query latency when compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, this paper explores the ethical considerations inherent in such advanced memory systems, discusses the implications for long-term memory in LLMs, and outlines promising future research trajectories.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal State Space Model For Efficient Event-Based Optical Flow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07878v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event cameras unlock new frontiers that were previously unthinkable with standard frame-based cameras. One notable example is low-latency motion estimation (optical flow), which is critical for many real-time applications. In such applications, the computational efficiency of algorithms is paramount. Although recent deep learning paradigms such as CNN, RNN, or ViT have shown remarkable performance, they often lack the desired computational efficiency. Conversely, asynchronous event-based methods including SNNs and GNNs are computationally efficient; however, these approaches fail to capture sufficient spatio-temporal information, a powerful feature required to achieve better performance for optical flow estimation. In this work, we introduce Spatio-Temporal State Space Model (STSSM) module along with a novel network architecture to develop an extremely efficient solution with competitive performance. Our STSSM module leverages state-space models to effectively capture spatio-temporal correlations in event data, offering higher performance with lower complexity compared to ViT, CNN-based architectures in similar settings. Our model achieves 4.5x faster inference and 8x lower computations compared to TMA and 2x lower computations compared to EV-FlowNet with competitive performance on the DSEC benchmark. Our code will be available at https://github.com/AhmedHumais/E-STMFlow</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce ST-GraphNet, a spatio-temporal graph neural network framework designed to model and predict AV crash severity by using both fine-grained and region-aggregated spatial graphs. Using a balanced dataset of 2,352 real-world AV-related crash reports from Texas (2024), including geospatial coordinates, crash timestamps, SAE automation levels, and narrative descriptions, we construct two complementary graph representations: (1) a fine-grained graph with individual crash events as nodes, where edges are defined via spatio-temporal proximity; and (2) a coarse-grained graph where crashes are aggregated into Hexagonal Hierarchical Spatial Indexing (H3)-based spatial cells, connected through hexagonal adjacency. Each node in the graph is enriched with multimodal data, including semantic, spatial, and temporal attributes, including textual embeddings from crash narratives using a pretrained Sentence-BERT model. We evaluate various graph neural network (GNN) architectures, such as Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), Graph Attention Networks (GAT), and Dynamic Spatio-Temporal GCN (DSTGCN), to classify crash severity and predict high-risk regions. Our proposed ST-GraphNet, which utilizes a DSTGCN backbone on the coarse-grained H3 graph, achieves a test accuracy of 97.74\%, substantially outperforming the best fine-grained model (64.7\% test accuracy). These findings highlight the effectiveness of spatial aggregation, dynamic message passing, and multi-modal feature integration in capturing the complex spatio-temporal patterns underlying AV crash severity.</p></details> |  |
| **[STSBench: A Spatio-temporal Scenario Benchmark for Multi-modal Large Language Models in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06218v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce STSBench, a scenario-based framework to benchmark the holistic understanding of vision-language models (VLMs) for autonomous driving. The framework automatically mines pre-defined traffic scenarios from any dataset using ground-truth annotations, provides an intuitive user interface for efficient human verification, and generates multiple-choice questions for model evaluation. Applied to the NuScenes dataset, we present STSnu, the first benchmark that evaluates the spatio-temporal reasoning capabilities of VLMs based on comprehensive 3D perception. Existing benchmarks typically target off-the-shelf or fine-tuned VLMs for images or videos from a single viewpoint and focus on semantic tasks such as object recognition, dense captioning, risk assessment, or scene understanding. In contrast, STSnu evaluates driving expert VLMs for end-to-end driving, operating on videos from multi-view cameras or LiDAR. It specifically assesses their ability to reason about both ego-vehicle actions and complex interactions among traffic participants, a crucial capability for autonomous vehicles. The benchmark features 43 diverse scenarios spanning multiple views and frames, resulting in 971 human-verified multiple-choice questions. A thorough evaluation uncovers critical shortcomings in existing models' ability to reason about fundamental traffic dynamics in complex environments. These findings highlight the urgent need for architectural advances that explicitly model spatio-temporal reasoning. By addressing a core gap in spatio-temporal evaluation, STSBench enables the development of more robust and explainable VLMs for autonomous driving.</p></details> | <details><summary>Datas...</summary><p>Dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/ivc-lrp/STSBench, Code: https://github.com/LRP-IVC/STSBench</p></details> |

Current video-based approaches, while proficient in tracking, lack the sophisticated reasoning capabilities of large language models, limiting their contextual understanding and generalization. We introduce VideoMolmo, a large multimodal model tailored for fine-grained spatio-temporal pointing conditioned on textual descriptions. Building upon the Molmo architecture, VideoMolmo incorporates a temporal module utilizing an attention mechanism to condition each frame on preceding frames, ensuring temporal consistency. Additionally, our novel temporal mask fusion pipeline employs SAM2 for bidirectional point propagation, significantly enhancing coherence across video sequences. This two-step decomposition, i.e., first using the LLM to generate precise pointing coordinates, then relying on a sequential mask-fusion module to produce coherent segmentation, not only simplifies the task for the language model but also enhances interpretability. Due to the lack of suitable datasets, we curate a comprehensive dataset comprising 72k video-caption pairs annotated with 100k object points. To evaluate the generalization of VideoMolmo, we introduce VPoS-Bench, a challenging out-of-distribution benchmark spanning five real-world scenarios: Cell Tracking, Egocentric Vision, Autonomous Driving, Video-GUI Interaction, and Robotics. We also evaluate our model on Referring Video Object Segmentation (Refer-VOS) and Reasoning VOS tasks. In comparison to existing models, VideoMolmo substantially improves spatio-temporal pointing accuracy and reasoning capability. Our code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/mbzuai-oryx/VideoMolmo.</p></details> | 20 pages, 13 figures |

However, the spatial correlation inherent to environmental monitoring has been mostly neglected in the recent literature, due to the significant modeling complexity it introduces. In this work, we address this gap by presenting a model of spatio-temporal information freshness, considering the conditional entropy of the system state in a remote monitoring scenario, such as a low-orbit satellite collecting information from a wide geographical area. Our analytical results show that purely age-oriented schemes tend to select an overly broad communication range, leading to inaccurate estimates and energy inefficiency, both of which can be mitigated by adopting a spatio-temporal approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Expand and Compress: Exploring Tuning Principles for Continual Spatio-Temporal Graph Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12593v2)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread deployment of sensing devices leads to a surge in data for spatio-temporal forecasting applications such as traffic flow, air quality, and wind energy. Although spatio-temporal graph neural networks have achieved success in modeling various static spatio-temporal forecasting scenarios, real-world spatio-temporal data are typically received in a streaming manner, and the network continuously expands with the installation of new sensors. Thus, spatio-temporal forecasting in streaming scenarios faces dual challenges: the inefficiency of retraining models over newly arrived data and the detrimental effects of catastrophic forgetting over long-term history. To address these challenges, we propose a novel prompt tuning-based continuous forecasting method, following two fundamental tuning principles guided by empirical and theoretical analysis: expand and compress, which effectively resolve the aforementioned problems with lightweight tuning parameters. Specifically, we integrate the base spatio-temporal graph neural network with a continuous prompt pool, utilizing stored prompts (i.e., few learnable parameters) in memory, and jointly optimize them with the base spatio-temporal graph neural network. This method ensures that the model sequentially learns from the spatio-temporal data stream to accomplish tasks for corresponding periods. Extensive experimental results on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the multi-faceted superiority of our method over the state-of-the-art baselines, including effectiveness, efficiency, universality, etc.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> |

However, existing methods typically rely on transformer-based architectures, which often face challenges related to scalability and efficiency. To address these issues, we propose a novel, efficient human-human interaction generation method based on the Mamba framework, designed to meet the demands of effectively capturing long-sequence dependencies while providing real-time feedback. Specifically, we introduce an adaptive spatio-temporal Mamba framework that utilizes two parallel SSM branches with an adaptive mechanism to integrate the spatial and temporal features of motion sequences. To further enhance the model's ability to capture dependencies within individual motion sequences and the interactions between different individual sequences, we develop two key modules: the self-adaptive spatio-temporal Mamba module and the cross-adaptive spatio-temporal Mamba module, enabling efficient feature learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results on two interaction datasets with remarkable quality and efficiency. Compared to the baseline method InterGen, our approach not only improves accuracy but also requires a minimal parameter size of just 66M ,only 36% of InterGen's, while achieving an average inference speed of 0.57 seconds, which is 46% of InterGen's execution time.</p></details> |  |

Many end-to-end approaches rely on human annotations to learn intermediate perception and prediction tasks, while purely self-supervised approaches--which directly learn from sensor inputs to generate planning trajectories without human annotations often underperform the state of the art. We observe a key gap in the input representation space: end-to-end approaches built on MLLMs are often pretrained with reasoning tasks in 2D image space rather than the native 3D space in which autonomous vehicles plan. To this end, we propose S4-Driver, a scalable self-supervised motion planning algorithm with spatio-temporal visual representation, based on the popular PaLI multimodal large language model. S4-Driver uses a novel sparse volume strategy to seamlessly transform the strong visual representation of MLLMs from perspective view to 3D space without the need to finetune the vision encoder. This representation aggregates multi-view and multi-frame visual inputs and enables better prediction of planning trajectories in 3D space. To validate our method, we run experiments on both nuScenes and Waymo Open Motion Dataset (with in-house camera data). Results show that S4-Driver performs favorably against existing supervised multi-task approaches while requiring no human annotations. It also demonstrates great scalability when pretrained on large volumes of unannotated driving logs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR2025; Project website: s4-driver.github.io</p></details> |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Fuzzy-oriented Multi-Modal Meta-Learning for Fine-grained Emotion Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13541v4)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-grained emotion recognition (FER) plays a vital role in various fields, such as disease diagnosis, personalized recommendations, and multimedia mining. However, existing FER methods face three key challenges in real-world applications: (i) they rely on large amounts of continuously annotated data to ensure accuracy since emotions are complex and ambiguous in reality, which is costly and time-consuming; (ii) they cannot capture the temporal heterogeneity caused by changing emotion patterns, because they usually assume that the temporal correlation within sampling periods is the same; (iii) they do not consider the spatial heterogeneity of different FER scenarios, that is, the distribution of emotion information in different data may have bias or interference. To address these challenges, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Fuzzy-oriented Multi-modal Meta-learning framework (ST-F2M). Specifically, ST-F2M first divides the multi-modal videos into multiple views, and each view corresponds to one modality of one emotion. Multiple randomly selected views for the same emotion form a meta-training task. Next, ST-F2M uses an integrated module with spatial and temporal convolutions to encode the data of each task, reflecting the spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Then it adds fuzzy semantic information to each task based on generalized fuzzy rules, which helps handle the complexity and ambiguity of emotions. Finally, ST-F2M learns emotion-related general meta-knowledge through meta-recurrent neural networks to achieve fast and robust fine-grained emotion recognition. Extensive experiments show that ST-F2M outperforms various state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and model efficiency. In addition, we construct ablation studies and further analysis to explore why ST-F2M performs well.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

They provide policymakers with the granular information needed to identify, target, and implement effective interventions and allocate resources appropriately. Traditional disease mapping methods typically rely on Poisson regression, modeling observed counts while adjusting for local covariates that are treated as fixed and known. However, these methods may fail to capture the complexities and uncertainties in areas with sparse or absent data. To address this challenge, we developed a Bayesian hierarchical spatio-temporal top-down approach designed to estimate county-level OUD rates when direct small-area (county) data is unavailable. This method allows us to infer small-area OUD rates and quantify associated uncertainties, even in data-sparse environments using observed state-level OUD rates and a combination of state and county level informative covariates. We applied our approach to estimate OUD rates for 3,143 counties in the United States between 2010 and 2025. Model performance was assessed through simulation studies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unraveling Spatio-Temporal Foundation Models via the Pipeline Lens: A Comprehensive Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01364v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal deep learning models aims to utilize useful patterns in such data to support tasks like prediction. However, previous deep learning models designed for specific tasks typically require separate training for each use case, leading to increased computational and storage costs. To address this issue, spatio-temporal foundation models have emerged, offering a unified framework capable of solving multiple spatio-temporal tasks. These foundation models achieve remarkable success by learning general knowledge with spatio-temporal data or transferring the general capabilities of pre-trained language models. While previous surveys have explored spatio-temporal data and methodologies separately, they have ignored a comprehensive examination of how foundation models are designed, selected, pre-trained, and adapted. As a result, the overall pipeline for spatio-temporal foundation models remains unclear. To bridge this gap, we innovatively provide an up-to-date review of previous spatio-temporal foundation models from the pipeline perspective. The pipeline begins with an introduction to different types of spatio-temporal data, followed by details of data preprocessing and embedding techniques. The pipeline then presents a novel data property taxonomy to divide existing methods according to data sources and dependencies, providing efficient and effective model design and selection for researchers. On this basis, we further illustrate the training objectives of primitive models, as well as the adaptation techniques of transferred models. Overall, our survey provides a clear and structured pipeline to understand the connection between core elements of spatio-temporal foundation models while guiding researchers to get started quickly. Additionally, we introduce emerging opportunities such as multi-objective training in the field of spatio-temporal foundation models.</p></details> | 21 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Decoupled Learning for Spiking Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01117v1)** | 2025-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have gained significant attention for their potential to enable energy-efficient artificial intelligence. However, effective and efficient training of SNNs remains an unresolved challenge. While backpropagation through time (BPTT) achieves high accuracy, it incurs substantial memory overhead. In contrast, biologically plausible local learning methods are more memory-efficient but struggle to match the accuracy of BPTT. To bridge this gap, we propose spatio-temporal decouple learning (STDL), a novel training framework that decouples the spatial and temporal dependencies to achieve both high accuracy and training efficiency for SNNs. Specifically, to achieve spatial decoupling, STDL partitions the network into smaller subnetworks, each of which is trained independently using an auxiliary network. To address the decreased synergy among subnetworks resulting from spatial decoupling, STDL constructs each subnetwork's auxiliary network by selecting the largest subset of layers from its subsequent network layers under a memory constraint. Furthermore, STDL decouples dependencies across time steps to enable efficient online learning. Extensive evaluations on seven static and event-based vision datasets demonstrate that STDL consistently outperforms local learning methods and achieves comparable accuracy to the BPTT method with considerably reduced GPU memory cost. Notably, STDL achieves 4x reduced GPU memory than BPTT on the ImageNet dataset. Therefore, this work opens up a promising avenue for memory-efficient SNN training.

In this paper, we propose a noise-robust real-world VSR framework by incorporating self-supervised learning and Mamba into pre-trained latent diffusion models. To ensure content consistency across adjacent frames, we enhance the diffusion model with a global spatio-temporal attention mechanism using the Video State-Space block with a 3D Selective Scan module, which reinforces coherence at an affordable computational cost. To further reduce artifacts in generated details, we introduce a self-supervised ControlNet that leverages HR features as guidance and employs contrastive learning to extract degradation-insensitive features from LR videos. Finally, a three-stage training strategy based on a mixture of HR-LR videos is proposed to stabilize VSR training. The proposed Self-supervised ControlNet with Spatio-Temporal Continuous Mamba based VSR algorithm achieves superior perceptual quality than state-of-the-arts on real-world VSR benchmark datasets, validating the effectiveness of the proposed model design and training strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 10 figures, accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Fixed Variables: Expanding-variate Time Series Forecasting via Flat Scheme and Spatio-temporal Focal Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15296v2)** | 2025-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate Time Series Forecasting (MTSF) has long been a key research focus. Traditionally, these studies assume a fixed number of variables, but in real-world applications, Cyber-Physical Systems often expand as new sensors are deployed, increasing variables in MTSF. In light of this, we introduce a novel task, Expanding-variate Time Series Forecasting (EVTSF). This task presents unique challenges, specifically (1) handling inconsistent data shapes caused by adding new variables, and (2) addressing imbalanced spatio-temporal learning, where expanding variables have limited observed data due to the necessity for timely operation. To address these challenges, we propose STEV, a flexible spatio-temporal forecasting framework. STEV includes a new Flat Scheme to tackle the inconsistent data shape issue, which extends the graph-based spatio-temporal modeling architecture into 1D space by flattening the 2D samples along the variable dimension, making the model variable-scale-agnostic while still preserving dynamic spatial correlations through a holistic graph. We introduce a novel Spatio-temporal Focal Learning strategy that incorporates a negative filter to resolve potential conflicts between contrastive learning and graph representation, and a focal contrastive loss as its core to guide the framework to focus on optimizing the expanding variables. We benchmark EVTSF performance using three real-world datasets and compare it against three potential solutions employing SOTA MTSF models tailored for EVSTF. Experimental results show that STEV significantly outperforms its competitors, particularly on expanding variables. Notably, STEV, with only 5% of observations from the expanding period, is on par with SOTA MTSF models trained with complete observations. Further exploration of various expanding strategies underscores the generalizability of STEV in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interpretable Spatio-Temporal Features Extraction based Industrial Process Modeling and Monitoring by Soft Sensor](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00858v1)** | 2025-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data-driven soft sensors have been widely applied in complex industrial processes. However, the interpretable spatio-temporal features extraction by soft sensors remains a challenge. In this light, this work introduces a novel method termed spatio-temporal consistent and interpretable model (STCIM). First, temporal and spatial features are captured and aligned by a far topological spatio-temporal consistency extraction block. Then, the features are mapped into an interpretable latent space for further prediction by explicitly giving physical meanings to latent variables. The efficacy of the proposed STCIM is demonstrated through the modeling of two generated datasets and a real-life dataset of coal-fired power plants. The corresponding experiments show: 1) The generalization of STCIM outperforms other methods, especially in different operation situations. 2) The far topological spatio-temporal consistency is vital for feature alignment. 3) The hyper-parameters of physics-informed interpretable latent space loss decide the performance of STCIM.</p></details> |  |

However, accurately forecasting STTS is challenging due to complex dynamic correlations in both time and space dimensions. Existing graph neural networks struggle to balance effectiveness and efficiency in modeling dynamic spatio-temporal relations. To address this problem, we propose the Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Stiefel Graph Neural Network (DST-SGNN) to efficiently process STTS. For DST-SGNN, we first introduce the novel Stiefel Graph Spectral Convolution (SGSC) and Stiefel Graph Fourier Transform (SGFT). The SGFT matrix in SGSC is constrained to lie on the Stiefel manifold, and SGSC can be regarded as a filtered graph spectral convolution. We also propose the Linear Dynamic Graph Optimization on Stiefel Manifold (LDGOSM), which can efficiently learn the SGFT matrix from the dynamic graph and significantly reduce the computational complexity. Finally, we propose a multi-layer SGSC (MSGSC) that efficiently captures complex spatio-temporal correlations. Extensive experiments on seven spatio-temporal datasets show that DST-SGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods while maintaining relatively low computational costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IJCAI 2025</p></details> |

While Graph Attention Networks (GATs) are popular for modeling spatial dependencies, they rely on predefined adjacency structures and dynamic attention scores, introducing inductive biases and computational overhead that can obscure interpretability. We propose InterGAT, a simplified alternative to GAT that replaces masked attention with a fully learnable, symmetric node interaction matrix, capturing latent spatial relationships without relying on fixed graph topologies. Our framework, InterGAT-GRU, which incorporates a GRU-based temporal decoder, outperforms the baseline GAT-GRU in forecasting accuracy, achieving at least a 21% improvement on the SZ-Taxi dataset and a 6% improvement on the Los-Loop dataset across all forecasting horizons (15 to 60 minutes). Additionally, we observed reduction in training time by 60-70% compared to GAT-GRU baseline. Crucially, the learned interaction matrix reveals interpretable structure: it recovers sparse, topology-aware attention patterns that align with community structure. Spectral and clustering analyses show that the model captures both localized and global dynamics, offering insights into the functional topology driving predictions. This highlights how structure learning can simultaneously support prediction, computational efficiency, and topological interpretabil-ity in dynamic graph-based domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 10 figures, workshop</p></details> |

However, real-world scenarios frequently present challenges such as signal anomalies, noise, and distributional shifts. Existing solutions primarily enhance robustness by modifying network architectures or training procedures. Nevertheless, these approaches are computationally intensive and resource-demanding, especially for large-scale applications. In this paper, we explore a novel test-time computing paradigm, namely learning with calibration, ST-TTC, for spatio-temporal forecasting. Through learning with calibration, we aim to capture periodic structural biases arising from non-stationarity during the testing phase and perform real-time bias correction on predictions to improve accuracy. Specifically, we first introduce a spectral-domain calibrator with phase-amplitude modulation to mitigate periodic shift and then propose a flash updating mechanism with a streaming memory queue for efficient test-time computation. ST-TTC effectively bypasses complex training-stage techniques, offering an efficient and generalizable paradigm. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness, universality, flexibility and efficiency of our proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 9 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

It provides a systematic approach to quantifying resource consumption, emissions, and waste, enabling industries, researchers, and policymakers to identify hotspots for sustainability improvements. By providing a comprehensive assessment of systems, from raw material extraction to end-of-life disposal, LCA facilitates the development of environmentally sound strategies, thereby contributing significantly to sustainable engineering and informed decision-making. Despite its strengths and ubiquitous use, life cycle analysis has not been reconciled with the broader literature in model-based systems engineering and analysis, thus hindering its integration into the design of complex systems more generally. This lack of reconciliation poses a significant problem, as it hinders the seamless integration of environmental sustainability into the design and optimization of complex systems. Without alignment between life cycle analysis (LCA) and model-based systems engineering (MBSE), sustainability remains an isolated consideration rather than an inherent part of the system's architecture and design. The original contribution of this paper is twofold. First, the paper reconciles process-based life cycle analysis with the broader literature and vocabulary of model-based systems engineering and hetero-functional graph theory. It ultimately proves that model-based systems engineering and hetero-functional graph theory are a formal generalization of process-based life cycle analysis. Secondly, the paper demonstrates how model-based systems engineering and hetero-functional graph theory may be used to enhance the spatio-temporal resolution of process-based life cycle analysis in a manner that aligns with system design objectives.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |

Hence, analyzing and clustering spatio-temporal air quality data is crucial for understanding pollution dynamics and guiding policy interventions. This work provides a review of Bayesian nonparametric clustering methods, with a particular focus on their application to spatio-temporal data, which are ubiquitous in environmental sciences. We first introduce key modeling approaches for point-referenced spatio-temporal data, highlighting their flexibility in capturing complex spatial and temporal dependencies. We then review recent advancements in Bayesian clustering, focusing on spatial product partition models, which incorporate spatial structure into the clustering process. We illustrate the proposed methods on PM10 monitoring data from Northern Italy, demonstrating their ability to identify meaningful pollution patterns. This review highlights the potential of Bayesian nonparametric methods for environmental risk assessment and offers insights into future research directions in spatio-temporal clustering for public health and environmental science.</p></details> |  |

While spatial super-resolution and spectral super-resolution have been extensively studied, joint spatio-spectral super-resolution remains relatively explored. We propose an end-to-end model-driven framework that explicitly decomposes the joint spatio-spectral super-resolution problem into spatial super-resolution, spectral super-resolution and fusion tasks. Each sub-task is addressed by unfolding a variational-based approach, where the operators involved in the proximal gradient iterative scheme are replaced with tailored learnable modules. In particular, we design an upsampling operator for spatial super-resolution based on classical back-projection algorithms, adapted to handle arbitrary scaling factors. Spectral reconstruction is performed using learnable cluster-based upsampling and downsampling operators. For image fusion, we integrate low-frequency estimation and high-frequency injection modules to combine the spatial and spectral information from spatial super-resolution and spectral super-resolution outputs. Additionally, we introduce an efficient nonlocal post-processing step that leverages image self-similarity by combining a multi-head attention mechanism with residual connections. Extensive evaluations on several datasets and sampling factors demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Such data show dependence across several dimensions of space as well as in time, and can easily involve hundreds of thousands of observations. Many spatio-temporal models result in a dependence structure across all observations and can be fit only at a substantial computational cost, arising from dense matrix inversion, high dimensional parameter spaces, poor mixing in Markov Chain Monte Carlo, or the impossibility of utilizing parallel computing due to a lack of independence anywhere in the model fitting process. These computational challenges are exacerbated when the response variable is ordinal, and especially as the number of ordered categories grows. Some spatio-temporal models achieve computational feasibility for large datasets but only through overly restrictive model simplifications, which we seek to avoid here. In this paper we demonstrate a two-stage algorithm to fit a Bayesian spatio-temporal model to large datasets when the response variable is ordinal. The first stage models locations independently in space, capturing temporal dependence, and can be run in parallel. The second stage resamples from the first stage posterior distributions with an acceptance probability computed to impose spatial dependence from the full spatio-temporal model. The result is fast Bayesian inference which samples from the full spatio-temporal posterior and is computationally feasible even for large datasets. We quantify the substantial computational gains our approach achieves, and demonstrate the preservation of the posterior distribution as compared to the more costly single-stage model fit. We apply our approach to a large spatio-temporal drought dataset in the United States, a dataset too large for many existing spatio-temporal methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing the Accuracy of Spatio-Temporal Models for Wind Speed Prediction by Incorporating Bias-Corrected Crowdsourced Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24506v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate high-resolution spatial and temporal wind speed data is critical for estimating the wind energy potential of a location. For real-time wind speed prediction, statistical models typically depend on high-quality (near) real-time data from official meteorological stations to improve forecasting accuracy. Personal weather stations (PWS) offer an additional source of real-time data and broader spatial coverage than offical stations. However, they are not subject to rigorous quality control and may exhibit bias or measurement errors. This paper presents a framework for incorporating PWS data into statistical models for validated official meteorological station data via a two-stage approach. First, bias correction is performed on PWS wind speed data using reanalysis data. Second, we implement a Bayesian hierarchical spatio-temporal model that accounts for varying measurement error in the PWS data. This enables wind speed prediction across a target area, and is particularly beneficial for improving predictions in regions sparse in official monitoring stations. Our results show that including bias-corrected PWS data improves prediction accuracy compared to using meteorological station data alone, with a 7% reduction in prediction error on average across all sites. The results are comparable with popular reanalysis products, but unlike these numerical weather models our approach is available in real-time and offers improved uncertainty quantification.</p></details> |  |

However, most current systems assume a static environment, which limits the system's applicability in real-world scenarios where environments frequently change due to human intervention or the robot's own actions. In this work, we present DynaMem, a new approach to open-world mobile manipulation that uses a dynamic spatio-semantic memory to represent a robot's environment. DynaMem constructs a 3D data structure to maintain a dynamic memory of point clouds, and answers open-vocabulary object localization queries using multimodal LLMs or open-vocabulary features generated by state-of-the-art vision-language models. Powered by DynaMem, our robots can explore novel environments, search for objects not found in memory, and continuously update the memory as objects move, appear, or disappear in the scene. We run extensive experiments on the Stretch SE3 robots in three real and nine offline scenes, and achieve an average pick-and-drop success rate of 70% on non-stationary objects, which is more than a 2x improvement over state-of-the-art static systems.

However, existing 3DGS-based methods for dynamic reconstruction often suffer from \textit{spatio-temporal incoherence} during initialization, where canonical Gaussians are constructed by aggregating observations from multiple frames without temporal distinction. This results in spatio-temporally entangled representations, making it difficult to model dynamic motion accurately. To overcome this limitation, we propose \textbf{STDR} (Spatio-Temporal Decoupling for Real-time rendering), a plug-and-play module that learns spatio-temporal probability distributions for each Gaussian. STDR introduces a spatio-temporal mask, a separated deformation field, and a consistency regularization to jointly disentangle spatial and temporal patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that incorporating our module into existing 3DGS-based dynamic scene reconstruction frameworks leads to notable improvements in both reconstruction quality and spatio-temporal consistency across synthetic and real-world benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we adapt and specialise the robust and conjugate GP (RCGP) framework of Altamirano et al. (2024) to the spatio-temporal setting. In doing so, we obtain an outlier-robust spatio-temporal GP with a computational cost comparable to classical spatio-temporal GPs. We also overcome the three main drawbacks of RCGPs: their unreliable performance when the prior mean is chosen poorly, their lack of reliable uncertainty quantification, and the need to carefully select a hyperparameter by hand. We study our method extensively in finance and weather forecasting applications, demonstrating that it provides a reliable approach to spatio-temporal modelling in the presence of outliers.</p></details> |  |

Recently, advancements in monitoring technology have facilitated the effective recording of nuclear radiation levels and related factors, such as weather conditions. The abundance of monitoring data enables the development of accurate and reliable nuclear radiation forecasting models, which play a crucial role in informing decision-making for individuals and governments. However, this task is challenging due to the imbalanced distribution of monitoring stations over a wide spatial range and the non-stationary radiation variation patterns. In this study, we introduce NRFormer, a novel framework tailored for the nationwide prediction of nuclear radiation variations. By integrating a non-stationary temporal attention module, an imbalance-aware spatial attention module, and a radiation propagation prompting module, NRFormer collectively captures complex spatio-temporal dynamics of nuclear radiation.

To make profits, prosumers equipped with photovoltaic (PV) panels and even the energy storage system (ESS) can actively participate in the real-time P2P energy market and trade energy. However, in real situations, system states such as energy demands and renewable energy power generation are highly uncertain, making it difficult for prosumers to make optimal real-time decisions. Moreover, severe problems with the physical network can arise from the real-time P2P energy trading, such as bus voltage violations and line overload. To handle these problems, this work first formulates the real-time P2P energy trading problem as a spatio-temporally constrained stochastic optimization problem by considering ESS and the spatial physical network constraints. To deal with the uncertainties online, a modified Lyapunov optimization method is innovatively proposed to approximately reformulate the stochastic optimization problem into an online one by relaxing the time-coupling constraints. Compared with the state-of-the-art online methods, the proposed one renders more flexibility and better performance for the real-time P2P energy market operation. Additionally, to protect the prosumers' privacy, an online distributed algorithm based on the consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is developed to solve the reformulated online problem by decoupling the spatial constraints. The theoretical near-optimal performance guarantee of the proposed online distributed algorithm is derived, and its performance can be further improved by minimizing the performance gap. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed online distributed algorithm can guarantee the fast, stable, and safe long-term operation of the real-time P2P energy market.</p></details> |  |

Spatio-temporal deep learning models, while scalable, typically assume a simplistic independent covariance matrix for the response, failing to capture the underlying correlation structure. However, spatio-temporal GPs suffer from issues of scalability and various forms of approximation bias resulting from restrictive assumptions of the covariance kernel function. We propose STACI, a novel framework consisting of a variational Bayesian neural network approximation of non-stationary spatio-temporal GP along with a novel spatio-temporal conformal inference algorithm. STACI is highly scalable, taking advantage of GPU training capabilities for neural network models, and provides statistically valid prediction intervals for uncertainty quantification. STACI outperforms competing GPs and deep methods in accurately approximating spatio-temporal processes and we show it easily scales to datasets with millions of observations.</p></details> |  |
| **[STRAP: Spatio-Temporal Pattern Retrieval for Out-of-Distribution Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19547v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for modeling dynamic graph-structured data across diverse domains. However, they often fail to generalize in Spatio-Temporal Out-of-Distribution (STOOD) scenarios, where both temporal dynamics and spatial structures evolve beyond the training distribution. To address this problem, we propose an innovative Spatio-Temporal Retrieval-Augmented Pattern Learning framework,STRAP, which enhances model generalization by integrating retrieval-augmented learning into the STGNN continue learning pipeline. The core of STRAP is a compact and expressive pattern library that stores representative spatio-temporal patterns enriched with historical, structural, and semantic information, which is obtained and optimized during the training phase. During inference, STRAP retrieves relevant patterns from this library based on similarity to the current input and injects them into the model via a plug-and-play prompting mechanism. This not only strengthens spatio-temporal representations but also mitigates catastrophic forgetting. Moreover, STRAP introduces a knowledge-balancing objective to harmonize new information with retrieved knowledge. Extensive experiments across multiple real-world streaming graph datasets show that STRAP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art STGNN baselines on STOOD tasks, demonstrating its robustness, adaptability, and strong generalization capability without task-specific fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Decoupling Spatio-Temporal Prediction: When Lightweight Large Models Meet Adaptive Hypergraphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19620v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal prediction is a pivotal task with broad applications in traffic management, climate monitoring, energy scheduling, etc. However, existing methodologies often struggle to balance model expressiveness and computational efficiency, especially when scaling to large real-world datasets. To tackle these challenges, we propose STH-SepNet (Spatio-Temporal Hypergraph Separation Networks), a novel framework that decouples temporal and spatial modeling to enhance both efficiency and precision. Therein, the temporal dimension is modeled using lightweight large language models, which effectively capture low-rank temporal dynamics. Concurrently, the spatial dimension is addressed through an adaptive hypergraph neural network, which dynamically constructs hyperedges to model intricate, higher-order interactions. A carefully designed gating mechanism is integrated to seamlessly fuse temporal and spatial representations. By leveraging the fundamental principles of low-rank temporal dynamics and spatial interactions, STH-SepNet offers a pragmatic and scalable solution for spatio-temporal prediction in real-world applications. Extensive experiments on large-scale real-world datasets across multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of STH-SepNet in boosting predictive performance while maintaining computational efficiency. This work may provide a promising lightweight framework for spatio-temporal prediction, aiming to reduce computational demands and while enhancing predictive performance.

| **[FutureSightDrive: Thinking Visually with Spatio-Temporal CoT for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17685v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual language models (VLMs) have attracted increasing interest in autonomous driving due to their powerful reasoning capabilities. However, existing VLMs typically utilize discrete text Chain-of-Thought (CoT) tailored to the current scenario, which essentially represents highly abstract and symbolic compression of visual information, potentially leading to spatio-temporal relationship ambiguity and fine-grained information loss. Is autonomous driving better modeled on real-world simulation and imagination than on pure symbolic logic? In this paper, we propose a spatio-temporal CoT reasoning method that enables models to think visually. First, VLM serves as a world model to generate unified image frame for predicting future world states: where perception results (e.g., lane divider and 3D detection) represent the future spatial relationships, and ordinary future frame represent the temporal evolution relationships. This spatio-temporal CoT then serves as intermediate reasoning steps, enabling the VLM to function as an inverse dynamics model for trajectory planning based on current observations and future predictions. To implement visual generation in VLMs, we propose a unified pretraining paradigm integrating visual generation and understanding, along with a progressive visual CoT enhancing autoregressive image generation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, advancing autonomous driving towards visual reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal Spatio-Temporal Prediction: An Effective and Efficient Multi-Modal Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17637v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal prediction plays a crucial role in intelligent transportation, weather forecasting, and urban planning. While integrating multi-modal data has shown potential for enhancing prediction accuracy, key challenges persist: (i) inadequate fusion of multi-modal information, (ii) confounding factors that obscure causal relations, and (iii) high computational complexity of prediction models. To address these challenges, we propose E^2-CSTP, an Effective and Efficient Causal multi-modal Spatio-Temporal Prediction framework. E^2-CSTP leverages cross-modal attention and gating mechanisms to effectively integrate multi-modal data. Building on this, we design a dual-branch causal inference approach: the primary branch focuses on spatio-temporal prediction, while the auxiliary branch mitigates bias by modeling additional modalities and applying causal interventions to uncover true causal dependencies. To improve model efficiency, we integrate GCN with the Mamba architecture for accelerated spatio-temporal encoding. Extensive experiments on 4 real-world datasets show that E^2-CSTP significantly outperforms 9 state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 9.66% improvements in accuracy as well as 17.37%-56.11% reductions in computational overhead.</p></details> |  |
| **[FLEX: A Backbone for Diffusion-Based Modeling of Spatio-temporal Physical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17351v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce FLEX (FLow EXpert), a backbone architecture for generative modeling of spatio-temporal physical systems using diffusion models. FLEX operates in the residual space rather than on raw data, a modeling choice that we motivate theoretically, showing that it reduces the variance of the velocity field in the diffusion model, which helps stabilize training. FLEX integrates a latent Transformer into a U-Net with standard convolutional ResNet layers and incorporates a redesigned skip connection scheme. This hybrid design enables the model to capture both local spatial detail and long-range dependencies in latent space. To improve spatio-temporal conditioning, FLEX uses a task-specific encoder that processes auxiliary inputs such as coarse or past snapshots. Weak conditioning is applied to the shared encoder via skip connections to promote generalization, while strong conditioning is applied to the decoder through both skip and bottleneck features to ensure reconstruction fidelity. FLEX achieves accurate predictions for super-resolution and forecasting tasks using as few as two reverse diffusion steps. It also produces calibrated uncertainty estimates through sampling. Evaluations on high-resolution 2D turbulence data show that FLEX outperforms strong baselines and generalizes to out-of-distribution settings, including unseen Reynolds numbers, physical observables (e.g., fluid flow velocity fields), and boundary conditions.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have opened a new frontier by fusing visual and linguistic modalities, enabling spatio-temporal vision-language understanding: models that not only capture spatial and temporal dependencies to recognize changes but also provide a richer interactive semantic analysis of temporal images (e.g., generate descriptive captions and answer natural-language queries). In this survey, we present the first comprehensive review of RS-STVLMs. The survey covers the evolution of models from early task-specific models to recent general foundation models that leverage powerful large language models. We discuss progress in representative tasks, such as change captioning, change question answering, and change grounding. Moreover, we systematically dissect the fundamental components and key technologies underlying these models, and review the datasets and evaluation metrics that have driven the field. By synthesizing task-level insights with a deep dive into shared architectural patterns, we aim to illuminate current achievements and chart promising directions for future research in spatio-temporal vision-language understanding for remote sensing. We will keep tracing related works at https://github.com/Chen-Yang-Liu/Awesome-RS-SpatioTemporal-VLMs</p></details> |  |

Accordingly, this work introduces a spatio-temporal analytical framework based on discrete-time Markov chains to analyze vessel movement patterns in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, emphasizing changes induced during the COVID-19 pandemic. We discretize the ocean space into hexagonal cells and construct mobility signatures for individual vessel types using the frequency of cell transitions and the dwell time within each cell. These features are used to build origin-destination matrices and spatial transition probability models that characterize vessel dynamics at different temporal resolutions. Under multiple vessel types, we contribute with a temporal evolution analysis of mobility patterns during pandemic times, highlighting significant but transient changes to recurring transportation behaviors. Our findings indicate vessel-specific mobility signatures consistent across spatially disjoint regions, suggesting that those are latent behavioral invariants. Besides, we observe significant temporal deviations among passenger and fishing vessels during the pandemic, indicating a strong influence of social isolation policies and operational limitations imposed on non-essential maritime activity in this region.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semi-decentralized Training of Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks for Traffic Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03188v2)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In smart mobility, large networks of geographically distributed sensors produce vast amounts of high-frequency spatio-temporal data that must be processed in real time to avoid major disruptions. Traditional centralized approaches are increasingly unsuitable to this task, as they struggle to scale with expanding sensor networks, and reliability issues in central components can easily affect the whole deployment. To address these challenges, we explore and adapt semi-decentralized training techniques for Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (ST-GNNs) in smart mobility domain. We implement a simulation framework where sensors are grouped by proximity into multiple cloudlets, each handling a subgraph of the traffic graph, fetching node features from other cloudlets to train its own local ST-GNN model, and exchanging model updates with other cloudlets to ensure consistency, enhancing scalability and removing reliance on a centralized aggregator. We perform extensive comparative evaluation of four different ST-GNN training setups -- centralized, traditional FL, server-free FL, and Gossip Learning -- on large-scale traffic datasets, the METR-LA and PeMS-BAY datasets, for short-, mid-, and long-term vehicle speed predictions. Experimental results show that semi-decentralized setups are comparable to centralized approaches in performance metrics, while offering advantages in terms of scalability and fault tolerance. In addition, we highlight often overlooked issues in existing literature for distributed ST-GNNs, such as the variation in model performance across different geographical areas due to region-specific traffic patterns, and the significant communication overhead and computational costs that arise from the large receptive field of GNNs, leading to substantial data transfers and increased computation of partial embeddings.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables, conference</p></details> |

While 3D point clouds provide detailed spatial information, spatio-temporal signals introduce a dynamic element that accounts for changes over time. However, applying deep learning techniques to spatio-temporal signals and deploying them on edge devices presents challenges, including real-time processing, memory capacity, and power consumption. To address these issues, this paper presents a novel approach that combines PointNet's feature extraction with the in-memory computing capabilities and energy efficiency of neuromorphic systems for spatio-temporal signal recognition. The proposed method consists of a two-stage process: in the first stage, PointNet extracts features from the spatio-temporal signals, which are then stored in non-volatile memristor crossbar arrays. In the second stage, these features are processed by a single-layer spiking neural encoder-decoder that employs the Locally Competitive Algorithm (LCA) for efficient encoding and classification. This work integrates the strengths of both PointNet and LCA, enhancing computational efficiency and energy performance on edge devices. PointLCA-Net achieves high recognition accuracy for spatio-temporal data with substantially lower energy burden during both inference and training than comparable approaches, thus advancing the deployment of advanced neural architectures in energy-constrained environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to International Joint Conference on Neural Networks(IJCNN), 2015</p></details> |
| **[Learning Spatio-Temporal Dynamics for Trajectory Recovery via Time-Aware Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13857v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In real-world applications, GPS trajectories often suffer from low sampling rates, with large and irregular intervals between consecutive GPS points. This sparse characteristic presents challenges for their direct use in GPS-based systems. This paper addresses the task of map-constrained trajectory recovery, aiming to enhance trajectory sampling rates of GPS trajectories. Previous studies commonly adopt a sequence-to-sequence framework, where an encoder captures the trajectory patterns and a decoder reconstructs the target trajectory. Within this framework, effectively representing the road network and extracting relevant trajectory features are crucial for overall performance. Despite advancements in these models, they fail to fully leverage the complex spatio-temporal dynamics present in both the trajectory and the road network. To overcome these limitations, we categorize the spatio-temporal dynamics of trajectory data into two distinct aspects: spatial-temporal traffic dynamics and trajectory dynamics. Furthermore, We propose TedTrajRec, a novel method for trajectory recovery. To capture spatio-temporal traffic dynamics, we introduce PD-GNN, which models periodic patterns and learns topologically aware dynamics concurrently for each road segment. For spatio-temporal trajectory dynamics, we present TedFormer, a time-aware Transformer that incorporates temporal dynamics for each GPS location by integrating closed-form neural ordinary differential equations into the attention mechanism. This allows TedFormer to effectively handle irregularly sampled data. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of TedTrajRec. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/ysygMhdxw/TEDTrajRec/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a journal paper in IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems (T-ITS)</p></details> |

Exploring a Differentiable Sparse Soft-Vector Quantization Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03406v4)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal forecasting is crucial in various fields and requires a careful balance between identifying subtle patterns and filtering out noise. Vector quantization (VQ) appears well-suited for this purpose, as it quantizes input vectors into a set of codebook vectors or patterns. Although VQ has shown promise in various computer vision tasks, it surprisingly falls short in enhancing the accuracy of spatio-temporal forecasting. We attribute this to two main issues: inaccurate optimization due to non-differentiability and limited representation power in hard-VQ. To tackle these challenges, we introduce Differentiable Sparse Soft-Vector Quantization (SVQ), the first VQ method to enhance spatio-temporal forecasting. SVQ balances detail preservation with noise reduction, offering full differentiability and a solid foundation in sparse regression. Our approach employs a two-layer MLP and an extensive codebook to streamline the sparse regression process, significantly cutting computational costs while simplifying training and improving performance. Empirical studies on five spatio-temporal benchmark datasets show SVQ achieves state-of-the-art results, including a 7.9% improvement on the WeatherBench-S temperature dataset and an average mean absolute error reduction of 9.4% in video prediction benchmarks (Human3.6M, KTH, and KittiCaltech), along with a 17.3% enhancement in image quality (LPIPS).

| **[AFCL: Analytic Federated Continual Learning for Spatio-Temporal Invariance of Non-IID Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12245v1)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Continual Learning (FCL) enables distributed clients to collaboratively train a global model from online task streams in dynamic real-world scenarios. However, existing FCL methods face challenges of both spatial data heterogeneity among distributed clients and temporal data heterogeneity across online tasks. Such data heterogeneity significantly degrades the model performance with severe spatial-temporal catastrophic forgetting of local and past knowledge. In this paper, we identify that the root cause of this issue lies in the inherent vulnerability and sensitivity of gradients to non-IID data. To fundamentally address this issue, we propose a gradient-free method, named Analytic Federated Continual Learning (AFCL), by deriving analytical (i.e., closed-form) solutions from frozen extracted features. In local training, our AFCL enables single-epoch learning with only a lightweight forward-propagation process for each client. In global aggregation, the server can recursively and efficiently update the global model with single-round aggregation. Theoretical analyses validate that our AFCL achieves spatio-temporal invariance of non-IID data. This ideal property implies that, regardless of how heterogeneous the data are distributed across local clients and online tasks, the aggregated model of our AFCL remains invariant and identical to that of centralized joint learning. Extensive experiments show the consistent superiority of our AFCL over state-of-the-art baselines across various benchmark datasets and settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Recent research on traffic forecasting has mainly focused on combining graph neural networks (GNNs) with other models. However, GNNs only consider short-range spatial information. In this study, we present a novel model termed LSTAN-GERPE (Lightweight Spatio-Temporal Attention Network with Graph Embedding and Rotational Position Encoding). This model leverages both Temporal and Spatial Attention mechanisms to effectively capture long-range traffic dynamics. Additionally, the optimal frequency for rotational position encoding is determined through a grid search approach in both the spatial and temporal attention mechanisms. This systematic optimization enables the model to effectively capture complex traffic patterns. The model also enhances feature representation by incorporating geographical location maps into the spatio-temporal embeddings. Without extensive feature engineering, the proposed method in this paper achieves advanced accuracy on the real-world traffic forecasting datasets PeMS04 and PeMS08.</p></details> |  |

However, existing EEG-based AAD methods overlook the spatio-temporal dependencies of EEG signals, limiting their decoding and generalization abilities. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Lightweight Spatio-Temporal Enhancement Nested Network (ListenNet) for AAD. The ListenNet has three key components: Spatio-temporal Dependency Encoder (STDE), Multi-scale Temporal Enhancement (MSTE), and Cross-Nested Attention (CNA). The STDE reconstructs dependencies between consecutive time windows across channels, improving the robustness of dynamic pattern extraction. The MSTE captures temporal features at multiple scales to represent both fine-grained and long-range temporal patterns. In addition, the CNA integrates hierarchical features more effectively through novel dynamic attention mechanisms to capture deep spatio-temporal correlations. Experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate the superiority of ListenNet over state-of-the-art methods in both subject-dependent and challenging subject-independent settings, while reducing the trainable parameter count by approximately 7 times.

In the human language system, experimental studies have observed clusters for syntactic and semantic categories, but the mechanisms underlying this functional organization remain unclear. Here, building on work from the vision literature, we develop TopoLM, a transformer language model with an explicit two-dimensional spatial representation of model units. By combining a next-token prediction objective with a spatial smoothness loss, representations in this model assemble into clusters that correspond to semantically interpretable groupings of text and closely match the functional organization in the brain's language system. TopoLM successfully predicts the emergence of the spatio-functional organization of a cortical language system as well as the organization of functional clusters selective for fine-grained linguistic features empirically observed in human cortex. Our results suggest that the functional organization of the human language system is driven by a unified spatial objective, and provide a functionally and spatially aligned model of language processing in the brain.</p></details> |  |

In this regard, covariance properties with respect to geometric image transformations in the earliest layers of the visual hierarchy are essential for expressing robust image operations, and for formulating invariant visual operations at higher levels. This paper defines and proves a set of joint covariance properties for spatio-temporal receptive fields in terms of spatio-temporal derivative operators applied to spatio-temporally smoothed image data under compositions of spatial scaling transformations, spatial affine transformations, Galilean transformations and temporal scaling transformations. Specifically, the derived relations show how the parameters of the receptive fields need to be transformed, in order to match the output from spatio-temporal receptive fields under composed spatio-temporal image transformations. For this purpose, we also fundamentally extend the notion of scale-normalized derivatives to affine-normalized derivatives, that are computed based on spatial smoothing with affine Gaussian kernels, and analyze the covariance properties of the resulting affine-normalized derivatives for the affine group as well as for important subgroups thereof. We conclude with a geometric analysis, showing how the derived joint covariance properties make it possible to relate or match spatio-temporal receptive field responses, when observing, possibly moving, local surface patches from different views, under locally linearized perspective or projective transformations, as well as when observing different instances of spatio-temporal events, that may occur either faster or slower between different views of similar spatio-temporal events.</p></details> | <details><summary>46 pa...</summary><p>46 pages, 19 figures.

However, when operated in the high-recall, low-precision regime required for exhaustive event coverage in soccer analytics, their lack of contextual understanding becomes apparent: many false positives could be resolved by considering a broader sequence of actions and game-state information. In this work, we address this limitation by reasoning at the game level and improving STAD through the addition of a denoising sequence transduction task. Sequences of noisy, context-free player-centric predictions are processed alongside clean game state information using a Transformer-based encoder-decoder model. By modeling extended temporal context and reasoning jointly over team-level dynamics, our method leverages the "language of soccer" - its tactical regularities and inter-player dependencies - to generate "denoised" sequences of actions. This approach improves both precision and recall in low-confidence regimes, enabling more reliable event extraction from broadcast video and complementing existing pixel-based methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, submitted to Advanced Concepts for Intelligent Vision Systems 2025</p></details> |

OFOS platforms offer dynamic allocation incentives to users and merchants through diverse marketing campaigns to encourage payments while maintaining the platforms' budget efficiency. Despite significant progress, the marketing domain continues to face two primary challenges: (i) how to allocate a limited budget with greater efficiency, demanding precision in predicting users' monotonic response (i.e. sensitivity) to incentives, and (ii) ensuring spatio-temporal adaptability and robustness in diverse marketing campaigns across different times and locations. To address these issues, we propose a Constrained Monotonic Adaptive Network (CoMAN) method for spatio-temporal perception within marketing pricing. Specifically, we capture spatio-temporal preferences within attribute features through two foundational spatio-temporal perception modules. To further enhance catching the user sensitivity differentials to incentives across varied times and locations, we design modules for learning spatio-temporal convexity and concavity as well as for expressing sensitivity functions. CoMAN can achieve a more efficient allocation of incentive investments during pricing, thus increasing the conversion rate and orders while maintaining budget efficiency. Extensive offline and online experimental results within our diverse marketing campaigns demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach while outperforming the monotonic state-of-the-art method.</p></details> | 12 pages |

Previous approaches for temporal modeling fall into two categories: recurrent-based and recurrent-free methods. The former, while meticulously processing frames one by one, neglect short-term spatio-temporal information redundancies, leading to inefficiencies. The latter naively stack frames sequentially, overlooking the inherent temporal dependencies. In this paper, we re-examine the two dominant temporal modeling approaches within the realm of spatio-temporal predictive learning, offering a unified perspective. Building upon this analysis, we introduce USTEP (Unified Spatio-TEmporal Predictive learning), an innovative framework that reconciles the recurrent-based and recurrent-free methods by integrating both micro-temporal and macro-temporal scales. Extensive experiments on a wide range of spatio-temporal predictive learning demonstrate that USTEP achieves significant improvements over existing temporal modeling approaches, thereby establishing it as a robust solution for a wide range of spatio-temporal applications.</p></details> | Accepted by TPAMI |

However, most existing learning-based methods for event-based optical flow adopt frame-based techniques, ignoring the spatio-temporal characteristics of events. Additionally, these methods assume linear motion between consecutive events within the loss time window, which increases optical flow errors in long-time sequences. In this work, we observe that rich spatio-temporal information and accurate nonlinear motion between events are crucial for event-based optical flow estimation. Therefore, we propose E-NMSTFlow, a novel unsupervised event-based optical flow network focusing on long-time sequences. We propose a Spatio-Temporal Motion Feature Aware (STMFA) module and an Adaptive Motion Feature Enhancement (AMFE) module, both of which utilize rich spatio-temporal information to learn spatio-temporal data associations. Meanwhile, we propose a nonlinear motion compensation loss that utilizes the accurate nonlinear motion between events to improve the unsupervised learning of our network. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method. Remarkably, our method ranks first among unsupervised learning methods on the MVSEC and DSEC-Flow datasets.

Existing solutions often rely on a pre-alignment strategy to normalize data, which can distort intrinsic patterns and escalate computational and memory demands. Addressing these limitations, we introduce STRGCN, a Spatio-Temporal Relational Graph Convolutional Network that avoids pre-alignment and directly captures the complex interdependencies in IMTS by representing them as a fully connected graph. Each observation is represented as a node, allowing the model to effectively handle misaligned timestamps by mapping all inter-node relationships, thus faithfully preserving the asynchronous nature of the data. Moreover, we enhance this model with a hierarchical ``Sandwich'' structure that strategically aggregates nodes to optimize graph embeddings, reducing computational overhead while maintaining detailed local and global context. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that STRGCN achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, competitive memory usage and training speed.</p></details> |  |

We present a 4D spatio-temporal metric-semantic mapping system that integrates multi-session measurements to track fruit growth over time. Our approach combines a LiDAR-RGB fusion module for 3D fruit localization with a 4D fruit association method leveraging positional, visual, and topology information for improved data association precision. Evaluated on real orchard data, our method achieves a 96.9% fruit counting accuracy for 1,790 apples across 60 trees, a mean fruit size estimation error of 1.1 cm, and a 23.7% improvement in 4D data association precision over baselines.

Neuromorphic disciplines view the brain as a coevolved system, simultaneously optimizing the hardware and the algorithms running on it. There are clear efficiency gains when bringing the computations into a physical substrate, but we presently lack theories to guide efficient implementations. Here, we present a principled computational model for neuromorphic systems in terms of spatio-temporal receptive fields, based on affine Gaussian kernels over space and leaky-integrator and leaky integrate-and-fire models over time. Our theory is provably covariant to spatial affine and temporal scaling transformations, and with close similarities to the visual processing in mammalian brains. We use these spatio-temporal receptive fields as a prior in an event-based vision task, and show that this improves the training of spiking networks, which otherwise is known as problematic for event-based vision. This work combines efforts within scale-space theory and computational neuroscience to identify theoretically well-founded ways to process spatio-temporal signals in neuromorphic systems. Our contributions are immediately relevant for signal processing and event-based vision, and can be extended to other processing tasks over space and time, such as memory and control.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/jegp/nrf</p></details> |

Accurate predictive models rely on high-resolution spatio-temporal data to capture the complex interplay of environmental and anthropogenic factors. To address the lack of localised and fine-grained datasets in Spain, this work introduces IberFire, a spatio-temporal datacube at 1 km x 1 km x 1-day resolution covering mainland Spain and the Balearic Islands from December 2007 to December 2024. IberFire integrates 260 features across eight main categories: auxiliary features, fire history, geography, topography, meteorology, vegetation indices, human activity, and land cover. All features are derived from open-access sources, ensuring transparency and real-time applicability. The data processing pipeline was implemented entirely using open-source tools, and the codebase has been made publicly available. This work not only enhances spatio-temporal granularity and feature diversity compared to existing European datacubes but also provides a reproducible methodology for constructing similar datasets. IberFire supports advanced wildfire risk modelling through Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques, enables climate pattern analysis and informs strategic planning in fire prevention and land management. The dataset is publicly available on Zenodo to promote open research and collaboration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-temporal data fusion of censored threshold exceedances](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20268v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data fusion models are widely used in air quality monitoring to integrate in situ and remote-sensing data, offering spatially complete and temporally detailed estimates. However, traditional Gaussian-based models often underestimate extreme pollution values, leading to biased risk assessments. To address this, we present a Bayesian hierarchical data fusion framework rooted in extreme value theory, using the Dirac-delta generalised Pareto distribution to jointly account for threshold and non-threshold exceedances while preserving the temporal structure of extreme events. Our model is used to describe and predict censored threshold exceedances of PM2.5 pollution in the Greater London region by using remote sensing observations from the EAC4 dataset, a reanalysis product from the Copernicus Atmospheric Monitoring Service (CAMS), and in situ observation stations from the automatic urban and rural network (AURN) ran by the UK government. Some of our approach's key innovations include combining data with varying spatio-temporal resolutions and fully accounting for parameter uncertainties. Results show that our model outperforms Gaussian-based alternatives and standalone remote-sensing data in predicting threshold exceedances at the majority of observation sites and can even result in improved spatial patterns of PM2.5 pollution than those discernible from the remote-sensing data. Moreover, our approach captures greater variability and spatial patterns, such as higher PM2.5 concentrations near coastal areas, which are not evident in remote-sensing data alone.</p></details> |  |
| **[3DPyranet Features Fusion for Spatio-temporal Feature Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18977v1)** | 2025-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Convolutional neural network (CNN) slides a kernel over the whole image to produce an output map. This kernel scheme reduces the number of parameters with respect to a fully connected neural network (NN). While CNN has proven to be an effective model in recognition of handwritten characters and traffic signal sign boards, etc. recently, its deep variants have proven to be effective in similar as well as more challenging applications like object, scene and action recognition. Deep CNN add more layers and kernels to the classical CNN, increasing the number of parameters, and partly reducing the main advantage of CNN which is less parameters. In this paper, a 3D pyramidal neural network called 3DPyraNet and a discriminative approach for spatio-temporal feature learning based on it, called 3DPyraNet-F, are proposed. 3DPyraNet introduces a new weighting scheme which learns features from both spatial and temporal dimensions analyzing multiple adjacent frames and keeping a biological plausible structure. It keeps the spatial topology of the input image and presents fewer parameters and lower computational and memory costs compared to both fully connected NNs and recent deep CNNs. 3DPyraNet-F extract the features maps of the highest layer of the learned network, fuse them in a single vector, and provide it as input in such a way to a linear-SVM classifier that enhances the recognition of human actions and dynamic scenes from the videos. Encouraging results are reported with 3DPyraNet in real-world environments, especially in the presence of camera induced motion. Further, 3DPyraNet-F clearly outperforms the state-of-the-art on three benchmark datasets and shows comparable result for the fourth.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods often fail to incorporate adequate spatio-temporal modeling and prompt alignment within a unified framework, resulting in temporal inconsistencies, geometric distortions, or low-quality 4D content that deviates from the provided texts. Therefore, we propose STP4D, a novel approach that aims to integrate comprehensive spatio-temporal-prompt consistency modeling for high-quality text-to-4D generation. Specifically, STP4D employs three carefully designed modules: Time-varying Prompt Embedding, Geometric Information Enhancement, and Temporal Extension Deformation, which collaborate to accomplish this goal. Furthermore, STP4D is among the first methods to exploit the Diffusion model to generate 4D Gaussians, combining the fine-grained modeling capabilities and the real-time rendering process of 4DGS with the rapid inference speed of the Diffusion model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STP4D excels in generating high-fidelity 4D content with exceptional efficiency (approximately 4.6s per asset), surpassing existing methods in both quality and speed.</p></details> |  |

Multi-sensor synchronous measurement has proven to be more effective for WHAR than using a single sensor. However, existing WHAR methods use shared convolutional kernels for indiscriminate temporal feature extraction across each sensor variable, which fails to effectively capture spatio-temporal relationships of intra-sensor and inter-sensor variables. We propose the DecomposeWHAR model consisting of a decomposition phase and a fusion phase to better model the relationships between modality variables. The decomposition creates high-dimensional representations of each intra-sensor variable through the improved Depth Separable Convolution to capture local temporal features while preserving their unique characteristics. The fusion phase begins by capturing relationships between intra-sensor variables and fusing their features at both the channel and variable levels. Long-range temporal dependencies are modeled using the State Space Model (SSM), and later cross-sensor interactions are dynamically captured through a self-attention mechanism, highlighting inter-sensor spatial correlations. Our model demonstrates superior performance on three widely used WHAR datasets, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art models while maintaining acceptable computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |

However, existing 3D segmentation models solely focus on spatial information. To address this gap, we propose OmniMamba4D, a novel segmentation model designed for 4D medical images (3D images over time). OmniMamba4D utilizes a spatio-temporal tetra-orientated Mamba block to effectively capture both spatial and temporal features. Unlike traditional 3D models, which analyze single-time points, OmniMamba4D processes 4D CT data, providing comprehensive spatio-temporal information on lesion progression. Evaluated on an internal dataset comprising of 3,252 CT scans, OmniMamba4D achieves a competitive Dice score of 0.682, comparable to state-of-the-arts (SOTA) models, while maintaining computational efficiency and better detecting disappeared lesions. This work demonstrates a new framework to leverage spatio-temporal information for longitudinal CT lesion segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) 2025</p></details> |

However, the inherent nonlinearity of the marine dynamic system presents significant challenges. Current forecasting methods mainly include physics-based numerical simulations and data-driven machine learning approaches. The former, while describing SST evolution through differential equations, suffers from high computational complexity and limited applicability, whereas the latter, despite its computational benefits, requires large datasets and faces interpretability challenges. This study presents a prediction framework based solely on data-driven techniques. Using phase space reconstruction, we construct initial-delay attractor pairs with a mathematical homeomorphism and design a Spatio-Temporal Fusion Mapping (STFM) to uncover their intrinsic connections. Unlike conventional models, our method captures SST dynamics efficiently through phase space reconstruction and achieves high prediction accuracy with minimal training data in comparative tests</p></details> | 19 pages, 14 figures |

However, the low resolution of TIR images, along with tracking interference, significantly limits the perfor-mance of TIR trackers. To address these challenges, we introduce STARS, a novel sparse learning-based CF tracker that incorporates spatio-temporal regulari-zation and super-resolution reconstruction. First, we apply adaptive sparse filter-ing and temporal domain filtering to extract key features of the target while reduc-ing interference from background clutter and noise. Next, we introduce an edge-preserving sparse regularization method to stabilize target features and prevent excessive blurring. This regularization integrates multiple terms and employs the alternating direction method of multipliers to optimize the solution. Finally, we propose a gradient-enhanced super-resolution method to extract fine-grained TIR target features and improve the resolution of TIR images, addressing performance degradation in tracking caused by low-resolution sequences. To the best of our knowledge, STARS is the first to integrate super-resolution methods within a sparse learning-based CF framework. Extensive experiments on the LSOTB-TIR, PTB-TIR, VOT-TIR2015, and VOT-TIR2017 benchmarks demonstrate that STARS outperforms state-of-the-art trackers in terms of robustness.</p></details> |  |

Among EEG techniques, the steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) is favored due to its robust signal-to-noise ratio, minimal training demands, and elevated information transmission rate. Frequency detection in SSVEP-based brain-computer interfaces commonly employs canonical correlation analysis (CCA). SSCCA (spatio-spectral canonical correlation analysis) augments CCA by refining spatial filtering. This paper presents a multistage feature fusion methodology for short-duration SSVEP frequency identification, employing SSCCA with template signals derived via leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV). A filterbank generates bandpass filters for stimulus frequencies and their harmonics, whereas SSCCA calculates correlation coefficients between subbands and templates. Two phases of non-linear weighting amalgamate these coefficients to discern the target stimulus. This multistage methodology surpasses traditional techniques, attaining a accuracy of 94.5%.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is presented in the Undergraduate Conference on Intelligent Computing and Systems (UCICS 2025) organised by Varendra University, Rajshahi, Bangladesh, 2025</p></details> |

However, similar to most RGBT fusion tasks, it still mainly relies on manually aligned multimodal image pairs. In this paper, we propose a novel Multimodal Spatio-temporal Graph learning Network (MSGNet) for alignment-free RGBT VOD problem by leveraging the robust graph representation learning model. Specifically, we first design an Adaptive Partitioning Layer (APL) to estimate the corresponding regions of the Thermal image within the RGB image (high-resolution), achieving a preliminary inexact alignment. Then, we introduce the Spatial Sparse Graph Learning Module (S-SGLM) which employs a sparse information passing mechanism on the estimated inexact alignment to achieve reliable information interaction between different modalities. Moreover, to fully exploit the temporal cues for RGBT VOD problem, we introduce Hybrid Structured Temporal Modeling (HSTM), which involves a Temporal Sparse Graph Learning Module (T-SGLM) and Temporal Star Block (TSB). T-SGLM aims to filter out some redundant information between adjacent frames by employing the sparse aggregation mechanism on the temporal graph. Meanwhile, TSB is dedicated to achieving the complementary learning of local spatial relationships. Extensive comparative experiments conducted on both the aligned dataset VT-VOD50 and the unaligned dataset UVT-VOD2024 demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method.

| **[SPOT: Spatio-Temporal Pattern Mining and Optimization for Load Consolidation in Freight Transportation Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09680v1)** | 2025-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Freight consolidation has significant potential to reduce transportation costs and mitigate congestion and pollution. An effective load consolidation plan relies on carefully chosen consolidation points to ensure alignment with existing transportation management processes, such as driver scheduling, personnel planning, and terminal operations. This complexity represents a significant challenge when searching for optimal consolidation strategies. Traditional optimization-based methods provide exact solutions, but their computational complexity makes them impractical for large-scale instances and they fail to leverage historical data. Machine learning-based approaches address these issues but often ignore operational constraints, leading to infeasible consolidation plans. This work proposes SPOT, an end-to-end approach that integrates the benefits of machine learning (ML) and optimization for load consolidation. The ML component plays a key role in the planning phase by identifying the consolidation points through spatio-temporal clustering and constrained frequent itemset mining, while the optimization selects the most cost-effective feasible consolidation routes for a given operational day. Extensive experiments conducted on industrial load data demonstrate that SPOT significantly reduces travel distance and transportation costs (by about 50% on large terminals) compared to the existing industry-standard load planning strategy and a neighborhood-based heuristic. Moreover, the ML component provides valuable tactical-level insights by identifying frequently recurring consolidation opportunities that guide proactive planning. In addition, SPOT is computationally efficient and can be easily scaled to accommodate large transportation networks.</p></details> |  |

While approaches such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and rule-based reward mechanisms demonstrate promise in text and image domains, their application to video understanding remains limited. This paper presents a systematic exploration of Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) with GRPO for video MLLMs, aiming to enhance spatio-temporal perception while maintaining general capabilities. Our experiments reveal that RFT is highly data-efficient for task-specific improvements. Through multi-task RFT on spatio-temporal perception objectives with limited samples, we develop VideoChat-R1, a powerful video MLLM that achieves state-of-the-art performance on spatio-temporal perception tasks without sacrificing chat ability, while exhibiting emerging spatio-temporal reasoning abilities. Compared to Qwen2.5-VL-7B, VideoChat-R1 boosts performance several-fold in tasks like temporal grounding (+31.8) and object tracking (+31.2). Additionally, it significantly improves on general QA benchmarks such as VideoMME (+0.9), MVBench (+1.0), and Perception Test (+0.9). Our findings underscore the potential of RFT for specialized task enhancement of Video MLLMs. We hope our work offers valuable insights for future RL research in video MLLMs.</p></details> |  |

The key challenge of accurate prediction is how to model the complex spatio-temporal dependencies and adapt to the inherent dynamics in data. Traditional Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) often struggle with static adjacency matrices that introduce domain bias or learnable matrices that may be overfitting to specific patterns. This challenge becomes more complex when considering Multi-Task Learning (MTL). While MTL has the potential to enhance prediction accuracy through task synergies, it can also face significant hurdles due to task interference. To overcome these challenges, this study introduces a novel MTL framework, Dynamic Group-wise Spatio-Temporal Multi-Task Learning (DG-STMTL). DG-STMTL proposes a hybrid adjacency matrix generation module that combines static matrices with dynamic ones through a task-specific gating mechanism. We also introduce a group-wise GCN module to enhance the modelling capability of spatio-temporal dependencies. We conduct extensive experiments on two real-world datasets to evaluate our method. Results show that our method outperforms other state-of-the-arts, indicating its effectiveness and robustness.</p></details> |  |

Since such datasets are often incomplete and noisy, it is useful to create the prediction surface of a spatial field. To this end, we consider an online filtering inference by using the Kalman filter based on linear Gaussian state-space models. However, the Kalman filter is impractically time-consuming when the number of locations in spatio-temporal datasets is large. To address this problem, we propose a multi-resolution filter via linear projection (MRF-lp), a fast computation method for online filtering inference. In the MRF-lp, by carrying out a multi-resolution approximation via linear projection (MRA-lp), the forecast covariance matrix can be approximated while capturing both the large- and small-scale spatial variations. As a result of this approximation, our proposed MRF-lp preserves a block-sparse structure of some matrices appearing in the MRF-lp through time, which leads to the scalability of this algorithm. Additionally, we discuss extensions of the MRF-lp to a nonlinear and non-Gaussian case. Simulation studies and real data analysis for total precipitable water vapor demonstrate that our proposed approach performs well compared with the related methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>44 pa...</summary><p>44 pages, 10 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[SpaceVLLM: Endowing Multimodal Large Language Model with Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding Capability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13983v3)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made remarkable progress in either temporal or spatial localization. However, they struggle to perform spatio-temporal video grounding. This limitation stems from two major challenges. Firstly, it is difficult to extract accurate spatio-temporal information of each frame in the video. Secondly, the substantial number of visual tokens makes it challenging to precisely map visual tokens of each frame to their corresponding spatial coordinates. To address these issues, we introduce SpaceVLLM, a MLLM endowed with spatio-temporal video grounding capability. Specifically, we adopt a set of interleaved Spatio-Temporal Aware Queries to capture temporal perception and dynamic spatial information. Moreover, we propose a Query-Guided Space Decoder to establish a corresponding connection between the queries and spatial coordinates. Additionally, due to the lack of spatio-temporal datasets, we construct the Unified Spatio-Temporal Grounding (Uni-STG) dataset, comprising 480K instances across three tasks. This dataset fully exploits the potential of MLLM to simultaneously facilitate localization in both temporal and spatial dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SpaceVLLM achieves the state-of-the-art performance across 11 benchmarks covering temporal, spatial, spatio-temporal and video understanding tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach. Our code, datasets and model will be released at https://github.com/Jayce1kk/SpaceVLLM.</p></details> |  |

Traditional models often rely on parametric kernels, limiting their ability to capture heterogeneous, nonstationary dynamics. Recent innovations integrate deep neural architectures -- either by modeling the conditional intensity function directly or by learning flexible, data-driven influence kernels, substantially broadening their expressive power. This article reviews the development of the deep influence kernel approach, which enjoys statistical explainability, since the influence kernel remains in the model to capture the spatiotemporal propagation of event influence and its impact on future events, while also possessing strong expressive power, thereby benefiting from both worlds. We explain the main components in developing deep kernel point processes, leveraging tools such as functional basis decomposition and graph neural networks to encode complex spatial or network structures, as well as estimation using both likelihood-based and likelihood-free methods, and address computational scalability for large-scale data. We also discuss the theoretical foundation of kernel identifiability. Simulated and real-data examples highlight applications to crime analysis, earthquake aftershock prediction, and sepsis prediction modeling, and we conclude by discussing promising directions for the field.</p></details> |  |
| **[STNAGNN: Data-driven Spatio-temporal Brain Connectivity beyond FC](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12065v2)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely applied in the analysis of brain fMRI, yet defining the connectivity between ROIs remains a challenge in noisy fMRI data. Among all approaches, Functional Connectome (FC) is the most popular method. Computed by the correlation coefficients between ROI time series, FC is a powerful and computationally efficient way to estimate ROI connectivity. However, it is well known for neglecting structural connections and causality in ROI interactions. Also, FC becomes much more noisy in the short spatio-temporal sliding-window subsequences of fMRI. Effective Connectome (EC) is proposed as a directional alternative, but is difficult to accurately estimate. Furthermore, for optimal GNN performance, usually only a small percentage of the strongest connections are selected as sparse edges, resulting in oversimplification of complex brain connections. To tackle these challenges, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Node Attention Graph Neural Network (STNAGNN) as a data-driven alternative that combines sparse predefined FC with dense data-driven spatio-temporal connections, allowing for flexible and spatio-temporal learning of ROI interaction patterns.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by recent advances in vision-language foundation models, we investigate their utility for WSTVG, leveraging their zero-shot grounding capabilities. However, we find that a simple adaptation lacks essential spatio-temporal grounding abilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce Tubelet Referral Grounding (TRG), which connects textual queries to tubelets to enable spatio-temporal predictions. Despite its promise, TRG struggles with compositional action understanding and dense scene scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose STPro, a novel progressive learning framework with two key modules: (1) Sub-Action Temporal Curriculum Learning (SA-TCL), which incrementally builds compositional action understanding, and (2) Congestion-Guided Spatial Curriculum Learning (CG-SCL), which adapts the model to complex scenes by spatially increasing task difficulty. STPro achieves state-of-the-art results on three benchmark datasets, with improvements of 1.0% on VidSTG-Declarative and 3.0% on HCSTVG-v1.</p></details> | CVPR'25 Conference |

Although spatio-temporal traffic prediction has received extensive research attention, further improvements in prediction accuracy and computational efficiency remain necessary. In particular, existing decomposition-based methods or hybrid architectures often incur heavy overhead when capturing local and global feature correlations, necessitating novel approaches that optimize accuracy and complexity. In this paper, we propose an efficient spatio-temporal network traffic prediction framework, DP-LET, which consists of a data processing module, a local feature enhancement module, and a Transformer-based prediction module. The data processing module is designed for high-efficiency denoising of network data and spatial decoupling. In contrast, the local feature enhancement module leverages multiple Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) to capture fine-grained local features. Meanwhile, the prediction module utilizes a Transformer encoder to model long-term dependencies and assess feature relevance. A case study on real-world cellular traffic prediction demonstrates the practicality of DP-LET, which maintains low computational complexity while achieving state-of-the-art performance, significantly reducing MSE by 31.8% and MAE by 23.1% compared to baseline models.</p></details> | 6 pages |

We would like to verify these systems during runtime when they are deployed. Thus, we propose robust predictive runtime verification (RPRV) algorithms for: (1) general stochastic CPS under signal temporal logic (STL) tasks, and (2) stochastic multi-agent systems (MAS) under spatio-temporal logic tasks. The RPRV problem presents the following challenges: (1) there may not be sufficient data on the behavior of the deployed CPS, (2) predictive models based on design phase system trajectories may encounter distribution shift during real-world deployment, and (3) the algorithms need to scale to the complexity of MAS and be applicable to spatio-temporal logic tasks. To address these challenges, we assume knowledge of an upper bound on the statistical distance (in terms of an f-divergence) between the trajectory distributions of the system at deployment and design time. We are motivated by our prior work [1, 2] where we proposed an accurate and an interpretable RPRV algorithm for general CPS, which we here extend to the MAS setting and spatio-temporal logic tasks. Specifically, we use a learned predictive model to estimate the system behavior at runtime and robust conformal prediction to obtain probabilistic guarantees by accounting for distribution shifts. Building on [1], we perform robust conformal prediction over the robust semantics of spatio-temporal reach and escape logic (STREL) to obtain centralized RPRV algorithms for MAS. We empirically validate our results in a drone swarm simulator, where we show the scalability of our RPRV algorithms to MAS and analyze the impact of different trajectory predictors on the verification result. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first statistically valid algorithms for MAS under distribution shift.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2311.09482</p></details> |
| **[Towards Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning based Traffic Signal Control through Spatio-temporal Hypergraphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11014v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic signal control systems (TSCSs) are integral to intelligent traffic management, fostering efficient vehicle flow. Traditional approaches often simplify road networks into standard graphs, which results in a failure to consider the dynamic nature of traffic data at neighboring intersections, thereby neglecting higher-order interconnections necessary for real-time control. To address this, we propose a novel TSCS framework to realize intelligent traffic control. This framework collaborates with multiple neighboring edge computing servers to collect traffic information across the road network. To elevate the efficiency of traffic signal control, we have crafted a multi-agent soft actor-critic (MA-SAC) reinforcement learning algorithm. Within this algorithm, individual agents are deployed at each intersection with a mandate to optimize traffic flow across the road network collectively. Furthermore, we introduce hypergraph learning into the critic network of MA-SAC to enable the spatio-temporal interactions from multiple intersections in the road network. This method fuses hypergraph and spatio-temporal graph structures to encode traffic data and capture the complex spatio-temporal correlations between multiple intersections.

| **[Decoding Covert Speech from EEG Using a Functional Areas Spatio-Temporal Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03762v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Covert speech involves imagining speaking without audible sound or any movements. Decoding covert speech from electroencephalogram (EEG) is challenging due to a limited understanding of neural pronunciation mapping and the low signal-to-noise ratio of the signal. In this study, we developed a large-scale multi-utterance speech EEG dataset from 57 right-handed native English-speaking subjects, each performing covert and overt speech tasks by repeating the same word in five utterances within a ten-second duration. Given the spatio-temporal nature of the neural activation process during speech pronunciation, we developed a Functional Areas Spatio-temporal Transformer (FAST), an effective framework for converting EEG signals into tokens and utilizing transformer architecture for sequence encoding. Our results reveal distinct and interpretable speech neural features by the visualization of FAST-generated activation maps across frontal and temporal brain regions with each word being covertly spoken, providing new insights into the discriminative features of the neural representation of covert speech. This is the first report of such a study, which provides interpretable evidence for speech decoding from EEG. The code for this work has been made public at https://github.com/Jiang-Muyun/FAST</p></details> |  |
| **[DRAN: A Distribution and Relation Adaptive Network for Spatio-temporal Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01531v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate predictions of spatio-temporal systems' states are crucial for tasks such as system management, control, and crisis prevention. However, the inherent time variance of spatio-temporal systems poses challenges to achieving accurate predictions whenever stationarity is not granted. To address non-stationarity frameworks, we propose a Distribution and Relation Adaptive Network (DRAN) capable of dynamically adapting to relation and distribution changes over time. While temporal normalization and de-normalization are frequently used techniques to adapt to distribution shifts, this operation is not suitable for the spatio-temporal context as temporal normalization scales the time series of nodes and possibly disrupts the spatial relations among nodes. In order to address this problem, we develop a Spatial Factor Learner (SFL) module that enables the normalization and de-normalization process in spatio-temporal systems. To adapt to dynamic changes in spatial relationships among sensors, we propose a Dynamic-Static Fusion Learner (DSFL) module that effectively integrates features learned from both dynamic and static relations through an adaptive fusion ratio mechanism. Furthermore, we introduce a Stochastic Learner to capture the noisy components of spatio-temporal representations. Our approach outperforms state of the art methods in weather prediction and traffic flows forecasting tasks. Experimental results show that our SFL efficiently preserves spatial relationships across various temporal normalization operations. Visualizations of the learned dynamic and static relations demonstrate that DSFL can capture both local and distant relationships between nodes. Moreover, ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each component.</p></details> | 15 pages, 9 figures |

Such data occurs widely, ranging from the scientific and medical domains to the industrial and environmental domains. When the properties in time series exhibit spatial variations, we often call the data spatio-temporal. As part of the continued digitalization of processes throughout society, increasingly large volumes of time series and spatio-temporal data are available. In this tutorial, we focus on data-driven decision making with such data, e.g., enabling greener and more efficient transportation based on traffic time series forecasting. The tutorial adopts the holistic paradigm of ``data-governance-analytics-decision.'' We first introduce the data foundation of time series and spatio-temporal data, which is often heterogeneous. Next, we discuss data governance methods that aim to improve data quality. We then cover data analytics, focusing on the ``AGREE'' principles: Automation, Generalization, Robustness, Explainability, and Efficiency. We finally cover data-driven decision making strategies and briefly discuss promising research directions. We hope that the tutorial will serve as a primary resource for researchers and practitioners who are interested in value creation from time series and spatio-temporal data.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by ICDE 2025</p></details> |
| **[AttentiveGRU: Recurrent Spatio-Temporal Modeling for Advanced Radar-Based BEV Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00559v1)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bird's-eye view (BEV) object detection has become important for advanced automotive 3D radar-based perception systems. However, the inherently sparse and non-deterministic nature of radar data limits the effectiveness of traditional single-frame BEV paradigms. In this paper, we addresses this limitation by introducing AttentiveGRU, a novel attention-based recurrent approach tailored for radar constraints, which extracts individualized spatio-temporal context for objects by dynamically identifying and fusing temporally correlated structures across present and memory states. By leveraging the consistency of object's latent representation over time, our approach exploits temporal relations to enrich feature representations for both stationary and moving objects, thereby enhancing detection performance and eliminating the need for externally providing or estimating any information about ego vehicle motion. Our experimental results on the public nuScenes dataset show a significant increase in mAP for the car category by 21% over the best radar-only submission. Further evaluations on an additional dataset demonstrate notable improvements in object detection capabilities, underscoring the applicability and effectiveness of our method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimizing Spatio-Temporal Information Processing in Spiking Neural Networks via Unconstrained Leaky Integrate-and-Fire Neurons and Hybrid Coding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12407v2)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) exhibit higher energy efficiency compared to Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) due to their unique spike-driven mechanism. Additionally, SNN possess a crucial characteristic, namely the ability to process spatio-temporal information. However, this ability is constrained by both internal and external factors in practical applications, thereby affecting the performance of SNN. Firstly, the internal issue of SNN lies in the inherent limitations of their network structure and neuronal model, which result in the network adopting a unified processing approach for information of different temporal dimensions when processing input data containing complex temporal information. Secondly, the external issue of SNN stems from the direct encoding method commonly adopted by directly trained SNN, which uses the same feature map for input at each time step, failing to fully exploit the spatio-temporal characteristics of SNN. To address these issues, this paper proposes an Unconstrained Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (ULIF) neuronal model that allows for learning different membrane potential parameters at different time steps, thereby enhancing SNN' ability to process information of different temporal dimensions. Additionally, this paper presents a hybrid encoding scheme aimed at solving the problem of direct encoding lacking temporal dimension information. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods effectively improve the overall performance of SNN in object detection and object recognition tasks. related code is available at https://github.com/hhx0320/ASNN.</p></details> |  |
| **[EventMamba: Enhancing Spatio-Temporal Locality with State Space Models for Event-Based Video Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19721v3)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging its robust linear global modeling capability, Mamba has notably excelled in computer vision. Despite its success, existing Mamba-based vision models have overlooked the nuances of event-driven tasks, especially in video reconstruction. Event-based video reconstruction (EBVR) demands spatial translation invariance and close attention to local event relationships in the spatio-temporal domain. Unfortunately, conventional Mamba algorithms apply static window partitions and standard reshape scanning methods, leading to significant losses in local connectivity. To overcome these limitations, we introduce EventMamba--a specialized model designed for EBVR tasks. EventMamba innovates by incorporating random window offset (RWO) in the spatial domain, moving away from the restrictive fixed partitioning. Additionally, it features a new consistent traversal serialization approach in the spatio-temporal domain, which maintains the proximity of adjacent events both spatially and temporally. These enhancements enable EventMamba to retain Mamba's robust modeling capabilities while significantly preserving the spatio-temporal locality of event data. Comprehensive testing on multiple datasets shows that EventMamba markedly enhances video reconstruction, drastically improving computation speed while delivering superior visual quality compared to Transformer-based methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[UniFlow: A Foundation Model for Unified Urban Spatio-Temporal Flow Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12972v3)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban spatio-temporal flow prediction, encompassing traffic flows and crowd flows, is crucial for optimizing city infrastructure and managing traffic and emergency responses. Traditional approaches have relied on separate models tailored to either grid-based data, representing cities as uniform cells, or graph-based data, modeling cities as networks of nodes and edges. In this paper, we build UniFlow, a foundational model for general urban flow prediction that unifies both grid-based and graphbased data. We first design a multi-view spatio-temporal patching mechanism to standardize different data into a consistent sequential format and then introduce a spatio-temporal transformer architecture to capture complex correlations and dynamics. To leverage shared spatio-temporal patterns across different data types and facilitate effective cross-learning, we propose SpatioTemporal Memory Retrieval Augmentation (ST-MRA). By creating structured memory modules to store shared spatio-temporal patterns, ST-MRA enhances predictions through adaptive memory retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniFlow outperforms existing models in both grid-based and graph-based flow prediction, excelling particularly in scenarios with limited data availability, showcasing its superior performance and broad applicability. The datasets and code implementation have been released on https://github.com/YuanYuan98/UniFlow.</p></details> |  |

We reformulate the optimality conditions into a variational problem involving both the state and adjoint. This problem is shown to be equivalent to our optimal control problem. Based on fully unstructured, space-time interface-fitted meshes, we propose and analyze a Petrov-Galerkin approximation of the problem. An optimal error estimate with respect to a discrete norm is established under a specific regularity assumption on the state and adjoint. Several numerical results are presented to corroborate our theoretical results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data-Driven LQR with Finite-Time Experiments via Extremum-Seeking Policy Iteration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02758v3)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we address Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) problems through a novel iterative algorithm named EXtremum-seeking Policy iteration LQR (EXP-LQR). The peculiarity of EXP-LQR is that it only needs access to a truncated approximation of the infinite-horizon cost associated to a given policy. Hence, EXP-LQR does not need the direct knowledge of neither the system and cost matrices. In particular, at each iteration, EXP-LQR refines the maintained policy using a truncated LQR cost retrieved by performing finite-time virtual or real experiments in which a perturbed version of the current policy is employed. Such a perturbation is done according to an extremum-seeking mechanism and makes the overall algorithm a time-varying nonlinear system. By using a Lyapunov-based approach exploiting averaging theory, we show that EXP-LQR exponentially converges to an arbitrarily small neighborhood of the optimal gain matrix. We corroborate the theoretical results with numerical simulations involving the control of an induction motor.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sample Complexity and Representation Ability of Test-time Scaling Paradigms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05295v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test-time scaling paradigms have significantly advanced the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) on complex tasks. Despite their empirical success, theoretical understanding of the sample efficiency of various test-time strategies -- such as self-consistency, best-of-$n$, and self-correction -- remains limited. In this work, we first establish a separation result between two repeated sampling strategies: self-consistency requires $\Theta(1/\Delta^2)$ samples to produce the correct answer, while best-of-$n$ only needs $\Theta(1/\Delta)$, where $\Delta < 1$ denotes the probability gap between the correct and second most likely answers. Next, we present an expressiveness result for the self-correction approach with verifier feedback: it enables Transformers to simulate online learning over a pool of experts at test time. Therefore, a single Transformer architecture can provably solve multiple tasks without prior knowledge of the specific task associated with a user query, extending the representation theory of Transformers from single-task to multi-task settings. Finally, we empirically validate our theoretical results, demonstrating the practical effectiveness of self-correction methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Combined Parallel-in-time Direct Inverse (ParaDIn)-Parareal Method for Nonlinear Differential Equations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10820v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As has been shown in our previous work, the parallel-in-time direct inverse (ParaDIn) method introduced by Yamaleev and Paudel in (arXiv: 2406.00878v1, 2024) imposes some constraint on the maximum number of time levels, $N_t$, that can be integrated in parallel. To circumvent this problem and further increase the speedup, we combine the ParaDIn method with the Parareal algorithm to efficiently parallelize the first-order time derivative term in nonlinear partial differential equations discretized by the method of lines. The main idea of the proposed approach is to use a block-Jacobi preconditioner, so that each block is solved by using the ParaDIn method. To accelerate the convergence of Jacobi iterations, we use the Parareal method which can be interpreted as a two-level multigrid method in time. In contrast to the conventional Parareal algorithm whose coarse grid correction step is performed sequentially, both the coarse- and fine-grid propagators in the proposed approach are implemented in parallel by using the ParaDIn method, thus significantly increasing the parallel performance of the combined algorithm. Numerical results show that the new combined ParaDIn-Parareal method provides the speedup of up to 124 on 480 computing cores as compared with the sequential first-order implicit backward difference (BDF1) scheme for the 2-D nonlinear heat and Burgers equations with both smooth and discontinuous solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2406.00878</p></details> |
| **[Reduced-Order Time Splitting for Navier-Stokes with Open Boundaries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10763v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we propose a Proper Orthogonal Decomposition-Reduced Order Model (POD-ROM) applied to time-splitting schemes for solving the Navier-Stokes equations with open boundary conditions. In this method, we combine three strategies to reduce the computing time to solve NSE: time splitting, reduction of the computational domain through non-standard treatment of open boundary conditions and reduced order modelling. To make the work self-contained, we first present the formulation of the time-splitting scheme applied to the Navier-Stokes equations with open boundary conditions, employing a first-order Euler time discretization and deriving the non-standard boundary condition for pressure. Then, we construct a Galerkin projection-based ROM using POD with two different treatments of the pressure boundary condition on the outlet. We propose a comparative performance analysis between the standard projection-based POD-ROM (fully intrusive) and a hybrid POD-ROM that combines a projection-based approach (intrusive) with a data-driven technique (non-intrusive) using Radial Basis Functions (RBF). We illustrate this comparison through two different numerical tests: the flow in a bifurcated tube and the benchmark numerical test of the flow past cylinder, numerically investigating the efficiency and accuracy of both ROMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[TSFM-Bench: A Comprehensive and Unified Benchmark of Foundation Models for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11802v6)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time Series Forecasting (TSF) is key functionality in numerous fields, such as financial investment, weather services, and energy management. Although increasingly capable TSF methods occur, many of them require domain-specific data collection and model training and do not generalize well when applied in other domains. Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) that are pre-trained on massive heterogeneous time series data aim to overcome these limitations. The prospects for generalizability have spurred the development of a new generation of TSFMs. This study proposes a benchmark, TSFM-Bench, to facilitate comprehensive and unified evaluation of TSFMs. TSFM-Bench covers a wide range of TSFMs, including those based on large language models and those pre-trained on time series data. TSFM-Bench supports multiple forecasting scenarios, including zero-shot, few-shot, and full-shot, enabling assessment across the full range of adaptation strategies. TSFM-Bench also provides a standardized experimental protocols for critical evaluation processes such as dataset splitting, loading, normalization, and few-shot sampling, facilitating consistency and fairness. We report on an extensive evaluation of TSFMs across a diverse range of datasets spanning multiple domains and exhibiting varied statistical characteristics. Specifically, we identify pros and cons and inherent limitations of existing TSFMs, and we propose potential directions for new model designs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time Series Forecasting as Reasoning: A Slow-Thinking Approach with Reinforced LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10630v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To advance time series forecasting (TSF), various methods have been proposed to improve prediction accuracy, evolving from statistical techniques to data-driven deep learning architectures. Despite their effectiveness, most existing methods still adhere to a fast thinking paradigm-relying on extracting historical patterns and mapping them to future values as their core modeling philosophy, lacking an explicit thinking process that incorporates intermediate time series reasoning. Meanwhile, emerging slow-thinking LLMs (e.g., OpenAI-o1) have shown remarkable multi-step reasoning capabilities, offering an alternative way to overcome these issues. However, prompt engineering alone presents several limitations - including high computational cost, privacy risks, and limited capacity for in-depth domain-specific time series reasoning. To address these limitations, a more promising approach is to train LLMs to develop slow thinking capabilities and acquire strong time series reasoning skills. For this purpose, we propose Time-R1, a two-stage reinforcement fine-tuning framework designed to enhance multi-step reasoning ability of LLMs for time series forecasting. Specifically, the first stage conducts supervised fine-tuning for warmup adaptation, while the second stage employs reinforcement learning to improve the model's generalization ability. Particularly, we design a fine-grained multi-objective reward specifically for time series forecasting, and then introduce GRIP (group-based relative importance for policy optimization), which leverages non-uniform sampling to further encourage and optimize the model's exploration of effective reasoning paths. Experiments demonstrate that Time-R1 significantly improves forecast performance across diverse datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inference-Time Decomposition of Activations (ITDA): A Scalable Approach to Interpreting Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17769v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are a popular method for decomposing Large Langage Models (LLM) activations into interpretable latents. However, due to their substantial training cost, most academic research uses open-source SAEs which are only available for a restricted set of models of up to 27B parameters. SAE latents are also learned from a dataset of activations, which means they do not transfer between models. Motivated by relative representation similarity measures, we introduce Inference-Time Decomposition of Activations (ITDA) models, an alternative method for decomposing language model activations. To train an ITDA, we greedily construct a dictionary of language model activations on a dataset of prompts, selecting those activations which were worst approximated by matching pursuit on the existing dictionary. ITDAs can be trained in just 1% of the time required for SAEs, using 1% of the data. This allowed us to train ITDAs on Llama-3.1 70B and 405B on a single consumer GPU. ITDAs can achieve similar reconstruction performance to SAEs on some target LLMs, but generally incur a performance penalty. However, ITDA dictionaries enable cross-model comparisons, and a simple Jaccard similarity index on ITDA dictionaries outperforms existing methods like CKA, SVCCA, and relative representation similarity metrics. ITDAs provide a cheap alternative to SAEs where computational resources are limited, or when cross model comparisons are necessary.

| **[CORT: Class-Oriented Real-time Tracking for Embedded Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17521v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ever-increasing use of artificial intelligence in autonomous systems has significantly contributed to advance the research on multi-object tracking, adopted in several real-time applications (e.g., autonomous driving, surveillance drones, robotics) to localize and follow the trajectory of multiple objects moving in front of a camera. Current tracking algorithms can be divided into two main categories: some approaches introduce complex heuristics and re-identification models to improve the tracking accuracy and reduce the number of identification switches, without particular attention to the timing performance, whereas other approaches are aimed at reducing response times by removing the re-identification phase, thus penalizing the tracking accuracy. This work proposes a new approach to multi-class object tracking that allows achieving smaller and more predictable execution times, without penalizing the tracking performance. The idea is to reduce the problem of matching predictions with detections into smaller sub-problems by splitting the Hungarian matrix by class and invoking the second re-identification stage only when strictly necessary for a smaller number of elements. The proposed solution was evaluated in complex urban scenarios with several objects of different types (as cars, trucks, bikes, and pedestrians), showing the effectiveness of the multi-class approach with respect to state of the art trackers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Wider or Deeper? Scaling LLM Inference-Time Compute with Adaptive Branching Tree Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04412v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances demonstrate that increasing inference-time computation can significantly boost the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Although repeated sampling (i.e., generating multiple candidate outputs) is a highly effective strategy, it does not leverage external feedback signals for refinement, which are often available in tasks like coding. In this work, we propose Adaptive Branching Monte Carlo Tree Search (AB-MCTS), a novel inference-time framework that generalizes repeated sampling with principled multi-turn exploration and exploitation. At each node in the search tree, AB-MCTS dynamically decides whether to "go wider" by expanding new candidate responses or "go deeper" by revisiting existing ones based on external feedback signals. We evaluate our method on complex coding and engineering tasks using frontier models. Empirical results show that AB-MCTS consistently outperforms both repeated sampling and standard MCTS, underscoring the importance of combining the response diversity of LLMs with multi-turn solution refinement for effective inference-time scaling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at ICLR 2025 Workshop on Foundation Models in the Wild</p></details> |

However, existing benchmarks typically assume clean, regularly sampled, unimodal data, creating a significant gap between research and real-world deployment. We introduce Time-IMM, a dataset specifically designed to capture cause-driven irregularity in multimodal multivariate time series. Time-IMM represents nine distinct types of time series irregularity, categorized into trigger-based, constraint-based, and artifact-based mechanisms. Complementing the dataset, we introduce IMM-TSF, a benchmark library for forecasting on irregular multimodal time series, enabling asynchronous integration and realistic evaluation. IMM-TSF includes specialized fusion modules, including a timestamp-to-text fusion module and a multimodality fusion module, which support both recency-aware averaging and attention-based integration strategies. Empirical results demonstrate that explicitly modeling multimodality on irregular time series data leads to substantial gains in forecasting performance. Time-IMM and IMM-TSF provide a foundation for advancing time series analysis under real-world conditions. The dataset is publicly available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blacksnail789521/time-imm/data, and the benchmark library can be accessed at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/IMMTSF_NeurIPS2025.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is currently under review</p></details> |

We introduce EQA-RM, a novel generative multimodal reward model specifically architected for EQA, trained via our innovative Contrastive Group Relative Policy Optimization (C-GRPO) strategy to learn fine-grained behavioral distinctions. The generative nature of EQA-RM provides interpretable, structured reward feedback (beyond simple scalars), uniquely enabling test-time scaling to dynamically adjust evaluation granularity, from concise scores to detailed critiques of reasoning and grounding, at inference without retraining. Concurrently, we introduce EQARewardBench, a new benchmark built on OpenEQA for standardized EQA reward model assessment. Demonstrating high sample efficiency, EQA-RM (fine-tuning Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct) achieves 61.9\% accuracy on EQA-RM-Bench with only 700 samples, outperforming strong proprietary baselines, including Gemini-2.5-Flash, GPT-4o, Claude-3.5-Haiku, and open-sourced state-of-the-art models such as RoVRM and VisualPRM.

However, user preferences are usually personalized, changing, and diverse regarding culture, values, or time. This leads to the problem that the actual user preferences often do not coincide with those trained by the model developers in the practical use of LLMs. Since we cannot collect enough data and retrain for every demand, researching efficient real-time preference adaptation methods based on the backbone LLMs during test time is important. To this end, we introduce Amulet, a novel, training-free framework that formulates the decoding process of every token as a separate online learning problem with the guidance of simple user-provided prompts, thus enabling real-time optimization to satisfy users' personalized preferences. To reduce the computational cost brought by this optimization process for each token, we additionally provide a closed-form solution for each iteration step of the optimization process, thereby reducing the computational time cost to a negligible level. The detailed experimental results demonstrate that Amulet can achieve significant performance improvements in rich settings with combinations of different LLMs, datasets, and user preferences, while maintaining acceptable computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025, Project page: https://zowiezhang.github.io/projects/Amulet</p></details> |
| **[Learning-Based Stable Optimal Control for Infinite-Time Nonlinear Regulation Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10291v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Infinite-time nonlinear optimal regulation control is widely utilized in aerospace engineering as a systematic method for synthesizing stable controllers. However, conventional methods often rely on linearization hypothesis, while recent learning-based approaches rarely consider stability guarantees. This paper proposes a learning-based framework to learn a stable optimal controller for nonlinear optimal regulation problems. First, leveraging the equivalence between Pontryagin Maximum Principle (PMP) and Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation, we improve the backward generation of optimal examples (BGOE) method for infinite-time optimal regulation problems. A state-transition-matrix-guided data generation method is then proposed to efficiently generate a complete dataset that covers the desired state space. Finally, we incorporate the Lyapunov stability condition into the learning framework, ensuring the stability of the learned optimal policy by jointly learning the optimal value function and control policy. Simulations on three nonlinear optimal regulation problems show that the learned optimal policy achieves near-optimal regulation control and the code is provided at https://github.com/wong-han/PaperNORC</p></details> |  |

Additionally, the integration of differentiable digital signal processing (DDSP) enables efficient vocoding directly from articulatory features, significantly reducing conversion latency. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that, while maintaining synthesis quality comparable to the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) method, RT-VC achieves a CPU latency of 61.4 ms, representing a 13.3\% reduction in latency.</p></details> | ACL Demo Track 2025 |
| **[TimeBridge: Better Diffusion Prior Design with Bridge Models for Time Series Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06672v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series generation is widely used in real-world applications such as simulation, data augmentation, and hypothesis testing. Recently, diffusion models have emerged as the de facto approach to time series generation, enabling diverse synthesis scenarios. However, the fixed standard-Gaussian diffusion prior may be ill-suited for general time series data, such as temporal order and fixed points. In this paper, we propose TimeBridge, a framework that flexibly synthesizes time series data by using diffusion bridges to learn paths between a chosen prior and the data distribution. We then explore several prior designs tailored to time series synthesis. Our framework covers (i) data- and time-dependent priors for unconditional generation and (ii) scale-preserving priors for conditional generation. Experiments show that our framework with data-driven priors outperforms standard diffusion models on time series generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ground Reaction Force Estimation via Time-aware Knowledge Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10265v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human gait analysis with wearable sensors has been widely used in various applications, such as daily life healthcare, rehabilitation, physical therapy, and clinical diagnostics and monitoring. In particular, ground reaction force (GRF) provides critical information about how the body interacts with the ground during locomotion. Although instrumented treadmills have been widely used as the gold standard for measuring GRF during walking, their lack of portability and high cost make them impractical for many applications. As an alternative, low-cost, portable, wearable insole sensors have been utilized to measure GRF; however, these sensors are susceptible to noise and disturbance and are less accurate than treadmill measurements. To address these challenges, we propose a Time-aware Knowledge Distillation framework for GRF estimation from insole sensor data. This framework leverages similarity and temporal features within a mini-batch during the knowledge distillation process, effectively capturing the complementary relationships between features and the sequential properties of the target and input data. The performance of the lightweight models distilled through this framework was evaluated by comparing GRF estimations from insole sensor data against measurements from an instrumented treadmill. Empirical results demonstrated that Time-aware Knowledge Distillation outperforms current baselines in GRF estimation from wearable sensor data.</p></details> |  |

| **[ETS: Efficient Tree Search for Inference-Time Scaling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13575v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test-time compute scaling has emerged as a new axis along which to improve model accuracy, where additional computation is used at inference time to allow the model to think longer for more challenging problems. One promising approach for test-time compute scaling is search against a process reward model, where a model generates multiple potential candidates at each step of the search, and these partial trajectories are then scored by a separate reward model in order to guide the search process. The diversity of trajectories in the tree search process affects the accuracy of the search, since increasing diversity promotes more exploration. However, this diversity comes at a cost, as divergent trajectories have less KV sharing, which means they consume more memory and slow down the search process. Previous search methods either do not perform sufficient exploration, or else explore diverse trajectories but have high latency. We address this challenge by proposing Efficient Tree Search (ETS), which promotes KV sharing by pruning redundant trajectories while maintaining necessary diverse trajectories. ETS incorporates a linear programming cost model to promote KV cache sharing by penalizing the number of nodes retained, while incorporating a semantic coverage term into the cost model to ensure that we retain trajectories which are semantically different. We demonstrate how ETS can achieve 1.8$\times$ reduction in average KV cache size during the search process, leading to 1.4$\times$ increased throughput relative to prior state-of-the-art methods, with minimal accuracy degradation and without requiring any custom kernel implementation.

In this work, we introduce VISTA (Vision-Language Inference for Stock Time-series Analysis), a novel, training-free framework that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for multi-modal stock forecasting. VISTA prompts a VLM with both textual representations of historical stock prices and their corresponding line charts to predict future price values. By combining numerical and visual modalities in a zero-shot setting and using carefully designed chain-of-thought prompts, VISTA captures complementary patterns that unimodal approaches often miss. We benchmark VISTA against standard baselines, including ARIMA and text-only LLM-based prompting methods. Experimental results show that VISTA outperforms these baselines by up to 89.83%, demonstrating the effectiveness of multi-modal inference for stock time-series analysis and highlighting the potential of VLMs in financial forecasting tasks without requiring task-specific training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the CVPR 2025 Workshop on Transformers for Vision (T4V): https://sites.google.com/view/t4v-cvpr25/accepted-papers</p></details> |

Feed-forward scene reconstruction has gained significant attention for its ability to rapidly create digital replicas of real-world environments. However, most existing models are limited to static scenes and fail to reconstruct the motion of moving objects. Developing a feed-forward model for dynamic scene reconstruction poses significant challenges, including the scarcity of training data and the need for appropriate 3D representations and training paradigms. To address these challenges, we introduce several key technical contributions: an enhanced large-scale synthetic dataset with ground-truth multi-view videos and dense 3D scene flow supervision; a per-pixel deformable 3D Gaussian representation that is easy to learn, supports high-quality dynamic view synthesis, and enables long-range 3D tracking; and a large transformer network that achieves real-time, generalizable dynamic scene reconstruction. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that DGS-LRM achieves dynamic scene reconstruction quality comparable to optimization-based methods, while significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art predictive dynamic reconstruction method on real-world examples. Its predicted physically grounded 3D deformation is accurate and can readily adapt for long-range 3D tracking tasks, achieving performance on par with state-of-the-art monocular video 3D tracking methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://hubert0527.github.io/dgslrm/</p></details> |

This literature review explores how modern event-driven and microservices-based architectures, particularly those leveraging Apache Kafka, Spring Boot, MongoDB, and Kubernetes are transforming retail and financial systems. By systematically reviewing academic publications, technical white papers, and industry reports from recent years, this study synthesizes key themes and implementation strategies. The analysis reveals that technologies like Kafka and Spring Boot are instrumental in building low-latency, event-driven applications that support real-time analytics and fraud detection, while MongoDB, when deployed on Kubernetes, ensures fault tolerance and high availability in inventory and transaction systems. Kubernetes itself plays a crucial role in automating deployment and scaling of microservices. These findings provide valuable insights for industry practitioners aiming to design scalable infrastructures, identify research opportunities in hybrid deployment models, and offer educators a foundation to integrate modern system architectures into professional and technical communication training.</p></details> |  |

| **[Mamba time series forecasting with uncertainty quantification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10873v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State space models, such as Mamba, have recently garnered attention in time series forecasting due to their ability to capture sequence patterns. However, in electricity consumption benchmarks, Mamba forecasts exhibit a mean error of approximately 8\%. Similarly, in traffic occupancy benchmarks, the mean error reaches 18\%. This discrepancy leaves us to wonder whether the prediction is simply inaccurate or falls within error given spread in historical data. To address this limitation, we propose a method to quantify the predictive uncertainty of Mamba forecasts. Here, we propose a dual-network framework based on the Mamba architecture for probabilistic forecasting, where one network generates point forecasts while the other estimates predictive uncertainty by modeling variance. We abbreviate our tool, Mamba with probabilistic time series forecasting, as Mamba-ProbTSF and the code for its implementation is available on GitHub (https://github.com/PessoaP/Mamba-ProbTSF). Evaluating this approach on synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets, we find Kullback-Leibler divergence between the learned distributions and the data--which, in the limit of infinite data, should converge to zero if the model correctly captures the underlying probability distribution--reduced to the order of $10^{-3}$ for synthetic data and $10^{-1}$ for real-world benchmark, demonstrating its effectiveness. We find that in both the electricity consumption and traffic occupancy benchmark, the true trajectory stays within the predicted uncertainty interval at the two-sigma level about 95\% of the time. We end with a consideration of potential limitations, adjustments to improve performance, and considerations for applying this framework to processes for purely or largely stochastic dynamics where the stochastic changes accumulate, as observed for example in pure Brownian motion or molecular dynamics trajectories.</p></details> |  |
| **[TransGI: Real-Time Dynamic Global Illumination With Object-Centric Neural Transfer Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09909v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural rendering algorithms have revolutionized computer graphics, yet their impact on real-time rendering under arbitrary lighting conditions remains limited due to strict latency constraints in practical applications. The key challenge lies in formulating a compact yet expressive material representation. To address this, we propose TransGI, a novel neural rendering method for real-time, high-fidelity global illumination. It comprises an object-centric neural transfer model for material representation and a radiance-sharing lighting system for efficient illumination. Traditional BSDF representations and spatial neural material representations lack expressiveness, requiring thousands of ray evaluations to converge to noise-free colors. Conversely, real-time methods trade quality for efficiency by supporting only diffuse materials. In contrast, our object-centric neural transfer model achieves compactness and expressiveness through an MLP-based decoder and vertex-attached latent features, supporting glossy effects with low memory overhead. For dynamic, varying lighting conditions, we introduce local light probes capturing scene radiance, coupled with an across-probe radiance-sharing strategy for efficient probe generation. We implemented our method in a real-time rendering engine, combining compute shaders and CUDA-based neural networks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves real-time performance of less than 10 ms to render a frame and significantly improved rendering quality compared to baseline methods.</p></details> |  |

However, effectively applying these time series forecasting models to the field of financial asset pricing remains a challenging issue. There is still a need for a bridge to connect cutting-edge time series forecasting models with financial asset pricing. To bridge this gap, we have undertaken the following efforts: 1) We constructed three datasets from the financial domain; 2) We selected over ten time series forecasting models from recent studies and validated their performance in financial time series; 3) We developed new metrics, msIC and msIR, in addition to MSE and MAE, to showcase the time series correlation captured by the models; 4) We designed financial-specific tasks for these three datasets and assessed the practical performance and application potential of these forecasting models in important financial problems. We hope the developed new evaluation suite, FinTSBridge, can provide valuable insights into the effectiveness and robustness of advanced forecasting models in finanical domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025 Workshop Advances in Financial AI</p></details> |

We introduce a novel continuous-time Bellman error, derived from the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation, which quantifies the suboptimality of stabilizing policies and is parametrized in terms of the feedback gain. We analyze its properties, including its effective domain, smoothness, coerciveness and show the existence of a unique stationary point within the stability region. Furthermore, we derive a closed-form gradient expression of the Bellman error that induces a gradient flow. This converges to the optimal feedback and generates a unique trajectory which exclusively comprises stabilizing feedback policies. Additionally, this work advances interesting connections between LQR theory and Reinforcement Learning (RL) by redefining suboptimality of the Algebraic Riccati Equation (ARE) as a Bellman error, adapting a state-independent formulation, and leveraging Lyapunov equations to overcome the infinite-horizon challenge. We validate our method in a simulation and compare it to the state of the art.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to Conference on Decision and Control</p></details> |

We present a novel framework using Markovian Gaussian Processes to learn brain communications with time-varying temporal delays from multi-region neural recordings, named Adaptive Delay Model (ADM). Our method combines Gaussian Processes with State Space Models and employs parallel scan inference algorithms, enabling efficient scaling to large datasets while identifying concurrent communication patterns that evolve over time. This time-varying approach captures how brain region interactions shift dynamically during cognitive processes. Validated on synthetic and multi-region neural recordings datasets, our approach discovers both the directionality and temporal dynamics of neural communication. This work advances our understanding of distributed neural computation and provides a scalable tool for analyzing dynamic brain networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[SyncFed: Time-Aware Federated Learning through Explicit Timestamping and Synchronization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09660v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Federated Learning (FL) expands to larger and more distributed environments, consistency in training is challenged by network-induced delays, clock unsynchronicity, and variability in client updates. This combination of factors may contribute to misaligned contributions that undermine model reliability and convergence. Existing methods like staleness-aware aggregation and model versioning address lagging updates heuristically, yet lack mechanisms to quantify staleness, especially in latency-sensitive and cross-regional deployments. In light of these considerations, we introduce \emph{SyncFed}, a time-aware FL framework that employs explicit synchronization and timestamping to establish a common temporal reference across the system. Staleness is quantified numerically based on exchanged timestamps under the Network Time Protocol (NTP), enabling the server to reason about the relative freshness of client updates and apply temporally informed weighting during aggregation. Our empirical evaluation on a geographically distributed testbed shows that, under \emph{SyncFed}, the global model evolves within a stable temporal context, resulting in improved accuracy and information freshness compared to round-based baselines devoid of temporal semantics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint version.

| **[Real-Time Network Traffic Forecasting with Missing Data: A Generative Model Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09647v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time network traffic forecasting is crucial for network management and early resource allocation. Existing network traffic forecasting approaches operate under the assumption that the network traffic data is fully observed. However, in practical scenarios, the collected data are often incomplete due to various human and natural factors. In this paper, we propose a generative model approach for real-time network traffic forecasting with missing data. Firstly, we model the network traffic forecasting task as a tensor completion problem. Secondly, we incorporate a pre-trained generative model to achieve the low-rank structure commonly associated with tensor completion. The generative model effectively captures the intrinsic low-rank structure of network traffic data during pre-training and enables the mapping from a compact latent representation to the tensor space. Thirdly, rather than directly optimizing the high-dimensional tensor, we optimize its latent representation, which simplifies the optimization process and enables real-time forecasting. We also establish a theoretical recovery guarantee that quantifies the error bound of the proposed approach. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves accurate network traffic forecasting within 100 ms, with a mean absolute error (MAE) below 0.002, as validated on the Abilene dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal effects on non-terminal event time with application to antibiotic usage and future resistance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09624v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Comparing future antibiotic resistance levels resulting from different antibiotic treatments is challenging because some patients may survive only under one of the antibiotic treatments. We embed this problem within a semi-competing risks approach to study the causal effect on resistant infection, treated as a non-terminal event time. We argue that existing principal stratification estimands for such problems exclude patients for whom a causal effect is well-defined and is of clinical interest. Therefore, we present a new principal stratum, the infected-or-survivors (ios). The ios is the subpopulation of patients who would have survived or been infected under both antibiotic treatments. This subpopulation is more inclusive than previously defined subpopulations. We target the causal effect among these patients, which we term the feasible-infection causal effect (FICE). We develop large-sample bounds under novel assumptions, and discuss the plausibility of these assumptions in our application. As an alternative, we derive FICE identification using two illness-death models with a bivariate frailty random variable. These two models are connected by a cross-world correlation parameter. Estimation is performed by an expectation-maximization algorithm followed by a Monte Carlo procedure. We apply our methods to detailed clinical data obtained from a hospital setting.</p></details> |  |
| **[DeepExtractor: Time-domain reconstruction of signals and glitches in gravitational wave data with deep learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18423v3)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gravitational wave (GW) detectors, such as LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA, detect faint signals from distant astrophysical events. However, their high sensitivity also makes them susceptible to background noise, which can obscure these signals. This noise often includes transient artifacts called 'glitches', that can mimic genuine astrophysical signals or mask their true characteristics. In this study, we present DeepExtractor, a deep learning framework that is designed to reconstruct signals and glitches with power exceeding interferometer noise, regardless of their source. We design DeepExtractor to model the inherent noise distribution of GW detectors, following conventional assumptions that the noise is Gaussian and stationary over short time scales. It operates by predicting and subtracting the noise component of the data, retaining only the clean reconstruction of signal or glitch. We focus on applications related to glitches and validate DeepExtractor's effectiveness through three experiments: (1) reconstructing simulated glitches injected into simulated detector noise, (2) comparing its performance with the state-of-the-art BayesWave algorithm, and (3) analyzing real data from the Gravity Spy dataset to demonstrate effective glitch subtraction from LIGO strain data. We further demonstrate its potential by reconstructing three real GW events from LIGO's third observing run, without being trained on GW waveforms. Our proposed model achieves a median mismatch of only 0.9% for simulated glitches, outperforming several deep learning baselines. Additionally, DeepExtractor surpasses BayesWave in glitch recovery, offering a dramatic computational speedup by reconstructing one glitch sample in approximately 0.1 seconds on a CPU, compared to BayesWave's processing time of approximately one hour per glitch.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 17 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

In this approach, convection and diffusion can be independently treated either explicitly or implicitly, which in particular allows to construct implicit-explicit (IMEX) methods. Original SRK schemes (Colomes, Badia, IJNME, 2015) are designed for finite-element methods that satisfy the inf-sup condition. In this paper, the idea of SRK schemes is generalized to spatial discretizations with pressure stabilization. In the numerical experiments, SRK schemes are demonstrated with both finite-difference and finite element spatial discretizations. Numerical results show that one of the SRK schemes outperforms the third-order multistep projection-based method in terms of accuracy while preserving the computational costs.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-Powered CPI Prediction Inference with Online Text Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09516v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting the Consumer Price Index (CPI) is an important yet challenging task in economics, where most existing approaches rely on low-frequency, survey-based data. With the recent advances of large language models (LLMs), there is growing potential to leverage high-frequency online text data for improved CPI prediction, an area still largely unexplored. This paper proposes LLM-CPI, an LLM-based approach for CPI prediction inference incorporating online text time series. We collect a large set of high-frequency online texts from a popularly used Chinese social network site and employ LLMs such as ChatGPT and the trained BERT models to construct continuous inflation labels for posts that are related to inflation. Online text embeddings are extracted via LDA and BERT. We develop a joint time series framework that combines monthly CPI data with LLM-generated daily CPI surrogates. The monthly model employs an ARX structure combining observed CPI data with text embeddings and macroeconomic variables, while the daily model uses a VARX structure built on LLM-generated CPI surrogates and text embeddings. We establish the asymptotic properties of the method and provide two forms of constructed prediction intervals. The finite-sample performance and practical advantages of LLM-CPI are demonstrated through both simulation and real data examples.</p></details> | 73 pages, 13 figures |

However, existing generalist time series foundation models struggle to handle medical time series data due to their inherent challenges, including irregular intervals, heterogeneous sampling rates, and frequent missing values. To address these challenges, we introduce MIRA, a unified foundation model specifically designed for medical time series forecasting. MIRA incorporates a Continuous-Time Rotary Positional Encoding that enables fine-grained modeling of variable time intervals, a frequency-specific mixture-of-experts layer that routes computation across latent frequency regimes to further promote temporal specialization, and a Continuous Dynamics Extrapolation Block based on Neural ODE that models the continuous trajectory of latent states, enabling accurate forecasting at arbitrary target timestamps. Pretrained on a large-scale and diverse medical corpus comprising over 454 billion time points collect from publicly available datasets, MIRA achieves reductions in forecasting errors by an average of 10% and 7% in out-of-distribution and in-distribution scenarios, respectively, when compared to other zero-shot and fine-tuned baselines. We also introduce a comprehensive benchmark spanning multiple downstream clinical tasks, establishing a foundation for future research in medical time series modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Test-Time Adaptation for Object Detection in Continually Changing Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16439v5)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world application models are commonly deployed in dynamic environments, where the target domain distribution undergoes temporal changes. Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) has recently emerged as a promising technique to gradually adapt a source-trained model to continually changing target domains. Despite recent advancements in addressing CTTA, two critical issues remain: 1) Fixed thresholds for pseudo-labeling in existing methodologies lead to low-quality pseudo-labels, as model confidence varies across categories and domains; 2) Stochastic parameter restoration methods for mitigating catastrophic forgetting fail to preserve critical information effectively, due to their intrinsic randomness. To tackle these challenges for detection models in CTTA scenarios, we present AMROD, featuring three core components. Firstly, the object-level contrastive learning module extracts object-level features for contrastive learning to refine the feature representation in the target domain. Secondly, the adaptive monitoring module dynamically skips unnecessary adaptation and updates the category-specific threshold based on predicted confidence scores to enable efficiency and improve the quality of pseudo-labels. Lastly, the adaptive randomized restoration mechanism selectively reset inactive parameters with higher possibilities, ensuring the retention of essential knowledge. We demonstrate the effectiveness of AMROD on four CTTA object detection tasks, where AMROD outperforms existing methods, especially achieving a 3.2 mAP improvement and a 20\% increase in efficiency on the Cityscapes-to-Cityscapes-C CTTA task. The code of this work is available at https://github.com/ShileiCao/AMROD.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time-Unified Diffusion Policy with Action Discrimination for Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09422v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many complex scenarios, robotic manipulation relies on generative models to estimate the distribution of multiple successful actions. As the diffusion model has better training robustness than other generative models, it performs well in imitation learning through successful robot demonstrations. However, the diffusion-based policy methods typically require significant time to iteratively denoise robot actions, which hinders real-time responses in robotic manipulation. Moreover, existing diffusion policies model a time-varying action denoising process, whose temporal complexity increases the difficulty of model training and leads to suboptimal action accuracy. To generate robot actions efficiently and accurately, we present the Time-Unified Diffusion Policy (TUDP), which utilizes action recognition capabilities to build a time-unified denoising process. On the one hand, we build a time-unified velocity field in action space with additional action discrimination information. By unifying all timesteps of action denoising, our velocity field reduces the difficulty of policy learning and speeds up action generation. On the other hand, we propose an action-wise training method, which introduces an action discrimination branch to supply additional action discrimination information. Through action-wise training, the TUDP implicitly learns the ability to discern successful actions to better denoising accuracy. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on RLBench with the highest success rate of 82.6% on a multi-view setup and 83.8% on a single-view setup. In particular, when using fewer denoising iterations, TUDP achieves a more significant improvement in success rate. Additionally, TUDP can produce accurate actions for a wide range of real-world tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[GenARM: Reward Guided Generation with Autoregressive Reward Model for Test-time Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08193v4)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive capabilities but require careful alignment with human preferences. Traditional training-time methods finetune LLMs using human preference datasets but incur significant training costs and require repeated training to handle diverse user preferences. Test-time alignment methods address this by using reward models (RMs) to guide frozen LLMs without retraining. However, existing test-time approaches rely on trajectory-level RMs which are designed to evaluate complete responses, making them unsuitable for autoregressive text generation that requires computing next-token rewards from partial responses. To address this, we introduce GenARM, a test-time alignment approach that leverages the Autoregressive Reward Model--a novel reward parametrization designed to predict next-token rewards for efficient and effective autoregressive generation. Theoretically, we demonstrate that this parametrization can provably guide frozen LLMs toward any distribution achievable by traditional RMs within the KL-regularized reinforcement learning framework. Experimental results show that GenARM significantly outperforms prior test-time alignment baselines and matches the performance of training-time methods. Additionally, GenARM enables efficient weak-to-strong guidance, aligning larger LLMs with smaller RMs without the high costs of training larger models. Furthermore, GenARM supports multi-objective alignment, allowing real-time trade-offs between preference dimensions and catering to diverse user preferences without retraining.

Despite its effectiveness, existing methods often struggle to comprehensively capture both long-term dynamic evolution and subtle local patterns in a unified manner. In this work, we propose \textbf{TimeDART}, a novel self-supervised time series pre-training framework that unifies two powerful generative paradigms to learn more transferable representations. Specifically, we first employ a causal Transformer encoder, accompanied by a patch-based embedding strategy, to model the evolving trends from left to right. Building on this global modeling, we further introduce a denoising diffusion process to capture fine-grained local patterns through forward diffusion and reverse denoising. Finally, we optimize the model in an autoregressive manner. As a result, TimeDART effectively accounts for both global and local sequence features in a coherent way. We conduct extensive experiments on public datasets for time series forecasting and classification. The experimental results demonstrate that TimeDART consistently outperforms previous compared methods, validating the effectiveness of our approach.

Our model autoregressively generates a latent frame at a time using a single neural function evaluation (1NFE). The model can stream the result to the user in real time and receive interactive responses as controls to generate the next latent frame. Unlike existing approaches, our method explores adversarial training as an effective paradigm for autoregressive generation. This not only allows us to design an architecture that is more efficient for one-step generation while fully utilizing the KV cache, but also enables training the model in a student-forcing manner that proves to be effective in reducing error accumulation during long video generation. Our experiments demonstrate that our 8B model achieves real-time, 24fps, streaming video generation at 736x416 resolution on a single H100, or 1280x720 on 8xH100 up to a minute long (1440 frames).

| **[TS-PIELM: Time-Stepping Physics-Informed Extreme Learning Machine Facilitates Soil Consolidation Analyses](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08381v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accuracy and efficiency of the conventional physics-informed neural network (PINN) need to be improved before it can be a competitive alternative for soil consolidation analyses. This paper aims to overcome these limitations by proposing a highly accurate and efficient physics-informed machine learning (PIML) approach, termed time-stepping physics-informed extreme learning machine (TS-PIELM). In the TS-PIELM framework the consolidation process is divided into numerous time intervals, which helps overcome the limitation of PIELM in solving differential equations with sharp gradients. To accelerate network training, the solution is approximated by a single-layer feedforward extreme learning machine (ELM), rather than using a fully connected neural network in PINN. The input layer weights of the ELM network are generated randomly and fixed during the training process. Subsequently, the output layer weights are directly computed by solving a system of linear equations, which significantly enhances the training efficiency compared to the time-consuming gradient descent method in PINN. Finally, the superior performance of TS-PIELM is demonstrated by solving three typical Terzaghi consolidation problems. Compared to PINN, results show that the computational efficiency and accuracy of the novel TS-PIELM framework are improved by more than 1000 times and 100 times for one-dimensional cases, respectively. This paper provides compelling evidence that PIML can be a powerful tool for computational geotechnics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pointwise-in-Time Explanation for Linear Temporal Logic Rules](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13956v4)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The new field of Explainable Planning (XAIP) has produced a variety of approaches to explain and describe the behavior of autonomous agents to human observers. Many summarize agent behavior in terms of the constraints, or ''rules,'' which the agent adheres to during its trajectories. In this work, we narrow the focus from summary to specific moments in individual trajectories, offering a ''pointwise-in-time'' view. Our novel framework, which we define on Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) rules, assigns an intuitive status to any rule in order to describe the trajectory progress at individual time steps; here, a rule is classified as active, satisfied, inactive, or violated. Given a trajectory, a user may query for status of specific LTL rules at individual trajectory time steps. In this paper, we present this novel framework, named Rule Status Assessment (RSA), and provide an example of its implementation. We find that pointwise-in-time status assessment is useful as a post-hoc diagnostic, enabling a user to systematically track the agent's behavior with respect to a set of rules.</p></details> | <details><summary>See r...</summary><p>See related publication in Conference on Decision and Control (CDC) 2023</p></details> |

However, best practices for developing systems that combine these techniques remain underdeveloped due to our limited understanding of the utility of each technique across models and tasks, the interactions between them, and the massive search space for combining them. To address these challenges, we introduce Archon, a modular and automated framework for optimizing the process of selecting and combining inference-time techniques and LLMs. Given a compute budget and a set of available LLMs, Archon explores a large design space to discover optimized configurations tailored to target benchmarks. It can design custom or general-purpose architectures that advance the Pareto frontier of accuracy vs. maximum token budget compared to top-performing baselines. Across instruction-following, reasoning, and coding tasks, we show that Archon can leverage additional inference compute budget to design systems that outperform frontier models such as OpenAI's o1, GPT-4o, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet by an average of 15.1%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) 2025</p></details> |

Effective bandwidth sharing enables optimal utilization of available resources, reducing congestion and improving QoE for delay-sensitive applications such as real-time video transmission. In this paper, we propose a novel iterative semi-static bandwidth sharing policy that balances the advantages of both static and dynamic sharing approaches. Our approach minimizes the frequency of coordination between network operators while ensuring efficient resource allocation and meeting the stringent QoE demands of real-time traffic. The proposed policy iteratively optimizes both the spectrum sharing between operators and the resource allocation for individual clients. We establish strong theoretical guarantees for the optimality of the proposed policy and prove that it converges to the optimal static sharing policy irrespective of initial conditions or fluctuations in traffic arrival rates. Additionally, we conduct extensive simulations to evaluate the impact of key system parameters - including step size, hyperperiod length, and arrival process dynamics - on the performance of our policy. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in achieving near-optimal bandwidth allocation with reduced overhead, making it a practical solution for real-time wireless applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2401.10681</p></details> |
| **[Multivariate Long-term Time Series Forecasting with Fourier Neural Filter](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09174v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate long-term time series forecasting has been suffering from the challenge of capturing both temporal dependencies within variables and spatial correlations across variables simultaneously. Current approaches predominantly repurpose backbones from natural language processing or computer vision (e.g., Transformers), which fail to adequately address the unique properties of time series (e.g., periodicity). The research community lacks a dedicated backbone with temporal-specific inductive biases, instead relying on domain-agnostic backbones supplemented with auxiliary techniques (e.g., signal decomposition). We introduce FNF as the backbone and DBD as the architecture to provide excellent learning capabilities and optimal learning pathways for spatio-temporal modeling, respectively. Our theoretical analysis proves that FNF unifies local time-domain and global frequency-domain information processing within a single backbone that extends naturally to spatial modeling, while information bottleneck theory demonstrates that DBD provides superior gradient flow and representation capacity compared to existing unified or sequential architectures. Our empirical evaluation across 11 public benchmark datasets spanning five domains (energy, meteorology, transportation, environment, and nature) confirms state-of-the-art performance with consistent hyperparameter settings. Notably, our approach achieves these results without any auxiliary techniques, suggesting that properly designed neural architectures can capture the inherent properties of time series, potentially transforming time series modeling in scientific and industrial applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Curious Language Model: Strategic Test-Time Information Acquisition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09173v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decision-makers often possess insufficient information to render a confident decision. In these cases, the decision-maker can often undertake actions to acquire the necessary information about the problem at hand, e.g., by consulting knowledgeable authorities or by conducting experiments. Importantly, different levers of information acquisition come with different costs, posing the challenge of selecting the actions that are both informative and cost-effective. In this work, we propose CuriosiTree, a heuristic-based, test-time policy for zero-shot information acquisition in large language models (LLMs). CuriosiTree employs a greedy tree search to estimate the expected information gain of each action and strategically chooses actions based on a balance of anticipated information gain and associated cost. Empirical validation in a clinical diagnosis simulation shows that CuriosiTree enables cost-effective integration of heterogenous sources of information, and outperforms baseline action selection strategies in selecting action sequences that enable accurate diagnosis.</p></details> | 39 pages |

As the demand for virtual interactions grows, it becomes increasingly important to measure participant engagement, attention, and overall interaction. This research presents a novel solution that leverages the Media Pipe Face Mesh framework to identify facial landmarks and extract geometric data for calculating Euler angles, which determine head orientation in real time. The system tracks 3D facial landmarks and uses this data to compute head movements with a focus on accuracy and responsiveness. By studying Euler angles, the system can identify a user's head orientation with an accuracy of 90\%, even at a distance of up to four feet. This capability offers significant enhancements for monitoring user interaction, allowing for more immersive and interactive virtual ex-periences. The proposed method shows its reliability in evaluating participant attentiveness during online assessments and meetings. Its application goes beyond engagement analysis, potentially providing a means for improving the quality of virtual communication, fostering better understanding between participants, and ensuring a higher level of interaction in digital spaces. This study offers a basis for future developments in enhancing virtual user experiences by integrating real-time facial tracking technologies, paving the way for more adaptive and interactive web-based platform.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in MECON 2025</p></details> |

These data are inherently tied to domain-specific contexts, such as clinical notes or weather narratives, making cross-modal retrieval essential not only for downstream tasks but also for developing robust time-series foundation models by retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Despite the increasing demand, time-series retrieval remains largely underexplored. Existing methods often lack semantic grounding, struggle to align heterogeneous modalities, and have limited capacity for handling multi-channel signals. To address this gap, we propose TRACE, a generic multimodal retriever that grounds time-series embeddings in aligned textual context. TRACE enables fine-grained channel-level alignment and employs hard negative mining to facilitate semantically meaningful retrieval. It supports flexible cross-modal retrieval modes, including Text-to-Timeseries and Timeseries-to-Text, effectively linking linguistic descriptions with complex temporal patterns. By retrieving semantically relevant pairs, TRACE enriches downstream models with informative context, leading to improved predictive accuracy and interpretability. Beyond a static retrieval engine, TRACE also serves as a powerful standalone encoder, with lightweight task-specific tuning that refines context-aware representations while maintaining strong cross-modal alignment. These representations achieve state-of-the-art performance on downstream forecasting and classification tasks. Extensive experiments across multiple domains highlight its dual utility, as both an effective encoder for downstream applications and a general-purpose retriever to enhance time-series models.</p></details> |  |
| **[e3: Learning to Explore Enables Extrapolation of Test-Time Compute for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09026v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test-time scaling offers a promising path to improve LLM reasoning by utilizing more compute at inference time; however, the true promise of this paradigm lies in extrapolation (i.e., improvement in performance on hard problems as LLMs keep "thinking" for longer, beyond the maximum token budget they were trained on). Surprisingly, we find that most existing reasoning models do not extrapolate well. We show that one way to enable extrapolation is by training the LLM to perform in-context exploration: training the LLM to effectively spend its test time budget by chaining operations (such as generation, verification, refinement, etc.), or testing multiple hypotheses before it commits to an answer. To enable in-context exploration, we identify three key ingredients as part of our recipe e3: (1) chaining skills that the base LLM has asymmetric competence in, e.g., chaining verification (easy) with generation (hard), as a way to implement in-context search; (2) leveraging "negative" gradients from incorrect traces to amplify exploration during RL, resulting in longer search traces that chains additional asymmetries; and (3) coupling task difficulty with training token budget during training via a specifically-designed curriculum to structure in-context exploration. Our recipe e3 produces the best known 1.7B model according to AIME'25 and HMMT'25 scores, and extrapolates to 2x the training token budget. Our e3-1.7B model not only attains high pass@1 scores, but also improves pass@k over the base model.</p></details> |  |

Our research aims at uncovering clear connections between time series characteristics and particular models. We introduce a novel dataset generated using Gaussian Processes, specifically designed to display distinct, known characteristics for targeted evaluations of model adaptability to them. Furthermore, we present TimeFlex, a new model that incorporates a modular architecture tailored to handle diverse temporal dynamics, including trends and periodic patterns.

Counterfactual explanations, a core tool within eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), offer insights into model decisions by identifying minimal changes to an input to alter its predicted outcome. However, existing methods for time series data are limited by univariate assumptions, rigid constraints on modifications, or lack of validity guarantees. This paper introduces Multi-SpaCE, a multi-objective counterfactual explanation method for multivariate time series. Using non-dominated ranking genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II), Multi-SpaCE balances proximity, sparsity, plausibility, and contiguity. Unlike most methods, it ensures perfect validity, supports multivariate data and provides a Pareto front of solutions, enabling flexibility to different end-user needs. Comprehensive experiments in diverse datasets demonstrate the ability of Multi-SpaCE to consistently achieve perfect validity and deliver superior performance compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |

Traditional time series decomposition methods are single and rely on fixed rules, which are insufficient for mining the potential information of the series and adapting to the dynamic characteristics of complex series. On the other hand, the Transformer-based models for time series forecasting struggle to effectively model long sequences and intricate dynamic relationships due to their high computational complexity. To overcome these limitations, we introduce KARMA, with an Adaptive Time Channel Decomposition module (ATCD) to dynamically extract trend and seasonal components. It further integrates a Hybrid Frequency-Time Decomposition module (HFTD) to further decompose Series into frequency-domain and time-domain. These components are coupled with multi-scale Mamba-based KarmaBlock to efficiently process global and local information in a coordinated manner. Experiments on eight real-world datasets from diverse domains well demonstrated that KARMA significantly outperforms mainstream baseline methods in both predictive accuracy and computational efficiency.

Real-time cascade mitigation requires fast, complex operational decisions under uncertainty. In this work, we extend the influence graph into a Markov decision process model (MDP) for real-time mitigation of cascading outages in power transmission systems, accounting for uncertainties in generation, load, and initial contingencies. The MDP includes a do-nothing action to allow for conservative decision-making and is solved using reinforcement learning. We present a policy gradient learning algorithm initialized with a policy corresponding to the unmitigated case and designed to handle invalid actions. The proposed learning method converges faster than the conventional algorithm. Through careful reward design, we learn a policy that takes conservative actions without deteriorating system conditions. The model is validated on the IEEE 14-bus and IEEE 118-bus systems. The results show that proactive line disconnections can effectively reduce cascading risk, and certain lines consistently emerge as critical in mitigating cascade propagation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agile Reinforcement Learning for Real-Time Task Scheduling in Edge Computing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08850v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Soft real-time applications are becoming increasingly complex, posing significant challenges for scheduling offloaded tasks in edge computing environments while meeting task timing constraints. Moreover, the exponential growth of the search space, presence of multiple objectives and parameters, and highly dynamic nature of edge computing environments further exacerbate the complexity of task scheduling. As a result, schedulers based on heuristic and metaheuristic algorithms frequently encounter difficulties in generating optimal or near-optimal task schedules due to their constrained ability to adapt to the dynamic conditions and complex environmental characteristics of edge computing. Accordingly, reinforcement learning algorithms have been incorporated into schedulers to address the complexity and dynamic conditions inherent in task scheduling in edge computing. However, a significant limitation of reinforcement learning algorithms is the prolonged learning time required to adapt to new environments and to address medium- and large-scale problems. This challenge arises from the extensive global action space and frequent random exploration of irrelevant actions. Therefore, this study proposes Agile Reinforcement learning (aRL), in which the RL-agent performs informed exploration and executes only relevant actions. Consequently, the predictability of the RL-agent is enhanced, leading to rapid adaptation and convergence, which positions aRL as a suitable candidate for scheduling the tasks of soft real-time applications in edge computing. The experiments demonstrate that the combination of informed exploration and action-masking methods enables aRL to achieve a higher hit-ratio and converge faster than the baseline approaches.</p></details> |  |

However, the accumulated noise in such dense representations has received insufficient attention, which degrades the representation quality and increases the likelihood of missed detections. To address this challenge, we propose the Wavelet Denoising-enhanced DEtection TRansformer, i.e., WD-DETR network, for event cameras. In particular, a dense event representation is presented first, which enables real-time reconstruction of events as tensors. Then, a wavelet transform method is designed to filter noise in the event representations. Such a method is integrated into the backbone for feature extraction. The extracted features are subsequently fed into a transformer-based network for object prediction. To further reduce inference time, we incorporate the Dynamic Reorganization Convolution Block (DRCB) as a fusion module within the hybrid encoder. The proposed method has been evaluated on three event-based object detection datasets, i.e., DSEC, Gen1, and 1Mpx. The results demonstrate that WD-DETR outperforms tested state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we implement our approach on a common onboard computer for robots, the NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX, achieving a high frame rate of approximately 35 FPS using TensorRT FP16, which is exceptionally well-suited for real-time perception of onboard robotic systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://youtu.be/AQAgVdrx1DE</p></details> |

Empirical Studies in Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24511v2)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting (TSF) is a fundamental and widely studied task, spanning methods from classical statistical approaches to modern deep learning and multimodal language modeling. Despite their effectiveness, these methods often follow a fast thinking paradigm emphasizing pattern extraction and direct value mapping, while overlooking explicit reasoning over temporal dynamics and contextual dependencies. Meanwhile, emerging slow-thinking LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT-o1, DeepSeek-R1) have demonstrated impressive multi-step reasoning capabilities across diverse domains, suggesting a new opportunity for reframing TSF as a structured reasoning task. This motivates a key question: can slow-thinking LLMs effectively reason over temporal patterns to support time series forecasting, even in zero-shot manner? To investigate this, in this paper, we propose TimeReasoner, an extensive empirical study that formulates TSF as a conditional reasoning task. We design a series of prompting strategies to elicit inference-time reasoning from pretrained slow-thinking LLMs and evaluate their performance across diverse TSF benchmarks. Our findings reveal that slow-thinking LLMs exhibit non-trivial zero-shot forecasting capabilities, especially in capturing high-level trends and contextual shifts. While preliminary, our study surfaces important insights into the reasoning behaviors of LLMs in temporal domains highlighting both their potential and limitations. We hope this work catalyzes further research into reasoning-based forecasting paradigms and paves the way toward more interpretable and generalizable TSF frameworks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Thinking vs. Doing: Agents that Reason by Scaling Test-Time Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07976v2)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The current paradigm of test-time scaling relies on generating long reasoning traces ("thinking" more) before producing a response. In agent problems that require interaction, this can be done by generating thinking traces before acting in the world. However, this process does not allow agents to acquire new information from the environment or adapt their behavior over time. In this work, we propose to scale test-time interaction, an untapped dimension of test-time scaling that increases the agent's interaction horizon to enable running rich behaviors such as exploration, backtracking, and dynamic re-planning within a single rollout. To demonstrate the promise of this scaling dimension, we study the domain of web agents. We first show that even prompting-based interaction scaling without any training can improve task success on web benchmarks non-trivially. Building on this, we introduce TTI (Test-Time Interaction), a curriculum-based online reinforcement learning (RL) approach that trains agents by adaptively adjusting their rollout lengths. Using a Gemma 3 12B model, TTI produces state-of-the-art open-source, open-data web agents on WebVoyager and WebArena benchmarks. We further show that TTI enables agents to balance exploration and exploitation adaptively. Our results establish interaction scaling as a powerful, complementary axis to scaling per-step compute, offering new avenues for training adaptive agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>Fixed...</summary><p>Fixed typo in Figure 6 and Conclusion</p></details> |

To date, most GA results for high-dimensional time series are established on hyper-rectangles and their equivalence. In this paper, by considering the 2-Wasserstein distance and the collection of all convex sets, we establish a general GA theory for a broad class of high-dimensional non-stationary (HDNS) time series, extending the scope of problems that can be addressed in HDNS time series analysis. For HDNS time series of sufficiently weak dependence and light tail, the GA rates established in this paper are either nearly optimal with respect to the dimensionality and time series length, or they are nearly identical to the corresponding best-known GA rates established for independent data. A multiplier bootstrap procedure is utilized and theoretically justified to implement our GA theory. We demonstrate by two previously undiscussed time series applications the use of the GA theory and the bootstrap procedure as unified tools for a wide range of statistical inference problems in HDNS time series analysis.</p></details> | 70 pages |

Key criteria for synthetic data include high data utility and traceability to verify the data source. Recent watermarking methods embed in homogeneous latent spaces, but state-of-the-art time series generators operate in real space, making latent-based watermarking incompatible. This creates the challenge of watermarking directly in real space while handling feature heterogeneity and temporal dependencies. We propose TimeWak, the first watermarking algorithm for multivariate time series diffusion models. To handle temporal dependence and spatial heterogeneity, TimeWak embeds a temporal chained-hashing watermark directly within the real temporal-feature space. The other unique feature is the $\epsilon$-exact inversion, which addresses the non-uniform reconstruction error distribution across features from inverting the diffusion process to detect watermarks. We derive the error bound of inverting multivariate time series and further maintain high watermark detectability. We extensively evaluate TimeWak on its impact on synthetic data quality, watermark detectability, and robustness under various post-editing attacks, against 5 datasets and baselines of different temporal lengths. Our results show that TimeWak achieves improvements of 61.96% in context-FID score, and 8.44% in correlational scores against the state-of-the-art baseline, while remaining consistently detectable.</p></details> |  |

Each channel is typically sampled at its own period and is prone to missing values due to various practical and operational constraints. These characteristics pose fundamental challenges related to channel dependency, sampling asynchrony, and missingness, all of which must be addressed to enable robust and reliable forecasting in practical settings. However, most existing architectures are built on oversimplified assumptions, such as identical sampling periods across channels and fully observed inputs at test time, which often do not hold in real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap, we propose ChannelTokenFormer, a Transformer-based forecasting model with a flexible architecture designed to explicitly capture cross-channel interactions, accommodate channel-wise asynchronous sampling, and effectively handle missing values. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets modified to reflect practical settings, along with one real-world industrial dataset, demonstrate the superior robustness and accuracy of ChannelTokenFormer under challenging real-world conditions.</p></details> |  |

These methods provide limited control and do not explicitly optimize for task-specific objectives. We introduce MEMETRON, a task-agnostic framework that formulates LLM decoding as a discrete black-box optimization problem. MEMETRON leverages hybrid metaheuristic algorithms, GENETRON and ANNETRON, to search the response space, guided by reward models and contextual operations performed by the LLM itself. This approach enables efficient discovery of high-reward responses without requiring model retraining or gradient access. The framework is modular and generalizes across diverse tasks, requiring only a reward function and lightweight prompt templates. We evaluate our framework on the critical human preference alignment task and demonstrate that it significantly outperforms standard decoding and reranking methods, highlighting its potential to improve alignment without model retraining.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose Time Vision Transformer (TiViT), a framework that converts time series into images to leverage the representational power of frozen Vision Transformers (ViTs) pretrained on large-scale image datasets. First, we theoretically motivate our approach by analyzing the 2D patching of ViTs for time series, showing that it can increase the number of label-relevant tokens and reduce the sample complexity. Second, we empirically demonstrate that TiViT achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard time series classification benchmarks by utilizing the hidden representations of large OpenCLIP models. We explore the structure of TiViT representations and find that intermediate layers with high intrinsic dimension are the most effective for time series classification. Finally, we assess the alignment between TiViT and TSFM representation spaces and identify a strong complementarity, with further performance gains achieved by combining their features. Our findings reveal yet another direction for reusing vision representations in a non-visual domain.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods often model spatial and temporal dynamics independently and overlook causality-driven probabilistic forecasting, limiting their predictive power. To address this, we propose STOAT (Spatial-Temporal Probabilistic Causal Inference Network), a novel framework for probabilistic forecasting in STC-TS. The proposed method extends a causal inference approach by incorporating a spatial relation matrix that encodes interregional dependencies (e.g. proximity or connectivity), enabling spatially informed causal effect estimation. The resulting latent series are processed by deep probabilistic models to estimate the parameters of the distributions, enabling calibrated uncertainty modeling. We further explore multiple output distributions (e.g., Gaussian, Student's-$t$, Laplace) to capture region-specific variability. Experiments on COVID-19 data across six countries demonstrate that STOAT outperforms state-of-the-art probabilistic forecasting models (DeepAR, DeepVAR, Deep State Space Model, etc.) in key metrics, particularly in regions with strong spatial dependencies. By bridging causal inference and geospatial probabilistic forecasting, STOAT offers a generalizable framework for complex spatial-temporal tasks, such as epidemic management.</p></details> |  |
| **[TDS-CLIP: Temporal Difference Side Network for Efficient VideoAction Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10688v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, large-scale pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP), have garnered significant attention thanks to their powerful representative capabilities. This inspires researchers in transferring the knowledge from these large pre-trained models to other task-specific models, e.g., Video Action Recognition (VAR) models, via particularly leveraging side networks to enhance the efficiency of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). However, current transferring approaches in VAR tend to directly transfer the frozen knowledge from large pre-trained models to action recognition networks with minimal cost, instead of exploiting the temporal modeling capabilities of the action recognition models themselves. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel memory-efficient Temporal Difference Side Network (TDS-CLIP) to balance knowledge transferring and temporal modeling, avoiding backpropagation in frozen parameter models. Specifically, we introduce a Temporal Difference Adapter (TD-Adapter), which can effectively capture local temporal differences in motion features to strengthen the model's global temporal modeling capabilities. Furthermore, we designed a Side Motion Enhancement Adapter (SME-Adapter) to guide the proposed side network in efficiently learning the rich motion information in videos, thereby improving the side network's ability to capture and learn motion information. Extensive experiments are conducted on three benchmark datasets, including Something-Something V1&V2, and Kinetics-400. Experimental results show that our method achieves competitive performance in video action recognition tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[CapST: Leveraging Capsule Networks and Temporal Attention for Accurate Model Attribution in Deep-fake Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03782v4)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep-fake videos, generated through AI face-swapping techniques, have gained significant attention due to their potential for impactful impersonation attacks. While most research focuses on real vs. fake detection, attributing a deep-fake to its specific generation model or encoder is vital for forensic analysis, enabling source tracing and tailored countermeasures. This enhances detection by leveraging model-specific artifacts and supports proactive defenses. We investigate the model attribution problem for deep-fake videos using two datasets: Deepfakes from Different Models (DFDM) and GANGen-Detection, both comprising deep-fake videos and GAN-generated images. We use only fake images from GANGen-Detection to align with DFDM's focus on attribution rather than binary classification. We formulate the task as a multiclass classification problem and introduce a novel Capsule-Spatial-Temporal (CapST) model that integrates a truncated VGG19 network for feature extraction, capsule networks for hierarchical encoding, and a spatio-temporal attention mechanism. Video-level fusion captures temporal dependencies across frames. Experiments on DFDM and GANGen-Detection show CapST outperforms baseline models in attribution accuracy while reducing computational cost.</p></details> |  |
| **[TD-Pipe: Temporally-Disaggregated Pipeline Parallelism Architecture for High-Throughput LLM Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10470v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the model size continuously increases, pipeline parallelism shows great promise in throughput-oriented LLM inference due to its low demand on communications. However, imbalanced pipeline workloads and complex data dependencies in the prefill and decode phases result in massive pipeline bubbles and further severe performance reduction. To better exploit the pipeline parallelism for high-throughput LLM inference, we propose TD-Pipe, with the key idea lies in the temporally-disaggregated pipeline parallelism architecture. Specifically, this architecture disaggregates the prefill and decode phases in the temporal dimension, so as to eliminate pipeline bubbles caused by the phase switching. TD-Pipe identifies potential issues of exploiting the novel architecture and provides solutions. First, a hierarchy-controller structure is used to better coordinate devices in pipeline parallelism by decoupling the scheduling from execution. Second, the AI-based greedy prefill approach aggressively performs more prefills by predicting the output length and simulating the memory usage. Third, the inter-batch work stealing approach dynamically balances decode phase workloads between different batches to reduce bubbles. Forth, the spatial-temporal intensity comparison approach determines the optimal switch from decode to prefill by comparing the performance drop from reduced computational intensity with that from phase switching bubbles. Extensive experiments show that TD-Pipe effectively increases the throughput of LLM inference by up to 1.91x over the existing tensor parallel approach and 2.73x over the existing pipeline parallel approach on GPU nodes with only PCIe interconnection.</p></details> |  |
| **[MF2Summ: Multimodal Fusion for Video Summarization with Temporal Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10430v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid proliferation of online video content necessitates effective video summarization techniques. Traditional methods, often relying on a single modality (typically visual), struggle to capture the full semantic richness of videos. This paper introduces MF2Summ, a novel video summarization model based on multimodal content understanding, integrating both visual and auditory information. MF2Summ employs a five-stage process: feature extraction, cross-modal attention interaction, feature fusion, segment prediction, and key shot selection. Visual features are extracted using a pre-trained GoogLeNet model, while auditory features are derived using SoundNet. The core of our fusion mechanism involves a cross-modal Transformer and an alignment-guided self-attention Transformer, designed to effectively model inter-modal dependencies and temporal correspondences. Segment importance, location, and center-ness are predicted, followed by key shot selection using Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) and the Kernel Temporal Segmentation (KTS) algorithm. Experimental results on the SumMe and TVSum datasets demonstrate that MF2Summ achieves competitive performance, notably improving F1-scores by 1.9\% and 0.6\% respectively over the DSNet model, and performing favorably against other state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Retrieval of Surface Solar Radiation through Implicit Albedo Recovery from Temporal Context](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10174v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate retrieval of surface solar radiation (SSR) from satellite imagery critically depends on estimating the background reflectance that a spaceborne sensor would observe under clear-sky conditions. Deviations from this baseline can then be used to detect cloud presence and guide radiative transfer models in inferring atmospheric attenuation. Operational retrieval algorithms typically approximate background reflectance using monthly statistics, assuming surface properties vary slowly relative to atmospheric conditions. However, this approach fails in mountainous regions where intermittent snow cover and changing snow surfaces are frequent. We propose an attention-based emulator for SSR retrieval that implicitly learns to infer clear-sky surface reflectance from raw satellite image sequences. Built on the Temporo-Spatial Vision Transformer, our approach eliminates the need for hand-crafted features such as explicit albedo maps or cloud masks. The emulator is trained on instantaneous SSR estimates from the HelioMont algorithm over Switzerland, a region characterized by complex terrain and dynamic snow cover. Inputs include multi-spectral SEVIRI imagery from the Meteosat Second Generation platform, augmented with static topographic features and solar geometry. The target variable is HelioMont's SSR, computed as the sum of its direct and diffuse horizontal irradiance components, given at a spatial resolution of 1.7 km. We show that, when provided a sufficiently long temporal context, the model matches the performances of albedo-informed models, highlighting the model's ability to internally learn and exploit latent surface reflectance dynamics. Our geospatial analysis shows this effect is most powerful in mountainous regions and improves generalization in both simple and complex topographic settings. Code and datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/frischwood/HeMu-dev.git</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Inference of Hierarchical Core-Periphery Structure in Temporal Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10135v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Networks can have various types of mesoscale structures. One type of mesoscale structure in networks is core-periphery structure, which consists of densely-connected core nodes and sparsely-connected peripheral nodes. The core nodes are connected densely to each other and can be connected to the peripheral nodes, which are connected sparsely to other nodes. There has been much research on core-periphery structure in time-independent networks, but few core-periphery detection methods have been developed for time-dependent (i.e., ``temporal") networks. Using a multilayer-network representation of temporal networks and an inference approach that employs stochastic block models, we generalize a recent method for detecting hierarchical core-periphery structure \cite{Polanco23} from time-independent networks to temporal networks. In contrast to ``onion-like'' nested core-periphery structures (where each node is assigned to a group according to how deeply it is nested in a network's core), hierarchical core-periphery structures encompass networks with nested structures, tree-like structures (where any two groups must either be disjoint or have one as a strict subset of the other), and general non-nested mesoscale structures (where the group assignments of nodes do not have to be nested in any way). To perform statistical inference and thereby identify core-periphery structure, we use a Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach. We illustrate our method for detecting hierarchical core-periphery structure in two real-world temporal networks, and we briefly discuss the structures that we identify in these networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fine-Tuning Large Audio-Language Models with LoRA for Precise Temporal Localization of Prolonged Exposure Therapy Elements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09707v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prolonged Exposure (PE) therapy is an effective treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but evaluating therapist fidelity remains labor-intensive due to the need for manual review of session recordings. We present a method for the automatic temporal localization of key PE fidelity elements -- identifying their start and stop times -- directly from session audio and transcripts. Our approach fine-tunes a large pre-trained audio-language model, Qwen2-Audio, using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to process focused 30-second windows of audio-transcript input. Fidelity labels for three core protocol phases -- therapist orientation (P1), imaginal exposure (P2), and post-imaginal processing (P3) -- are generated via LLM-based prompting and verified by trained raters. The model is trained to predict normalized boundary offsets using soft supervision guided by task-specific prompts. On a dataset of 313 real PE sessions, our best configuration (LoRA rank 8, 30s windows) achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 5.3 seconds across tasks. We further analyze the effects of window size and LoRA rank, highlighting the importance of context granularity and model adaptation. This work introduces a scalable framework for fidelity tracking in PE therapy, with potential to support clinician training, supervision, and quality assurance.</p></details> | 5 pages, 2 figures |
| **[TRIDENT: Temporally Restricted Inference via DFA-Enhanced Neural Traversal](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09701v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) and other neural architectures have achieved impressive results across a variety of generative and classification tasks. However, they remain fundamentally ill-equipped to ensure that their outputs satisfy temporal constraints, such as those expressible in Linear Temporal Logic over finite traces (LTLf). In this paper, we introduce TRIDENT: a general and model-agnostic inference-time algorithm that guarantees compliance with such constraints without requiring any retraining. TRIDENT compiles LTLf formulas into a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA), which is used to guide a constrained variant of beam search. At each decoding step, transitions that would lead to constraint violations are masked, while remaining paths are dynamically re-ranked based on both the model's probabilities and the DFA's acceptance structure. We formally prove that the resulting sequences are guaranteed to satisfy the given LTLf constraints, and we empirically demonstrate that TRIDENT also improves output quality. We validate our approach on two distinct tasks: temporally constrained image-stream classification and controlled text generation. In both settings, TRIDENT achieves perfect constraint satisfaction, while comparison with the state of the art shows improved efficiency and high standard quality metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[DHoTT: A Temporal Extension of Homotopy Type Theory for Semantic Drift](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09671v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Dynamic Homotopy Type Theory (DHoTT), a temporal extension of Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT) designed to reason formally about concepts whose meanings evolve continuously or rupture discontinuously over time. While traditional HoTT captures identity and equivalence within a fixed semantic landscape, DHoTT enriches this framework by explicitly indexing types with a temporal parameter, allowing types themselves to deform, rupture, and reassemble as contexts shift. Formally, we show that DHoTT serves as the internal language of a presheaf topos over the linearly ordered time category. As a result, DHoTT (1) conservatively extends HoTT, recovering standard homotopy-theoretic reasoning when time is held constant; (2) preserves foundational structures such as univalence and higher inductive types; and (3) introduces new constructs (drift paths and rupture types) for precisely capturing semantic evolution and discontinuity. We illustrate the expressiveness of DHoTT through a worked example derived from conversational dynamics in large language models, highlighting its relevance to posthuman intelligence and the formal modeling of evolving meaning.</p></details> |  |
| **[CINeMA: Conditional Implicit Neural Multi-Modal Atlas for a Spatio-Temporal Representation of the Perinatal Brain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09668v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Magnetic resonance imaging of fetal and neonatal brains reveals rapid neurodevelopment marked by substantial anatomical changes unfolding within days. Studying this critical stage of the developing human brain, therefore, requires accurate brain models-referred to as atlases-of high spatial and temporal resolution. To meet these demands, established traditional atlases and recently proposed deep learning-based methods rely on large and comprehensive datasets. This poses a major challenge for studying brains in the presence of pathologies for which data remains scarce. We address this limitation with CINeMA (Conditional Implicit Neural Multi-Modal Atlas), a novel framework for creating high-resolution, spatio-temporal, multimodal brain atlases, suitable for low-data settings. Unlike established methods, CINeMA operates in latent space, avoiding compute-intensive image registration and reducing atlas construction times from days to minutes. Furthermore, it enables flexible conditioning on anatomical features including GA, birth age, and pathologies like ventriculomegaly (VM) and agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC). CINeMA supports downstream tasks such as tissue segmentation and age prediction whereas its generative properties enable synthetic data creation and anatomically informed data augmentation. Surpassing state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, efficiency, and versatility, CINeMA represents a powerful tool for advancing brain research. We release the code and atlases at https://github.com/m-dannecker/CINeMA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work currently under revision for IEEE TMI</p></details> |
| **[Genesis: Multimodal Driving Scene Generation with Spatio-Temporal and Cross-Modal Consistency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07497v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Genesis, a unified framework for joint generation of multi-view driving videos and LiDAR sequences with spatio-temporal and cross-modal consistency. Genesis employs a two-stage architecture that integrates a DiT-based video diffusion model with 3D-VAE encoding, and a BEV-aware LiDAR generator with NeRF-based rendering and adaptive sampling. Both modalities are directly coupled through a shared latent space, enabling coherent evolution across visual and geometric domains. To guide the generation with structured semantics, we introduce DataCrafter, a captioning module built on vision-language models that provides scene-level and instance-level supervision. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that Genesis achieves state-of-the-art performance across video and LiDAR metrics (FVD 16.95, FID 4.24, Chamfer 0.611), and benefits downstream tasks including segmentation and 3D detection, validating the semantic fidelity and practical utility of the generated data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal-Guided Spiking Neural Networks for Event-Based Human Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17132v3)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper explores the promising interplay between spiking neural networks (SNNs) and event-based cameras for privacy-preserving human action recognition (HAR). The unique feature of event cameras in capturing only the outlines of motion, combined with SNNs' proficiency in processing spatiotemporal data through spikes, establishes a highly synergistic compatibility for event-based HAR. Previous studies, however, have been limited by SNNs' ability to process long-term temporal information, essential for precise HAR. In this paper, we introduce two novel frameworks to address this: temporal segment-based SNN (\textit{TS-SNN}) and 3D convolutional SNN (\textit{3D-SNN}). The \textit{TS-SNN} extracts long-term temporal information by dividing actions into shorter segments, while the \textit{3D-SNN} replaces 2D spatial elements with 3D components to facilitate the transmission of temporal information. To promote further research in event-based HAR, we create a dataset, \textit{FallingDetection-CeleX}, collected using the high-resolution CeleX-V event camera $(1280 \times 800)$, comprising 7 distinct actions. Extensive experimental results show that our proposed frameworks surpass state-of-the-art SNN methods on our newly collected dataset and three other neuromorphic datasets, showcasing their effectiveness in handling long-range temporal information for event-based HAR.</p></details> |  |

Given a video and a question, we generate an open-ended answer grounded with the start and end time. For this task, we propose TOGA: a vision-language model for Temporally Grounded Open-Ended Video QA with Weak Supervision. We instruct-tune TOGA to jointly generate the answer and the temporal grounding. We operate in a weakly supervised setup where the temporal grounding annotations are not available. We generate pseudo labels for temporal grounding and ensure the validity of these labels by imposing a consistency constraint between the question of a grounding response and the response generated by a question referring to the same temporal segment. We notice that jointly generating the answers with the grounding improves performance on question answering as well as grounding. We evaluate TOGA on grounded QA and open-ended QA tasks. For grounded QA, we consider the NExT-GQA benchmark which is designed to evaluate weakly supervised grounded question answering. For open-ended QA, we consider the MSVD-QA and ActivityNet-QA benchmarks. We achieve state-of-the-art performance for both tasks on these benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[CTPD: Cross-Modal Temporal Pattern Discovery for Enhanced Multimodal Electronic Health Records Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00696v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrating multimodal Electronic Health Records (EHR) data, such as numerical time series and free-text clinical reports, has great potential in predicting clinical outcomes. However, prior work has primarily focused on capturing temporal interactions within individual samples and fusing multimodal information, overlooking critical temporal patterns across patients. These patterns, such as trends in vital signs like abnormal heart rate or blood pressure, can indicate deteriorating health or an impending critical event. Similarly, clinical notes often contain textual descriptions that reflect these patterns. Identifying corresponding temporal patterns across different modalities is crucial for improving the accuracy of clinical outcome predictions, yet it remains a challenging task. To address this gap, we introduce a Cross-Modal Temporal Pattern Discovery (CTPD) framework, designed to efficiently extract meaningful cross-modal temporal patterns from multimodal EHR data. Our approach introduces shared initial temporal pattern representations which are refined using slot attention to generate temporal semantic embeddings. To ensure rich cross-modal temporal semantics in the learned patterns, we introduce a contrastive-based TPNCE loss for cross-modal alignment, along with two reconstruction losses to retain core information of each modality. Evaluations on two clinically critical tasks, 48-hour in-hospital mortality and 24-hour phenotype classification, using the MIMIC-III database demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing approaches.</p></details> | ACL 2025 Findings |

We introduce DSMIL-LocNet, a Multiple Instance Learning framework for whale call detection and localization using only bag-level labels. Our dual-stream model processes 2-30 minute audio segments, leveraging spectral and temporal features with attention-based instance selection. Tests on Antarctic whale data show longer contexts improve classification (F1: 0.8-0.9) while medium instances ensure localization precision (0.65-0.70). This suggests MIL can enhance scalable marine monitoring. Code: https://github.com/Ragib-Amin-Nihal/DSMIL-Loc</p></details> |  |

However, the frame-independence of T2I generation often results in poor temporal consistency. Existing methods address this issue through temporal layer fine-tuning or inference-based temporal propagation, but these approaches suffer from high training costs or limited temporal coherence. To address these challenges, we propose a General and Efficient Adapter (GE-Adapter) that integrates temporal-spatial and semantic consistency with Baliteral DDIM inversion. This framework introduces three key components: (1) Frame-based Temporal Consistency Blocks (FTC Blocks) to capture frame-specific features and enforce smooth inter-frame transitions via temporally-aware loss functions; (2) Channel-dependent Spatial Consistency Blocks (SCD Blocks) employing bilateral filters to enhance spatial coherence by reducing noise and artifacts; and (3) Token-based Semantic Consistency Module (TSC Module) to maintain semantic alignment using shared prompt tokens and frame-specific tokens. Our method significantly improves perceptual quality, text-image alignment, and temporal coherence, as demonstrated on the MSR-VTT dataset. Additionally, it achieves enhanced fidelity and frame-to-frame coherence, offering a practical solution for T2V editing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learnable Spatial-Temporal Positional Encoding for Link Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08309v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate predictions rely on the expressiveness power of graph deep learning frameworks like graph neural networks and graph transformers, where a positional encoding mechanism has become much more indispensable in recent state-of-the-art works to record the canonical position information. However, the current positional encoding is limited in three aspects: (1) most positional encoding methods use pre-defined, and fixed functions, which are inadequate to adapt to the complex attributed graphs; (2) a few pioneering works proposed the learnable positional encoding but are still limited to the structural information, not considering the real-world time-evolving topological and feature information; (3) most positional encoding methods are equipped with transformers' attention mechanism to fully leverage their capabilities, where the dense or relational attention is often unaffordable on large-scale structured data. Hence, we aim to develop Learnable Spatial-Temporal Positional Encoding in an effective and efficient manner and propose a simple temporal link prediction model named L-STEP. Briefly, for L-STEP, we (1) prove the proposed positional learning scheme can preserve the graph property from the spatial-temporal spectral viewpoint, (2) verify that MLPs can fully exploit the expressiveness and reach transformers' performance on that encoding, (3) change different initial positional encoding inputs to show robustness, (4) analyze the theoretical complexity and obtain less empirical running time than SOTA, and (5) demonstrate its temporal link prediction out-performance on 13 classic datasets and with 10 algorithms in both transductive and inductive settings using 3 different sampling strategies. Also, L-STEP obtains the leading performance in the newest large-scale TGB benchmark.

However, existing time-to-space sequential methods often fail to effectively extract features in block-wise missing data scenarios. Meanwhile, the static graph structure for spatial feature propagation significantly constrains the models flexibility in handling the distribution shift issue for the nonstationary traffic data. To address these issues, this paper proposes a SpatioTemporal Attention Mixture of experts network named STAMImputer for traffic data imputation. Specifically, we introduce a Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework to capture latent spatio-temporal features and their influence weights, effectively imputing block missing. A novel Low-rank guided Sampling Graph ATtention (LrSGAT) mechanism is designed to dynamically balance the local and global correlations across road networks. The sampled attention vectors are utilized to generate dynamic graphs that capture real-time spatial correlations. Extensive experiments are conducted on four traffic datasets for evaluation. The result shows STAMImputer achieves significantly performance improvement compared with existing SOTA approaches.

Many summarize agent behavior in terms of the constraints, or ''rules,'' which the agent adheres to during its trajectories. In this work, we narrow the focus from summary to specific moments in individual trajectories, offering a ''pointwise-in-time'' view. Our novel framework, which we define on Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) rules, assigns an intuitive status to any rule in order to describe the trajectory progress at individual time steps; here, a rule is classified as active, satisfied, inactive, or violated. Given a trajectory, a user may query for status of specific LTL rules at individual trajectory time steps. In this paper, we present this novel framework, named Rule Status Assessment (RSA), and provide an example of its implementation. We find that pointwise-in-time status assessment is useful as a post-hoc diagnostic, enabling a user to systematically track the agent's behavior with respect to a set of rules.</p></details> | <details><summary>See r...</summary><p>See related publication in Conference on Decision and Control (CDC) 2023</p></details> |
| **[Zero-Shot Temporal Interaction Localization for Egocentric Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03662v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Locating human-object interaction (HOI) actions within video serves as the foundation for multiple downstream tasks, such as human behavior analysis and human-robot skill transfer. Current temporal action localization methods typically rely on annotated action and object categories of interactions for optimization, which leads to domain bias and low deployment efficiency. Although some recent works have achieved zero-shot temporal action localization (ZS-TAL) with large vision-language models (VLMs), their coarse-grained estimations and open-loop pipelines hinder further performance improvements for temporal interaction localization (TIL). To address these issues, we propose a novel zero-shot TIL approach dubbed EgoLoc to locate the timings of grasp actions for human-object interaction in egocentric videos. EgoLoc introduces a self-adaptive sampling strategy to generate reasonable visual prompts for VLM reasoning. By absorbing both 2D and 3D observations, it directly samples high-quality initial guesses around the possible contact/separation timestamps of HOI according to 3D hand velocities, leading to high inference accuracy and efficiency. In addition, EgoLoc generates closed-loop feedback from visual and dynamic cues to further refine the localization results. Comprehensive experiments on the publicly available dataset and our newly proposed benchmark demonstrate that EgoLoc achieves better temporal interaction localization for egocentric videos compared to state-of-the-art baselines. We will release our code and relevant data as open-source at https://github.com/IRMVLab/EgoLoc.</p></details> |  |

Sensor delays often cause discrepancies between the actual time when the event was captured and the time of sensor measurement, leading to temporal misalignment (time offset) between sensor measurement streams. In this paper, we propose an extended Kalman filter (EKF)-based radar-inertial odometry (RIO) framework that estimates the time offset online. The radar ego-velocity measurement model, derived from a single radar scan, is formulated to incorporate the time offset into the update. By leveraging temporal calibration, the proposed RIO enables accurate propagation and measurement updates based on a common time stream. Experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate the accurate time offset estimation of the proposed method and its impact on RIO performance, validating the importance of sensor time synchronization. Our implementation of the EKF-RIO with online temporal calibration is available at https://github.com/spearwin/EKF-RIO-TC.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Key criteria for synthetic data include high data utility and traceability to verify the data source. Recent watermarking methods embed in homogeneous latent spaces, but state-of-the-art time series generators operate in real space, making latent-based watermarking incompatible. This creates the challenge of watermarking directly in real space while handling feature heterogeneity and temporal dependencies. We propose TimeWak, the first watermarking algorithm for multivariate time series diffusion models. To handle temporal dependence and spatial heterogeneity, TimeWak embeds a temporal chained-hashing watermark directly within the real temporal-feature space. The other unique feature is the $\epsilon$-exact inversion, which addresses the non-uniform reconstruction error distribution across features from inverting the diffusion process to detect watermarks. We derive the error bound of inverting multivariate time series and further maintain high watermark detectability. We extensively evaluate TimeWak on its impact on synthetic data quality, watermark detectability, and robustness under various post-editing attacks, against 5 datasets and baselines of different temporal lengths. Our results show that TimeWak achieves improvements of 61.96% in context-FID score, and 8.44% in correlational scores against the state-of-the-art baseline, while remaining consistently detectable.</p></details> |  |
| **[IssueCourier: Multi-Relational Heterogeneous Temporal Graph Neural Network for Open-Source Issue Assignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11205v3)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Issue assignment plays a critical role in open-source software (OSS) maintenance, which involves recommending the most suitable developers to address the reported issues. Given the high volume of issue reports in large-scale projects, manually assigning issues is tedious and costly. Previous studies have proposed automated issue assignment approaches that primarily focus on modeling issue report textual information, developers' expertise, or interactions between issues and developers based on historical issue-fixing records. However, these approaches often suffer from performance limitations due to the presence of incorrect and missing labels in OSS datasets, as well as the long tail of developer contributions and the changes of developer activity as the project evolves. To address these challenges, we propose IssueCourier, a novel Multi-Relational Heterogeneous Temporal Graph Neural Network approach for issue assignment. Specifically, we formalize five key relationships among issues, developers, and source code files to construct a heterogeneous graph. Then, we further adopt a temporal slicing technique that partitions the graph into a sequence of time-based subgraphs to learn stage-specific patterns. Furthermore, we provide a benchmark dataset with relabeled ground truth to address the problem of incorrect and missing labels in existing OSS datasets. Finally, to evaluate the performance of IssueCourier, we conduct extensive experiments on our benchmark dataset. The results show that IssueCourier can improve over the best baseline up to 45.49% in top-1 and 31.97% in MRR.</p></details> | 16 pages, 10 figures |
| **[TSRec: Enhancing Repeat-Aware Recommendation from a Temporal-Sequential Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08531v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Repeat consumption, such as repurchasing items and relistening songs, is a common scenario in daily life. To model repeat consumption, the repeat-aware recommendation has been proposed to predict which item will be re-interacted based on the user-item interactions. In this paper, we investigate various inherent characteristics to enhance the repeat-aware recommendation. Specifically, we explore these characteristics from two aspects: one is from the temporal aspect where we consider the time interval relationship in the user behavior sequence; the other is from the sequential aspect where we consider the sequential-level relationship in the user behavior sequence. And our intuition is that both the temporal pattern and sequential pattern will reflect users' intentions of repeat consumption. By utilizing these two patterns, a novel model called Temporal and Sequential repeat-aware Recommendation(TSRec for short) is proposed to enhance repeat-aware recommendation. TSRec has three main components: 1) User-specific Temporal Representation Module (UTRM), which encodes and extracts user historical repeat temporal information. 2)Item-specific Temporal Representation Module (ITRM), which incorporates item time interval information as side information to alleviate the data sparsity problem of user repeat behavior sequence. 3) Sequential Repeat-Aware Module (SRAM), which represents the similarity between the user's current and the last repeat sequences. Extensive experimental results on three public benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of TSRec over state-of-the-art methods. The implementation code is available https://anonymous.4open.science/r/TSRec-2306/.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods usually suffer from limited temporal coherence and prohibitively high computational costs (e.g., typically requiring over 8 NVIDIA A100-80G GPUs), especially for long videos. In this work, we propose LiftVSR, an efficient VSR framework that leverages and elevates the image-wise diffusion prior from PixArt-$\alpha$, achieving state-of-the-art results using only 4$\times$RTX 4090 GPUs. To balance long-term consistency and efficiency, we introduce a hybrid temporal modeling mechanism that decomposes temporal learning into two complementary components: (i) Dynamic Temporal Attention (DTA) for fine-grained temporal modeling within short frame segment ($\textit{i.e.}$, low complexity), and (ii) Attention Memory Cache (AMC) for long-term temporal modeling across segments ($\textit{i.e.}$, consistency). Specifically, DTA identifies multiple token flows across frames within multi-head query and key tokens to warp inter-frame contexts in the value tokens. AMC adaptively aggregates historical segment information via a cache unit, ensuring long-term coherence with minimal overhead. To further stabilize the cache interaction during inference, we introduce an asymmetric sampling strategy that mitigates feature mismatches arising from different diffusion sampling steps. Extensive experiments on several typical VSR benchmarks have demonstrated that LiftVSR achieves impressive performance with significantly lower computational costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://kopperx.github.io/projects/liftvsr</p></details> |

Existing Transformer-based methods often suffer from redundant attention and suboptimal multi-modal alignment. To address these limitations, we propose MLVTG, a novel framework that integrates two key modules: MambaAligner and LLMRefiner. MambaAligner uses stacked Vision Mamba blocks as a backbone instead of Transformers to model temporal dependencies and extract robust video representations for multi-modal alignment. LLMRefiner leverages the specific frozen layer of a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) to implicitly transfer semantic priors, enhancing multi-modal alignment without fine-tuning. This dual alignment strategy, temporal modeling via structured state-space dynamics and semantic purification via textual priors, enables more precise localization. Extensive experiments on QVHighlights, Charades-STA, and TVSum demonstrate that MLVTG achieves state-of-the-art performance and significantly outperforms existing baselines.</p></details> |  |

We propose UMaT, a theoretically-grounded framework that unifies visual and auditory inputs as structured text for large language models, addressing semantic alignment, temporal synchronization, and efficient sparse information retrieval. It significantly improves state-of-the-art Long Video Question Answering accuracy (up to 13.7%, and 16.9% on long videos) via redundancy minimization and structured textual representation for unified multi-modal reasoning</p></details> |  |
| **[Context-aware TFL: A Universal Context-aware Contrastive Learning Framework for Temporal Forgery Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08493v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most research efforts in the multimedia forensics domain have focused on detecting forgery audio-visual content and reached sound achievements. However, these works only consider deepfake detection as a classification task and ignore the case where partial segments of the video are tampered with. Temporal forgery localization (TFL) of small fake audio-visual clips embedded in real videos is still challenging and more in line with realistic application scenarios. To resolve this issue, we propose a universal context-aware contrastive learning framework (UniCaCLF) for TFL. Our approach leverages supervised contrastive learning to discover and identify forged instants by means of anomaly detection, allowing for the precise localization of temporal forged segments. To this end, we propose a novel context-aware perception layer that utilizes a heterogeneous activation operation and an adaptive context updater to construct a context-aware contrastive objective, which enhances the discriminability of forged instant features by contrasting them with genuine instant features in terms of their distances to the global context. An efficient context-aware contrastive coding is introduced to further push the limit of instant feature distinguishability between genuine and forged instants in a supervised sample-by-sample manner, suppressing the cross-sample influence to improve temporal forgery localization performance. Extensive experimental results over five public datasets demonstrate that our proposed UniCaCLF significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art competing algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[FinHEAR: Human Expertise and Adaptive Risk-Aware Temporal Reasoning for Financial Decision-Making](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09080v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Financial decision-making presents unique challenges for language models, demanding temporal reasoning, adaptive risk assessment, and responsiveness to dynamic events. While large language models (LLMs) show strong general reasoning capabilities, they often fail to capture behavioral patterns central to human financial decisions-such as expert reliance under information asymmetry, loss-averse sensitivity, and feedback-driven temporal adjustment. We propose FinHEAR, a multi-agent framework for Human Expertise and Adaptive Risk-aware reasoning. FinHEAR orchestrates specialized LLM-based agents to analyze historical trends, interpret current events, and retrieve expert-informed precedents within an event-centric pipeline. Grounded in behavioral economics, it incorporates expert-guided retrieval, confidence-adjusted position sizing, and outcome-based refinement to enhance interpretability and robustness. Empirical results on curated financial datasets show that FinHEAR consistently outperforms strong baselines across trend prediction and trading tasks, achieving higher accuracy and better risk-adjusted returns.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dense ReLU Neural Networks for Temporal-spatial Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09961v8)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we focus on fully connected deep neural networks utilizing the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function for nonparametric estimation. We derive non-asymptotic bounds that lead to convergence rates, addressing both temporal and spatial dependence in the observed measurements. By accounting for dependencies across time and space, our models better reflect the complexities of real-world data, enhancing both predictive performance and theoretical robustness. We also tackle the curse of dimensionality by modeling the data on a manifold, exploring the intrinsic dimensionality of high-dimensional data. We broaden existing theoretical findings of temporal-spatial analysis by applying them to neural networks in more general contexts and demonstrate that our proof techniques are effective for models with short-range dependence. Our empirical simulations across various synthetic response functions underscore the superior performance of our method, outperforming established approaches in the existing literature. These findings provide valuable insights into the strong capabilities of dense neural networks (Dense NN) for temporal-spatial modeling across a broad range of function classes.</p></details> |  |
| **[TPP-LLM: Modeling Temporal Point Processes by Efficiently Fine-Tuning Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02062v2)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal point processes (TPPs) are widely used to model the timing and occurrence of events in domains such as social networks, transportation systems, and e-commerce. In this paper, we introduce TPP-LLM, a novel framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) with TPPs to capture both the semantic and temporal aspects of event sequences. Unlike traditional methods that rely on categorical event type representations, TPP-LLM directly utilizes the textual descriptions of event types, enabling the model to capture rich semantic information embedded in the text. While LLMs excel at understanding event semantics, they are less adept at capturing temporal patterns. To address this, TPP-LLM incorporates temporal embeddings and employs parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods to effectively learn temporal dynamics without extensive retraining. This approach improves both predictive accuracy and computational efficiency. Experimental results across diverse real-world datasets demonstrate that TPP-LLM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in sequence modeling and event prediction, highlighting the benefits of combining LLMs with TPPs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Continuous Temporal Learning of Probability Distributions via Neural ODEs with Applications in Continuous Glucose Monitoring Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08698v2)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling the dynamics of probability distributions from time-dependent data samples is a fundamental problem in many fields, including digital health. The goal is to analyze how the distribution of a biomarker, such as glucose, changes over time and how these changes may reflect the progression of chronic diseases like diabetes. We introduce a probabilistic model based on a Gaussian mixture that captures the evolution of a continuous-time stochastic process. Our approach combines a non-parametric estimate of the distribution, obtained with Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), and a Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (Neural ODE) that governs the temporal evolution of the mixture weights. The model is highly interpretable, detects subtle distribution shifts, and remains computationally efficient. Simulation studies show that our method matches or surpasses the estimation accuracy of state-of-the-art, less interpretable techniques such as normalizing flows and non-parametric kernel density estimators. We further demonstrate its utility using data from a digital clinical trial, revealing how interventions affect the time-dependent distribution of glucose levels. The proposed method enables rigorous comparisons between control and treatment groups from both mathematical and clinical perspectives, offering novel longitudinal characterizations that existing approaches cannot achieve.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporalizing Confidence: Evaluation of Chain-of-Thought Reasoning with Signal Temporal Logic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08243v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in mathematical reasoning tasks when guided by Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. However, they tend to produce highly confident yet incorrect outputs, which poses significant risks in domains like education, where users may lack the expertise to assess reasoning steps. To address this, we propose a structured framework that models stepwise confidence as a temporal signal and evaluates it using Signal Temporal Logic (STL). In particular, we define formal STL-based constraints to capture desirable temporal properties and compute robustness scores that serve as structured, interpretable confidence estimates. Our approach also introduces a set of uncertainty reshaping strategies to enforce smoothness, monotonicity, and causal consistency across the reasoning trajectory. Experiments show that our approach consistently improves calibration metrics and provides more reliable uncertainty estimates than conventional confidence aggregation and post-hoc calibration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Compiling Metric Temporal Answer Set Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08150v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop a computational approach to Metric Answer Set Programming (ASP) to allow for expressing quantitative temporal constrains, like durations and deadlines. A central challenge is to maintain scalability when dealing with fine-grained timing constraints, which can significantly exacerbate ASP's grounding bottleneck. To address this issue, we leverage extensions of ASP with difference constraints, a simplified form of linear constraints, to handle time-related aspects externally. Our approach effectively decouples metric ASP from the granularity of time, resulting in a solution that is unaffected by time precision.</p></details> |  |
| **[Directed Exploration in Reinforcement Learning from Linear Temporal Logic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09495v2)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Linear temporal logic (LTL) is a powerful language for task specification in reinforcement learning, as it allows describing objectives beyond the expressivity of conventional discounted return formulations. Nonetheless, recent works have shown that LTL formulas can be translated into a variable rewarding and discounting scheme, whose optimization produces a policy maximizing a lower bound on the probability of formula satisfaction. However, the synthesized reward signal remains fundamentally sparse, making exploration challenging. We aim to overcome this limitation, which can prevent current algorithms from scaling beyond low-dimensional, short-horizon problems. We show how better exploration can be achieved by further leveraging the LTL specification and casting its corresponding Limit Deterministic B\"uchi Automaton (LDBA) as a Markov reward process, thus enabling a form of high-level value estimation. By taking a Bayesian perspective over LDBA dynamics and proposing a suitable prior distribution, we show that the values estimated through this procedure can be treated as a shaping potential and mapped to informative intrinsic rewards. Empirically, we demonstrate applications of our method from tabular settings to high-dimensional continuous systems, which have so far represented a significant challenge for LTL-based reinforcement learning algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cognitive Weave: Synthesizing Abstracted Knowledge with a Spatio-Temporal Resonance Graph](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08098v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of capable large language model (LLM) based agents necessitates memory architectures that transcend mere data storage, enabling continuous learning, nuanced reasoning, and dynamic adaptation. Current memory systems often grapple with fundamental limitations in structural flexibility, temporal awareness, and the ability to synthesize higher-level insights from raw interaction data. This paper introduces Cognitive Weave, a novel memory framework centered around a multi-layered spatio-temporal resonance graph (STRG). This graph manages information as semantically rich insight particles (IPs), which are dynamically enriched with resonance keys, signifiers, and situational imprints via a dedicated semantic oracle interface (SOI). These IPs are interconnected through typed relational strands, forming an evolving knowledge tapestry. A key component of Cognitive Weave is the cognitive refinement process, an autonomous mechanism that includes the synthesis of insight aggregates (IAs) condensed, higher-level knowledge structures derived from identified clusters of related IPs. We present comprehensive experimental results demonstrating Cognitive Weave's marked enhancement over existing approaches in long-horizon planning tasks, evolving question-answering scenarios, and multi-session dialogue coherence. The system achieves a notable 34% average improvement in task completion rates and a 42% reduction in mean query latency when compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, this paper explores the ethical considerations inherent in such advanced memory systems, discusses the implications for long-term memory in LLMs, and outlines promising future research trajectories.</p></details> |  |
| **[Audio-Sync Video Generation with Multi-Stream Temporal Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08003v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Audio is inherently temporal and closely synchronized with the visual world, making it a naturally aligned and expressive control signal for controllable video generation (e.g., movies). Beyond control, directly translating audio into video is essential for understanding and visualizing rich audio narratives (e.g., Podcasts or historical recordings). However, existing approaches fall short in generating high-quality videos with precise audio-visual synchronization, especially across diverse and complex audio types. In this work, we introduce MTV, a versatile framework for audio-sync video generation. MTV explicitly separates audios into speech, effects, and music tracks, enabling disentangled control over lip motion, event timing, and visual mood, respectively -- resulting in fine-grained and semantically aligned video generation. To support the framework, we additionally present DEMIX, a dataset comprising high-quality cinematic videos and demixed audio tracks. DEMIX is structured into five overlapped subsets, enabling scalable multi-stage training for diverse generation scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MTV achieves state-of-the-art performance across six standard metrics spanning video quality, text-video consistency, and audio-video alignment.

| **[Spatio-Temporal State Space Model For Efficient Event-Based Optical Flow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07878v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event cameras unlock new frontiers that were previously unthinkable with standard frame-based cameras. One notable example is low-latency motion estimation (optical flow), which is critical for many real-time applications. In such applications, the computational efficiency of algorithms is paramount. Although recent deep learning paradigms such as CNN, RNN, or ViT have shown remarkable performance, they often lack the desired computational efficiency. Conversely, asynchronous event-based methods including SNNs and GNNs are computationally efficient; however, these approaches fail to capture sufficient spatio-temporal information, a powerful feature required to achieve better performance for optical flow estimation. In this work, we introduce Spatio-Temporal State Space Model (STSSM) module along with a novel network architecture to develop an extremely efficient solution with competitive performance. Our STSSM module leverages state-space models to effectively capture spatio-temporal correlations in event data, offering higher performance with lower complexity compared to ViT, CNN-based architectures in similar settings. Our model achieves 4.5x faster inference and 8x lower computations compared to TMA and 2x lower computations compared to EV-FlowNet with competitive performance on the DSEC benchmark.

| **[A Temporal FRBR/FRBRoo-Based Model for Component-Level Versioning of Legal Norms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07853v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effectively representing legal norms for automated processing is a critical challenge, particularly in tracking the diachronic evolution of their hierarchical components (e.g., articles, paragraphs). While foundational frameworks like FRBR/FRBRoo and standards like Akoma Ntoso model legal documents at a macro level, they lack native mechanisms for granular, component-level versioning. This limitation hinders the deterministic point-in-time reconstruction of legal texts, a fundamental capability for reliable Legal Tech and AI applications. This paper proposes a structured, temporal model that extends the FRBRoo framework to address this gap. It introduces specialized subclasses of Expressio - Temporal Version (TV) and Language Version (LV - to represent the state of a legal norm and its linguistic variations at specific points in time. The model applies this same paradigm hierarchically, introducing Component Work (CW), Component Temporal Version (CTV), and Component Language Version (CLV) to track the lifecycle of individual articles, paragraphs, and clauses. Using the Brazilian Federal Constitution as a case study, the paper demonstrates how each amendment creates new Component Temporal Versions for affected provisions, while unaffected components retain their existing versions. This fine-grained, time-aware architecture enables the precise, deterministic retrieval and reconstruction of any part of a legal text as it existed on a specific date. The model provides a robust foundation for developing advanced legal information systems, knowledge graphs, and AI tools capable of accurate historical analysis and impact assessment, overcoming the limitations of current generative models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Decentralizing Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Temporal Causal Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07829v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms can find an optimal policy for a single agent to accomplish a particular task. However, many real-world problems require multiple agents to collaborate in order to achieve a common goal. For example, a robot executing a task in a warehouse may require the assistance of a drone to retrieve items from high shelves. In Decentralized Multi-Agent RL (DMARL), agents learn independently and then combine their policies at execution time, but often must satisfy constraints on compatibility of local policies to ensure that they can achieve the global task when combined. In this paper, we study how providing high-level symbolic knowledge to agents can help address unique challenges of this setting, such as privacy constraints, communication limitations, and performance concerns. In particular, we extend the formal tools used to check the compatibility of local policies with the team task, making decentralized training with theoretical guarantees usable in more scenarios. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that symbolic knowledge about the temporal evolution of events in the environment can significantly expedite the learning process in DMARL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Weakly Supervised Temporal Action Localization via Dual-Prior Collaborative Learning Guided by Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08466v2)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent breakthroughs in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have gained significant recognition within the deep learning community, where the fusion of the Video Foundation Models (VFMs) and Large Language Models(LLMs) has proven instrumental in constructing robust video understanding systems, effectively surmounting constraints associated with predefined visual tasks. These sophisticated MLLMs exhibit remarkable proficiency in comprehending videos, swiftly attaining unprecedented performance levels across diverse benchmarks. However, their operation demands substantial memory and computational resources, underscoring the continued importance of traditional models in video comprehension tasks. In this paper, we introduce a novel learning paradigm termed MLLM4WTAL. This paradigm harnesses the potential of MLLM to offer temporal action key semantics and complete semantic priors for conventional Weakly-supervised Temporal Action Localization (WTAL) methods. MLLM4WTAL facilitates the enhancement of WTAL by leveraging MLLM guidance. It achieves this by integrating two distinct modules: Key Semantic Matching (KSM) and Complete Semantic Reconstruction (CSR). These modules work in tandem to effectively address prevalent issues like incomplete and over-complete outcomes common in WTAL methods. Rigorous experiments are conducted to validate the efficacy of our proposed approach in augmenting the performance of various heterogeneous WTAL models.</p></details> | Accepted to CVPR |

However, most existing neural B-frame codecs directly adopt P-frame coding tools without adequately addressing the unique challenges of B-frame compression, leading to suboptimal performance. To bridge this gap, we propose novel enhancements for motion compression and temporal fusion for neural B-frame coding. First, we design a fine-grained motion compression method. This method incorporates an interactive dual-branch motion auto-encoder with per-branch adaptive quantization steps, which enables fine-grained compression of bi-directional motion vectors while accommodating their asymmetric bitrate allocation and reconstruction quality requirements. Furthermore, this method involves an interactive motion entropy model that exploits correlations between bi-directional motion latent representations by interactively leveraging partitioned latent segments as directional priors. Second, we propose a selective temporal fusion method that predicts bi-directional fusion weights to achieve discriminative utilization of bi-directional multi-scale temporal contexts with varying qualities. Additionally, this method introduces a hyperprior-based implicit alignment mechanism for contextual entropy modeling. By treating the hyperprior as a surrogate for the contextual latent representation, this mechanism implicitly mitigates the misalignment in the fused bi-directional temporal priors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed codec outperforms state-of-the-art neural B-frame codecs and achieves comparable or even superior compression performance to the H.266/VVC reference software under random-access configurations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Continuous Urban Change Detection from Satellite Image Time Series with Temporal Feature Refinement and Multi-Task Integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17458v3)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urbanization advances at unprecedented rates, leading to negative environmental and societal impacts. Remote sensing can help mitigate these effects by supporting sustainable development strategies with accurate information on urban growth. Deep learning-based methods have achieved promising urban change detection results from optical satellite image pairs using convolutional neural networks (ConvNets), transformers, and a multi-task learning setup. However, bi-temporal methods are limited for continuous urban change detection, i.e., the detection of changes in consecutive image pairs of satellite image time series (SITS), as they fail to fully exploit multi-temporal data (> 2 images). Existing multi-temporal change detection methods, on the other hand, collapse the temporal dimension, restricting their ability to capture continuous urban changes. Additionally, multi-task learning methods lack integration approaches that combine change and segmentation outputs. To address these challenges, we propose a continuous urban change detection framework incorporating two key modules. The temporal feature refinement (TFR) module employs self-attention to improve ConvNet-based multi-temporal building representations. The temporal dimension is preserved in the TFR module, enabling the detection of continuous changes. The multi-task integration (MTI) module utilizes Markov networks to find an optimal building map time series based on segmentation and dense change outputs. The proposed framework effectively identifies urban changes based on high-resolution SITS acquired by the PlanetScope constellation (F1 score 0.551), Gaofen-2 (F1 score 0.440), and WorldView-2 (F1 score 0.543). Moreover, our experiments on three challenging datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework compared to bi-temporal and multi-temporal urban change detection and segmentation methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, Code will be available at https://github.com/SebastianHafner/ContUrbanCD.git</p></details> |
| **[GLOS: Sign Language Generation with Temporally Aligned Gloss-Level Conditioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07460v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sign language generation (SLG), or text-to-sign generation, bridges the gap between signers and non-signers. Despite recent progress in SLG, existing methods still often suffer from incorrect lexical ordering and low semantic accuracy. This is primarily due to sentence-level condition, which encodes the entire sentence of the input text into a single feature vector as a condition for SLG. This approach fails to capture the temporal structure of sign language and lacks the granularity of word-level semantics, often leading to disordered sign sequences and ambiguous motions. To overcome these limitations, we propose GLOS, a sign language generation framework with temporally aligned gloss-level conditioning. First, we employ gloss-level conditions, which we define as sequences of gloss embeddings temporally aligned with the motion sequence. This enables the model to access both the temporal structure of sign language and word-level semantics at each timestep. As a result, this allows for fine-grained control of signs and better preservation of lexical order. Second, we introduce a condition fusion module, temporal alignment conditioning (TAC), to efficiently deliver the word-level semantic and temporal structure provided by the gloss-level condition to the corresponding motion timesteps. Our method, which is composed of gloss-level conditions and TAC, generates signs with correct lexical order and high semantic accuracy, outperforming prior methods on CSL-Daily and Phoenix-2014T.</p></details> |  |
| **[ST-GraphNet: A Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network for Understanding and Predicting Automated Vehicle Crash Severity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08051v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the spatial and temporal dynamics of automated vehicle (AV) crash severity is critical for advancing urban mobility safety and infrastructure planning. In this work, we introduce ST-GraphNet, a spatio-temporal graph neural network framework designed to model and predict AV crash severity by using both fine-grained and region-aggregated spatial graphs. Using a balanced dataset of 2,352 real-world AV-related crash reports from Texas (2024), including geospatial coordinates, crash timestamps, SAE automation levels, and narrative descriptions, we construct two complementary graph representations: (1) a fine-grained graph with individual crash events as nodes, where edges are defined via spatio-temporal proximity; and (2) a coarse-grained graph where crashes are aggregated into Hexagonal Hierarchical Spatial Indexing (H3)-based spatial cells, connected through hexagonal adjacency. Each node in the graph is enriched with multimodal data, including semantic, spatial, and temporal attributes, including textual embeddings from crash narratives using a pretrained Sentence-BERT model. We evaluate various graph neural network (GNN) architectures, such as Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), Graph Attention Networks (GAT), and Dynamic Spatio-Temporal GCN (DSTGCN), to classify crash severity and predict high-risk regions. Our proposed ST-GraphNet, which utilizes a DSTGCN backbone on the coarse-grained H3 graph, achieves a test accuracy of 97.74\%, substantially outperforming the best fine-grained model (64.7\% test accuracy). These findings highlight the effectiveness of spatial aggregation, dynamic message passing, and multi-modal feature integration in capturing the complex spatio-temporal patterns underlying AV crash severity.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Diffusion-Driven Temporal Super-Resolution and Spatial Consistency Enhancement Framework for 4D MRI imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04116v2)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In medical imaging, 4D MRI enables dynamic 3D visualization, yet the trade-off between spatial and temporal resolution requires prolonged scan time that can compromise temporal fidelity--especially during rapid, large-amplitude motion. Traditional approaches typically rely on registration-based interpolation to generate intermediate frames. However, these methods struggle with large deformations, resulting in misregistration, artifacts, and diminished spatial consistency. To address these challenges, we propose TSSC-Net, a novel framework that generates intermediate frames while preserving spatial consistency. To improve temporal fidelity under fast motion, our diffusion-based temporal super-resolution network generates intermediate frames using the start and end frames as key references, achieving 6x temporal super-resolution in a single inference step. Additionally, we introduce a novel tri-directional Mamba-based module that leverages long-range contextual information to effectively resolve spatial inconsistencies arising from cross-slice misalignment, thereby enhancing volumetric coherence and correcting cross-slice errors. Extensive experiments were performed on the public ACDC cardiac MRI dataset and a real-world dynamic 4D knee joint dataset. The results demonstrate that TSSC-Net can generate high-resolution dynamic MRI from fast-motion data while preserving structural fidelity and spatial consistency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Question Answering under Temporal Conflict: Evaluating and Organizing Evolving Knowledge with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07270v1)** | 2025-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities in question answering and reasoning thanks to their extensive parametric memory. However, their knowledge is inherently limited by the scope of their pre-training data, while real-world information evolves continuously. Updating this knowledge typically requires costly and brittle re-training, or in-context learning (ICL), which becomes impractical at scale given the volume and volatility of modern information. Motivated by these limitations, we investigate how LLMs perform when exposed to temporal text corpora, or documents that reflect evolving knowledge over time, such as sports biographies where facts like a player's "current team" change year by year. To this end, we introduce two new benchmarks: Temporal Wiki, which captures factual drift across historical Wikipedia snapshots, and Unified Clark, which aggregates timestamped news articles to simulate real-world information accumulation. Our analysis reveals that LLMs often struggle to reconcile conflicting or outdated facts and can be misled when multiple versions of a fact appear in context. To address these issues, we propose a lightweight, agentic framework that incrementally builds a structured, external memory from source documents without requiring re-training. This knowledge organization strategy enables models to retrieve and reason over temporally filtered, relevant information at inference time. Empirically, our method outperforms ICL and RAG baselines across both benchmarks, especially on questions requiring more complex reasoning or integration of conflicting facts.</p></details> |  |

Despite advancements in artificial intelligence enabling automated sleep staging, significant challenges remain: (1) Simultaneously extracting prominent temporal and spatial sleep features from multi-channel raw signals, including characteristic sleep waveforms and salient spatial brain networks. (2) Capturing the spatial-temporal coupling patterns essential for accurate sleep staging. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework named ST-USleepNet, comprising a spatial-temporal graph construction module (ST) and a U-shaped sleep network (USleepNet). The ST module converts raw signals into a spatial-temporal graph based on signal similarity, temporal, and spatial relationships to model spatial-temporal coupling patterns. The USleepNet employs a U-shaped structure for both the temporal and spatial streams, mirroring its original use in image segmentation to isolate significant targets. Applied to raw sleep signals and graph data from the ST module, USleepNet effectively segments these inputs, simultaneously extracting prominent temporal and spatial sleep features. Testing on three datasets demonstrates that ST-USleepNet outperforms existing baselines, and model visualizations confirm its efficacy in extracting prominent sleep features and temporal-spatial coupling patterns across various sleep stages. The code is available at https://github.com/Majy-Yuji/ST-USleepNet.</p></details> |  |

While existing benchmarks assess basic ToM abilities, they predominantly focus on static snapshots of mental states, overlooking the temporal evolution that characterizes real-world social interactions. We present \textsc{DynToM}, a novel benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs' ability to understand and track the temporal progression of mental states across interconnected scenarios. Through a systematic four-step framework, we generate 1,100 social contexts encompassing 5,500 scenarios and 78,100 questions, each validated for realism and quality. Our comprehensive evaluation of ten state-of-the-art LLMs reveals that their average performance underperforms humans by 44.7\%, with performance degrading significantly when tracking and reasoning about the shift of mental states. This performance gap highlights fundamental limitations in current LLMs' ability to model the dynamic nature of human mental states.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACL 2025 Main Conference</p></details> |

We argue that sharing contextual information between frames or clips is pivotal in fostering temporal consistency. Therefore, we reformulate depth prediction into a conditional generation problem to provide contextual information within a clip and across clips. Specifically, we propose a consistent context-aware training and inference strategy for arbitrarily long videos to provide cross-clip context. We sample independent noise levels for each frame within a clip during training while using a sliding window strategy and initializing overlapping frames with previously predicted frames without adding noise. Moreover, we design an effective training strategy to provide context within a clip. Extensive experimental results validate our design choices and demonstrate the superiority of our approach, dubbed ChronoDepth.

| **[Video LLMs for Temporal Reasoning in Long Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02930v3)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces TemporalVLM, a video large language model (video LLM) capable of effective temporal reasoning and fine-grained understanding in long videos. At the core, our approach includes a visual encoder for mapping a long-term input video into features which are time-aware and contain both local and global cues. In particular, it first divides the input video into short-term clips, which are jointly encoded with their timestamps into time-sensitive local features. Next, the local features are passed through a bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) module for global feature aggregation. The extracted time-aware and multi-level features are important for accurate temporal reasoning and fine-grained understanding in long videos. Moreover, to facilitate the evaluation of TemporalVLM, we present a large-scale long video dataset of industry assembly processes, namely IndustryASM, which consists of videos recorded on factory floors with actions and timestamps annotated by industrial engineers for time and motion studies and temporal action segmentation evaluation. Finally, extensive experiments on datasets of long videos, including TimeIT and IndustryASM, show that TemporalVLM achieves superior performance than previous methods across temporal reasoning and fine-grained understanding tasks, namely dense video captioning, temporal video grounding, video highlight detection, and temporal action segmentation. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to incorporate LSTMs into video LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[STSBench: A Spatio-temporal Scenario Benchmark for Multi-modal Large Language Models in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06218v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce STSBench, a scenario-based framework to benchmark the holistic understanding of vision-language models (VLMs) for autonomous driving. The framework automatically mines pre-defined traffic scenarios from any dataset using ground-truth annotations, provides an intuitive user interface for efficient human verification, and generates multiple-choice questions for model evaluation. Applied to the NuScenes dataset, we present STSnu, the first benchmark that evaluates the spatio-temporal reasoning capabilities of VLMs based on comprehensive 3D perception. Existing benchmarks typically target off-the-shelf or fine-tuned VLMs for images or videos from a single viewpoint and focus on semantic tasks such as object recognition, dense captioning, risk assessment, or scene understanding. In contrast, STSnu evaluates driving expert VLMs for end-to-end driving, operating on videos from multi-view cameras or LiDAR. It specifically assesses their ability to reason about both ego-vehicle actions and complex interactions among traffic participants, a crucial capability for autonomous vehicles. The benchmark features 43 diverse scenarios spanning multiple views and frames, resulting in 971 human-verified multiple-choice questions. A thorough evaluation uncovers critical shortcomings in existing models' ability to reason about fundamental traffic dynamics in complex environments. These findings highlight the urgent need for architectural advances that explicitly model spatio-temporal reasoning. By addressing a core gap in spatio-temporal evaluation, STSBench enables the development of more robust and explainable VLMs for autonomous driving.</p></details> | <details><summary>Datas...</summary><p>Dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/ivc-lrp/STSBench, Code: https://github.com/LRP-IVC/STSBench</p></details> |

In particular, two problems emerge: (1) Encoding longer histories requires more computational resources, making it crucial for CTDG models to maintain low computational complexity to ensure efficiency; (2) Meanwhile, more powerful models are needed to identify and select the most critical temporal information within the extended context provided by longer histories. To address these problems, we propose a CTDG representation learning model named DyGMamba, originating from the popular Mamba state space model (SSM). DyGMamba first leverages a node-level SSM to encode the sequence of historical node interactions. Another time-level SSM is then employed to exploit the temporal patterns hidden in the historical graph, where its output is used to dynamically select the critical information from the interaction history. We validate DyGMamba experimentally on the dynamic link prediction task. The results show that our model achieves state-of-the-art in most cases. DyGMamba also maintains high efficiency in terms of computational resources, making it possible to capture long temporal dependencies with a limited computation budget.</p></details> | Accepted to TMLR |

Electronic health records (EHRs), particularly those from intensive care units (ICUs), contain rich temporal clinical data that can be leveraged for this purpose. In this work, we introduce ICU-TSB (Temporal Stratification Benchmark), the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating patient stratification based on temporal patient representation learning using three publicly available ICU EHR datasets. A key contribution of our benchmark is a novel hierarchical evaluation framework utilizing disease taxonomies to measure the alignment of discovered clusters with clinically validated disease groupings. In our experiments with ICU-TSB, we compared statistical methods and several recurrent neural networks, including LSTM and GRU, for their ability to generate effective patient representations for subsequent clustering of patient trajectories. Our results demonstrate that temporal representation learning can rediscover clinically meaningful patient cohorts; nevertheless, it remains a challenging task, with v-measuring varying from up to 0.46 at the top level of the taxonomy to up to 0.40 at the lowest level. To further enhance the practical utility of our findings, we also evaluate multiple strategies for assigning interpretable labels to the identified clusters. The experiments and benchmark are fully reproducible and available at https://github.com/ds4dh/CBMS2025stratification.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages 1 table 6 figures</p></details> |

Specifically, we consider a single UAV with 3 degree-of-freedom dynamics tasked with delivering blood packages to multiple hospitals, each with a predefined time window and priority. Mission objectives are encoded using Signal Temporal Logic (STL), enabling the formal specification of spatial-temporal constraints. To ensure safety, city buildings are modeled as 3D convex obstacles, and obstacle avoidance is handled through a Convex Feasible Set (CFS) method. The entire planning problem-combining UAV dynamics, STL satisfaction, and collision avoidance-is formulated as a convex optimization problem that ensures tractability and can be solved efficiently using standard convex programming techniques. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method generates dynamically feasible, collision-free trajectories that satisfy temporal mission goals, providing a scalable and reliable approach for autonomous UAV-based medical logistics.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |

However, they have not yet been empirically supported by laboratory experiments with real human participants. In this work we demonstrate how multi-agent reinforcement learning can model group behavior in a spatially and temporally complex public good provision game called Clean Up. We show that human groups succeed in Clean Up when they can see who is who and track reputations over time but fail under conditions of anonymity. A new multi-agent reinforcement learning model of reputation-based cooperation demonstrates the same difference between identifiable and anonymous conditions. Furthermore, both human groups and artificial agent groups solve the problem via turn-taking despite other options being available. Our results highlight the benefits of using multi-agent reinforcement learning to model human social behavior in complex environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>45 pa...</summary><p>45 pages, 29 figures. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2103.04982</p></details> |

This study investigates the temporal and spatial similarities in their service demands to assess potential for routine cross-agency collaboration. Time series analysis revealed aligned demand peaks in summer, on Fridays, during daytime hours, and were highly sensitive to high temperature weather conditions. Bivariate mapping and Moran I indicated significant spatial overlaps in central London and Hillingdon. Geographically Weighted Regression, GWR, examined the influence of socioeconomic factors, while Comap analysis uncovered spatiotemporal heterogeneity across fire service types. The findings highlight opportunities for targeted collaboration in high-overlap areas and peak periods, offering practical insights to enhance emergency service resilience and efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Respecting Temporal-Causal Consistency: Entity-Event Knowledge Graphs for Retrieval-Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05939v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) based on large language models often falters on narrative documents with inherent temporal structures. Standard unstructured RAG methods rely solely on embedding-similarity matching and lack any general mechanism to encode or exploit chronological information, while knowledge graph RAG (KG-RAG) frameworks collapse every mention of an entity into a single node, erasing the evolving context that drives many queries. To formalize this challenge and draw the community's attention, we construct ChronoQA, a robust and discriminative QA benchmark that measures temporal, causal, and character consistency understanding in narrative documents (e.g., novels) under the RAG setting. We then introduce Entity-Event RAG (E^2RAG), a dual-graph framework that keeps separate entity and event subgraphs linked by a bipartite mapping, thereby preserving the temporal and causal facets needed for fine-grained reasoning. Across ChronoQA, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art unstructured and KG-based RAG baselines, with notable gains on causal and character consistency queries. E^2RAG therefore offers a practical path to more context-aware retrieval for tasks that require precise answers grounded in chronological information.</p></details> | 24 pages, 4 figures |

To overcome this limitation, we propose a customized positional embedding strategy tailored to enhance temporal modeling capabilities.

| **[TT-Occ: Test-Time Compute for Self-Supervised Occupancy via Spatio-Temporal Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08485v2)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised 3D occupancy prediction offers a promising solution for understanding complex driving scenes without requiring costly 3D annotations. However, training dense occupancy decoders to capture fine-grained geometry and semantics can demand hundreds of GPU hours, and once trained, such models struggle to adapt to varying voxel resolutions or novel object categories without extensive retraining. To overcome these limitations, we propose a practical and flexible test-time occupancy prediction framework termed TT-Occ. Our method incrementally constructs, optimizes and voxelizes time-aware 3D Gaussians from raw sensor streams by integrating vision foundation models (VLMs) at runtime. The flexible nature of 3D Gaussians allows voxelization at arbitrary user-specified resolutions, while the generalization ability of VLMs enables accurate perception and open-vocabulary recognition, without any network training or fine-tuning. Specifically, TT-Occ operates in a lift-track-voxelize symphony: We first lift the geometry and semantics of surrounding-view extracted from VLMs to instantiate Gaussians at 3D space; Next, we track dynamic Gaussians while accumulating static ones to complete the scene and enforce temporal consistency; Finally, we voxelize the optimized Gaussians to generate occupancy prediction. Optionally, inherent noise in VLM predictions and tracking is mitigated by periodically smoothing neighboring Gaussians during optimization. To validate the generality and effectiveness of our framework, we offer two variants: one LiDAR-based and one vision-centric, and conduct extensive experiments on Occ3D and nuCraft benchmarks with varying voxel resolutions. Code will be available at https://github.com/Xian-Bei/TT-Occ.</p></details> |  |

These methods face challenges such as memorization, sensitivity to table size, and reduced performance on complex queries. To overcome these limitations, we introduce TempTabQA-C, a synthetic dataset designed for systematic and controlled evaluations, alongside a symbolic intermediate representation that transforms tables into database schemas. This structured approach allows LLMs to generate and execute SQL queries, enhancing generalization and mitigating biases. By incorporating adaptive few-shot prompting with contextually tailored examples, our method achieves superior robustness, scalability, and performance. Experimental results consistently highlight improvements across key challenges, setting a new benchmark for robust temporal reasoning with LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL Findings 2025</p></details> |

Our approach utilizes a transformer architecture with heterogeneous type embedding trained using temporal-difference learning. After obtaining an initial estimate using the transformer, following the targeted minimum loss-based likelihood estimation (TMLE) framework, we statistically corrected for the bias commonly associated with machine learning algorithms. Furthermore, our method also facilitates statistical inference by enabling the provision of 95% confidence intervals grounded in asymptotic statistical theory. Simulation results demonstrate our method's superior performance over existing approaches, particularly in complex, long time-horizon scenarios. It remains effective in small-sample, short-duration contexts, matching the performance of asymptotically efficient estimators. To demonstrate our method in practice, we applied our method to estimate counterfactual mean outcomes for standard versus intensive blood pressure management strategies in a real-world cardiovascular epidemiology cohort study.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in ICML 2024, PMLR 235</p></details> |

In this work, we introduce visual trace prompting, a simple yet effective approach to facilitate VLA models' spatial-temporal awareness for action prediction by encoding state-action trajectories visually. We develop a new TraceVLA model by finetuning OpenVLA on our own collected dataset of 150K robot manipulation trajectories using visual trace prompting. Evaluations of TraceVLA across 137 configurations in SimplerEnv and 4 tasks on a physical WidowX robot demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, outperforming OpenVLA by 10% on SimplerEnv and 3.5x on real-robot tasks and exhibiting robust generalization across diverse embodiments and scenarios. To further validate the effectiveness and generality of our method, we present a compact VLA model based on 4B Phi-3-Vision, pretrained on the Open-X-Embodiment and finetuned on our dataset, rivals the 7B OpenVLA baseline while significantly improving inference efficiency.</p></details> |  |

Time series data is characterized by low per-timestep information density and complex dependencies across channels and covariates, requiring conditioning on structured variable interactions. To address this mismatch and overparameterization, we propose FaCTR, a lightweight spatiotemporal Transformer with an explicitly structural design. FaCTR injects dynamic, symmetric cross-channel interactions-modeled via a low-rank Factorization Machine into temporally contextualized patch embeddings through a learnable gating mechanism. It further encodes static and dynamic covariates for multivariate conditioning. Despite its compact design, FaCTR achieves state-of-the-art performance on eleven public forecasting benchmarks spanning both short-term and long-term horizons, with its largest variant using close to only 400K parameters-on average 50x smaller than competitive spatiotemporal transformer baselines. In addition, its structured design enables interpretability through cross-channel influence scores-an essential requirement for real-world decision-making. Finally, FaCTR supports self-supervised pretraining, positioning it as a compact yet versatile foundation for downstream time series tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multivariate Temporal Regression at Scale: A Three-Pillar Framework Combining ML, XAI, and NLP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02151v2)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a novel framework that accelerates the discovery of actionable relationships in high-dimensional temporal data by integrating machine learning (ML), explainable AI (XAI), and natural language processing (NLP) to enhance data quality and streamline workflows. Traditional methods often fail to recognize complex temporal relationships, leading to noisy, redundant, or biased datasets. Our approach combines ML-driven pruning to identify and mitigate low-quality samples, XAI-based interpretability to validate critical feature interactions, and NLP for future contextual validation, reducing the time required to uncover actionable insights by 40-60%. Evaluated on real-world agricultural and synthetic datasets, the framework significantly improves performance metrics (e.g., MSE, R2, MAE) and computational efficiency, with hardware-agnostic scalability across diverse platforms. While long-term real-world impacts (e.g., cost savings, sustainability gains) are pending, this methodology provides an immediate pathway to accelerate data-centric AI in dynamic domains like agriculture and energy, enabling faster iteration cycles for domain experts.</p></details> | 7 pages |

Current video-based approaches, while proficient in tracking, lack the sophisticated reasoning capabilities of large language models, limiting their contextual understanding and generalization. We introduce VideoMolmo, a large multimodal model tailored for fine-grained spatio-temporal pointing conditioned on textual descriptions. Building upon the Molmo architecture, VideoMolmo incorporates a temporal module utilizing an attention mechanism to condition each frame on preceding frames, ensuring temporal consistency. Additionally, our novel temporal mask fusion pipeline employs SAM2 for bidirectional point propagation, significantly enhancing coherence across video sequences. This two-step decomposition, i.e., first using the LLM to generate precise pointing coordinates, then relying on a sequential mask-fusion module to produce coherent segmentation, not only simplifies the task for the language model but also enhances interpretability. Due to the lack of suitable datasets, we curate a comprehensive dataset comprising 72k video-caption pairs annotated with 100k object points. To evaluate the generalization of VideoMolmo, we introduce VPoS-Bench, a challenging out-of-distribution benchmark spanning five real-world scenarios: Cell Tracking, Egocentric Vision, Autonomous Driving, Video-GUI Interaction, and Robotics. We also evaluate our model on Referring Video Object Segmentation (Refer-VOS) and Reasoning VOS tasks. In comparison to existing models, VideoMolmo substantially improves spatio-temporal pointing accuracy and reasoning capability.

Existing CoVR benchmarks emphasize appearance shifts or coarse event changes and therefore do not test the ability to capture subtle, fast-paced temporal differences. We introduce TF-CoVR, the first large-scale benchmark dedicated to temporally fine-grained CoVR. TF-CoVR focuses on gymnastics and diving and provides 180K triplets drawn from FineGym and FineDiving. Previous CoVR benchmarks focusing on temporal aspect, link each query to a single target segment taken from the same video, limiting practical usefulness. In TF-CoVR, we instead construct each <query, modification> pair by prompting an LLM with the label differences between clips drawn from different videos; every pair is thus associated with multiple valid target videos (3.9 on average), reflecting real-world tasks such as sports-highlight generation. To model these temporal dynamics we propose TF-CoVR-Base, a concise two-stage training framework: (i) pre-train a video encoder on fine-grained action classification to obtain temporally discriminative embeddings; (ii) align the composed query with candidate videos using contrastive learning. We conduct the first comprehensive study of image, video, and general multimodal embedding (GME) models on temporally fine-grained composed retrieval in both zero-shot and fine-tuning regimes. On TF-CoVR, TF-CoVR-Base improves zero-shot mAP@50 from 5.92 (LanguageBind) to 7.51, and after fine-tuning raises the state-of-the-art from 19.83 to 25.82.</p></details> |  |

As for the motion-transfer task, current methods mainly use two-stage Low-Rank Adaptations (LoRAs) finetuning to obtain better performance. However, existing adaptation-based motion transfer still suffers from motion inconsistency and tuning inefficiency when applied to large video diffusion transformers. Naive two-stage LoRA tuning struggles to maintain motion consistency between generated and input videos due to the inherent spatial-temporal coupling in the 3D attention operator. Additionally, they require time-consuming fine-tuning processes in both stages. To tackle these issues, we propose Follow-Your-Motion, an efficient two-stage video motion transfer framework that finetunes a powerful video diffusion transformer to synthesize complex motion.Specifically, we propose a spatial-temporal decoupled LoRA to decouple the attention architecture for spatial appearance and temporal motion processing. During the second training stage, we design the sparse motion sampling and adaptive RoPE to accelerate the tuning speed. To address the lack of a benchmark for this field, we introduce MotionBench, a comprehensive benchmark comprising diverse motion, including creative camera motion, single object motion, multiple object motion, and complex human motion. We show extensive evaluations on MotionBench to verify the superiority of Follow-Your-Motion.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: https://follow-your-motion.github.io/</p></details> |

In the case of human behavior, face-to-face interaction networks enable us to understand the dynamics of how communities emerge and evolve in time through the interactions, which is crucial in fields like epidemics, sociological studies and urban science. However, state-of-the-art datasets suffer from a number of drawbacks, such as short time-span for data collection and a small number of participants. Moreover, concerns arise for the participants' privacy and the data collection costs. Over the past years, many successful algorithms for static networks generation have been proposed, but they often do not tackle the social structure of interactions or their temporal aspect. In this work, we extend a recent network generation approach to capture the evolution of interactions between different communities. Our method labels nodes based on their community affiliation and constructs surrogate networks that reflect the interactions of the original temporal networks between nodes with different labels. This enables the generation of synthetic networks that replicate realistic behaviors. We validate our approach by comparing structural measures between the original and generated networks across multiple face-to-face interaction datasets.</p></details> |  |

FIA produces estimates of area averages and totals for plot-measured forest variables through design-based inference, assuming a fixed population and a probability sample of field plot locations. The fixed-population assumption and characteristics of the FIA sampling scheme make it difficult to estimate change in forest variables over time using design-based inference. We propose spatial-temporal models based on Gaussian processes as a flexible tool for forest inventory data, capable of inferring forest variables and change thereof over arbitrary spatial and temporal domains. It is shown to be beneficial for the covariance function governing the latent Gaussian process to account for variation at multiple scales, separating spatially local variation from ecosystem-scale variation. We demonstrate a model for forest biomass density, inferring 20 years of biomass change within two US National Forests.</p></details> |  |

Our analysis shows that conventional Integrated Gradients (IG) effectively capture critical points with both positive and negative impacts on predictions. However, current evaluation metrics fail to assess this capability, as they inadvertently cancel out opposing feature contributions. To address this limitation, we propose novel evaluation metrics-Cumulative Prediction Difference (CPD) and Cumulative Prediction Preservation (CPP)-to systematically assess whether attribution methods accurately identify significant positive and negative points in time series XAI. Under these metrics, conventional IG outperforms recent counterparts. However, directly applying IG to time series data may lead to suboptimal outcomes, as generated paths ignore temporal relationships and introduce out-of-distribution samples. To overcome these challenges, we introduce TIMING, which enhances IG by incorporating temporal awareness while maintaining its theoretical properties. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world time series benchmarks demonstrate that TIMING outperforms existing time series XAI baselines.

To this end, we introduce Proficiency-Aware Temporal Sampling (PATS), a novel sampling strategy that preserves complete fundamental movements within continuous temporal segments for multi-view skill assessment. PATS adaptively segments videos to ensure each analyzed portion contains full execution of critical performance components, repeating this process across multiple segments to maximize information coverage while maintaining temporal coherence. Evaluated on the EgoExo4D benchmark with SkillFormer, PATS surpasses the state-of-the-art accuracy across all viewing configurations (+0.65% to +3.05%) and delivers substantial gains in challenging domains (+26.22% bouldering, +2.39% music, +1.13% basketball). Systematic analysis reveals that PATS successfully adapts to diverse activity characteristics-from high-frequency sampling for dynamic sports to fine-grained segmentation for sequential skills-demonstrating its effectiveness as an adaptive approach to temporal sampling that advances automated skill assessment for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

However, current approaches either address partial embryo evaluation lacking holistic quality assessment or target clinical outcomes inevitably confounded by extra-embryonic factors, both limiting clinical utility. To bridge this gap, we propose a new task called Video-Based Embryo Grading - the first paradigm that directly utilizes full-length time-lapse monitoring (TLM) videos to predict embryologists' overall quality assessments. To support this task, we curate a real-world clinical dataset comprising over 2,500 TLM videos, each annotated with a grading label indicating the overall quality of embryos. Grounded in clinical decision-making principles, we propose a Complementary Spatial-Temporal Pattern Mining (CoSTeM) framework that conceptually replicates embryologists' evaluation process. The CoSTeM comprises two branches: (1) a morphological branch using a Mixture of Cross-Attentive Experts layer and a Temporal Selection Block to select discriminative local structural features, and (2) a morphokinetic branch employing a Temporal Transformer to model global developmental trajectories, synergistically integrating static and dynamic determinants for grading embryos. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our design. This work provides a valuable methodological framework for AI-assisted embryo selection. The dataset and source code will be publicly available upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |

Recent video generation models, such as Sora and Vidu, further highlight the power of transformers in long-range feature extraction and holistic spatiotemporal modeling. However, directly applying these models to real-world video super-resolution (VSR) is challenging, as VSR demands pixel-level precision, which can be compromised by tokenization and sequential attention mechanisms. While recent transformer-based VSR models attempt to address these issues using smaller patches and local attention, they still face limitations such as restricted receptive fields and dependence on optical flow-based alignment, which can introduce inaccuracies in real-world settings. To overcome these issues, we propose Dual Axial Spatial$\times$Temporal Transformer for Real-World Video Super-Resolution (DualX-VSR), which introduces a novel dual axial spatial$\times$temporal attention mechanism that integrates spatial and temporal information along orthogonal directions. DualX-VSR eliminates the need for motion compensation, offering a simplified structure that provides a cohesive representation of spatiotemporal information. As a result, DualX-VSR achieves high fidelity and superior performance in real-world VSR task.</p></details> | 15 pages, 9 figures |

Using temporal passing networks to model team behavior, the focus is on the dynamics of the temporal patterns of interaction between players. Several metrics grounded in social network analysis are calculated at different level to assess the dynamics of the patterns used by teams and of the individual roles within those patterns. The results reveal a 3-phase dynamic, differentiated by more or less complex and diversified patterns, and by more or less specialized or flexible roles. Additionally, time-dependent features of the different tactical playing positions are identified, some of which linked to team performance. The findings are intended to explain how basketball teams adapt their organization to cope with time pressure, offering potential insights for other type of teams facing similar constraints. Moreover, this work provides a useful framework for a multilevel understanding of how constraints shape team adaptations dynamically, making it applicable to a wide range of team settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Information Freshness for Remote Source Monitoring in IoT Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04804v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread adoption of age of information (AoI) as a meaningful and analytically tractable information freshness metric has led to a wide body of work on the timing performance of Internet of things (IoT) systems. However, the spatial correlation inherent to environmental monitoring has been mostly neglected in the recent literature, due to the significant modeling complexity it introduces. In this work, we address this gap by presenting a model of spatio-temporal information freshness, considering the conditional entropy of the system state in a remote monitoring scenario, such as a low-orbit satellite collecting information from a wide geographical area. Our analytical results show that purely age-oriented schemes tend to select an overly broad communication range, leading to inaccurate estimates and energy inefficiency, both of which can be mitigated by adopting a spatio-temporal approach.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes a novel method for inducing lexicons of in-group language, which incorporates its socio-temporal context. Existing methods for lexicon induction do not capture the evolving nature of in-group language, nor the social structure of the community. Using dynamic word and user embeddings trained on conversations from online anti-women communities, our approach outperforms prior methods for lexicon induction. We develop a test set for the task of lexicon induction and a new lexicon of manosphere language, validated by human experts, which quantifies the relevance of each term to a specific sub-community at a given point in time. Finally, we present novel insights on in-group language which illustrate the utility of this approach.</p></details> | Accepted to ACL 2025 |

However, as task complexity increases, LTL formulas become lengthy, making them difficult to interpret and generate, and straining the computational capacities of planners. To address this, we introduce a hierarchical structure for a widely used specification type -- LTL on finite traces (LTL$_f$). The resulting language, termed H-LTL$_f$, is defined with both its syntax and semantics. We further prove that H-LTL$_f$ is more expressive than its standard "flat" counterparts. Moreover, we conducted a user study that compared the standard LTL$_f$ with our hierarchical version and found that users could more easily comprehend complex tasks using the hierarchical structure. We develop a search-based approach to synthesize plans for multi-robot systems, achieving simultaneous task allocation and planning. This method approximates the search space by loosely interconnected sub-spaces, each corresponding to an LTL$_f$ specification. The search primarily focuses on a single sub-space, transitioning to another under conditions determined by the decomposition of automata. We develop multiple heuristics to significantly expedite the search. Our theoretical analysis, conducted under mild assumptions, addresses completeness and optimality. Compared to existing methods used in various simulators for service tasks, our approach improves planning times while maintaining comparable solution quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 11 figures.

Existing supervised or weakly supervised methods heavily rely on labeled temporal boundaries and action categories, which are labor-intensive and time-consuming. Consequently, unsupervised temporal action localization (UTAL) has gained popularity. However, current methods face two main challenges: 1) Classification pre-trained features overly focus on highly discriminative regions; 2) Solely relying on visual modality information makes it difficult to determine contextual boundaries. To address these issues, we propose a CLIP-assisted cross-view audiovisual enhanced UTAL method. Specifically, we introduce visual language pre-training (VLP) and classification pre-training-based collaborative enhancement to avoid excessive focus on highly discriminative regions; we also incorporate audio perception to provide richer contextual boundary information. Finally, we introduce a self-supervised cross-view learning paradigm to achieve multi-view perceptual enhancement without additional annotations. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate our model's superiority over several state-of-the-art competitors.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present a novel carbon-aware temporal data transfer scheduling framework, called LinTS, which promises to significantly reduce the carbon emission of data transfers between cloud data centers. LinTS produces a competitive transfer schedule and makes scaling decisions, outperforming common heuristic algorithms. LinTS can lower carbon emissions during inter-datacenter transfers by up to 66% compared to the worst case and up to 15% compared to other solutions while preserving all deadline constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Generative Adaptive Replay Continual Learning Model for Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04083v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent Continual Learning (CL)-based Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning (TKGR) methods focus on significantly reducing computational cost and mitigating catastrophic forgetting caused by fine-tuning models with new data. However, existing CL-based TKGR methods still face two key limitations: (1) They usually one-sidedly reorganize individual historical facts, while overlooking the historical context essential for accurately understanding the historical semantics of these facts; (2) They preserve historical knowledge by simply replaying historical facts, while ignoring the potential conflicts between historical and emerging facts. In this paper, we propose a Deep Generative Adaptive Replay (DGAR) method, which can generate and adaptively replay historical entity distribution representations from the whole historical context. To address the first challenge, historical context prompts as sampling units are built to preserve the whole historical context information. To overcome the second challenge, a pre-trained diffusion model is adopted to generate the historical distribution. During the generation process, the common features between the historical and current distributions are enhanced under the guidance of the TKGR model. In addition, a layer-by-layer adaptive replay mechanism is designed to effectively integrate historical and current distributions. Experimental results demonstrate that DGAR significantly outperforms baselines in reasoning and mitigating forgetting.</p></details> |  |

However, existing datasets lack expert language evaluation, leaving a gap in understanding how LLMs manage event ordering in legal contexts. We introduce LexTime, the first dataset designed to evaluate LLMs' event ordering capabilities in legal language, consisting of 512 instances from U.S. Federal Complaints with annotated event pairs and their temporal relations. Our findings show that (1) LLMs are more accurate on legal event ordering than on narrative (up to +10.5%); (2) longer input contexts and implicit events boost accuracy, reaching 80.8% for implicit-explicit event pairs; (3) legal linguistic complexities and nested clauses remain a challenge. We investigate how context length, explicit vs implicit event pairs, and legal language features affect model performance, demonstrating the need for specific modeling strategies to enhance temporal event reasoning.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Expand and Compress: Exploring Tuning Principles for Continual Spatio-Temporal Graph Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12593v2)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread deployment of sensing devices leads to a surge in data for spatio-temporal forecasting applications such as traffic flow, air quality, and wind energy. Although spatio-temporal graph neural networks have achieved success in modeling various static spatio-temporal forecasting scenarios, real-world spatio-temporal data are typically received in a streaming manner, and the network continuously expands with the installation of new sensors. Thus, spatio-temporal forecasting in streaming scenarios faces dual challenges: the inefficiency of retraining models over newly arrived data and the detrimental effects of catastrophic forgetting over long-term history. To address these challenges, we propose a novel prompt tuning-based continuous forecasting method, following two fundamental tuning principles guided by empirical and theoretical analysis: expand and compress, which effectively resolve the aforementioned problems with lightweight tuning parameters. Specifically, we integrate the base spatio-temporal graph neural network with a continuous prompt pool, utilizing stored prompts (i.e., few learnable parameters) in memory, and jointly optimize them with the base spatio-temporal graph neural network. This method ensures that the model sequentially learns from the spatio-temporal data stream to accomplish tasks for corresponding periods. Extensive experimental results on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the multi-faceted superiority of our method over the state-of-the-art baselines, including effectiveness, efficiency, universality, etc.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Towards Foundation Model on Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06367v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) store temporal facts with quadruple formats (s, p, o, t). Existing Temporal Knowledge Graph Embedding (TKGE) models perform link prediction tasks in transductive or semi-inductive settings, which means the entities, relations, and temporal information in the test graph are fully or partially observed during training. Such reliance on seen elements during inference limits the models' ability to transfer to new domains and generalize to real-world scenarios. A central limitation is the difficulty in learning representations for entities, relations, and timestamps that are transferable and not tied to dataset-specific vocabularies. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the first fully-inductive approach to temporal knowledge graph link prediction. Our model employs sinusoidal positional encodings to capture fine-grained temporal patterns and generates adaptive entity and relation representations using message passing conditioned on both local and global temporal contexts. Our model design is agnostic to temporal granularity and time span, effectively addressing temporal discrepancies across TKGs and facilitating time-aware structural information transfer. As a pretrained, scalable, and transferable model, POSTRA demonstrates strong zero-shot performance on unseen temporal knowledge graphs, effectively generalizing to novel entities, relations, and timestamps. Extensive theoretical analysis and empirical results show that a single pretrained model can improve zero-shot performance on various inductive temporal reasoning scenarios, marking a significant step toward a foundation model for temporal KGs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Easy attention: A simple attention mechanism for temporal predictions with transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12874v4)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To improve the robustness of transformer neural networks used for temporal-dynamics prediction of chaotic systems, we propose a novel attention mechanism called easy attention which we demonstrate in time-series reconstruction and prediction. While the standard self attention only makes use of the inner product of queries and keys, it is demonstrated that the keys, queries and softmax are not necessary for obtaining the attention score required to capture long-term dependencies in temporal sequences. Through the singular-value decomposition (SVD) on the softmax attention score, we further observe that self attention compresses the contributions from both queries and keys in the space spanned by the attention score. Therefore, our proposed easy-attention method directly treats the attention scores as learnable parameters. This approach produces excellent results when reconstructing and predicting the temporal dynamics of chaotic systems exhibiting more robustness and less complexity than self attention or the widely-used long short-term memory (LSTM) network. We show the improved performance of the easy-attention method in the Lorenz system, a turbulence shear flow and a model of a nuclear reactor.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages and 6 figures</p></details> |

To obtain training data, annotators are asked to provide preferences between two videos generated from independent noise. However, this approach prohibits fine-grained comparisons, and we point out that it biases the annotators towards low-motion clips as they often contain fewer visual artifacts. In this work, we introduce DenseDPO, a method that addresses these shortcomings by making three contributions. First, we create each video pair for DPO by denoising corrupted copies of a ground truth video. This results in aligned pairs with similar motion structures while differing in local details, effectively neutralizing the motion bias. Second, we leverage the resulting temporal alignment to label preferences on short segments rather than entire clips, yielding a denser and more precise learning signal. With only one-third of the labeled data, DenseDPO greatly improves motion generation over vanilla DPO, while matching it in text alignment, visual quality, and temporal consistency. Finally, we show that DenseDPO unlocks automatic preference annotation using off-the-shelf Vision Language Models (VLMs): GPT accurately predicts segment-level preferences similar to task-specifically fine-tuned video reward models, and DenseDPO trained on these labels achieves performance close to using human labels.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://snap-research.github.io/DenseDPO/</p></details> |

In this work, we take advantage of the complementarity between temporally dense feature differences of adjacent event frames and cost volume and present a lightweight event-based optical flow network (EDCFlow) to achieve high-quality flow estimation at a higher resolution. Specifically, an attention-based multi-scale temporal feature difference layer is developed to capture diverse motion patterns at high resolution in a computation-efficient manner. An adaptive fusion of high-resolution difference motion features and low-resolution correlation motion features is performed to enhance motion representation and model generalization. Notably, EDCFlow can serve as a plug-and-play refinement module for RAFT-like event-based methods to enhance flow details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EDCFlow achieves better performance with lower complexity compared to existing methods, offering superior generalization.</p></details> | 14 pages, 8 figures |

It is designed to identify and retrieve untrimmed videos that are partially relevant to the provided query. In this work, we investigate long-sequence video content understanding to address information redundancy issues. Leveraging the outstanding long-term state space modeling capability and linear scalability of the Mamba module, we introduce a multi-Mamba module with temporal fusion framework (MamFusion) tailored for PRVR task. This framework effectively captures the state-relatedness in long-term video content and seamlessly integrates it into text-video relevance understanding, thereby enhancing the retrieval process. Specifically, we introduce Temporal T-to-V Fusion and Temporal V-to-T Fusion to explicitly model temporal relationships between text queries and video moments, improving contextual awareness and retrieval accuracy. Extensive experiments conducted on large-scale datasets demonstrate that MamFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance in retrieval effectiveness.

The new estimate is $O(N^{-1/2})$, with a constant related to the probability of success of the bound, given by Hoeffding's inequality, similar to other methodologies, such as Philipp et al. Furthermore, we propose a \textit{lifting back} operator to obtain trajectories generated by embedding the initial state and iterating a linear system in a higher dimension. This naturally yields an $O(N^{-1/2})$ error bound for mean trajectories. Finally, we show numerical results including an example of nonlinear system, exhibiting successful approximation with exponential decay faster than $-1/2$, as suggested by the theoretical results.</p></details> | 24 pages, 6 figures |
| **[A composition of simplified physics-based model with neural operator for trajectory-level seismic response predictions of structural systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10569v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of nonlinear structural responses is essential for earthquake risk assessment and management. While high-fidelity nonlinear time history analysis provides the most comprehensive and accurate representation of the responses, it becomes computationally prohibitive for complex structural system models and repeated simulations under varying ground motions. To address this challenge, we propose a composite learning framework that integrates simplified physics-based models with a Fourier neural operator to enable efficient and accurate trajectory-level seismic response prediction. In the proposed architecture, a simplified physics-based model, obtained from techniques such as linearization, modal reduction, or solver relaxation, serves as a preprocessing operator to generate structural response trajectories that capture coarse dynamic characteristics. A neural operator is then trained to correct the discrepancy between these initial approximations and the true nonlinear responses, allowing the composite model to capture hysteretic and path-dependent behaviors. Additionally, a linear regression-based postprocessing scheme is introduced to further refine predictions and quantify associated uncertainty with negligible additional computational effort. The proposed approach is validated on three representative structural systems subjected to synthetic or recorded ground motions. Results show that the proposed approach consistently improves prediction accuracy over baseline models, particularly in data-scarce regimes. These findings demonstrate the potential of physics-guided operator learning for reliable and data-efficient modeling of nonlinear structural seismic responses.</p></details> |  |
| **[Policy-Based Trajectory Clustering in Offline Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09202v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel task of clustering trajectories from offline reinforcement learning (RL) datasets, where each cluster center represents the policy that generated its trajectories. By leveraging the connection between the KL-divergence of offline trajectory distributions and a mixture of policy-induced distributions, we formulate a natural clustering objective. To solve this, we propose Policy-Guided K-means (PG-Kmeans) and Centroid-Attracted Autoencoder (CAAE). PG-Kmeans iteratively trains behavior cloning (BC) policies and assigns trajectories based on policy generation probabilities, while CAAE resembles the VQ-VAE framework by guiding the latent representations of trajectories toward the vicinity of specific codebook entries to achieve clustering. Theoretically, we prove the finite-step convergence of PG-Kmeans and identify a key challenge in offline trajectory clustering: the inherent ambiguity of optimal solutions due to policy-induced conflicts, which can result in multiple equally valid but structurally distinct clusterings. Experimentally, we validate our methods on the widely used D4RL dataset and custom GridWorld environments. Our results show that both PG-Kmeans and CAAE effectively partition trajectories into meaningful clusters. They offer a promising framework for policy-based trajectory clustering, with broad applications in offline RL and beyond.</p></details> |  |

Unlike conventional approaches that predict next step action(s) forward, CoA generates an entire trajectory by explicit backward reasoning with task-specific goals through an action-level Chain-of-Thought (CoT) process. This process is unified within a single autoregressive structure: (1) the first token corresponds to a stable keyframe action that encodes the task-specific goals; and (2) subsequent action tokens are generated autoregressively, conditioned on the initial keyframe and previously predicted actions. This backward action reasoning enforces a global-to-local structure, allowing each local action to be tightly constrained by the final goal. To further realize the action reasoning structure, CoA incorporates four complementary designs: continuous action token representation; dynamic stopping for variable-length trajectory generation; reverse temporal ensemble; and multi-token prediction to balance action chunk modeling with global structure. As a result, CoA gives strong spatial generalization capabilities while preserving the flexibility and simplicity of a visuo-motor policy. Empirically, we observe CoA achieves the state-of-the-art performance across 60 RLBench tasks and 8 real-world manipulation tasks.</p></details> |  |

Accurate forecasting requires models to consider various factors, including social interactions, multi-modal predictions, pedestrian intention and environmental context. While existing methods account for these factors, they often overlook the impact of the environment, which leads to collisions with obstacles. This paper introduces ECAM (Environmental Collision Avoidance Module), a contrastive learning-based module to enhance collision avoidance ability with the environment. The proposed module can be integrated into existing trajectory forecasting models, improving their ability to generate collision-free predictions. We evaluate our method on the ETH/UCY dataset and quantitatively and qualitatively demonstrate its collision avoidance capabilities. Our experiments show that state-of-the-art methods significantly reduce (-40/50%) the collision rate when integrated with the proposed module.

To this end, an accurate prediction of dynamic obstacle trajectories is vital. Traditional approaches to trajectory prediction face limitations in generalizability and often fail to account for the intentions of other vessels. While recent research has considered incorporating the intentions of dynamic obstacles, these efforts are typically based on the own-ship's interpretation of the situation. The current state-of-the-art in this area is a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) model, which infers target vessel intentions by considering multiple underlying causes and allowing for different interpretations of the situation by different vessels. However, since its inception, there have not been any significant structural improvements to this model. In this paper, we propose enhancing the DBN model by incorporating considerations for grounding hazards and vessel waypoint information. The proposed model is validated using real vessel encounters extracted from historical Automatic Identification System (AIS) data.</p></details> | <details><summary>IMPOR...</summary><p>IMPORTANT: This preprint is not the final version.

| **[TGRPO :Fine-tuning Vision-Language-Action Model via Trajectory-wise Group Relative Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08440v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model have demonstrated strong generalization capabilities across diverse scenes, tasks, and robotic platforms when pretrained at large-scale datasets. However, these models still require task-specific fine-tuning in novel environments, a process that relies almost exclusively on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using static trajectory datasets. Such approaches neither allow robot to interact with environment nor do they leverage feedback from live execution. Also, their success is critically dependent on the size and quality of the collected trajectories. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising alternative by enabling closed-loop interaction and aligning learned policies directly with task objectives. In this work, we draw inspiration from the ideas of GRPO and propose the Trajectory-wise Group Relative Policy Optimization (TGRPO) method. By fusing step-level and trajectory-level advantage signals, this method improves GRPO's group-level advantage estimation, thereby making the algorithm more suitable for online reinforcement learning training of VLA. Experimental results on ten manipulation tasks from the libero-object benchmark demonstrate that TGRPO consistently outperforms various baseline methods, capable of generating more robust and efficient policies across multiple tested scenarios.

| **[What is the Cost of Differential Privacy for Deep Learning-Based Trajectory Generation?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09312v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While location trajectories offer valuable insights, they also reveal sensitive personal information. Differential Privacy (DP) offers formal protection, but achieving a favourable utility-privacy trade-off remains challenging. Recent works explore deep learning-based generative models to produce synthetic trajectories. However, current models lack formal privacy guarantees and rely on conditional information derived from real data during generation. This work investigates the utility cost of enforcing DP in such models, addressing three research questions across two datasets and eleven utility metrics. (1) We evaluate how DP-SGD, the standard DP training method for deep learning, affects the utility of state-of-the-art generative models. (2) Since DP-SGD is limited to unconditional models, we propose a novel DP mechanism for conditional generation that provides formal guarantees and assess its impact on utility. (3) We analyse how model types - Diffusion, VAE, and GAN - affect the utility-privacy trade-off. Our results show that DP-SGD significantly impacts performance, although some utility remains if the datasets is sufficiently large. The proposed DP mechanism improves training stability, particularly when combined with DP-SGD, for unstable models such as GANs and on smaller datasets. Diffusion models yield the best utility without guarantees, but with DP-SGD, GANs perform best, indicating that the best non-private model is not necessarily optimal when targeting formal guarantees. In conclusion, DP trajectory generation remains a challenging task, and formal guarantees are currently only feasible with large datasets and in constrained use cases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating Generative Vehicle Trajectory Models for Traffic Intersection Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08963v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic Intersections are vital to urban road networks as they regulate the movement of people and goods. However, they are regions of conflicting trajectories and are prone to accidents. Deep Generative models of traffic dynamics at signalized intersections can greatly help traffic authorities better understand the efficiency and safety aspects. At present, models are evaluated on computational metrics that primarily look at trajectory reconstruction errors. They are not evaluated online in a `live' microsimulation scenario. Further, these metrics do not adequately consider traffic engineering-specific concerns such as red-light violations, unallowed stoppage, etc. In this work, we provide a comprehensive analytics tool to train, run, and evaluate models with metrics that give better insights into model performance from a traffic engineering point of view. We train a state-of-the-art multi-vehicle trajectory forecasting model on a large dataset collected by running a calibrated scenario of a real-world urban intersection. We then evaluate the performance of the prediction models, online in a microsimulator, under unseen traffic conditions. We show that despite using ideally-behaved trajectories as input, and achieving low trajectory reconstruction errors, the generated trajectories show behaviors that break traffic rules. We introduce new metrics to evaluate such undesired behaviors and present our results.</p></details> |  |
| **[IntTrajSim: Trajectory Prediction for Simulating Multi-Vehicle driving at Signalized Intersections](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08957v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic simulators are widely used to study the operational efficiency of road infrastructure, but their rule-based approach limits their ability to mimic real-world driving behavior. Traffic intersections are critical components of the road infrastructure, both in terms of safety risk (nearly 28% of fatal crashes and 58% of nonfatal crashes happen at intersections) as well as the operational efficiency of a road corridor. This raises an important question: can we create a data-driven simulator that can mimic the macro- and micro-statistics of the driving behavior at a traffic intersection? Deep Generative Modeling-based trajectory prediction models provide a good starting point to model the complex dynamics of vehicles at an intersection. But they are not tested in a "live" micro-simulation scenario and are not evaluated on traffic engineering-related metrics. In this study, we propose traffic engineering-related metrics to evaluate generative trajectory prediction models and provide a simulation-in-the-loop pipeline to do so. We also provide a multi-headed self-attention-based trajectory prediction model that incorporates the signal information, which outperforms our previous models on the evaluation metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Intra-Trajectory Consistency for Reward Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09096v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reward models are critical for improving large language models (LLMs), particularly in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) or inference-time verification. Current reward modeling typically relies on scores of overall responses to learn the outcome rewards for the responses. However, since the response-level scores are coarse-grained supervision signals, the reward model struggles to identify the specific components within a response trajectory that truly correlate with the scores, leading to poor generalization on unseen responses. In this paper, we propose to leverage generation probabilities to establish reward consistency between processes in the response trajectory, which allows the response-level supervisory signal to propagate across processes, thereby providing additional fine-grained signals for reward learning. Building on analysis under the Bayesian framework, we develop an intra-trajectory consistency regularization to enforce that adjacent processes with higher next-token generation probability maintain more consistent rewards. We apply the proposed regularization to the advanced outcome reward model, improving its performance on RewardBench. Besides, we show that the reward model trained with the proposed regularization induces better DPO-aligned policies and achieves better best-of-N (BON) inference-time verification results.

| **[TraGraph-GS: Trajectory Graph-based Gaussian Splatting for Arbitrary Large-Scale Scene Rendering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08704v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-quality novel view synthesis for large-scale scenes presents a challenging dilemma in 3D computer vision. Existing methods typically partition large scenes into multiple regions, reconstruct a 3D representation using Gaussian splatting for each region, and eventually merge them for novel view rendering. They can accurately render specific scenes, yet they do not generalize effectively for two reasons: (1) rigid spatial partition techniques struggle with arbitrary camera trajectories, and (2) the merging of regions results in Gaussian overlap to distort texture details. To address these challenges, we propose TraGraph-GS, leveraging a trajectory graph to enable high-precision rendering for arbitrarily large-scale scenes. We present a spatial partitioning method for large-scale scenes based on graphs, which incorporates a regularization constraint to enhance the rendering of textures and distant objects, as well as a progressive rendering strategy to mitigate artifacts caused by Gaussian overlap. Experimental results demonstrate its superior performance both on four aerial and four ground datasets and highlight its remarkable efficiency: our method achieves an average improvement of 1.86 dB in PSNR on aerial datasets and 1.62 dB on ground datasets compared to state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches struggle as they rely on static augmentations that fail under object deformations, occlusions, and camera movement, leading to inconsistent feature learning over time. We propose a motion-guided self-supervised learning framework that clusters dense point tracks to learn spatiotemporally consistent representations. By leveraging an off-the-shelf point tracker, we extract long-range motion trajectories and optimize feature clustering through a momentum-encoder-based optimal transport mechanism. To ensure temporal coherence, we propagate cluster assignments along tracked points, enforcing feature consistency across views despite viewpoint changes. Integrating motion as an implicit supervisory signal, our method learns representations that generalize across frames, improving robustness in dynamic scenes and challenging occlusion scenarios. By initializing from strong image-pretrained models and leveraging video data for training, we improve state-of-the-art by 1% to 6% on six image and video datasets and four evaluation benchmarks. The implementation is publicly available at our GitHub repository: https://github.com/SMSD75/MoSiC/tree/main</p></details> | preprint |
| **[FlickerFusion: Intra-trajectory Domain Generalizing Multi-Agent RL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15876v4)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent reinforcement learning has demonstrated significant potential in addressing complex cooperative tasks across various real-world applications. However, existing MARL approaches often rely on the restrictive assumption that the number of entities (e.g., agents, obstacles) remains constant between training and inference. This overlooks scenarios where entities are dynamically removed or added during the inference trajectory -- a common occurrence in real-world environments like search and rescue missions and dynamic combat situations. In this paper, we tackle the challenge of intra-trajectory dynamic entity composition under zero-shot out-of-domain (OOD) generalization, where such dynamic changes cannot be anticipated beforehand. Our empirical studies reveal that existing MARL methods suffer significant performance degradation and increased uncertainty in these scenarios. In response, we propose FlickerFusion, a novel OOD generalization method that acts as a universally applicable augmentation technique for MARL backbone methods. FlickerFusion stochastically drops out parts of the observation space, emulating being in-domain when inferenced OOD. The results show that FlickerFusion not only achieves superior inference rewards but also uniquely reduces uncertainty vis-\`a-vis the backbone, compared to existing methods. Benchmarks, implementations, and model weights are organized and open-sourced at flickerfusion305.github.io, accompanied by ample demo video renderings.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

This growing deployment presents new challenges for UAV trajectory planning in complex urban environments. However, existing studies often overlook key factors, such as urban airspace constraints and economic efficiency, which are essential in low-altitude economy contexts. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is regarded as a promising solution to these issues, while its practical adoption remains limited by low learning efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel UAV trajectory planning framework that combines DRL with large language model (LLM) reasoning to enable safe, compliant, and economically viable path planning. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines across multiple metrics, including data collection rate, collision avoidance, successful landing, regulatory compliance, and energy efficiency. These results validate the effectiveness of our approach in addressing UAV trajectory planning key challenges under constraints of the low-altitude economy networking.</p></details> |  |
| **[ATI: Any Trajectory Instruction for Controllable Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22944v3)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a unified framework for motion control in video generation that seamlessly integrates camera movement, object-level translation, and fine-grained local motion using trajectory-based inputs. In contrast to prior methods that address these motion types through separate modules or task-specific designs, our approach offers a cohesive solution by projecting user-defined trajectories into the latent space of pre-trained image-to-video generation models via a lightweight motion injector. Users can specify keypoints and their motion paths to control localized deformations, entire object motion, virtual camera dynamics, or combinations of these. The injected trajectory signals guide the generative process to produce temporally consistent and semantically aligned motion sequences. Our framework demonstrates superior performance across multiple video motion control tasks, including stylized motion effects (e.g., motion brushes), dynamic viewpoint changes, and precise local motion manipulation. Experiments show that our method provides significantly better controllability and visual quality compared to prior approaches and commercial solutions, while remaining broadly compatible with various state-of-the-art video generation backbones.

| **[Egocentric Event-Based Vision for Ping Pong Ball Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07860v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present a real-time egocentric trajectory prediction system for table tennis using event cameras. Unlike standard cameras, which suffer from high latency and motion blur at fast ball speeds, event cameras provide higher temporal resolution, allowing more frequent state updates, greater robustness to outliers, and accurate trajectory predictions using just a short time window after the opponent's impact. We collect a dataset of ping-pong game sequences, including 3D ground-truth trajectories of the ball, synchronized with sensor data from the Meta Project Aria glasses and event streams. Our system leverages foveated vision, using eye-gaze data from the glasses to process only events in the viewer's fovea. This biologically inspired approach improves ball detection performance and significantly reduces computational latency, as it efficiently allocates resources to the most perceptually relevant regions, achieving a reduction factor of 10.81 on the collected trajectories. Our detection pipeline has a worst-case total latency of 4.5 ms, including computation and perception - significantly lower than a frame-based 30 FPS system, which, in the worst case, takes 66 ms solely for perception. Finally, we fit a trajectory prediction model to the estimated states of the ball, enabling 3D trajectory forecasting in the future. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to predict table tennis trajectories from an egocentric perspective using event cameras.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE/...</summary><p>IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (CVPRW), Nashville (TN), USA, 2025; 5th International Workshop on Event-Based Vision</p></details> |

In this paper, we reformulate the trajectory optimization of this kind of method, focusing on enhancing both reconstruction quality and efficiency. Initially, we navigate effective restoration paths through a reinforcement learning process, gradually steering potential trajectories toward the most precise options. Additionally, to mitigate the considerable computational burden associated with iterative sampling, we propose cost-aware trajectory distillation to streamline complex paths into several manageable steps with adaptable sizes. Moreover, we fine-tune a foundational diffusion model (FLUX) with 12B parameters by using our algorithms, producing a unified framework for handling 7 kinds of image restoration tasks. Extensive experiments showcase the $\textit{significant}$ superiority of the proposed method, achieving a maximum PSNR improvement of 2.1 dB over state-of-the-art methods, while also greatly enhancing visual perceptual quality.

Additionally, we propose TrajWorld, a novel architecture capable of flexibly handling varying sensor and actuator information and capturing environment dynamics in-context. Pre-training TrajWorld on UniTraj yields substantial gains in transition prediction, achieves a new state-of-the-art for off-policy evaluation, and also delivers superior online performance of model predictive control.

| **[Aircraft Trajectory Dataset Augmentation in Latent Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07585v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aircraft trajectory modeling plays a crucial role in Air Traffic Management (ATM) and is important for various downstream tasks, including conflict detection and landing time prediction. Dataset augmentation through the addition of synthetically generated trajectory data is necessary to develop a more robust aircraft trajectory model and ensure that the trajectory dataset is sufficient and balanced. In this work, we propose a novel framework called ATRADA for aircraft trajectory dataset augmentation. In the proposed framework, a Transformer encoder learns the underlying patterns in the original trajectory dataset and converts each data point into a context vector in the learned latent space. The converted dataset in the latent space is projected into reduced dimensions using principal component analysis (PCA), and a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is applied to fit the probability distribution of the data points in the reduced-dimensional space. Finally, new samples are drawn from the fitted GMM, the dimension of the samples is reverted to the original dimension, and they are decoded with a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). Several experiments demonstrate that the framework effectively generates new, high-quality synthetic aircraft trajectory data, which were compared to the results of several baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Physics-informed Diffusion for Anomaly Detection in Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06999v1)** | 2025-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given trajectory data, a domain-specific study area, and a user-defined threshold, we aim to find anomalous trajectories indicative of possible GPS spoofing (e.g., fake trajectory). The problem is societally important to curb illegal activities in international waters, such as unauthorized fishing and illicit oil transfers. The problem is challenging due to advances in AI generated in deep fakes generation (e.g., additive noise, fake trajectories) and lack of adequate amount of labeled samples for ground-truth verification. Recent literature shows promising results for anomalous trajectory detection using generative models despite data sparsity. However, they do not consider fine-scale spatiotemporal dependencies and prior physical knowledge, resulting in higher false-positive rates. To address these limitations, we propose a physics-informed diffusion model that integrates kinematic constraints to identify trajectories that do not adhere to physical laws. Experimental results on real-world datasets in the maritime and urban domains show that the proposed framework results in higher prediction accuracy and lower estimation error rate for anomaly detection and trajectory generation methods, respectively.

Inspired by the success of decoder-only models for language modeling, we propose DONUT, a Decoder-Only Network for Unrolling Trajectories. Different from existing encoder-decoder forecasting models, we encode historical trajectories and predict future trajectories with a single autoregressive model. This allows the model to make iterative predictions in a consistent manner, and ensures that the model is always provided with up-to-date information, enhancing the performance. Furthermore, inspired by multi-token prediction for language modeling, we introduce an 'overprediction' strategy that gives the network the auxiliary task of predicting trajectories at longer temporal horizons. This allows the model to better anticipate the future, and further improves the performance. With experiments, we demonstrate that our decoder-only approach outperforms the encoder-decoder baseline, and achieves new state-of-the-art results on the Argoverse 2 single-agent motion forecasting benchmark.</p></details> |  |

Our framework features a unified trajectory representation that encapsulates the kinematic models of both $SO(3)\times\mathbb{R}^3$ and $SE(3)$ pose representations. This encapsulation strategy allows users to use the same implementation of measurement-based factors for either choice of pose representation, which facilitates experimentation and comparison to achieve the best model for the ME task. In addition, unique to our framework, we derive the kinematic models with the closed-form temporal derivatives of the local variable of $SO(3)$ and $SE(3)$, which so far has only been approximated based on the Taylor expansion in the literature. Our experiments show that these kinematic models can improve the estimation accuracy in high-speed scenarios. All analytical Jacobians of the interpolated states with respect to the support states of the trajectory representation, as well as the motion prior factors, are also provided for accelerated Gauss-Newton (GN) optimization. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of the framework in various motion estimation tasks such as localization, calibration, and odometry, facilitating fast prototyping for ME researchers.

We call this the \textit{continuous inverse problem} and start by rigorously defining its solution. We then develop a framework where the solution can be constructed as a limit of solutions to appropriately designed \textit{discrete inverse problems}, so that convergence holds in $p$-variation. Our approach is based on calibrating the bounded variation paths whose limit defines the rough path `lift' of path $X$ to rough path ${\bf X}$ to the observed trajectory $y$. Moreover, we develop a general numerical algorithm for constructing the solution to the discrete inverse problem. The core idea of the algorithm is to use the signature representation of the path, iterating between the response and the control, each time correcting according to the required properties. We apply our framework to the case where the geometric $p$-rough path ${\bf X}$ is defined as the limit of piecewise linear paths in the $p$-variation topology. We express the discrete inverse problem for a fixed observation rate as a solution to a system of equations driven by piecewise linear paths and prove convergence to the solution of the continuous inverse problem for observation time $\delta\to 0$. Finally, we show that, in this context, the numerical algorithm for solving the discrete inverse problem simplifies to an iterative simultaneous update of the local gradients and we prove that it converges in $p$-variation uniformly with respect to $\delta$.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended updated version - 41 pages, 10 figures</p></details> |

A key component is a robust trajectory scorer capable of selecting the optimal trajectory from these candidates. While recent trajectory scorers focus on scoring either large sets of static trajectories or small sets of dynamically generated ones, both approaches face significant limitations in generalization. Static vocabularies provide effective coarse discretization but struggle to make fine-grained adaptation, while dynamic proposals offer detailed precision but fail to capture broader trajectory distributions. To overcome these challenges, we propose GTRS (Generalized Trajectory Scoring), a unified framework for end-to-end multi-modal planning that combines coarse and fine-grained trajectory evaluation. GTRS consists of three complementary innovations: (1) a diffusion-based trajectory generator that produces diverse fine-grained proposals; (2) a vocabulary generalization technique that trains a scorer on super-dense trajectory sets with dropout regularization, enabling its robust inference on smaller subsets; and (3) a sensor augmentation strategy that enhances out-of-domain generalization while incorporating refinement training for critical trajectory discrimination. As the winning solution of the Navsim v2 Challenge, GTRS demonstrates superior performance even with sub-optimal sensor inputs, approaching privileged methods that rely on ground-truth perception.

Relying on a single predicted path, as in regression-based approaches, usually does not explicitly assess the safety of the predicted trajectory. Selection-based methods address this by generating and scoring multiple trajectory candidates and predicting the safety score for each, but face optimization challenges in precisely selecting the best option from thousands of possibilities and distinguishing subtle but safety-critical differences, especially in rare or underrepresented scenarios. We propose DriveSuprim to overcome these challenges and advance the selection-based paradigm through a coarse-to-fine paradigm for progressive candidate filtering, a rotation-based augmentation method to improve robustness in out-of-distribution scenarios, and a self-distillation framework to stabilize training. DriveSuprim achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching 93.5% PDMS in NAVSIM v1 and 87.1% EPDMS in NAVSIM v2 without extra data, demonstrating superior safetycritical capabilities, including collision avoidance and compliance with rules, while maintaining high trajectory quality in various driving scenarios.</p></details> | 15 pages, 6 figures |

Although some trajectory prediction methods have been developed to provide empirical robustness, these methods are heuristic and do not offer guaranteed robustness. In this work, we propose a certification approach tailored for trajectory prediction that provides guaranteed robustness. To this end, we address the unique challenges associated with trajectory prediction, such as unbounded outputs and multi-modality. To mitigate the inherent performance drop through certification, we propose a diffusion-based trajectory denoiser and integrate it into our method. Moreover, we introduce new certified performance metrics to reliably measure the trajectory prediction performance. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the certified predictors and highlight their advantages over the non-certified ones.

These methods learn the parameters of parametric policies via stochastic gradient ascent, typically using on-policy trajectory data to estimate the policy gradient. However, such reliance on fresh data makes them sample-inefficient. Indeed, vanilla PG methods require $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ trajectories to reach an $\epsilon$-approximate stationary point. A common strategy to improve efficiency is to reuse off-policy information from past iterations, such as previous gradients or trajectories. While gradient reuse has received substantial theoretical attention, leading to improved rates of $O(\epsilon^{-3/2})$, the reuse of past trajectories remains largely unexplored from a theoretical perspective. In this work, we provide the first rigorous theoretical evidence that extensive reuse of past off-policy trajectories can significantly accelerate convergence in PG methods. We introduce a power mean correction to the multiple importance weighting estimator and propose RPG (Retrospective Policy Gradient), a PG algorithm that combines old and new trajectories for policy updates. Through a novel analysis, we show that, under established assumptions, RPG achieves a sample complexity of $\widetilde{O}(\epsilon^{-1})$, the best known rate in the literature. We further validate empirically our approach against PG methods with state-of-the-art rates.</p></details> |  |

To provide an optimized solution, we propose a cooperative trajectory optimization and task allocation framework leveraging unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs). This study integrates a Genetic Algorithm (GA) for efficient task allocation among multiple UAVs and UGVs, and employs an informed-RRT* (Rapidly-exploring Random Tree Star) algorithm for collision-free trajectory generation. Further optimization of task sequencing and path efficiency is conducted using Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES). Simulation experiments conducted in a realistic post-disaster environment demonstrate that our proposed approach significantly improves the overall efficiency of medical rescue operations compared to traditional strategies, showing substantial reductions in total mission completion time and traveled distance. Additionally, the cooperative utilization of UAVs and UGVs effectively balances their complementary advantages, highlighting the system' s scalability and practicality for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |

To address this limitation, we propose the Multidimensional Adaptive Coefficient (MAC), a plug-in module for flow and diffusion models that extends conventional unidimensional coefficients to multidimensional ones and enables inference trajectory-wise adaptation. MAC is trained via simulation-based feedback through adversarial refinement. Empirical results across diverse frameworks and datasets demonstrate that MAC enhances generative quality with high training efficiency. Consequently, our work offers a new perspective on inference trajectory optimality, encouraging future research to move beyond vector field design and to leverage training-efficient, simulation-based optimization.</p></details> | ICML 2025 Paper |

Specifically, we consider a single UAV with 3 degree-of-freedom dynamics tasked with delivering blood packages to multiple hospitals, each with a predefined time window and priority. Mission objectives are encoded using Signal Temporal Logic (STL), enabling the formal specification of spatial-temporal constraints. To ensure safety, city buildings are modeled as 3D convex obstacles, and obstacle avoidance is handled through a Convex Feasible Set (CFS) method. The entire planning problem-combining UAV dynamics, STL satisfaction, and collision avoidance-is formulated as a convex optimization problem that ensures tractability and can be solved efficiently using standard convex programming techniques. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method generates dynamically feasible, collision-free trajectories that satisfy temporal mission goals, providing a scalable and reliable approach for autonomous UAV-based medical logistics.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |

In this study, we propose an enhanced trust region sequential convex optimization (TR-SCO) algorithm for optimal trajectory planning of multiple drones performing thermal screening tasks. Our improved algorithm integrates a refined convex optimization formulation within a trust region framework, effectively balancing trajectory smoothness, obstacle avoidance, altitude constraints, and maximum screening coverage. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves trajectory optimality and computational efficiency compared to conventional convex optimization methods. This research provides critical insights and practical contributions toward deploying efficient multi-drone systems for real-time thermal screening in urban areas. For reader who are interested in our research, we release our source code at https://github.com/Cherry0302/Enhanced-TR-SCO.</p></details> |  |
| **[State-Covering Trajectory Stitching for Diffusion Planners](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00895v2)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based generative models are emerging as powerful tools for long-horizon planning in reinforcement learning (RL), particularly with offline datasets. However, their performance is fundamentally limited by the quality and diversity of training data. This often restricts their generalization to tasks outside their training distribution or longer planning horizons. To overcome this challenge, we propose State-Covering Trajectory Stitching (SCoTS), a novel reward-free trajectory augmentation method that incrementally stitches together short trajectory segments, systematically generating diverse and extended trajectories. SCoTS first learns a temporal distance-preserving latent representation that captures the underlying temporal structure of the environment, then iteratively stitches trajectory segments guided by directional exploration and novelty to effectively cover and expand this latent space. We demonstrate that SCoTS significantly improves the performance and generalization capabilities of diffusion planners on offline goal-conditioned benchmarks requiring stitching and long-horizon reasoning. Furthermore, augmented trajectories generated by SCoTS significantly improve the performance of widely used offline goal-conditioned RL algorithms across diverse environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Entropy: Modeling Game State Stability from Multimodality Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05810v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Complex interactions among agents present a significant challenge for autonomous driving in real-world scenarios. Recently, a promising approach has emerged, which formulates the interactions of agents as a level-k game framework. It effectively decouples agent policies by hierarchical game levels. However, this framework ignores both the varying driving complexities among agents and the dynamic changes in agent states across game levels, instead treating them uniformly. Consequently, redundant and error-prone computations are introduced into this framework. To tackle the issue, this paper proposes a metric, termed as Trajectory Entropy, to reveal the game status of agents within the level-k game framework. The key insight stems from recognizing the inherit relationship between agent policy uncertainty and the associated driving complexity. Specifically, Trajectory Entropy extracts statistical signals representing uncertainty from the multimodality trajectory prediction results of agents in the game. Then, the signal-to-noise ratio of this signal is utilized to quantify the game status of agents. Based on the proposed Trajectory Entropy, we refine the current level-k game framework through a simple gating mechanism, significantly improving overall accuracy while reducing computational costs. Our method is evaluated on the Waymo and nuPlan datasets, in terms of trajectory prediction, open-loop and closed-loop planning tasks. The results demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method, with precision improved by up to 19.89% for prediction and up to 16.48% for planning.</p></details> | 10 pages |

To overcome the ambiguity in 3D from 2D estimation, we design an LSTM-based pipeline that utilizes a novel canonical 3D representation that is independent of the camera's location to handle arbitrary views and a series of intermediate representations that encourage crucial invariance and reprojection consistency. We evaluated our method on four synthetic and three real datasets and conducted extensive ablation studies on our design choices. Despite training solely on simulated data, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance and can generalize to real-world scenarios with multiple trajectories, opening up a range of applications in sport analysis and virtual replay.

| **[BiTrajDiff: Bidirectional Trajectory Generation with Diffusion Models for Offline Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05762v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) have proven that effective policy learning can benefit from imposing conservative constraints on pre-collected datasets. However, such static datasets often exhibit distribution bias, resulting in limited generalizability. To address this limitation, a straightforward solution is data augmentation (DA), which leverages generative models to enrich data distribution. Despite the promising results, current DA techniques focus solely on reconstructing future trajectories from given states, while ignoring the exploration of history transitions that reach them. This single-direction paradigm inevitably hinders the discovery of diverse behavior patterns, especially those leading to critical states that may have yielded high-reward outcomes. In this work, we introduce Bidirectional Trajectory Diffusion (BiTrajDiff), a novel DA framework for offline RL that models both future and history trajectories from any intermediate states. Specifically, we decompose the trajectory generation task into two independent yet complementary diffusion processes: one generating forward trajectories to predict future dynamics, and the other generating backward trajectories to trace essential history transitions.BiTrajDiff can efficiently leverage critical states as anchors to expand into potentially valuable yet underexplored regions of the state space, thereby facilitating dataset diversity. Extensive experiments on the D4RL benchmark suite demonstrate that BiTrajDiff achieves superior performance compared to other advanced DA methods across various offline RL backbones.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we analyze the anonymized Yjmob100k dataset, which captures the trajectories of 100,000 users in Japan, and demonstrate how existing anonymization techniques fail to protect their sensitive attributes. We leverage population density patterns, structural correlations, and temporal activity profiles to re-identify the dataset's real-world location and timing. Our results reveal that the anonymization process carried out for Yjmob100k is inefficient and preserves enough spatial and temporal structure to enable re-identification. This work underscores the limitations of current trajectory anonymization methods and calls for more robust privacy mechanisms in the publication of mobility data.</p></details> |  |

It is expected to be the next-gen video technology and a prevalent use case for 5G and beyond wireless communication. Considering that each user typically only watches a section of the volumetric video, known as the viewport, it is essential to have precise viewport prediction for optimal performance. However, research on this topic is still in its infancy. In the end, this paper presents and proposes a novel approach, named Saliency and Trajectory Viewport Prediction (STVP), which aims to improve the precision of viewport prediction in volumetric video streaming. The STVP extensively utilizes video saliency information and viewport trajectory. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study of viewport prediction in volumetric video streaming. In particular, we introduce a novel sampling method, Uniform Random Sampling (URS), to reduce computational complexity while still preserving video features in an efficient manner. Then we present a saliency detection technique that incorporates both spatial and temporal information for detecting static, dynamic geometric, and color salient regions. Finally, we intelligently fuse saliency and trajectory information to achieve more accurate viewport prediction. We conduct extensive simulations to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed viewport prediction methods using state-of-the-art volumetric video sequences. The experimental results show the superiority of the proposed method over existing schemes. The dataset and source code will be publicly accessible after acceptance.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches often focus on narrow use cases with a limited feature space, overlooking the complex, longitudinal interactions needed for a holistic understanding of patient health. In this work, we propose a novel approach to patient pathway modeling by transforming diverse electronic health record (EHR) data into a structured representation and designing a holistic pathway prediction model, EHR2Path, optimized to predict future health trajectories. Further, we introduce a novel summary mechanism that embeds long-term temporal context into topic-specific summary tokens, improving performance over text-only models, while being much more token-efficient. EHR2Path demonstrates strong performance in both next time-step prediction and longitudinal simulation, outperforming competitive baselines. It enables detailed simulations of patient trajectories, inherently targeting diverse evaluation tasks, such as forecasting vital signs, lab test results, or length-of-stay, opening a path towards predictive and personalized healthcare.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present a novel model predictive control (MPC) method for MS-AGV trajectory tracking that takes tire wear minimization consideration in the objective function. To speed up the problem-solving process, we propose a hierarchical controller design and simplify the dynamic model by integrating the \textit{magic formula tire model} and \textit{simplified tire wear model}. In the experiment, the proposed method can be solved by simulated annealing in real-time on a normal personal computer and by incorporating tire wear into the objective function, tire wear is reduced by 19.19\% while maintaining the tracking accuracy in curve-tracking experiments. In the more challenging scene: the desired trajectory is offset by 60 degrees from the vehicle's heading, the reduction in tire wear increased to 65.20\% compared to the kinematic model without considering the tire wear optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in Journal of Automation and Intelligence</p></details> |

Predicting dissection trajectories in ESD videos offers significant potential for enhancing surgical skill training and simplifying the learning process, yet this area remains underexplored. While imitation learning has shown promise in acquiring skills from expert demonstrations, challenges persist in handling uncertain future movements, learning geometric symmetries, and generalizing to diverse surgical scenarios. To address these, we introduce a novel approach: Implicit Diffusion Policy with Equivariant Representations for Imitation Learning (iDPOE). Our method models expert behavior through a joint state action distribution, capturing the stochastic nature of dissection trajectories and enabling robust visual representation learning across various endoscopic views. By incorporating a diffusion model into policy learning, iDPOE ensures efficient training and sampling, leading to more accurate predictions and better generalization. Additionally, we enhance the model's ability to generalize to geometric symmetries by embedding equivariance into the learning process. To address state mismatches, we develop a forward-process guided action inference strategy for conditional sampling. Using an ESD video dataset of nearly 2000 clips, experimental results show that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods, both explicit and implicit, in trajectory prediction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of imitation learning to surgical skill development for dissection trajectory prediction.</p></details> |  |

The proposed approach incorporates a modular architecture that integrates state estimation, vehicle dynamics modeling, and optimization to ensure real-time performance. The state-space equations are formulated in a Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) form, and a curvature-based tuning method is introduced to optimize weight matrices for varying trajectories. The MPC framework is implemented using the Robot Operating System (ROS) for parallel execution of state estimation and control optimization, ensuring scalability and minimal latency. Extensive simulations and real-time experiments were conducted on multiple predefined trajectories, demonstrating high accuracy with minimal cross-track and orientation errors, even under aggressive maneuvers and high-speed conditions. The results highlight the robustness and adaptability of the proposed system, achieving seamless alignment between simulated and real-world performance. This work lays the foundation for dynamic weight tuning and integration into cooperative autonomous navigation systems, paving the way for enhanced safety and efficiency in autonomous driving applications.</p></details> |  |

Training models to generate such manipulation trajectories requires a large and diverse collection of detailed manipulation demonstrations for various objects, which is nearly unfeasible to gather at scale. In this paper, we propose a framework that leverages large-scale ego- and exo-centric video datasets -- constructed globally with substantial effort -- of Exo-Ego4D to extract diverse manipulation trajectories at scale. From these extracted trajectories with the associated textual action description, we develop trajectory generation models based on visual and point cloud-based language models. In the recently proposed egocentric vision-based in-a-quality trajectory dataset of HOT3D, we confirmed that our models successfully generate valid object trajectories, establishing a training dataset and baseline models for the novel task of generating 6DoF manipulation trajectories from action descriptions in egocentric vision.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |

| **[Urban Visibility Hotspots: Quantifying Building Vertex Visibility from Connected Vehicle Trajectories using Spatial Indexing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03365v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective placement of Out-of-Home advertising and street furniture requires accurate identification of locations offering maximum visual exposure to target audiences, particularly vehicular traffic. Traditional site selection methods often rely on static traffic counts or subjective assessments. This research introduces a data-driven methodology to objectively quantify location visibility by analyzing large-scale connected vehicle trajectory data (sourced from Compass IoT) within urban environments. We model the dynamic driver field-of-view using a forward-projected visibility area for each vehicle position derived from interpolated trajectories. By integrating this with building vertex locations extracted from OpenStreetMap, we quantify the cumulative visual exposure, or ``visibility count'', for thousands of potential points of interest near roadways. The analysis reveals that visibility is highly concentrated, identifying specific ``visual hotspots'' that receive disproportionately high exposure compared to average locations. The core technical contribution involves the construction of a BallTree spatial index over building vertices. This enables highly efficient (O(logN) complexity) radius queries to determine which vertices fall within the viewing circles of millions of trajectory points across numerous trips, significantly outperforming brute-force geometric checks. Analysis reveals two key findings: 1) Visibility is highly concentrated, identifying distinct 'visual hotspots' receiving disproportionately high exposure compared to average locations. 2) The aggregated visibility counts across vertices conform to a Log-Normal distribution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Trajectory Stitching with Flow Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07802v2)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models have shown great promise as trajectory planners, given their affinity to modeling complex distributions and guidable inference process. Previous works have successfully applied these in the context of robotic manipulation but perform poorly when the required solution does not exist as a complete trajectory within the training set. We identify that this is a result of being unable to plan via stitching, and subsequently address the architectural and dataset choices needed to remedy this. On top of this, we propose a novel addition to the training and inference procedures to both stabilize and enhance these capabilities. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by generating plans with out of distribution boundary conditions and performing obstacle avoidance on the Franka Panda in simulation and on real hardware. In both of these tasks our method performs significantly better than the baselines and is able to avoid obstacles up to four times as large.</p></details> |  |

Complex tasks can be accomplished through iterative clarifying questions and final responses generated by an LLM acting as a questioner (STaR-GATE; Andukuri et al., 2024}). However, existing approaches based on self-taught reasoning struggle to identify optimal dialogue trajectories and avoid irrelevant questions to the tasks. To address this limitation, we propose TO-GATE, a novel framework that enhances question generation through trajectory optimization, which consists of two key components: a clarification resolver that generates optimal questioning trajectories, and a summarizer that ensures task-aligned final responses. The trajectory optimization enables the model to produce effective elicitation questions and summary responses tailored to specific tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that TO-GATE significantly outperforms baseline methods, achieving a 9.32% improvement on standard preference elicitation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Controllable Sequence Editing for Biological and Clinical Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03569v2)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conditional generation models for longitudinal sequences can generate new or modified trajectories given a conditioning input. While effective at generating entire sequences, these models typically lack control over the timing and scope of the edits. Most existing approaches either operate on univariate sequences or assume that the condition affects all variables and time steps. However, many scientific and clinical applications require more precise interventions, where a condition takes effect only after a specific time and influences only a subset of variables. We introduce CLEF, a controllable sequence editing model for conditional generation of immediate and delayed effects in multivariate longitudinal sequences. CLEF learns temporal concepts that encode how and when a condition alters future sequence evolution. These concepts allow CLEF to apply targeted edits to the affected time steps and variables while preserving the rest of the sequence. We evaluate CLEF on 6 datasets spanning cellular reprogramming and patient health trajectories, comparing against 9 state-of-the-art baselines. CLEF improves immediate sequence editing accuracy by up to 36.01% (MAE). Unlike prior models, CLEF enables one-step conditional generation at arbitrary future times, outperforming them in delayed sequence editing by up to 65.71% (MAE). We test CLEF under counterfactual inference assumptions and show up to 63.19% (MAE) improvement on zero-shot conditional generation of counterfactual trajectories. In a case study of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, CLEF identifies clinical interventions that generate realistic counterfactual trajectories shifted toward healthier outcomes.</p></details> |  |

The proposed method, Exploration-Boosted MC-PILCO (EB-MC-PILCO), leverages iLQR to generate informative, exploratory trajectories and initialize the policy, significantly reducing the number of required optimization steps. Experiments on the cart-pole task demonstrate that EB-MC-PILCO accelerates convergence compared to standard MC-PILCO, achieving up to $\bm{45.9\%}$ reduction in execution time when both methods solve the task in four trials. EB-MC-PILCO also maintains a $\bm{100\%}$ success rate across trials while solving the task faster, even in cases where MC-PILCO converges in fewer iterations.</p></details> |  |

However, prevailing approaches often depend on computationally intensive heuristics or latent anchor representations that lack interpretability and controllability. In this work, we propose a novel framework for learning fixed-dimensional embeddings for short trajectories by leveraging a Transformer encoder trained with a contrastive triplet loss that emphasize the importance of discriminative feature spaces for trajectory data. We analyze the influence of Cosine and FFT-based similarity metrics within the contrastive learning paradigm, with a focus on capturing the nuanced directional intent that characterizes short-term maneuvers. Our empirical evaluation on the Argoverse 2 dataset demonstrates that embeddings shaped by Cosine similarity objectives yield superior clustering of trajectories by both semantic and directional attributes, outperforming FFT-based baselines in retrieval tasks. Notably, we show that compact Transformer architectures, even with low-dimensional embeddings (e.g., 16 dimensions, but qualitatively down to 4), achieve a compelling balance between retrieval performance (minADE, minFDE) and computational overhead, aligning with the growing demand for scalable and interpretable motion priors in real-time systems. The resulting embeddings provide a compact, semantically meaningful, and efficient representation of trajectory data, offering a robust alternative to heuristic similarity measures and paving the way for more transparent and controllable motion forecasting pipelines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted for peer review</p></details> |

The localization of point targets constitutes a fundamental problem in optical experimental mechanics, with extensive applications in various missions of UAVs. Localizing moving targets is crucial for analyzing their motion characteristics and dynamic properties. Reconstructing the trajectories of points from asynchronous cameras is a significant challenge. It encompasses two coupled sub-problems: trajectory reconstruction and camera synchronization. Present methods typically address only one of these sub-problems individually. This paper proposes a 3D trajectory reconstruction method for point targets based on asynchronous cameras, simultaneously solving both sub-problems. Firstly, we extend the trajectory intersection method to asynchronous cameras to resolve the limitation of traditional triangulation that requires camera synchronization. Secondly, we develop models for camera temporal information and target motion, based on imaging mechanisms and target dynamics characteristics. The parameters are optimized simultaneously to achieve trajectory reconstruction without accurate time parameters. Thirdly, we optimize the camera rotations alongside the camera time information and target motion parameters, using tighter and more continuous constraints on moving points. The reconstruction accuracy is significantly improved, especially when the camera rotations are inaccurate. Finally, the simulated and real-world experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and accuracy of the proposed method. The real-world results indicate that the proposed algorithm achieved a localization error of 112.95 m at an observation range of 15 ~ 20 km.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by Acta Mechanica Sinica</p></details> |

However, existing trajectory-based methods primarily focus on individual object motion and struggle to capture multi-object interaction crucial in complex robotic manipulation. This limitation arises from multi-feature entanglement in overlapping regions, which leads to degraded visual fidelity. To address this, we present RoboMaster, a novel framework that models inter-object dynamics through a collaborative trajectory formulation. Unlike prior methods that decompose objects, our core is to decompose the interaction process into three sub-stages: pre-interaction, interaction, and post-interaction. Each stage is modeled using the feature of the dominant object, specifically the robotic arm in the pre- and post-interaction phases and the manipulated object during interaction, thereby mitigating the drawback of multi-object feature fusion present during interaction in prior work. To further ensure subject semantic consistency throughout the video, we incorporate appearance- and shape-aware latent representations for objects. Extensive experiments on the challenging Bridge V2 dataset, as well as in-the-wild evaluation, demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches, establishing new state-of-the-art performance in trajectory-controlled video generation for robotic manipulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://fuxiao0719.github.io/projects/robomaster/ Code: https://github.com/KwaiVGI/RoboMaster</p></details> |

These problems are modeled by partially observable stochastic games (POSGs), but planning in fully continuous POSGs is intractable without heavy offline computation or assumptions on the order of belief maintained by each player. We formulate a finite history/horizon refinement of POSGs which admits competitive information gathering behavior in trajectory space, and through a series of approximations, we present an online method for computing rational trajectory plans in these games which leverages particle-based estimations of the joint state space and performs stochastic gradient play. We also provide the necessary adjustments required to deploy this method on individual agents. The method is tested in continuous pursuit-evasion and warehouse-pickup scenarios (alongside extensions to $N > 2$ players and to more complex environments with visual and physical obstacles), demonstrating evidence of active information gathering and outperforming passive competitors.</p></details> | Accepted at RSS 2025 |

This arises because users frequently do not fully understand their own needs, while systems require precise intent definitions. Current LLM-based agents cannot effectively distinguish between linguistically complete and contextually triggerable expressions, lacking frameworks for collaborative intent formation. We present STORM, a framework modeling asymmetric information dynamics through conversations between UserLLM (full internal access) and AgentLLM (observable behavior only). STORM produces annotated corpora capturing expression trajectories and latent cognitive transitions, enabling systematic analysis of collaborative understanding development. Our contributions include: (1) formalizing asymmetric information processing in dialogue systems; (2) modeling intent formation tracking collaborative understanding evolution; and (3) evaluation metrics measuring internal cognitive improvements alongside task performance. Experiments across four language models reveal that moderate uncertainty (40-60%) can outperform complete transparency in certain scenarios, with model-specific patterns suggesting reconsideration of optimal information completeness in human-AI collaboration. These findings contribute to understanding asymmetric reasoning dynamics and inform uncertainty-calibrated dialogue system design.</p></details> | <details><summary>43 pa...</summary><p>43 pages, 31 figures.

In this context, constrained diversity optimization has emerged as a powerful reinforcement learning (RL) framework to train a diverse set of agents in parallel. However, existing constrained-diversity RL methods often under-explore in complex tasks such as robotic manipulation, leading to a lack in policy diversity. To improve diversity optimization in RL, we therefore propose a curriculum that first explores at the trajectory level before learning step-based policies. In our empirical evaluation, we provide novel insights into the shortcoming of skill-based diversity optimization, and demonstrate empirically that our curriculum improves the diversity of the learned skills.</p></details> |  |

| **[Towards Predicting Any Human Trajectory In Context](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00871v1)** | 2025-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting accurate future trajectories of pedestrians is essential for autonomous systems but remains a challenging task due to the need for adaptability in different environments and domains. A common approach involves collecting scenario-specific data and performing fine-tuning via backpropagation. However, this process is often impractical on edge devices due to constrained computational resources. To address this challenge, we introduce TrajICL, an In-Context Learning (ICL) framework for pedestrian trajectory prediction that enables rapid adaptation without fine-tuning on the scenario-specific data. We propose a spatio-temporal similarity-based example selection (STES) method that selects relevant examples from previously observed trajectories within the same scene by identifying similar motion patterns at corresponding locations. To further refine this selection, we introduce prediction-guided example selection (PG-ES), which selects examples based on both the past trajectory and the predicted future trajectory, rather than relying solely on the past trajectory. This approach allows the model to account for long-term dynamics when selecting examples. Finally, instead of relying on small real-world datasets with limited scenario diversity, we train our model on a large-scale synthetic dataset to enhance its prediction ability by leveraging in-context examples. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TrajICL achieves remarkable adaptation across both in-domain and cross-domain scenarios, outperforming even fine-tuned approaches across multiple public benchmarks. The code will be released at https://fujiry0.github.io/TrajICL-project-page.</p></details> |  |
| **[KG-TRACES: Enhancing Large Language Models with Knowledge Graph-constrained Trajectory Reasoning and Attribution Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00783v1)** | 2025-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have made remarkable strides in various natural language processing tasks, but their performance on complex reasoning problems remains hindered by a lack of explainability and trustworthiness. This issue, often manifesting as hallucinations or unattributable reasoning processes, limits their applicability in complex reasoning scenarios. To address this, we propose Knowledge Graph-constrained Trajectory Reasoning Attribution and Chain Explanation Supervision (KG-TRACES), a novel framework that enhances the reasoning ability of LLMs through explicit supervision over reasoning paths and processes. KG-TRACES jointly supervises the model to: (1) predict symbolic relation paths, (2) predict full triple-level reasoning paths, and (3) generate attribution-aware reasoning processes grounded in the reasoning paths. At inference phase, the model adapts to both KG-available and KG-unavailable scenarios, retrieving reasoning paths from a KG when possible or predicting plausible reasoning paths with only intrinsic knowledge when not. This design enables the model to reason in an explainable and source-attributable pattern. Through extensive experiments on complex reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that KG-TRACES significantly outperforms existing SOTA: it improves Hits@1 by 1.6% and F1 by 4.7% on WebQSP, and achieves improvements of 4.8% in Hits@1 and 2.1% in F1 on CWQ. Moreover, we show its transferability to specialized domains such as medicine. By visualizing the intermediate steps of reasoning processes, we further show that the explicit supervision introduced by KG-TRACES leads to more stable and goal-directed reasoning processes, aligning closely with correct answers. Code is available at https://github.com/Edaizi/KG-TRACES.</p></details> | 23 pages, 13 figures |

Numerous methods have been proposed to address specific problems within trajectory modeling. However, the heterogeneity of data and the diversity of trajectory tasks make effective and reliable trajectory modeling an important yet highly challenging endeavor, even for domain experts. In this paper, we propose \textit{TrajAgent}, a agent framework powered by large language models (LLMs), designed to facilitate robust and efficient trajectory modeling through automation modeling. This framework leverages and optimizes diverse specialized models to address various trajectory modeling tasks across different datasets effectively. In \textit{TrajAgent}, we first develop \textit{UniEnv}, an execution environment with a unified data and model interface, to support the execution and training of various models. Building on \textit{UniEnv}, we introduce an agentic workflow designed for automatic trajectory modeling across various trajectory tasks and data. Furthermore, we introduce collaborative learning schema between LLM-based agents and small speciallized models, to enhance the performance of the whole framework effectively. Extensive experiments on four tasks using four real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of \textit{TrajAgent} in automated trajectory modeling, achieving a performance improvement of 2.38\%-34.96\% over baseline methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>the c...</summary><p>the code will be openly accessible at: https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/TrajAgent</p></details> |

As time progresses, the amount of data fitted by the AD model expands, which helps to improve the AD model generalization substantially. However, such ever-expanding data is a double-edged sword for the AD model. Specifically, as the fitted data volume grows to exceed the the AD model's fitting capacities, the AD model is prone to under-fitting. To address this issue, we propose to use a pretrained Large Vision Models (LVMs) as backbone coupled with downstream perception head to understand AD semantic information. This design can not only surmount the aforementioned under-fitting problem due to LVMs' powerful fitting capabilities, but also enhance the perception generalization thanks to LVMs' vast and diverse training data. On the other hand, to mitigate vehicles' computational burden of training the perception head while running LVM backbone, we introduce a Posterior Optimization Trajectory (POT)-Guided optimization scheme (POTGui) to accelerate the convergence. Concretely, we propose a POT Generator (POTGen) to generate posterior (future) optimization direction in advance to guide the current optimization iteration, through which the model can generally converge within 10 epochs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method improves the performance by over 66.48\% and converges faster over 6 times, compared to the existing state-of-the-art approach.</p></details> | 7 pages |

Rule-based planners are efficient but lack generalization, while learning-based planners excel in generalization yet have limitations in real-time performance and interpretability. In long-tail scenarios, these challenges make planning particularly difficult. To leverage the strengths of both rule-based and learning-based planners, we proposed the Scenario-Aware Hybrid Planner (SAH-Drive) for closed-loop vehicle trajectory planning. Inspired by human driving behavior, SAH-Drive combines a lightweight rule-based planner and a comprehensive learning-based planner, utilizing a dual-timescale decision neuron to determine the final trajectory. To enhance the computational efficiency and robustness of the hybrid planner, we also employed a diffusion proposal number regulator and a trajectory fusion module. The experimental results show that the proposed method significantly improves the generalization capability of the planning system, achieving state-of-the-art performance in interPlan, while maintaining computational efficiency without incurring substantial additional runtime.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 8 figures, International Conference on Machine Learning</p></details> |
| **[Explorer: Scaling Exploration-driven Web Trajectory Synthesis for Multimodal Web Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11357v4)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent success in large multimodal models (LMMs) has sparked promising applications of agents capable of autonomously completing complex web tasks. While open-source LMM agents have made significant advances in offline evaluation benchmarks, their performance still falls substantially short of human-level capabilities in more realistic online settings. A key bottleneck is the lack of diverse and large-scale trajectory-level datasets across various domains, which are expensive to collect. In this paper, we address this challenge by developing a scalable recipe to synthesize the largest and most diverse trajectory-level dataset to date, containing over 94K successful multimodal web trajectories, spanning 49K unique URLs, 720K screenshots, and 33M web elements. In particular, we leverage extensive web exploration and refinement to obtain diverse task intents. The average cost is 28 cents per successful trajectory, making it affordable to a wide range of users in the community. Leveraging this dataset, we train Explorer, a multimodal web agent, and demonstrate strong performance on both offline and online web agent benchmarks such as Mind2Web-Live, Multimodal-Mind2Web, and MiniWob++. Additionally, our experiments highlight data scaling as a key driver for improving web agent capabilities. We hope this study makes state-of-the-art LMM-based agent research at a larger scale more accessible.</p></details> | ACL 2025 (Findings) |

Modeling hand-object interaction priors holds significant potential to advance robotic and embodied AI systems in learning to operate effectively within the physical world. We introduce SIGHT, a novel task focused on generating realistic and physically plausible 3D hand-object interaction trajectories from a single image and a brief language-based task description. Prior work on hand-object trajectory generation typically relies on textual input that lacks explicit grounding to the target object, or assumes access to 3D object meshes, which are often considerably more difficult to obtain than 2D images. We propose SIGHT-Fusion, a novel diffusion-based image-text conditioned generative model that tackles this task by retrieving the most similar 3D object mesh from a database and enforcing geometric hand-object interaction constraints via a novel inference-time diffusion guidance. We benchmark our model on the HOI4D and H2O datasets, adapting relevant baselines for this novel task. Experiments demonstrate our superior performance in the diversity and quality of generated trajectories, as well as in hand-object interaction geometry metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[One Trajectory, One Token: Grounded Video Tokenization via Panoptic Sub-object Trajectory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23617v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective video tokenization is critical for scaling transformer models for long videos. Current approaches tokenize videos using space-time patches, leading to excessive tokens and computational inefficiencies. The best token reduction strategies degrade performance and barely reduce the number of tokens when the camera moves. We introduce grounded video tokenization, a paradigm that organizes tokens based on panoptic sub-object trajectories rather than fixed patches. Our method aligns with fundamental perceptual principles, ensuring that tokenization reflects scene complexity rather than video duration. We propose TrajViT, a video encoder that extracts object trajectories and converts them into semantically meaningful tokens, significantly reducing redundancy while maintaining temporal coherence. Trained with contrastive learning, TrajViT significantly outperforms space-time ViT (ViT3D) across multiple video understanding benchmarks, e.g., TrajViT outperforms ViT3D by a large margin of 6% top-5 recall in average at video-text retrieval task with 10x token deduction. We also show TrajViT as a stronger model than ViT3D for being the video encoder for modern VideoLLM, obtaining an average of 5.2% performance improvement across 6 VideoQA benchmarks while having 4x faster training time and 18x less inference FLOPs. TrajViT is the first efficient encoder to consistently outperform ViT3D across diverse video analysis tasks, making it a robust and scalable solution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Autoregressive Meta-Actions for Unified Controllable Trajectory Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23612v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Controllable trajectory generation guided by high-level semantic decisions, termed meta-actions, is crucial for autonomous driving systems. A significant limitation of existing frameworks is their reliance on invariant meta-actions assigned over fixed future time intervals, causing temporal misalignment with the actual behavior trajectories. This misalignment leads to irrelevant associations between the prescribed meta-actions and the resulting trajectories, disrupting task coherence and limiting model performance. To address this challenge, we introduce Autoregressive Meta-Actions, an approach integrated into autoregressive trajectory generation frameworks that provides a unified and precise definition for meta-action-conditioned trajectory prediction. Specifically, We decompose traditional long-interval meta-actions into frame-level meta-actions, enabling a sequential interplay between autoregressive meta-action prediction and meta-action-conditioned trajectory generation. This decomposition ensures strict alignment between each trajectory segment and its corresponding meta-action, achieving a consistent and unified task formulation across the entire trajectory span and significantly reducing complexity. Moreover, we propose a staged pre-training process to decouple the learning of basic motion dynamics from the integration of high-level decision control, which offers flexibility, stability, and modularity. Experimental results validate our framework's effectiveness, demonstrating improved trajectory adaptivity and responsiveness to dynamic decision-making scenarios. We provide the video document and dataset, which are available at https://arma-traj.github.io/.</p></details> |  |

Existing work primarily focuses on behavior cloning from expert demonstrations or preference learning through exploratory trajectory sampling. However, these methods often struggle to address long-horizon tasks, where suboptimal actions accumulate step by step, causing agents to deviate from correct task trajectories. To address this, we highlight the importance of timely calibration and the need to automatically construct calibration trajectories for training agents. We propose Step-Level Trajectory Calibration (STeCa), a novel framework for LLM agent learning. Specifically, STeCa identifies suboptimal actions through a step-level reward comparison during exploration. It constructs calibrated trajectories using LLM-driven reflection, enabling agents to learn from improved decision-making processes. We finally leverage these calibrated trajectories with successful trajectories for reinforced training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STeCa significantly outperforms existing methods. Further analysis highlights that timely calibration enables agents to complete tasks with greater robustness.

We propose a centroidal online trajectory generation and stabilization control for humanoid dynamic multi-contact motion. The proposed method features the drastic reduction of the computational cost by using preview control instead of the conventional model predictive control that considers the constraints of all sample times. By combining preview control with centroidal state feedback for robustness to disturbances and wrench distribution for satisfying contact constraints, we show that the robot can stably perform a variety of multi-contact motions through simulation experiments.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce \textbf{TRACE (Trajectory-Constrained Attentional Concept Erasure)}, a novel method to erase targeted concepts from diffusion models while preserving overall generative quality. Our approach combines a rigorous theoretical framework, establishing formal conditions under which a concept can be provably suppressed in the diffusion process, with an effective fine-tuning procedure compatible with both conventional latent diffusion (Stable Diffusion) and emerging rectified flow models (e.g.~FLUX). We first derive a closed-form update to the model's cross-attention layers that removes hidden representations of the target concept. We then introduce a trajectory-aware finetuning objective that steers the denoising process away from the concept only in the late sampling stages, thus maintaining the model's fidelity on unrelated content. Empirically, we evaluate TRACE on multiple benchmarks used in prior concept erasure studies (object classes, celebrity faces, artistic styles, and explicit content from the I2P dataset). TRACE achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming recent methods such as ANT, EraseAnything, and MACE in terms of removal efficacy and output quality.</p></details> | In peer review |
| **[Universal Trajectory Optimization Framework for Differential Drive Robot Class](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07924v3)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differential drive robots are widely used in various scenarios thanks to their straightforward principle, from household service robots to disaster response field robots. There are several types of driving mechanisms for real-world applications, including two-wheeled, four-wheeled skid-steering, tracked robots, and so on. The differences in the driving mechanisms usually require specific kinematic modeling when precise control is desired. Furthermore, the nonholonomic dynamics and possible lateral slip lead to different degrees of difficulty in getting feasible and high-quality trajectories. Therefore, a comprehensive trajectory optimization framework to compute trajectories efficiently for various kinds of differential drive robots is highly desirable. In this paper, we propose a universal trajectory optimization framework that can be applied to differential drive robots, enabling the generation of high-quality trajectories within a restricted computational timeframe. We introduce a novel trajectory representation based on polynomial parameterization of motion states or their integrals, such as angular and linear velocities, which inherently matches the robots' motion to the control principle. The trajectory optimization problem is formulated to minimize complexity while prioritizing safety and operational efficiency. We then build a full-stack autonomous planning and control system to demonstrate its feasibility and robustness. We conduct extensive simulations and real-world testing in crowded environments with three kinds of differential drive robots to validate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | 15 pages, 16 figures |

In this paper, we leverage ideas from generative modeling of image data to push the boundary of time series generation. For this, we find new generators of SDEs and jump processes, inspired by trajectory flow matching, that have the marginal distributions of the time series of interest. Specifically, we can handle discontinuities of the underlying processes by parameterizing the jump kernel densities by scaled Gaussians that allow for closed form formulas of the corresponding Kullback-Leibler divergence in the loss. Unlike most other approaches, we are able to handle irregularly sampled time series.</p></details> |  |

While the lack of exact latent inversion is a core advantage of these methods, it often results in unstable editing trajectories and poor source consistency. To address this limitation, we propose FlowAlign, a novel inversion-free flow-based framework for consistent image editing with principled trajectory control. FlowAlign introduces a flow-matching loss as a regularization mechanism to promote smoother and more stable trajectories during the editing process. Notably, the flow-matching loss is shown to explicitly balance semantic alignment with the edit prompt and structural consistency with the source image along the trajectory. Furthermore, FlowAlign naturally supports reverse editing by simply reversing the ODE trajectory, highlighting the reversible and consistent nature of the transformation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlowAlign outperforms existing methods in both source preservation and editing controllability.</p></details> |  |

Existing imputation methods rely on sparse trajectory or travel information, such as velocity, to infer missing points. However, these approaches assume that sparse trajectories retain essential behavioral patterns, which place significant demands on data acquisition and overlook the potential of large-scale human trajectory embeddings. To address this, we propose ProDiff, a trajectory imputation framework that uses only two endpoints as minimal information. It integrates prototype learning to embed human movement patterns and a denoising diffusion probabilistic model for robust spatiotemporal reconstruction. Joint training with a tailored loss function ensures effective imputation. ProDiff outperforms state-of-the-art methods, improving accuracy by 6.28\% on FourSquare and 2.52\% on WuXi. Further analysis shows a 0.927 correlation between generated and real trajectories, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |

Traditional MPI reconstruction relies on either time-consuming calibration (measured system matrix) or model-based simulation of the forward operator. Recent developments have shown the applicability of Chebyshev polynomials to multi-dimensional Lissajous Field-Free Point (FFP) scans. This method is bound to the particular choice of sinusoidal scanning trajectories. In this paper, we present the first reconstruction on real 2D MPI data with a trajectory-independent model-based MPI reconstruction algorithm. We further develop the zero-shot Plug-and-Play (PnP) algorithm of the authors -- with automatic noise level estimation -- to address the present deconvolution problem, leveraging a state-of-the-art denoiser trained on natural images without retraining on MPI-specific data. We evaluate our method on the publicly available 2D FFP MPI dataset ``MPIdata: Equilibrium Model with Anisotropy", featuring scans of six phantoms acquired using a Bruker preclinical scanner. Moreover, we show reconstruction performed on custom data on a 2D scanner with additional high-frequency excitation field and partial data. Our results demonstrate strong reconstruction capabilities across different scanning scenarios -- setting a precedent for general-purpose, flexible model-based MPI reconstruction.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures.

We find that, across languages and contexts, the ratio of instantaneous displacement to instantaneous velocity generally follows an exponential decay curve from movement onset to movement offset. We formalize this empirical discovery in a differential equation and, in combination with an assumption of point attractor dynamics, derive a nonlinear second-order dynamical system describing labial constriction trajectories. The equation has only two parameters, T and r. T corresponds to the target state and r corresponds to movement rapidity. Thus, each of the parameters corresponds to a phonetically relevant dimension of control. Nonlinear regression demonstrates that the model provides excellent fits to individual movement trajectories. Moreover, trajectories simulated from the model qualitatively match empirical trajectories, and capture key kinematic variables like duration, peak velocity, and time to achieve peak velocity. The model constitutes a proposal for the dynamics of individual articulatory movements, and thus offers a novel foundation from which to understand additional influences on articulatory kinematics like prosody, inter-movement coordination, and stochastic noise.</p></details> |  |

However, this approach remains primarily acoustic and lacks articulatory constraints. In this study, the same 75 VCVs are analyzed, but generated with the Maeda model, using trajectory planning that differentiates vowel-to-vowel transitions from consonantal influences. Synthetic data exhibit similar characteristics to Ohman's sequences, including the presence of S-shaped F2 trajectories. Furthermore, locus equations (LEs) for F2 and F3 are computed from synthetic CV data to investigate their underlying determinism, leading to a reassessment of conventional interpretations. The findings indicate that, although articulatory planning is structured separately for vowel and consonant groups, S-shaped F2 trajectories emerge from a composite mechanism governed by the coordinated synergy of all articulators.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 4 figures, submitted to Interspeech 2025</p></details> |

This study categorizes such misalignments into three types: (1) lack of functions to express intent, (2) inefficient action sequences, and (3) incorrect intentions that cannot solve the task. To address these issues, we first formalize and define these three misalignment types in a unified framework. We then propose a heuristic algorithm to detect misalignments in ARCTraj trajectories and analyze their impact hierarchically and quantitatively. We also present an intention estimation method based on our formalism that infers missing alignment between user actions and intentions. Through trajectory alignment, we experimentally demonstrate that AI models trained on human task-solving trajectories improve performance in mimicking human reasoning. Based on hierarchical analysis and experiments, we highlight the importance of trajectory-intention alignment and demonstrate the effectiveness of intention-aligned training.</p></details> | KDD 2025 accepted |
| **[Risk-Informed Diffusion Transformer for Long-Tail Trajectory Prediction in the Crash Scenario](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16349v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction methods have been widely applied in autonomous driving technologies. Although the overall performance accuracy of trajectory prediction is relatively high, the lack of trajectory data in critical scenarios in the training data leads to the long-tail phenomenon. Normally, the trajectories of the tail data are more critical and more difficult to predict and may include rare scenarios such as crashes. To solve this problem, we extracted the trajectory data from real-world crash scenarios, which contain more long-tail data. Meanwhile, based on the trajectory data in this scenario, we integrated graph-based risk information and diffusion with transformer and proposed the Risk-Informed Diffusion Transformer (RI-DiT) trajectory prediction method. Extensive experiments were conducted on trajectory data in the real-world crash scenario, and the results show that the algorithm we proposed has good performance. When predicting the data of the tail 10\% (Top 10\%), the minADE and minFDE indicators are 0.016/2.667 m. At the same time, we showed the trajectory conditions of different long-tail distributions. The distribution of trajectory data is closer to the tail, the less smooth the trajectory is. Through the trajectory data in real-world crash scenarios, Our work expands the methods to overcome the long-tail challenges in trajectory prediction. Our method, RI-DiT, integrates inverse time to collision (ITTC) and the feature of traffic flow, which can predict long-tail trajectories more accurately and improve the safety of autonomous driving systems.</p></details> |  |

However, previous LLM-based methods, which are superficially adapted to next POI prediction, largely overlook critical challenges associated with applying LLMs to this task. Specifically, LLMs encounter two critical challenges: (1) a lack of intrinsic understanding of numeric spatiotemporal data, which hinders accurate modeling of users' spatiotemporal distributions and preferences; and (2) an excessively large and unconstrained candidate POI space, which often results in random or irrelevant predictions. To address these issues, we propose a Collaborative Multi Agent Framework for Next POI Prediction, named CoMaPOI. Through the close interaction of three specialized agents (Profiler, Forecaster, and Predictor), CoMaPOI collaboratively addresses the two critical challenges. The Profiler agent is responsible for converting numeric data into language descriptions, enhancing semantic understanding. The Forecaster agent focuses on dynamically constraining and refining the candidate POI space. The Predictor agent integrates this information to generate high-precision predictions. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets (NYC, TKY, and CA) demonstrate that CoMaPOI achieves state of the art performance, improving all metrics by 5% to 10% compared to SOTA baselines. This work pioneers the investigation of challenges associated with applying LLMs to complex spatiotemporal tasks by leveraging tailored collaborative agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by SIGIR 2025</p></details> |

Key contributions include the quantum-based state transitions, return calculation, and trajectory search mechanism that utilize quantum principles to demonstrate the realization of RL processes through quantum phenomena. The implementation emphasizes the fundamental role of quantum superposition in enhancing computational efficiency for RL tasks. Results demonstrate the capacity of a quantum model to achieve quantum enhancement in RL, highlighting the potential of fully quantum implementations in decision-making tasks. This work not only underscores the applicability of quantum computing in machine learning but also contributes to the field of quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) by offering a robust framework for understanding and exploiting quantum computing in RL systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Latent Weight Diffusion: Generating reactive policies instead of trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14040v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing availability of open-source robotic data, imitation learning has emerged as a viable approach for both robot manipulation and locomotion. Currently, large generalized policies are trained to predict controls or trajectories using diffusion models, which have the desirable property of learning multimodal action distributions. However, generalizability comes with a cost, namely, larger model size and slower inference. This is especially an issue for robotic tasks that require high control frequency. Further, there is a known trade-off between performance and action horizon for Diffusion Policy (DP), a popular model for generating trajectories: fewer diffusion queries accumulate greater trajectory tracking errors. For these reasons, it is common practice to run these models at high inference frequency, subject to robot computational constraints. To address these limitations, we propose Latent Weight Diffusion (LWD), a method that uses diffusion to generate closed-loop policies (weights for neural policies) for robotic tasks, rather than generating trajectories. Learning the behavior distribution through parameter space over trajectory space offers two key advantages: longer action horizons (fewer diffusion queries) & robustness to perturbations while retaining high performance; and a lower inference compute cost. To this end, we show that LWD has higher success rates than DP when the action horizon is longer and when stochastic perturbations exist in the environment. Furthermore, LWD achieves multitask performance comparable to DP while requiring just ~1/45th of the inference-time FLOPS</p></details> |  |
| **[Streaming Flow Policy: Simplifying diffusion$/$flow-matching policies by treating action trajectories as flow trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21851v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in diffusion$/$flow-matching policies have enabled imitation learning of complex, multi-modal action trajectories. However, they are computationally expensive because they sample a trajectory of trajectories: a diffusion$/$flow trajectory of action trajectories. They discard intermediate action trajectories, and must wait for the sampling process to complete before any actions can be executed on the robot. We simplify diffusion$/$flow policies by treating action trajectories as flow trajectories. Instead of starting from pure noise, our algorithm samples from a narrow Gaussian around the last action. Then, it incrementally integrates a velocity field learned via flow matching to produce a sequence of actions that constitute a single trajectory. This enables actions to be streamed to the robot on-the-fly during the flow sampling process, and is well-suited for receding horizon policy execution. Despite streaming, our method retains the ability to model multi-modal behavior. We train flows that stabilize around demonstration trajectories to reduce distribution shift and improve imitation learning performance. Streaming flow policy outperforms prior methods while enabling faster policy execution and tighter sensorimotor loops for learning-based robot control.

However, existing learning-based planning methods often rely on expert demonstrations, which not only lack explicit safety awareness but also risk inheriting unsafe behaviors such as speeding from suboptimal human driving data. Inspired by the success of large language models, we propose Plan-R1, a novel two-stage trajectory planning framework that formulates trajectory planning as a sequential prediction task, guided by explicit planning principles such as safety, comfort, and traffic rule compliance. In the first stage, we train an autoregressive trajectory predictor via next motion token prediction on expert data. In the second stage, we design rule-based rewards (e.g., collision avoidance, speed limits) and fine-tune the model using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a reinforcement learning strategy, to align its predictions with these planning principles. Experiments on the nuPlan benchmark demonstrate that our Plan-R1 significantly improves planning safety and feasibility, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Our code will be made public soon.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose IKMo, an image-keyframed motion generation method based on the diffusion model with trajectory and pose being decoupled. The trajectory and pose inputs go through a two-stage conditioning framework. In the first stage, the dedicated optimization module is applied to refine inputs. In the second stage, trajectory and pose are encoded via a Trajectory Encoder and a Pose Encoder in parallel. Then, motion with high spatial and semantic fidelity is guided by a motion ControlNet, which processes the fused trajectory and pose data. Experiment results based on HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art on all metrics under trajectory-keyframe constraints. In addition, MLLM-based agents are implemented to pre-process model inputs. Given texts and keyframe images from users, the agents extract motion descriptions, keyframe poses, and trajectories as the optimized inputs into the motion generation model. We conducts a user study with 10 participants. The experiment results prove that the MLLM-based agents pre-processing makes generated motion more in line with users' expectation. We believe that the proposed method improves both the fidelity and controllability of motion generation by the diffusion model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamical ON-OFF Control with Trajectory Prediction for Multi-RIS Wireless Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20887v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have demonstrated an unparalleled ability to reconfigure wireless environments by dynamically controlling the phase, amplitude, and polarization of impinging waves. However, as nearly passive reflective metasurfaces, RISs may not distinguish between desired and interference signals, which can lead to severe spectrum pollution and even affect performance negatively. In particular, in large-scale networks, the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the receiving node can be degraded due to excessive interference reflected from the RIS. To overcome this fundamental limitation, we propose in this paper a trajectory prediction-based dynamical control algorithm (TPC) for anticipating RIS ON-OFF states sequence, integrating a long-short-term-memory (LSTM) scheme to predict user trajectories. In particular, through a codebook-based algorithm, the RIS controller adaptively coordinates the configuration of the RIS elements to maximize the received SINR. Our simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed TPC method over various system settings.</p></details> |  |

Existing OPE methods are ineffective for high-dimensional, long-horizon problems, due to exponential blow-ups in variance from importance weighting or compounding errors from learned dynamics models. To address these challenges, we propose STITCH-OPE, a model-based generative framework that leverages denoising diffusion for long-horizon OPE in high-dimensional state and action spaces. Starting with a diffusion model pre-trained on the behavior data, STITCH-OPE generates synthetic trajectories from the target policy by guiding the denoising process using the score function of the target policy. STITCH-OPE proposes two technical innovations that make it advantageous for OPE: (1) prevents over-regularization by subtracting the score of the behavior policy during guidance, and (2) generates long-horizon trajectories by stitching partial trajectories together end-to-end. We provide a theoretical guarantee that under mild assumptions, these modifications result in an exponential reduction in variance versus long-horizon trajectory diffusion. Experiments on the D4RL and OpenAI Gym benchmarks show substantial improvement in mean squared error, correlation, and regret metrics compared to state-of-the-art OPE methods.</p></details> |  |

The new estimate is $O(N^{-1/2})$, with a constant related to the probability of success of the bound, given by Hoeffding's inequality, similar to other methodologies, such as Philipp et al. Furthermore, we propose a \textit{lifting back} operator to obtain trajectories generated by embedding the initial state and iterating a linear system in a higher dimension. This naturally yields an $O(N^{-1/2})$ error bound for mean trajectories. Finally, we show numerical results including an example of nonlinear system, exhibiting successful approximation with exponential decay faster than $-1/2$, as suggested by the theoretical results.</p></details> | 24 pages, 6 figures |

While high-fidelity nonlinear time history analysis provides the most comprehensive and accurate representation of the responses, it becomes computationally prohibitive for complex structural system models and repeated simulations under varying ground motions. To address this challenge, we propose a composite learning framework that integrates simplified physics-based models with a Fourier neural operator to enable efficient and accurate trajectory-level seismic response prediction. In the proposed architecture, a simplified physics-based model, obtained from techniques such as linearization, modal reduction, or solver relaxation, serves as a preprocessing operator to generate structural response trajectories that capture coarse dynamic characteristics. A neural operator is then trained to correct the discrepancy between these initial approximations and the true nonlinear responses, allowing the composite model to capture hysteretic and path-dependent behaviors. Additionally, a linear regression-based postprocessing scheme is introduced to further refine predictions and quantify associated uncertainty with negligible additional computational effort. The proposed approach is validated on three representative structural systems subjected to synthetic or recorded ground motions. Results show that the proposed approach consistently improves prediction accuracy over baseline models, particularly in data-scarce regimes. These findings demonstrate the potential of physics-guided operator learning for reliable and data-efficient modeling of nonlinear structural seismic responses.</p></details> |  |
| **[Policy-Based Trajectory Clustering in Offline Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09202v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel task of clustering trajectories from offline reinforcement learning (RL) datasets, where each cluster center represents the policy that generated its trajectories. By leveraging the connection between the KL-divergence of offline trajectory distributions and a mixture of policy-induced distributions, we formulate a natural clustering objective. To solve this, we propose Policy-Guided K-means (PG-Kmeans) and Centroid-Attracted Autoencoder (CAAE). PG-Kmeans iteratively trains behavior cloning (BC) policies and assigns trajectories based on policy generation probabilities, while CAAE resembles the VQ-VAE framework by guiding the latent representations of trajectories toward the vicinity of specific codebook entries to achieve clustering. Theoretically, we prove the finite-step convergence of PG-Kmeans and identify a key challenge in offline trajectory clustering: the inherent ambiguity of optimal solutions due to policy-induced conflicts, which can result in multiple equally valid but structurally distinct clusterings. Experimentally, we validate our methods on the widely used D4RL dataset and custom GridWorld environments. Our results show that both PG-Kmeans and CAAE effectively partition trajectories into meaningful clusters. They offer a promising framework for policy-based trajectory clustering, with broad applications in offline RL and beyond.</p></details> |  |
| **[Chain-of-Action: Trajectory Autoregressive Modeling for Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09990v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Chain-of-Action (CoA), a novel visuo-motor policy paradigm built upon Trajectory Autoregressive Modeling. Unlike conventional approaches that predict next step action(s) forward, CoA generates an entire trajectory by explicit backward reasoning with task-specific goals through an action-level Chain-of-Thought (CoT) process. This process is unified within a single autoregressive structure: (1) the first token corresponds to a stable keyframe action that encodes the task-specific goals; and (2) subsequent action tokens are generated autoregressively, conditioned on the initial keyframe and previously predicted actions. This backward action reasoning enforces a global-to-local structure, allowing each local action to be tightly constrained by the final goal. To further realize the action reasoning structure, CoA incorporates four complementary designs: continuous action token representation; dynamic stopping for variable-length trajectory generation; reverse temporal ensemble; and multi-token prediction to balance action chunk modeling with global structure. As a result, CoA gives strong spatial generalization capabilities while preserving the flexibility and simplicity of a visuo-motor policy. Empirically, we observe CoA achieves the state-of-the-art performance across 60 RLBench tasks and 8 real-world manipulation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[ECAM: A Contrastive Learning Approach to Avoid Environmental Collision in Trajectory Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09626v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human trajectory forecasting is crucial in applications such as autonomous driving, robotics and surveillance. Accurate forecasting requires models to consider various factors, including social interactions, multi-modal predictions, pedestrian intention and environmental context. While existing methods account for these factors, they often overlook the impact of the environment, which leads to collisions with obstacles. This paper introduces ECAM (Environmental Collision Avoidance Module), a contrastive learning-based module to enhance collision avoidance ability with the environment. The proposed module can be integrated into existing trajectory forecasting models, improving their ability to generate collision-free predictions. We evaluate our method on the ETH/UCY dataset and quantitatively and qualitatively demonstrate its collision avoidance capabilities. Our experiments show that state-of-the-art methods significantly reduce (-40/50%) the collision rate when integrated with the proposed module.

To this end, an accurate prediction of dynamic obstacle trajectories is vital. Traditional approaches to trajectory prediction face limitations in generalizability and often fail to account for the intentions of other vessels. While recent research has considered incorporating the intentions of dynamic obstacles, these efforts are typically based on the own-ship's interpretation of the situation. The current state-of-the-art in this area is a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) model, which infers target vessel intentions by considering multiple underlying causes and allowing for different interpretations of the situation by different vessels. However, since its inception, there have not been any significant structural improvements to this model. In this paper, we propose enhancing the DBN model by incorporating considerations for grounding hazards and vessel waypoint information. The proposed model is validated using real vessel encounters extracted from historical Automatic Identification System (AIS) data.</p></details> | <details><summary>IMPOR...</summary><p>IMPORTANT: This preprint is not the final version.

| **[TGRPO :Fine-tuning Vision-Language-Action Model via Trajectory-wise Group Relative Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08440v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model have demonstrated strong generalization capabilities across diverse scenes, tasks, and robotic platforms when pretrained at large-scale datasets. However, these models still require task-specific fine-tuning in novel environments, a process that relies almost exclusively on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using static trajectory datasets. Such approaches neither allow robot to interact with environment nor do they leverage feedback from live execution. Also, their success is critically dependent on the size and quality of the collected trajectories. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising alternative by enabling closed-loop interaction and aligning learned policies directly with task objectives. In this work, we draw inspiration from the ideas of GRPO and propose the Trajectory-wise Group Relative Policy Optimization (TGRPO) method. By fusing step-level and trajectory-level advantage signals, this method improves GRPO's group-level advantage estimation, thereby making the algorithm more suitable for online reinforcement learning training of VLA. Experimental results on ten manipulation tasks from the libero-object benchmark demonstrate that TGRPO consistently outperforms various baseline methods, capable of generating more robust and efficient policies across multiple tested scenarios.

| **[What is the Cost of Differential Privacy for Deep Learning-Based Trajectory Generation?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09312v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While location trajectories offer valuable insights, they also reveal sensitive personal information. Differential Privacy (DP) offers formal protection, but achieving a favourable utility-privacy trade-off remains challenging. Recent works explore deep learning-based generative models to produce synthetic trajectories. However, current models lack formal privacy guarantees and rely on conditional information derived from real data during generation. This work investigates the utility cost of enforcing DP in such models, addressing three research questions across two datasets and eleven utility metrics. (1) We evaluate how DP-SGD, the standard DP training method for deep learning, affects the utility of state-of-the-art generative models. (2) Since DP-SGD is limited to unconditional models, we propose a novel DP mechanism for conditional generation that provides formal guarantees and assess its impact on utility. (3) We analyse how model types - Diffusion, VAE, and GAN - affect the utility-privacy trade-off. Our results show that DP-SGD significantly impacts performance, although some utility remains if the datasets is sufficiently large. The proposed DP mechanism improves training stability, particularly when combined with DP-SGD, for unstable models such as GANs and on smaller datasets. Diffusion models yield the best utility without guarantees, but with DP-SGD, GANs perform best, indicating that the best non-private model is not necessarily optimal when targeting formal guarantees. In conclusion, DP trajectory generation remains a challenging task, and formal guarantees are currently only feasible with large datasets and in constrained use cases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating Generative Vehicle Trajectory Models for Traffic Intersection Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08963v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic Intersections are vital to urban road networks as they regulate the movement of people and goods. However, they are regions of conflicting trajectories and are prone to accidents. Deep Generative models of traffic dynamics at signalized intersections can greatly help traffic authorities better understand the efficiency and safety aspects. At present, models are evaluated on computational metrics that primarily look at trajectory reconstruction errors. They are not evaluated online in a `live' microsimulation scenario. Further, these metrics do not adequately consider traffic engineering-specific concerns such as red-light violations, unallowed stoppage, etc. In this work, we provide a comprehensive analytics tool to train, run, and evaluate models with metrics that give better insights into model performance from a traffic engineering point of view. We train a state-of-the-art multi-vehicle trajectory forecasting model on a large dataset collected by running a calibrated scenario of a real-world urban intersection. We then evaluate the performance of the prediction models, online in a microsimulator, under unseen traffic conditions. We show that despite using ideally-behaved trajectories as input, and achieving low trajectory reconstruction errors, the generated trajectories show behaviors that break traffic rules. We introduce new metrics to evaluate such undesired behaviors and present our results.</p></details> |  |
| **[IntTrajSim: Trajectory Prediction for Simulating Multi-Vehicle driving at Signalized Intersections](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08957v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic simulators are widely used to study the operational efficiency of road infrastructure, but their rule-based approach limits their ability to mimic real-world driving behavior. Traffic intersections are critical components of the road infrastructure, both in terms of safety risk (nearly 28% of fatal crashes and 58% of nonfatal crashes happen at intersections) as well as the operational efficiency of a road corridor. This raises an important question: can we create a data-driven simulator that can mimic the macro- and micro-statistics of the driving behavior at a traffic intersection? Deep Generative Modeling-based trajectory prediction models provide a good starting point to model the complex dynamics of vehicles at an intersection. But they are not tested in a "live" micro-simulation scenario and are not evaluated on traffic engineering-related metrics. In this study, we propose traffic engineering-related metrics to evaluate generative trajectory prediction models and provide a simulation-in-the-loop pipeline to do so. We also provide a multi-headed self-attention-based trajectory prediction model that incorporates the signal information, which outperforms our previous models on the evaluation metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Intra-Trajectory Consistency for Reward Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09096v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reward models are critical for improving large language models (LLMs), particularly in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) or inference-time verification. Current reward modeling typically relies on scores of overall responses to learn the outcome rewards for the responses. However, since the response-level scores are coarse-grained supervision signals, the reward model struggles to identify the specific components within a response trajectory that truly correlate with the scores, leading to poor generalization on unseen responses. In this paper, we propose to leverage generation probabilities to establish reward consistency between processes in the response trajectory, which allows the response-level supervisory signal to propagate across processes, thereby providing additional fine-grained signals for reward learning. Building on analysis under the Bayesian framework, we develop an intra-trajectory consistency regularization to enforce that adjacent processes with higher next-token generation probability maintain more consistent rewards. We apply the proposed regularization to the advanced outcome reward model, improving its performance on RewardBench. Besides, we show that the reward model trained with the proposed regularization induces better DPO-aligned policies and achieves better best-of-N (BON) inference-time verification results.

| **[TraGraph-GS: Trajectory Graph-based Gaussian Splatting for Arbitrary Large-Scale Scene Rendering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08704v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-quality novel view synthesis for large-scale scenes presents a challenging dilemma in 3D computer vision. Existing methods typically partition large scenes into multiple regions, reconstruct a 3D representation using Gaussian splatting for each region, and eventually merge them for novel view rendering. They can accurately render specific scenes, yet they do not generalize effectively for two reasons: (1) rigid spatial partition techniques struggle with arbitrary camera trajectories, and (2) the merging of regions results in Gaussian overlap to distort texture details. To address these challenges, we propose TraGraph-GS, leveraging a trajectory graph to enable high-precision rendering for arbitrarily large-scale scenes. We present a spatial partitioning method for large-scale scenes based on graphs, which incorporates a regularization constraint to enhance the rendering of textures and distant objects, as well as a progressive rendering strategy to mitigate artifacts caused by Gaussian overlap. Experimental results demonstrate its superior performance both on four aerial and four ground datasets and highlight its remarkable efficiency: our method achieves an average improvement of 1.86 dB in PSNR on aerial datasets and 1.62 dB on ground datasets compared to state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches struggle as they rely on static augmentations that fail under object deformations, occlusions, and camera movement, leading to inconsistent feature learning over time. We propose a motion-guided self-supervised learning framework that clusters dense point tracks to learn spatiotemporally consistent representations. By leveraging an off-the-shelf point tracker, we extract long-range motion trajectories and optimize feature clustering through a momentum-encoder-based optimal transport mechanism. To ensure temporal coherence, we propagate cluster assignments along tracked points, enforcing feature consistency across views despite viewpoint changes. Integrating motion as an implicit supervisory signal, our method learns representations that generalize across frames, improving robustness in dynamic scenes and challenging occlusion scenarios. By initializing from strong image-pretrained models and leveraging video data for training, we improve state-of-the-art by 1% to 6% on six image and video datasets and four evaluation benchmarks.

However, existing MARL approaches often rely on the restrictive assumption that the number of entities (e.g., agents, obstacles) remains constant between training and inference. This overlooks scenarios where entities are dynamically removed or added during the inference trajectory -- a common occurrence in real-world environments like search and rescue missions and dynamic combat situations. In this paper, we tackle the challenge of intra-trajectory dynamic entity composition under zero-shot out-of-domain (OOD) generalization, where such dynamic changes cannot be anticipated beforehand. Our empirical studies reveal that existing MARL methods suffer significant performance degradation and increased uncertainty in these scenarios. In response, we propose FlickerFusion, a novel OOD generalization method that acts as a universally applicable augmentation technique for MARL backbone methods. FlickerFusion stochastically drops out parts of the observation space, emulating being in-domain when inferenced OOD. The results show that FlickerFusion not only achieves superior inference rewards but also uniquely reduces uncertainty vis-\`a-vis the backbone, compared to existing methods. Benchmarks, implementations, and model weights are organized and open-sourced at flickerfusion305.github.io, accompanied by ample demo video renderings.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

This growing deployment presents new challenges for UAV trajectory planning in complex urban environments. However, existing studies often overlook key factors, such as urban airspace constraints and economic efficiency, which are essential in low-altitude economy contexts. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is regarded as a promising solution to these issues, while its practical adoption remains limited by low learning efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel UAV trajectory planning framework that combines DRL with large language model (LLM) reasoning to enable safe, compliant, and economically viable path planning. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines across multiple metrics, including data collection rate, collision avoidance, successful landing, regulatory compliance, and energy efficiency. These results validate the effectiveness of our approach in addressing UAV trajectory planning key challenges under constraints of the low-altitude economy networking.</p></details> |  |

In contrast to prior methods that address these motion types through separate modules or task-specific designs, our approach offers a cohesive solution by projecting user-defined trajectories into the latent space of pre-trained image-to-video generation models via a lightweight motion injector. Users can specify keypoints and their motion paths to control localized deformations, entire object motion, virtual camera dynamics, or combinations of these. The injected trajectory signals guide the generative process to produce temporally consistent and semantically aligned motion sequences. Our framework demonstrates superior performance across multiple video motion control tasks, including stylized motion effects (e.g., motion brushes), dynamic viewpoint changes, and precise local motion manipulation. Experiments show that our method provides significantly better controllability and visual quality compared to prior approaches and commercial solutions, while remaining broadly compatible with various state-of-the-art video generation backbones.

Unlike standard cameras, which suffer from high latency and motion blur at fast ball speeds, event cameras provide higher temporal resolution, allowing more frequent state updates, greater robustness to outliers, and accurate trajectory predictions using just a short time window after the opponent's impact. We collect a dataset of ping-pong game sequences, including 3D ground-truth trajectories of the ball, synchronized with sensor data from the Meta Project Aria glasses and event streams. Our system leverages foveated vision, using eye-gaze data from the glasses to process only events in the viewer's fovea. This biologically inspired approach improves ball detection performance and significantly reduces computational latency, as it efficiently allocates resources to the most perceptually relevant regions, achieving a reduction factor of 10.81 on the collected trajectories. Our detection pipeline has a worst-case total latency of 4.5 ms, including computation and perception - significantly lower than a frame-based 30 FPS system, which, in the worst case, takes 66 ms solely for perception. Finally, we fit a trajectory prediction model to the estimated states of the ball, enabling 3D trajectory forecasting in the future. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to predict table tennis trajectories from an egocentric perspective using event cameras.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE/...</summary><p>IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (CVPRW), Nashville (TN), USA, 2025; 5th International Workshop on Event-Based Vision</p></details> |

In this paper, we reformulate the trajectory optimization of this kind of method, focusing on enhancing both reconstruction quality and efficiency. Initially, we navigate effective restoration paths through a reinforcement learning process, gradually steering potential trajectories toward the most precise options. Additionally, to mitigate the considerable computational burden associated with iterative sampling, we propose cost-aware trajectory distillation to streamline complex paths into several manageable steps with adaptable sizes. Moreover, we fine-tune a foundational diffusion model (FLUX) with 12B parameters by using our algorithms, producing a unified framework for handling 7 kinds of image restoration tasks. Extensive experiments showcase the $\textit{significant}$ superiority of the proposed method, achieving a maximum PSNR improvement of 2.1 dB over state-of-the-art methods, while also greatly enhancing visual perceptual quality.

In this work, we explore pre-training world models for heterogeneous environments by addressing key transfer barriers in both data diversity and model flexibility. We introduce UniTraj, a unified dataset comprising over one million trajectories from 80 environments, designed to scale data while preserving critical diversity. Additionally, we propose TrajWorld, a novel architecture capable of flexibly handling varying sensor and actuator information and capturing environment dynamics in-context. Pre-training TrajWorld on UniTraj yields substantial gains in transition prediction, achieves a new state-of-the-art for off-policy evaluation, and also delivers superior online performance of model predictive control. To the best of our knowledge, this work, for the first time, demonstrates the transfer benefits of world models across heterogeneous and complex control environments.

| **[Aircraft Trajectory Dataset Augmentation in Latent Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07585v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aircraft trajectory modeling plays a crucial role in Air Traffic Management (ATM) and is important for various downstream tasks, including conflict detection and landing time prediction. Dataset augmentation through the addition of synthetically generated trajectory data is necessary to develop a more robust aircraft trajectory model and ensure that the trajectory dataset is sufficient and balanced. In this work, we propose a novel framework called ATRADA for aircraft trajectory dataset augmentation. In the proposed framework, a Transformer encoder learns the underlying patterns in the original trajectory dataset and converts each data point into a context vector in the learned latent space. The converted dataset in the latent space is projected into reduced dimensions using principal component analysis (PCA), and a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is applied to fit the probability distribution of the data points in the reduced-dimensional space. Finally, new samples are drawn from the fitted GMM, the dimension of the samples is reverted to the original dimension, and they are decoded with a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). Several experiments demonstrate that the framework effectively generates new, high-quality synthetic aircraft trajectory data, which were compared to the results of several baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Physics-informed Diffusion for Anomaly Detection in Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06999v1)** | 2025-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given trajectory data, a domain-specific study area, and a user-defined threshold, we aim to find anomalous trajectories indicative of possible GPS spoofing (e.g., fake trajectory). The problem is societally important to curb illegal activities in international waters, such as unauthorized fishing and illicit oil transfers. The problem is challenging due to advances in AI generated in deep fakes generation (e.g., additive noise, fake trajectories) and lack of adequate amount of labeled samples for ground-truth verification. Recent literature shows promising results for anomalous trajectory detection using generative models despite data sparsity. However, they do not consider fine-scale spatiotemporal dependencies and prior physical knowledge, resulting in higher false-positive rates. To address these limitations, we propose a physics-informed diffusion model that integrates kinematic constraints to identify trajectories that do not adhere to physical laws. Experimental results on real-world datasets in the maritime and urban domains show that the proposed framework results in higher prediction accuracy and lower estimation error rate for anomaly detection and trajectory generation methods, respectively. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/arunshar/Physics-Informed-Diffusion-Probabilistic-Model.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by the success of decoder-only models for language modeling, we propose DONUT, a Decoder-Only Network for Unrolling Trajectories. Different from existing encoder-decoder forecasting models, we encode historical trajectories and predict future trajectories with a single autoregressive model. This allows the model to make iterative predictions in a consistent manner, and ensures that the model is always provided with up-to-date information, enhancing the performance. Furthermore, inspired by multi-token prediction for language modeling, we introduce an 'overprediction' strategy that gives the network the auxiliary task of predicting trajectories at longer temporal horizons. This allows the model to better anticipate the future, and further improves the performance. With experiments, we demonstrate that our decoder-only approach outperforms the encoder-decoder baseline, and achieves new state-of-the-art results on the Argoverse 2 single-agent motion forecasting benchmark.</p></details> |  |

Our framework features a unified trajectory representation that encapsulates the kinematic models of both $SO(3)\times\mathbb{R}^3$ and $SE(3)$ pose representations. This encapsulation strategy allows users to use the same implementation of measurement-based factors for either choice of pose representation, which facilitates experimentation and comparison to achieve the best model for the ME task. In addition, unique to our framework, we derive the kinematic models with the closed-form temporal derivatives of the local variable of $SO(3)$ and $SE(3)$, which so far has only been approximated based on the Taylor expansion in the literature. Our experiments show that these kinematic models can improve the estimation accuracy in high-speed scenarios. All analytical Jacobians of the interpolated states with respect to the support states of the trajectory representation, as well as the motion prior factors, are also provided for accelerated Gauss-Newton (GN) optimization. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of the framework in various motion estimation tasks such as localization, calibration, and odometry, facilitating fast prototyping for ME researchers. We release the source code for the benefit of the community.

We call this the \textit{continuous inverse problem} and start by rigorously defining its solution. We then develop a framework where the solution can be constructed as a limit of solutions to appropriately designed \textit{discrete inverse problems}, so that convergence holds in $p$-variation. Our approach is based on calibrating the bounded variation paths whose limit defines the rough path `lift' of path $X$ to rough path ${\bf X}$ to the observed trajectory $y$. Moreover, we develop a general numerical algorithm for constructing the solution to the discrete inverse problem. The core idea of the algorithm is to use the signature representation of the path, iterating between the response and the control, each time correcting according to the required properties. We apply our framework to the case where the geometric $p$-rough path ${\bf X}$ is defined as the limit of piecewise linear paths in the $p$-variation topology. We express the discrete inverse problem for a fixed observation rate as a solution to a system of equations driven by piecewise linear paths and prove convergence to the solution of the continuous inverse problem for observation time $\delta\to 0$. Finally, we show that, in this context, the numerical algorithm for solving the discrete inverse problem simplifies to an iterative simultaneous update of the local gradients and we prove that it converges in $p$-variation uniformly with respect to $\delta$.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended updated version - 41 pages, 10 figures</p></details> |
| **[Generalized Trajectory Scoring for End-to-end Multimodal Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06664v1)** | 2025-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end multi-modal planning is a promising paradigm in autonomous driving, enabling decision-making with diverse trajectory candidates. A key component is a robust trajectory scorer capable of selecting the optimal trajectory from these candidates. While recent trajectory scorers focus on scoring either large sets of static trajectories or small sets of dynamically generated ones, both approaches face significant limitations in generalization. Static vocabularies provide effective coarse discretization but struggle to make fine-grained adaptation, while dynamic proposals offer detailed precision but fail to capture broader trajectory distributions. To overcome these challenges, we propose GTRS (Generalized Trajectory Scoring), a unified framework for end-to-end multi-modal planning that combines coarse and fine-grained trajectory evaluation. GTRS consists of three complementary innovations: (1) a diffusion-based trajectory generator that produces diverse fine-grained proposals; (2) a vocabulary generalization technique that trains a scorer on super-dense trajectory sets with dropout regularization, enabling its robust inference on smaller subsets; and (3) a sensor augmentation strategy that enhances out-of-domain generalization while incorporating refinement training for critical trajectory discrimination. As the winning solution of the Navsim v2 Challenge, GTRS demonstrates superior performance even with sub-optimal sensor inputs, approaching privileged methods that rely on ground-truth perception.

Relying on a single predicted path, as in regression-based approaches, usually does not explicitly assess the safety of the predicted trajectory. Selection-based methods address this by generating and scoring multiple trajectory candidates and predicting the safety score for each, but face optimization challenges in precisely selecting the best option from thousands of possibilities and distinguishing subtle but safety-critical differences, especially in rare or underrepresented scenarios. We propose DriveSuprim to overcome these challenges and advance the selection-based paradigm through a coarse-to-fine paradigm for progressive candidate filtering, a rotation-based augmentation method to improve robustness in out-of-distribution scenarios, and a self-distillation framework to stabilize training. DriveSuprim achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching 93.5% PDMS in NAVSIM v1 and 87.1% EPDMS in NAVSIM v2 without extra data, demonstrating superior safetycritical capabilities, including collision avoidance and compliance with rules, while maintaining high trajectory quality in various driving scenarios.</p></details> | 15 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Certified Human Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13778v2)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting human trajectories is essential for the safe operation of autonomous vehicles, yet current data-driven models often lack robustness in case of noisy inputs such as adversarial examples or imperfect observations. Although some trajectory prediction methods have been developed to provide empirical robustness, these methods are heuristic and do not offer guaranteed robustness. In this work, we propose a certification approach tailored for trajectory prediction that provides guaranteed robustness. To this end, we address the unique challenges associated with trajectory prediction, such as unbounded outputs and multi-modality. To mitigate the inherent performance drop through certification, we propose a diffusion-based trajectory denoiser and integrate it into our method. Moreover, we introduce new certified performance metrics to reliably measure the trajectory prediction performance. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the certified predictors and highlight their advantages over the non-certified ones.

| **[Reusing Trajectories in Policy Gradients Enables Fast Convergence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06178v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Policy gradient (PG) methods are a class of effective reinforcement learning algorithms, particularly when dealing with continuous control problems. These methods learn the parameters of parametric policies via stochastic gradient ascent, typically using on-policy trajectory data to estimate the policy gradient. However, such reliance on fresh data makes them sample-inefficient. Indeed, vanilla PG methods require $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ trajectories to reach an $\epsilon$-approximate stationary point. A common strategy to improve efficiency is to reuse off-policy information from past iterations, such as previous gradients or trajectories. While gradient reuse has received substantial theoretical attention, leading to improved rates of $O(\epsilon^{-3/2})$, the reuse of past trajectories remains largely unexplored from a theoretical perspective. In this work, we provide the first rigorous theoretical evidence that extensive reuse of past off-policy trajectories can significantly accelerate convergence in PG methods. We introduce a power mean correction to the multiple importance weighting estimator and propose RPG (Retrospective Policy Gradient), a PG algorithm that combines old and new trajectories for policy updates. Through a novel analysis, we show that, under established assumptions, RPG achieves a sample complexity of $\widetilde{O}(\epsilon^{-1})$, the best known rate in the literature. We further validate empirically our approach against PG methods with state-of-the-art rates.</p></details> |  |

To provide an optimized solution, we propose a cooperative trajectory optimization and task allocation framework leveraging unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs). This study integrates a Genetic Algorithm (GA) for efficient task allocation among multiple UAVs and UGVs, and employs an informed-RRT* (Rapidly-exploring Random Tree Star) algorithm for collision-free trajectory generation. Further optimization of task sequencing and path efficiency is conducted using Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES). Simulation experiments conducted in a realistic post-disaster environment demonstrate that our proposed approach significantly improves the overall efficiency of medical rescue operations compared to traditional strategies, showing substantial reductions in total mission completion time and traveled distance. Additionally, the cooperative utilization of UAVs and UGVs effectively balances their complementary advantages, highlighting the system' s scalability and practicality for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |

To address this limitation, we propose the Multidimensional Adaptive Coefficient (MAC), a plug-in module for flow and diffusion models that extends conventional unidimensional coefficients to multidimensional ones and enables inference trajectory-wise adaptation. MAC is trained via simulation-based feedback through adversarial refinement. Empirical results across diverse frameworks and datasets demonstrate that MAC enhances generative quality with high training efficiency. Consequently, our work offers a new perspective on inference trajectory optimality, encouraging future research to move beyond vector field design and to leverage training-efficient, simulation-based optimization.</p></details> | ICML 2025 Paper |

Specifically, we consider a single UAV with 3 degree-of-freedom dynamics tasked with delivering blood packages to multiple hospitals, each with a predefined time window and priority. Mission objectives are encoded using Signal Temporal Logic (STL), enabling the formal specification of spatial-temporal constraints. To ensure safety, city buildings are modeled as 3D convex obstacles, and obstacle avoidance is handled through a Convex Feasible Set (CFS) method. The entire planning problem-combining UAV dynamics, STL satisfaction, and collision avoidance-is formulated as a convex optimization problem that ensures tractability and can be solved efficiently using standard convex programming techniques. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method generates dynamically feasible, collision-free trajectories that satisfy temporal mission goals, providing a scalable and reliable approach for autonomous UAV-based medical logistics.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |

Multi-drone thermal screening systems offer promising solutions for fast, large-scale, and non-intrusive human temperature monitoring. However, trajectory planning for multiple drones in complex urban environments poses significant challenges, including collision avoidance, coverage efficiency, and constrained flight environments. In this study, we propose an enhanced trust region sequential convex optimization (TR-SCO) algorithm for optimal trajectory planning of multiple drones performing thermal screening tasks. Our improved algorithm integrates a refined convex optimization formulation within a trust region framework, effectively balancing trajectory smoothness, obstacle avoidance, altitude constraints, and maximum screening coverage. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves trajectory optimality and computational efficiency compared to conventional convex optimization methods. This research provides critical insights and practical contributions toward deploying efficient multi-drone systems for real-time thermal screening in urban areas.

| **[State-Covering Trajectory Stitching for Diffusion Planners](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00895v2)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based generative models are emerging as powerful tools for long-horizon planning in reinforcement learning (RL), particularly with offline datasets. However, their performance is fundamentally limited by the quality and diversity of training data. This often restricts their generalization to tasks outside their training distribution or longer planning horizons. To overcome this challenge, we propose State-Covering Trajectory Stitching (SCoTS), a novel reward-free trajectory augmentation method that incrementally stitches together short trajectory segments, systematically generating diverse and extended trajectories. SCoTS first learns a temporal distance-preserving latent representation that captures the underlying temporal structure of the environment, then iteratively stitches trajectory segments guided by directional exploration and novelty to effectively cover and expand this latent space. We demonstrate that SCoTS significantly improves the performance and generalization capabilities of diffusion planners on offline goal-conditioned benchmarks requiring stitching and long-horizon reasoning. Furthermore, augmented trajectories generated by SCoTS significantly improve the performance of widely used offline goal-conditioned RL algorithms across diverse environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Entropy: Modeling Game State Stability from Multimodality Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05810v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Complex interactions among agents present a significant challenge for autonomous driving in real-world scenarios. Recently, a promising approach has emerged, which formulates the interactions of agents as a level-k game framework. It effectively decouples agent policies by hierarchical game levels. However, this framework ignores both the varying driving complexities among agents and the dynamic changes in agent states across game levels, instead treating them uniformly. Consequently, redundant and error-prone computations are introduced into this framework. To tackle the issue, this paper proposes a metric, termed as Trajectory Entropy, to reveal the game status of agents within the level-k game framework. The key insight stems from recognizing the inherit relationship between agent policy uncertainty and the associated driving complexity. Specifically, Trajectory Entropy extracts statistical signals representing uncertainty from the multimodality trajectory prediction results of agents in the game. Then, the signal-to-noise ratio of this signal is utilized to quantify the game status of agents. Based on the proposed Trajectory Entropy, we refine the current level-k game framework through a simple gating mechanism, significantly improving overall accuracy while reducing computational costs. Our method is evaluated on the Waymo and nuPlan datasets, in terms of trajectory prediction, open-loop and closed-loop planning tasks. The results demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method, with precision improved by up to 19.89% for prediction and up to 16.48% for planning.</p></details> | 10 pages |

However, such static datasets often exhibit distribution bias, resulting in limited generalizability. To address this limitation, a straightforward solution is data augmentation (DA), which leverages generative models to enrich data distribution. Despite the promising results, current DA techniques focus solely on reconstructing future trajectories from given states, while ignoring the exploration of history transitions that reach them. This single-direction paradigm inevitably hinders the discovery of diverse behavior patterns, especially those leading to critical states that may have yielded high-reward outcomes. In this work, we introduce Bidirectional Trajectory Diffusion (BiTrajDiff), a novel DA framework for offline RL that models both future and history trajectories from any intermediate states. Specifically, we decompose the trajectory generation task into two independent yet complementary diffusion processes: one generating forward trajectories to predict future dynamics, and the other generating backward trajectories to trace essential history transitions.BiTrajDiff can efficiently leverage critical states as anchors to expand into potentially valuable yet underexplored regions of the state space, thereby facilitating dataset diversity. Extensive experiments on the D4RL benchmark suite demonstrate that BiTrajDiff achieves superior performance compared to other advanced DA methods across various offline RL backbones.</p></details> |  |

It is expected to be the next-gen video technology and a prevalent use case for 5G and beyond wireless communication. Considering that each user typically only watches a section of the volumetric video, known as the viewport, it is essential to have precise viewport prediction for optimal performance. However, research on this topic is still in its infancy. In the end, this paper presents and proposes a novel approach, named Saliency and Trajectory Viewport Prediction (STVP), which aims to improve the precision of viewport prediction in volumetric video streaming. The STVP extensively utilizes video saliency information and viewport trajectory. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study of viewport prediction in volumetric video streaming. In particular, we introduce a novel sampling method, Uniform Random Sampling (URS), to reduce computational complexity while still preserving video features in an efficient manner. Then we present a saliency detection technique that incorporates both spatial and temporal information for detecting static, dynamic geometric, and color salient regions. Finally, we intelligently fuse saliency and trajectory information to achieve more accurate viewport prediction. We conduct extensive simulations to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed viewport prediction methods using state-of-the-art volumetric video sequences. The experimental results show the superiority of the proposed method over existing schemes. The dataset and source code will be publicly accessible after acceptance.</p></details> |  |

Predicting dissection trajectories in ESD videos offers significant potential for enhancing surgical skill training and simplifying the learning process, yet this area remains underexplored. While imitation learning has shown promise in acquiring skills from expert demonstrations, challenges persist in handling uncertain future movements, learning geometric symmetries, and generalizing to diverse surgical scenarios. To address these, we introduce a novel approach: Implicit Diffusion Policy with Equivariant Representations for Imitation Learning (iDPOE). Our method models expert behavior through a joint state action distribution, capturing the stochastic nature of dissection trajectories and enabling robust visual representation learning across various endoscopic views. By incorporating a diffusion model into policy learning, iDPOE ensures efficient training and sampling, leading to more accurate predictions and better generalization. Additionally, we enhance the model's ability to generalize to geometric symmetries by embedding equivariance into the learning process. To address state mismatches, we develop a forward-process guided action inference strategy for conditional sampling. Using an ESD video dataset of nearly 2000 clips, experimental results show that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods, both explicit and implicit, in trajectory prediction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of imitation learning to surgical skill development for dissection trajectory prediction.</p></details> |  |

Training models to generate such manipulation trajectories requires a large and diverse collection of detailed manipulation demonstrations for various objects, which is nearly unfeasible to gather at scale. In this paper, we propose a framework that leverages large-scale ego- and exo-centric video datasets -- constructed globally with substantial effort -- of Exo-Ego4D to extract diverse manipulation trajectories at scale. From these extracted trajectories with the associated textual action description, we develop trajectory generation models based on visual and point cloud-based language models. In the recently proposed egocentric vision-based in-a-quality trajectory dataset of HOT3D, we confirmed that our models successfully generate valid object trajectories, establishing a training dataset and baseline models for the novel task of generating 6DoF manipulation trajectories from action descriptions in egocentric vision.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |

| **[Urban Visibility Hotspots: Quantifying Building Vertex Visibility from Connected Vehicle Trajectories using Spatial Indexing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03365v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective placement of Out-of-Home advertising and street furniture requires accurate identification of locations offering maximum visual exposure to target audiences, particularly vehicular traffic. Traditional site selection methods often rely on static traffic counts or subjective assessments. This research introduces a data-driven methodology to objectively quantify location visibility by analyzing large-scale connected vehicle trajectory data (sourced from Compass IoT) within urban environments. We model the dynamic driver field-of-view using a forward-projected visibility area for each vehicle position derived from interpolated trajectories. By integrating this with building vertex locations extracted from OpenStreetMap, we quantify the cumulative visual exposure, or ``visibility count'', for thousands of potential points of interest near roadways. The analysis reveals that visibility is highly concentrated, identifying specific ``visual hotspots'' that receive disproportionately high exposure compared to average locations. The core technical contribution involves the construction of a BallTree spatial index over building vertices. This enables highly efficient (O(logN) complexity) radius queries to determine which vertices fall within the viewing circles of millions of trajectory points across numerous trips, significantly outperforming brute-force geometric checks. Analysis reveals two key findings: 1) Visibility is highly concentrated, identifying distinct 'visual hotspots' receiving disproportionately high exposure compared to average locations. 2) The aggregated visibility counts across vertices conform to a Log-Normal distribution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Trajectory Stitching with Flow Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07802v2)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models have shown great promise as trajectory planners, given their affinity to modeling complex distributions and guidable inference process. Previous works have successfully applied these in the context of robotic manipulation but perform poorly when the required solution does not exist as a complete trajectory within the training set. We identify that this is a result of being unable to plan via stitching, and subsequently address the architectural and dataset choices needed to remedy this. On top of this, we propose a novel addition to the training and inference procedures to both stabilize and enhance these capabilities. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by generating plans with out of distribution boundary conditions and performing obstacle avoidance on the Franka Panda in simulation and on real hardware. In both of these tasks our method performs significantly better than the baselines and is able to avoid obstacles up to four times as large.</p></details> |  |
| **[TO-GATE: Clarifying Questions and Summarizing Responses with Trajectory Optimization for Eliciting Human Preference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02827v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) can effectively elicit human preferences through multi-turn dialogue. Complex tasks can be accomplished through iterative clarifying questions and final responses generated by an LLM acting as a questioner (STaR-GATE; Andukuri et al., 2024}). However, existing approaches based on self-taught reasoning struggle to identify optimal dialogue trajectories and avoid irrelevant questions to the tasks. To address this limitation, we propose TO-GATE, a novel framework that enhances question generation through trajectory optimization, which consists of two key components: a clarification resolver that generates optimal questioning trajectories, and a summarizer that ensures task-aligned final responses. The trajectory optimization enables the model to produce effective elicitation questions and summary responses tailored to specific tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that TO-GATE significantly outperforms baseline methods, achieving a 9.32% improvement on standard preference elicitation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Controllable Sequence Editing for Biological and Clinical Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03569v2)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conditional generation models for longitudinal sequences can generate new or modified trajectories given a conditioning input. While effective at generating entire sequences, these models typically lack control over the timing and scope of the edits. Most existing approaches either operate on univariate sequences or assume that the condition affects all variables and time steps. However, many scientific and clinical applications require more precise interventions, where a condition takes effect only after a specific time and influences only a subset of variables. We introduce CLEF, a controllable sequence editing model for conditional generation of immediate and delayed effects in multivariate longitudinal sequences. CLEF learns temporal concepts that encode how and when a condition alters future sequence evolution. These concepts allow CLEF to apply targeted edits to the affected time steps and variables while preserving the rest of the sequence. We evaluate CLEF on 6 datasets spanning cellular reprogramming and patient health trajectories, comparing against 9 state-of-the-art baselines. CLEF improves immediate sequence editing accuracy by up to 36.01% (MAE). Unlike prior models, CLEF enables one-step conditional generation at arbitrary future times, outperforming them in delayed sequence editing by up to 65.71% (MAE). We test CLEF under counterfactual inference assumptions and show up to 63.19% (MAE) improvement on zero-shot conditional generation of counterfactual trajectories. In a case study of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, CLEF identifies clinical interventions that generate realistic counterfactual trajectories shifted toward healthier outcomes.</p></details> |  |

The proposed method, Exploration-Boosted MC-PILCO (EB-MC-PILCO), leverages iLQR to generate informative, exploratory trajectories and initialize the policy, significantly reducing the number of required optimization steps. Experiments on the cart-pole task demonstrate that EB-MC-PILCO accelerates convergence compared to standard MC-PILCO, achieving up to $\bm{45.9\%}$ reduction in execution time when both methods solve the task in four trials. EB-MC-PILCO also maintains a $\bm{100\%}$ success rate across trials while solving the task faster, even in cases where MC-PILCO converges in fewer iterations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contrast & Compress: Learning Lightweight Embeddings for Short Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02571v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to retrieve semantically and directionally similar short-range trajectories with both accuracy and efficiency is foundational for downstream applications such as motion forecasting and autonomous navigation. However, prevailing approaches often depend on computationally intensive heuristics or latent anchor representations that lack interpretability and controllability. In this work, we propose a novel framework for learning fixed-dimensional embeddings for short trajectories by leveraging a Transformer encoder trained with a contrastive triplet loss that emphasize the importance of discriminative feature spaces for trajectory data. We analyze the influence of Cosine and FFT-based similarity metrics within the contrastive learning paradigm, with a focus on capturing the nuanced directional intent that characterizes short-term maneuvers. Our empirical evaluation on the Argoverse 2 dataset demonstrates that embeddings shaped by Cosine similarity objectives yield superior clustering of trajectories by both semantic and directional attributes, outperforming FFT-based baselines in retrieval tasks. Notably, we show that compact Transformer architectures, even with low-dimensional embeddings (e.g., 16 dimensions, but qualitatively down to 4), achieve a compelling balance between retrieval performance (minADE, minFDE) and computational overhead, aligning with the growing demand for scalable and interpretable motion priors in real-time systems. The resulting embeddings provide a compact, semantically meaningful, and efficient representation of trajectory data, offering a robust alternative to heuristic similarity measures and paving the way for more transparent and controllable motion forecasting pipelines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted for peer review</p></details> |
| **[3D Trajectory Reconstruction of Moving Points Based on Asynchronous Cameras](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00541v2)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photomechanics is a crucial branch of solid mechanics. The localization of point targets constitutes a fundamental problem in optical experimental mechanics, with extensive applications in various missions of UAVs. Localizing moving targets is crucial for analyzing their motion characteristics and dynamic properties. Reconstructing the trajectories of points from asynchronous cameras is a significant challenge. It encompasses two coupled sub-problems: trajectory reconstruction and camera synchronization. Present methods typically address only one of these sub-problems individually. This paper proposes a 3D trajectory reconstruction method for point targets based on asynchronous cameras, simultaneously solving both sub-problems. Firstly, we extend the trajectory intersection method to asynchronous cameras to resolve the limitation of traditional triangulation that requires camera synchronization. Secondly, we develop models for camera temporal information and target motion, based on imaging mechanisms and target dynamics characteristics. The parameters are optimized simultaneously to achieve trajectory reconstruction without accurate time parameters. Thirdly, we optimize the camera rotations alongside the camera time information and target motion parameters, using tighter and more continuous constraints on moving points. The reconstruction accuracy is significantly improved, especially when the camera rotations are inaccurate. Finally, the simulated and real-world experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and accuracy of the proposed method. The real-world results indicate that the proposed algorithm achieved a localization error of 112.95 m at an observation range of 15 ~ 20 km.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by Acta Mechanica Sinica</p></details> |

To address these issues, we present LAM SIMULATOR, a comprehensive framework designed for online exploration of agentic tasks with high-quality feedback. Our framework features a dynamic task query generator, an extensive collection of tools, and an interactive environment where Large Language Model (LLM) Agents can call tools and receive real-time feedback. This setup enables LLM Agents to explore and solve tasks autonomously, facilitating the discovery of multiple approaches to tackle any given task. The resulting action trajectory data are then used to create high-quality training datasets for LAMs. Our experiments on popular agentic benchmarks, ToolBench and CRMArena, highlight the effectiveness of LAM SIMULATOR: models trained with self-generated datasets using our framework achieve significant performance gains, up to a 49.3\% improvement over their original baselines. LAM SIMULATOR requires minimal human input during dataset creation, highlighting LAM SIMULATOR's efficiency and effectiveness in speeding up development of AI agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>LAM S...</summary><p>LAM Simulator framework for agentic data generation</p></details> |

However, existing trajectory-based methods primarily focus on individual object motion and struggle to capture multi-object interaction crucial in complex robotic manipulation. This limitation arises from multi-feature entanglement in overlapping regions, which leads to degraded visual fidelity. To address this, we present RoboMaster, a novel framework that models inter-object dynamics through a collaborative trajectory formulation. Unlike prior methods that decompose objects, our core is to decompose the interaction process into three sub-stages: pre-interaction, interaction, and post-interaction. Each stage is modeled using the feature of the dominant object, specifically the robotic arm in the pre- and post-interaction phases and the manipulated object during interaction, thereby mitigating the drawback of multi-object feature fusion present during interaction in prior work. To further ensure subject semantic consistency throughout the video, we incorporate appearance- and shape-aware latent representations for objects. Extensive experiments on the challenging Bridge V2 dataset, as well as in-the-wild evaluation, demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches, establishing new state-of-the-art performance in trajectory-controlled video generation for robotic manipulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://fuxiao0719.github.io/projects/robomaster/ Code: https://github.com/KwaiVGI/RoboMaster</p></details> |
| **[Online Competitive Information Gathering for Partially Observable Trajectory Games](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01927v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Game-theoretic agents must make plans that optimally gather information about their opponents. These problems are modeled by partially observable stochastic games (POSGs), but planning in fully continuous POSGs is intractable without heavy offline computation or assumptions on the order of belief maintained by each player. We formulate a finite history/horizon refinement of POSGs which admits competitive information gathering behavior in trajectory space, and through a series of approximations, we present an online method for computing rational trajectory plans in these games which leverages particle-based estimations of the joint state space and performs stochastic gradient play. We also provide the necessary adjustments required to deploy this method on individual agents. The method is tested in continuous pursuit-evasion and warehouse-pickup scenarios (alongside extensions to $N > 2$ players and to more complex environments with visual and physical obstacles), demonstrating evidence of active information gathering and outperforming passive competitors.</p></details> | Accepted at RSS 2025 |

This arises because users frequently do not fully understand their own needs, while systems require precise intent definitions. Current LLM-based agents cannot effectively distinguish between linguistically complete and contextually triggerable expressions, lacking frameworks for collaborative intent formation. We present STORM, a framework modeling asymmetric information dynamics through conversations between UserLLM (full internal access) and AgentLLM (observable behavior only). STORM produces annotated corpora capturing expression trajectories and latent cognitive transitions, enabling systematic analysis of collaborative understanding development. Our contributions include: (1) formalizing asymmetric information processing in dialogue systems; (2) modeling intent formation tracking collaborative understanding evolution; and (3) evaluation metrics measuring internal cognitive improvements alongside task performance. Experiments across four language models reveal that moderate uncertainty (40-60%) can outperform complete transparency in certain scenarios, with model-specific patterns suggesting reconsideration of optimal information completeness in human-AI collaboration. These findings contribute to understanding asymmetric reasoning dynamics and inform uncertainty-calibrated dialogue system design.</p></details> | <details><summary>43 pa...</summary><p>43 pages, 31 figures.

| **[Trajectory First: A Curriculum for Discovering Diverse Policies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01568v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Being able to solve a task in diverse ways makes agents more robust to task variations and less prone to local optima. In this context, constrained diversity optimization has emerged as a powerful reinforcement learning (RL) framework to train a diverse set of agents in parallel. However, existing constrained-diversity RL methods often under-explore in complex tasks such as robotic manipulation, leading to a lack in policy diversity. To improve diversity optimization in RL, we therefore propose a curriculum that first explores at the trajectory level before learning step-based policies. In our empirical evaluation, we provide novel insights into the shortcoming of skill-based diversity optimization, and demonstrate empirically that our curriculum improves the diversity of the learned skills.</p></details> |  |
| **[Camera Trajectory Generation: A Comprehensive Survey of Methods, Metrics, and Future Directions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00974v1)** | 2025-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Camera trajectory generation is a cornerstone in computer graphics, robotics, virtual reality, and cinematography, enabling seamless and adaptive camera movements that enhance visual storytelling and immersive experiences. Despite its growing prominence, the field lacks a systematic and unified survey that consolidates essential knowledge and advancements in this domain. This paper addresses this gap by providing the first comprehensive review of the field, covering from foundational definitions to advanced methodologies. We introduce the different approaches to camera representation and present an in-depth review of available camera trajectory generation models, starting with rule-based approaches and progressing through optimization-based techniques, machine learning advancements, and hybrid methods that integrate multiple strategies. Additionally, we gather and analyze the metrics and datasets commonly used for evaluating camera trajectory systems, offering insights into how these tools measure performance, aesthetic quality, and practical applicability. Finally, we highlight existing limitations, critical gaps in current research, and promising opportunities for investment and innovation in the field. This paper not only serves as a foundational resource for researchers entering the field but also paves the way for advancing adaptive, efficient, and creative camera trajectory systems across diverse applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Predicting Any Human Trajectory In Context](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00871v1)** | 2025-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting accurate future trajectories of pedestrians is essential for autonomous systems but remains a challenging task due to the need for adaptability in different environments and domains. A common approach involves collecting scenario-specific data and performing fine-tuning via backpropagation. However, this process is often impractical on edge devices due to constrained computational resources. To address this challenge, we introduce TrajICL, an In-Context Learning (ICL) framework for pedestrian trajectory prediction that enables rapid adaptation without fine-tuning on the scenario-specific data. We propose a spatio-temporal similarity-based example selection (STES) method that selects relevant examples from previously observed trajectories within the same scene by identifying similar motion patterns at corresponding locations. To further refine this selection, we introduce prediction-guided example selection (PG-ES), which selects examples based on both the past trajectory and the predicted future trajectory, rather than relying solely on the past trajectory. This approach allows the model to account for long-term dynamics when selecting examples. Finally, instead of relying on small real-world datasets with limited scenario diversity, we train our model on a large-scale synthetic dataset to enhance its prediction ability by leveraging in-context examples. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TrajICL achieves remarkable adaptation across both in-domain and cross-domain scenarios, outperforming even fine-tuned approaches across multiple public benchmarks. The code will be released at https://fujiry0.github.io/TrajICL-project-page.</p></details> |  |

This issue, often manifesting as hallucinations or unattributable reasoning processes, limits their applicability in complex reasoning scenarios. To address this, we propose Knowledge Graph-constrained Trajectory Reasoning Attribution and Chain Explanation Supervision (KG-TRACES), a novel framework that enhances the reasoning ability of LLMs through explicit supervision over reasoning paths and processes. KG-TRACES jointly supervises the model to: (1) predict symbolic relation paths, (2) predict full triple-level reasoning paths, and (3) generate attribution-aware reasoning processes grounded in the reasoning paths. At inference phase, the model adapts to both KG-available and KG-unavailable scenarios, retrieving reasoning paths from a KG when possible or predicting plausible reasoning paths with only intrinsic knowledge when not. This design enables the model to reason in an explainable and source-attributable pattern. Through extensive experiments on complex reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that KG-TRACES significantly outperforms existing SOTA: it improves Hits@1 by 1.6% and F1 by 4.7% on WebQSP, and achieves improvements of 4.8% in Hits@1 and 2.1% in F1 on CWQ. Moreover, we show its transferability to specialized domains such as medicine. By visualizing the intermediate steps of reasoning processes, we further show that the explicit supervision introduced by KG-TRACES leads to more stable and goal-directed reasoning processes, aligning closely with correct answers.

Numerous methods have been proposed to address specific problems within trajectory modeling. However, the heterogeneity of data and the diversity of trajectory tasks make effective and reliable trajectory modeling an important yet highly challenging endeavor, even for domain experts.

Building on \textit{UniEnv}, we introduce an agentic workflow designed for automatic trajectory modeling across various trajectory tasks and data. Furthermore, we introduce collaborative learning schema between LLM-based agents and small speciallized models, to enhance the performance of the whole framework effectively.

As time progresses, the amount of data fitted by the AD model expands, which helps to improve the AD model generalization substantially. However, such ever-expanding data is a double-edged sword for the AD model. Specifically, as the fitted data volume grows to exceed the the AD model's fitting capacities, the AD model is prone to under-fitting. To address this issue, we propose to use a pretrained Large Vision Models (LVMs) as backbone coupled with downstream perception head to understand AD semantic information. This design can not only surmount the aforementioned under-fitting problem due to LVMs' powerful fitting capabilities, but also enhance the perception generalization thanks to LVMs' vast and diverse training data. On the other hand, to mitigate vehicles' computational burden of training the perception head while running LVM backbone, we introduce a Posterior Optimization Trajectory (POT)-Guided optimization scheme (POTGui) to accelerate the convergence. Concretely, we propose a POT Generator (POTGen) to generate posterior (future) optimization direction in advance to guide the current optimization iteration, through which the model can generally converge within 10 epochs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method improves the performance by over 66.48\% and converges faster over 6 times, compared to the existing state-of-the-art approach.</p></details> | 7 pages |

Rule-based planners are efficient but lack generalization, while learning-based planners excel in generalization yet have limitations in real-time performance and interpretability. In long-tail scenarios, these challenges make planning particularly difficult. To leverage the strengths of both rule-based and learning-based planners, we proposed the Scenario-Aware Hybrid Planner (SAH-Drive) for closed-loop vehicle trajectory planning. Inspired by human driving behavior, SAH-Drive combines a lightweight rule-based planner and a comprehensive learning-based planner, utilizing a dual-timescale decision neuron to determine the final trajectory. To enhance the computational efficiency and robustness of the hybrid planner, we also employed a diffusion proposal number regulator and a trajectory fusion module. The experimental results show that the proposed method significantly improves the generalization capability of the planning system, achieving state-of-the-art performance in interPlan, while maintaining computational efficiency without incurring substantial additional runtime.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 8 figures, International Conference on Machine Learning</p></details> |

While open-source LMM agents have made significant advances in offline evaluation benchmarks, their performance still falls substantially short of human-level capabilities in more realistic online settings. A key bottleneck is the lack of diverse and large-scale trajectory-level datasets across various domains, which are expensive to collect. In this paper, we address this challenge by developing a scalable recipe to synthesize the largest and most diverse trajectory-level dataset to date, containing over 94K successful multimodal web trajectories, spanning 49K unique URLs, 720K screenshots, and 33M web elements. In particular, we leverage extensive web exploration and refinement to obtain diverse task intents. The average cost is 28 cents per successful trajectory, making it affordable to a wide range of users in the community. Leveraging this dataset, we train Explorer, a multimodal web agent, and demonstrate strong performance on both offline and online web agent benchmarks such as Mind2Web-Live, Multimodal-Mind2Web, and MiniWob++. Additionally, our experiments highlight data scaling as a key driver for improving web agent capabilities. We hope this study makes state-of-the-art LMM-based agent research at a larger scale more accessible.</p></details> | ACL 2025 (Findings) |

Modeling hand-object interaction priors holds significant potential to advance robotic and embodied AI systems in learning to operate effectively within the physical world. We introduce SIGHT, a novel task focused on generating realistic and physically plausible 3D hand-object interaction trajectories from a single image and a brief language-based task description. Prior work on hand-object trajectory generation typically relies on textual input that lacks explicit grounding to the target object, or assumes access to 3D object meshes, which are often considerably more difficult to obtain than 2D images. We propose SIGHT-Fusion, a novel diffusion-based image-text conditioned generative model that tackles this task by retrieving the most similar 3D object mesh from a database and enforcing geometric hand-object interaction constraints via a novel inference-time diffusion guidance. We benchmark our model on the HOI4D and H2O datasets, adapting relevant baselines for this novel task. Experiments demonstrate our superior performance in the diversity and quality of generated trajectories, as well as in hand-object interaction geometry metrics.</p></details> |  |

Current approaches tokenize videos using space-time patches, leading to excessive tokens and computational inefficiencies. The best token reduction strategies degrade performance and barely reduce the number of tokens when the camera moves. We introduce grounded video tokenization, a paradigm that organizes tokens based on panoptic sub-object trajectories rather than fixed patches. Our method aligns with fundamental perceptual principles, ensuring that tokenization reflects scene complexity rather than video duration. We propose TrajViT, a video encoder that extracts object trajectories and converts them into semantically meaningful tokens, significantly reducing redundancy while maintaining temporal coherence. Trained with contrastive learning, TrajViT significantly outperforms space-time ViT (ViT3D) across multiple video understanding benchmarks, e.g., TrajViT outperforms ViT3D by a large margin of 6% top-5 recall in average at video-text retrieval task with 10x token deduction. We also show TrajViT as a stronger model than ViT3D for being the video encoder for modern VideoLLM, obtaining an average of 5.2% performance improvement across 6 VideoQA benchmarks while having 4x faster training time and 18x less inference FLOPs. TrajViT is the first efficient encoder to consistently outperform ViT3D across diverse video analysis tasks, making it a robust and scalable solution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Autoregressive Meta-Actions for Unified Controllable Trajectory Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23612v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Controllable trajectory generation guided by high-level semantic decisions, termed meta-actions, is crucial for autonomous driving systems. A significant limitation of existing frameworks is their reliance on invariant meta-actions assigned over fixed future time intervals, causing temporal misalignment with the actual behavior trajectories. This misalignment leads to irrelevant associations between the prescribed meta-actions and the resulting trajectories, disrupting task coherence and limiting model performance. To address this challenge, we introduce Autoregressive Meta-Actions, an approach integrated into autoregressive trajectory generation frameworks that provides a unified and precise definition for meta-action-conditioned trajectory prediction. Specifically, We decompose traditional long-interval meta-actions into frame-level meta-actions, enabling a sequential interplay between autoregressive meta-action prediction and meta-action-conditioned trajectory generation. This decomposition ensures strict alignment between each trajectory segment and its corresponding meta-action, achieving a consistent and unified task formulation across the entire trajectory span and significantly reducing complexity. Moreover, we propose a staged pre-training process to decouple the learning of basic motion dynamics from the integration of high-level decision control, which offers flexibility, stability, and modularity. Experimental results validate our framework's effectiveness, demonstrating improved trajectory adaptivity and responsiveness to dynamic decision-making scenarios.

Existing work primarily focuses on behavior cloning from expert demonstrations or preference learning through exploratory trajectory sampling. However, these methods often struggle to address long-horizon tasks, where suboptimal actions accumulate step by step, causing agents to deviate from correct task trajectories. To address this, we highlight the importance of timely calibration and the need to automatically construct calibration trajectories for training agents. We propose Step-Level Trajectory Calibration (STeCa), a novel framework for LLM agent learning. Specifically, STeCa identifies suboptimal actions through a step-level reward comparison during exploration. It constructs calibrated trajectories using LLM-driven reflection, enabling agents to learn from improved decision-making processes. We finally leverage these calibrated trajectories with successful trajectories for reinforced training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STeCa significantly outperforms existing methods. Further analysis highlights that timely calibration enables agents to complete tasks with greater robustness.

We propose a centroidal online trajectory generation and stabilization control for humanoid dynamic multi-contact motion. The proposed method features the drastic reduction of the computational cost by using preview control instead of the conventional model predictive control that considers the constraints of all sample times. By combining preview control with centroidal state feedback for robustness to disturbances and wrench distribution for satisfying contact constraints, we show that the robot can stably perform a variety of multi-contact motions through simulation experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[TRACE: Trajectory-Constrained Concept Erasure in Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23312v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image diffusion models have shown unprecedented generative capability, but their ability to produce undesirable concepts (e.g.~pornographic content, sensitive identities, copyrighted styles) poses serious concerns for privacy, fairness, and safety. {Concept erasure} aims to remove or suppress specific concept information in a generative model. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{TRACE (Trajectory-Constrained Attentional Concept Erasure)}, a novel method to erase targeted concepts from diffusion models while preserving overall generative quality. Our approach combines a rigorous theoretical framework, establishing formal conditions under which a concept can be provably suppressed in the diffusion process, with an effective fine-tuning procedure compatible with both conventional latent diffusion (Stable Diffusion) and emerging rectified flow models (e.g.~FLUX). We first derive a closed-form update to the model's cross-attention layers that removes hidden representations of the target concept. We then introduce a trajectory-aware finetuning objective that steers the denoising process away from the concept only in the late sampling stages, thus maintaining the model's fidelity on unrelated content. Empirically, we evaluate TRACE on multiple benchmarks used in prior concept erasure studies (object classes, celebrity faces, artistic styles, and explicit content from the I2P dataset). TRACE achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming recent methods such as ANT, EraseAnything, and MACE in terms of removal efficacy and output quality.</p></details> | In peer review |
| **[Universal Trajectory Optimization Framework for Differential Drive Robot Class](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07924v3)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differential drive robots are widely used in various scenarios thanks to their straightforward principle, from household service robots to disaster response field robots. There are several types of driving mechanisms for real-world applications, including two-wheeled, four-wheeled skid-steering, tracked robots, and so on. The differences in the driving mechanisms usually require specific kinematic modeling when precise control is desired. Furthermore, the nonholonomic dynamics and possible lateral slip lead to different degrees of difficulty in getting feasible and high-quality trajectories. Therefore, a comprehensive trajectory optimization framework to compute trajectories efficiently for various kinds of differential drive robots is highly desirable. In this paper, we propose a universal trajectory optimization framework that can be applied to differential drive robots, enabling the generation of high-quality trajectories within a restricted computational timeframe. We introduce a novel trajectory representation based on polynomial parameterization of motion states or their integrals, such as angular and linear velocities, which inherently matches the robots' motion to the control principle. The trajectory optimization problem is formulated to minimize complexity while prioritizing safety and operational efficiency. We then build a full-stack autonomous planning and control system to demonstrate its feasibility and robustness. We conduct extensive simulations and real-world testing in crowded environments with three kinds of differential drive robots to validate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | 15 pages, 16 figures |
| **[Trajectory Generator Matching for Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23215v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately modeling time-continuous stochastic processes from irregular observations remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we leverage ideas from generative modeling of image data to push the boundary of time series generation. For this, we find new generators of SDEs and jump processes, inspired by trajectory flow matching, that have the marginal distributions of the time series of interest. Specifically, we can handle discontinuities of the underlying processes by parameterizing the jump kernel densities by scaled Gaussians that allow for closed form formulas of the corresponding Kullback-Leibler divergence in the loss. Unlike most other approaches, we are able to handle irregularly sampled time series.</p></details> |  |
| **[FlowAlign: Trajectory-Regularized, Inversion-Free Flow-based Image Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23145v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent inversion-free, flow-based image editing methods such as FlowEdit leverages a pre-trained noise-to-image flow model such as Stable Diffusion 3, enabling text-driven manipulation by solving an ordinary differential equation (ODE). While the lack of exact latent inversion is a core advantage of these methods, it often results in unstable editing trajectories and poor source consistency. To address this limitation, we propose FlowAlign, a novel inversion-free flow-based framework for consistent image editing with principled trajectory control. FlowAlign introduces a flow-matching loss as a regularization mechanism to promote smoother and more stable trajectories during the editing process. Notably, the flow-matching loss is shown to explicitly balance semantic alignment with the edit prompt and structural consistency with the source image along the trajectory. Furthermore, FlowAlign naturally supports reverse editing by simply reversing the ODE trajectory, highlighting the reversible and consistent nature of the transformation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlowAlign outperforms existing methods in both source preservation and editing controllability.</p></details> |  |
| **[ProDiff: Prototype-Guided Diffusion for Minimal Information Trajectory Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23048v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory data is crucial for various applications but often suffers from incompleteness due to device limitations and diverse collection scenarios. Existing imputation methods rely on sparse trajectory or travel information, such as velocity, to infer missing points. However, these approaches assume that sparse trajectories retain essential behavioral patterns, which place significant demands on data acquisition and overlook the potential of large-scale human trajectory embeddings. To address this, we propose ProDiff, a trajectory imputation framework that uses only two endpoints as minimal information. It integrates prototype learning to embed human movement patterns and a denoising diffusion probabilistic model for robust spatiotemporal reconstruction. Joint training with a tailored loss function ensures effective imputation. ProDiff outperforms state-of-the-art methods, improving accuracy by 6.28\% on FourSquare and 2.52\% on WuXi. Further analysis shows a 0.927 correlation between generated and real trajectories, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fast Trajectory-Independent Model-Based Reconstruction Algorithm for Multi-Dimensional Magnetic Particle Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22797v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Magnetic Particle Imaging (MPI) is a promising tomographic technique for visualizing the spatio-temporal distribution of superparamagnetic nanoparticles, with applications ranging from cancer detection to real-time cardiovascular monitoring. Traditional MPI reconstruction relies on either time-consuming calibration (measured system matrix) or model-based simulation of the forward operator. Recent developments have shown the applicability of Chebyshev polynomials to multi-dimensional Lissajous Field-Free Point (FFP) scans. This method is bound to the particular choice of sinusoidal scanning trajectories. In this paper, we present the first reconstruction on real 2D MPI data with a trajectory-independent model-based MPI reconstruction algorithm. We further develop the zero-shot Plug-and-Play (PnP) algorithm of the authors -- with automatic noise level estimation -- to address the present deconvolution problem, leveraging a state-of-the-art denoiser trained on natural images without retraining on MPI-specific data. We evaluate our method on the publicly available 2D FFP MPI dataset ``MPIdata: Equilibrium Model with Anisotropy", featuring scans of six phantoms acquired using a Bruker preclinical scanner. Moreover, we show reconstruction performed on custom data on a 2D scanner with additional high-frequency excitation field and partial data. Our results demonstrate strong reconstruction capabilities across different scanning scenarios -- setting a precedent for general-purpose, flexible model-based MPI reconstruction.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures.

| **[Nonlinear second-order dynamics describe labial constriction trajectories across languages and contexts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08351v3)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the dynamics of labial constriction trajectories during the production of /b/ and /m/ in English and Mandarin. We find that, across languages and contexts, the ratio of instantaneous displacement to instantaneous velocity generally follows an exponential decay curve from movement onset to movement offset. We formalize this empirical discovery in a differential equation and, in combination with an assumption of point attractor dynamics, derive a nonlinear second-order dynamical system describing labial constriction trajectories. The equation has only two parameters, T and r. T corresponds to the target state and r corresponds to movement rapidity. Thus, each of the parameters corresponds to a phonetically relevant dimension of control. Nonlinear regression demonstrates that the model provides excellent fits to individual movement trajectories. Moreover, trajectories simulated from the model qualitatively match empirical trajectories, and capture key kinematic variables like duration, peak velocity, and time to achieve peak velocity. The model constitutes a proposal for the dynamics of individual articulatory movements, and thus offers a novel foundation from which to understand additional influences on articulatory kinematics like prosody, inter-movement coordination, and stochastic noise.</p></details> |  |

However, this approach remains primarily acoustic and lacks articulatory constraints. In this study, the same 75 VCVs are analyzed, but generated with the Maeda model, using trajectory planning that differentiates vowel-to-vowel transitions from consonantal influences. Synthetic data exhibit similar characteristics to Ohman's sequences, including the presence of S-shaped F2 trajectories. Furthermore, locus equations (LEs) for F2 and F3 are computed from synthetic CV data to investigate their underlying determinism, leading to a reassessment of conventional interpretations. The findings indicate that, although articulatory planning is structured separately for vowel and consonant groups, S-shaped F2 trajectories emerge from a composite mechanism governed by the coordinated synergy of all articulators.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 4 figures, submitted to Interspeech 2025</p></details> |
| **[Addressing and Visualizing Misalignments in Human Task-Solving Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14191v4)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding misalignments in human task-solving trajectories is crucial for enhancing AI models trained to closely mimic human reasoning. This study categorizes such misalignments into three types: (1) lack of functions to express intent, (2) inefficient action sequences, and (3) incorrect intentions that cannot solve the task. To address these issues, we first formalize and define these three misalignment types in a unified framework. We then propose a heuristic algorithm to detect misalignments in ARCTraj trajectories and analyze their impact hierarchically and quantitatively. We also present an intention estimation method based on our formalism that infers missing alignment between user actions and intentions. Through trajectory alignment, we experimentally demonstrate that AI models trained on human task-solving trajectories improve performance in mimicking human reasoning. Based on hierarchical analysis and experiments, we highlight the importance of trajectory-intention alignment and demonstrate the effectiveness of intention-aligned training.</p></details> | KDD 2025 accepted |
| **[Risk-Informed Diffusion Transformer for Long-Tail Trajectory Prediction in the Crash Scenario](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16349v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction methods have been widely applied in autonomous driving technologies. Although the overall performance accuracy of trajectory prediction is relatively high, the lack of trajectory data in critical scenarios in the training data leads to the long-tail phenomenon. Normally, the trajectories of the tail data are more critical and more difficult to predict and may include rare scenarios such as crashes. To solve this problem, we extracted the trajectory data from real-world crash scenarios, which contain more long-tail data. Meanwhile, based on the trajectory data in this scenario, we integrated graph-based risk information and diffusion with transformer and proposed the Risk-Informed Diffusion Transformer (RI-DiT) trajectory prediction method. Extensive experiments were conducted on trajectory data in the real-world crash scenario, and the results show that the algorithm we proposed has good performance. When predicting the data of the tail 10\% (Top 10\%), the minADE and minFDE indicators are 0.016/2.667 m. At the same time, we showed the trajectory conditions of different long-tail distributions. The distribution of trajectory data is closer to the tail, the less smooth the trajectory is. Through the trajectory data in real-world crash scenarios, Our work expands the methods to overcome the long-tail challenges in trajectory prediction. Our method, RI-DiT, integrates inverse time to collision (ITTC) and the feature of traffic flow, which can predict long-tail trajectories more accurately and improve the safety of autonomous driving systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[CoMaPOI: A Collaborative Multi-Agent Framework for Next POI Prediction Bridging the Gap Between Trajectory and Language](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23837v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for the next Point-Of-Interest (POI) prediction task, leveraging their capabilities in semantic understanding of POI trajectories. However, previous LLM-based methods, which are superficially adapted to next POI prediction, largely overlook critical challenges associated with applying LLMs to this task. Specifically, LLMs encounter two critical challenges: (1) a lack of intrinsic understanding of numeric spatiotemporal data, which hinders accurate modeling of users' spatiotemporal distributions and preferences; and (2) an excessively large and unconstrained candidate POI space, which often results in random or irrelevant predictions. To address these issues, we propose a Collaborative Multi Agent Framework for Next POI Prediction, named CoMaPOI. Through the close interaction of three specialized agents (Profiler, Forecaster, and Predictor), CoMaPOI collaboratively addresses the two critical challenges. The Profiler agent is responsible for converting numeric data into language descriptions, enhancing semantic understanding. The Forecaster agent focuses on dynamically constraining and refining the candidate POI space. The Predictor agent integrates this information to generate high-precision predictions. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets (NYC, TKY, and CA) demonstrate that CoMaPOI achieves state of the art performance, improving all metrics by 5% to 10% compared to SOTA baselines. This work pioneers the investigation of challenges associated with applying LLMs to complex spatiotemporal tasks by leveraging tailored collaborative agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by SIGIR 2025</p></details> |

By employing quantum concepts and a quantum search algorithm, this work presents the implementation and optimization of the agent-environment interactions entirely within the quantum domain, eliminating reliance on classical computations. Key contributions include the quantum-based state transitions, return calculation, and trajectory search mechanism that utilize quantum principles to demonstrate the realization of RL processes through quantum phenomena. The implementation emphasizes the fundamental role of quantum superposition in enhancing computational efficiency for RL tasks. Results demonstrate the capacity of a quantum model to achieve quantum enhancement in RL, highlighting the potential of fully quantum implementations in decision-making tasks. This work not only underscores the applicability of quantum computing in machine learning but also contributes to the field of quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) by offering a robust framework for understanding and exploiting quantum computing in RL systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Latent Weight Diffusion: Generating reactive policies instead of trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14040v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing availability of open-source robotic data, imitation learning has emerged as a viable approach for both robot manipulation and locomotion. Currently, large generalized policies are trained to predict controls or trajectories using diffusion models, which have the desirable property of learning multimodal action distributions. However, generalizability comes with a cost, namely, larger model size and slower inference. This is especially an issue for robotic tasks that require high control frequency. Further, there is a known trade-off between performance and action horizon for Diffusion Policy (DP), a popular model for generating trajectories: fewer diffusion queries accumulate greater trajectory tracking errors. For these reasons, it is common practice to run these models at high inference frequency, subject to robot computational constraints. To address these limitations, we propose Latent Weight Diffusion (LWD), a method that uses diffusion to generate closed-loop policies (weights for neural policies) for robotic tasks, rather than generating trajectories. Learning the behavior distribution through parameter space over trajectory space offers two key advantages: longer action horizons (fewer diffusion queries) & robustness to perturbations while retaining high performance; and a lower inference compute cost. To this end, we show that LWD has higher success rates than DP when the action horizon is longer and when stochastic perturbations exist in the environment. Furthermore, LWD achieves multitask performance comparable to DP while requiring just ~1/45th of the inference-time FLOPS</p></details> |  |
| **[Streaming Flow Policy: Simplifying diffusion$/$flow-matching policies by treating action trajectories as flow trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21851v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in diffusion$/$flow-matching policies have enabled imitation learning of complex, multi-modal action trajectories. However, they are computationally expensive because they sample a trajectory of trajectories: a diffusion$/$flow trajectory of action trajectories. They discard intermediate action trajectories, and must wait for the sampling process to complete before any actions can be executed on the robot. We simplify diffusion$/$flow policies by treating action trajectories as flow trajectories. Instead of starting from pure noise, our algorithm samples from a narrow Gaussian around the last action. Then, it incrementally integrates a velocity field learned via flow matching to produce a sequence of actions that constitute a single trajectory. This enables actions to be streamed to the robot on-the-fly during the flow sampling process, and is well-suited for receding horizon policy execution. Despite streaming, our method retains the ability to model multi-modal behavior. We train flows that stabilize around demonstration trajectories to reduce distribution shift and improve imitation learning performance. Streaming flow policy outperforms prior methods while enabling faster policy execution and tighter sensorimotor loops for learning-based robot control.

However, existing learning-based planning methods often rely on expert demonstrations, which not only lack explicit safety awareness but also risk inheriting unsafe behaviors such as speeding from suboptimal human driving data. Inspired by the success of large language models, we propose Plan-R1, a novel two-stage trajectory planning framework that formulates trajectory planning as a sequential prediction task, guided by explicit planning principles such as safety, comfort, and traffic rule compliance. In the first stage, we train an autoregressive trajectory predictor via next motion token prediction on expert data. In the second stage, we design rule-based rewards (e.g., collision avoidance, speed limits) and fine-tune the model using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a reinforcement learning strategy, to align its predictions with these planning principles. Experiments on the nuPlan benchmark demonstrate that our Plan-R1 significantly improves planning safety and feasibility, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Our code will be made public soon.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose IKMo, an image-keyframed motion generation method based on the diffusion model with trajectory and pose being decoupled. The trajectory and pose inputs go through a two-stage conditioning framework. In the first stage, the dedicated optimization module is applied to refine inputs. In the second stage, trajectory and pose are encoded via a Trajectory Encoder and a Pose Encoder in parallel. Then, motion with high spatial and semantic fidelity is guided by a motion ControlNet, which processes the fused trajectory and pose data. Experiment results based on HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art on all metrics under trajectory-keyframe constraints. In addition, MLLM-based agents are implemented to pre-process model inputs. Given texts and keyframe images from users, the agents extract motion descriptions, keyframe poses, and trajectories as the optimized inputs into the motion generation model. We conducts a user study with 10 participants. The experiment results prove that the MLLM-based agents pre-processing makes generated motion more in line with users' expectation. We believe that the proposed method improves both the fidelity and controllability of motion generation by the diffusion model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamical ON-OFF Control with Trajectory Prediction for Multi-RIS Wireless Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20887v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have demonstrated an unparalleled ability to reconfigure wireless environments by dynamically controlling the phase, amplitude, and polarization of impinging waves. However, as nearly passive reflective metasurfaces, RISs may not distinguish between desired and interference signals, which can lead to severe spectrum pollution and even affect performance negatively. In particular, in large-scale networks, the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the receiving node can be degraded due to excessive interference reflected from the RIS. To overcome this fundamental limitation, we propose in this paper a trajectory prediction-based dynamical control algorithm (TPC) for anticipating RIS ON-OFF states sequence, integrating a long-short-term-memory (LSTM) scheme to predict user trajectories. In particular, through a codebook-based algorithm, the RIS controller adaptively coordinates the configuration of the RIS elements to maximize the received SINR. Our simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed TPC method over various system settings.</p></details> |  |

Existing OPE methods are ineffective for high-dimensional, long-horizon problems, due to exponential blow-ups in variance from importance weighting or compounding errors from learned dynamics models. To address these challenges, we propose STITCH-OPE, a model-based generative framework that leverages denoising diffusion for long-horizon OPE in high-dimensional state and action spaces. Starting with a diffusion model pre-trained on the behavior data, STITCH-OPE generates synthetic trajectories from the target policy by guiding the denoising process using the score function of the target policy. STITCH-OPE proposes two technical innovations that make it advantageous for OPE: (1) prevents over-regularization by subtracting the score of the behavior policy during guidance, and (2) generates long-horizon trajectories by stitching partial trajectories together end-to-end. We provide a theoretical guarantee that under mild assumptions, these modifications result in an exponential reduction in variance versus long-horizon trajectory diffusion. Experiments on the D4RL and OpenAI Gym benchmarks show substantial improvement in mean squared error, correlation, and regret metrics compared to state-of-the-art OPE methods.</p></details> |  |

To support interactive operations for better immersiveness, such as moving or editing objects, 3D scene inpainting methods are proposed to repair or complete the altered geometry. However, current approaches rely on lengthy and computationally intensive optimization, making them impractical for real-time or online applications. We propose InstaInpaint, a reference-based feed-forward framework that produces 3D-scene inpainting from a 2D inpainting proposal within 0.4 seconds. We develop a self-supervised masked-finetuning strategy to enable training of our custom large reconstruction model (LRM) on the large-scale dataset. Through extensive experiments, we analyze and identify several key designs that improve generalization, textural consistency, and geometric correctness. InstaInpaint achieves a 1000x speed-up from prior methods while maintaining a state-of-the-art performance across two standard benchmarks. Moreover, we show that InstaInpaint generalizes well to flexible downstream applications such as object insertion and multi-region inpainting.

To bridge this, we introduce Farseer, a novel and refined scaling law offering enhanced predictive accuracy across scales. By systematically constructing a model loss surface $L(N,D)$, Farseer achieves a significantly better fit to empirical data than prior laws (e.g., Chinchilla's law). Our methodology yields accurate, robust, and highly generalizable predictions, demonstrating excellent extrapolation capabilities, improving upon Chinchilla's law by reducing extrapolation error by 433\%. This allows for the reliable evaluation of competing training strategies across all $(N,D)$ settings, enabling conclusions from small-scale ablation studies to be confidently extrapolated to predict large-scale performance. Furthermore, Farseer provides new insights into optimal compute allocation, better reflecting the nuanced demands of modern LLM training. To validate our approach, we trained an extensive suite of approximately 1,000 LLMs across diverse scales and configurations, consuming roughly 3 million NVIDIA H100 GPU hours. We are comprehensively open-sourcing all models, data, results, and logs at https://github.com/Farseer-Scaling-Law/Farseer to foster further research.</p></details> | 34 |

However, a key challenge in LLM unlearning is unintended forgetting, where the removal of specific data inadvertently impairs the utility of the model and its retention of valuable, desired information. While prior work has primarily focused on architectural innovations, the influence of data-level factors on unlearning performance remains underexplored. As a result, existing methods often suffer from degraded retention when forgetting high-impact data. To address this, we propose GUARD-a novel framework for Guided Unlearning And Retention via Data attribution. At its core, GUARD introduces a lightweight proxy data attribution metric tailored for LLM unlearning, which quantifies the "alignment" between the forget and retain sets while remaining computationally efficient. Building on this, we design a novel unlearning objective that assigns adaptive, nonuniform unlearning weights to samples, inversely proportional to their proxy attribution scores. Through such a reallocation of unlearning power, GUARD mitigates unintended losses in retention. We provide rigorous theoretical guarantees that GUARD significantly enhances retention while maintaining forgetting metrics comparable to prior methods. Extensive experiments on the TOFU benchmark across multiple LLM architectures demonstrate that GUARD substantially improves utility preservation while ensuring effective unlearning. Notably, GUARD reduces utility sacrifice on the Retain Set by up to 194.92% in terms of Truth Ratio when forgetting 10% of the training data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Investigating the Relationship Between Physical Activity and Tailored Behavior Change Messaging: Connecting Contextual Bandit with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07275v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning approaches, such as contextual multi-armed bandit (cMAB) algorithms, offer a promising strategy to reduce sedentary behavior by delivering personalized interventions to encourage physical activity. However, cMAB algorithms typically require large participant samples to learn effectively and may overlook key psychological factors that are not explicitly encoded in the model. In this study, we propose a hybrid approach that combines cMAB for selecting intervention types with large language models (LLMs) to personalize message content. We evaluate four intervention types: behavioral self-monitoring, gain-framed, loss-framed, and social comparison, each delivered as a motivational message aimed at increasing motivation for physical activity and daily step count. Message content is further personalized using dynamic contextual factors including daily fluctuations in self-efficacy, social influence, and regulatory focus. Over a seven-day trial, participants receive daily messages assigned by one of four models: cMAB alone, LLM alone, combined cMAB with LLM personalization (cMABxLLM), or equal randomization (RCT). Outcomes include daily step count and message acceptance, assessed via ecological momentary assessments (EMAs). We apply a causal inference framework to evaluate the effects of each model. Our findings offer new insights into the complementary roles of LLM-based personalization and cMAB adaptation in promoting physical activity through personalized behavioral messaging.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose the weak-to-strong jailbreaking attack, an efficient inference time attack for aligned LLMs to produce harmful text. Our key intuition is based on the observation that jailbroken and aligned models only differ in their initial decoding distributions. The weak-to-strong attack's key technical insight is using two smaller models (a safe and an unsafe one) to adversarially modify a significantly larger safe model's decoding probabilities. We evaluate the weak-to-strong attack on 5 diverse open-source LLMs from 3 organizations. The results show our method can increase the misalignment rate to over 99% on two datasets with just one forward pass per example. Our study exposes an urgent safety issue that needs to be addressed when aligning LLMs. As an initial attempt, we propose a defense strategy to protect against such attacks, but creating more advanced defenses remains challenging. The code for replicating the method is available at https://github.com/XuandongZhao/weak-to-strong</p></details> | ICML 2025 |

Scaling up these clusters is expensive and can become impractical, imposing limits on the size of models that can be trained. Several recent studies have proposed training methods that are less communication intensive, avoiding the need for a highly connected compute cluster. These state-of-the-art low communication training methods still employ a synchronization step for model parameters, which, when performed over all model replicas, can become costly on a low-bandwidth network. In this work, we propose a novel optimization method, NoLoCo, that does not explicitly synchronize all model parameters during training and, as a result, does not require any collective communication. NoLoCo implicitly synchronizes model weights via a novel variant of the Nesterov momentum optimizer by partially averaging model weights with a randomly selected other one. We provide both a theoretical convergence analysis for our proposed optimizer as well as empirical results from language model training. We benchmark NoLoCo on a wide range of accelerator counts and model sizes, between 125M to 6.8B parameters. Our method requires significantly less communication overhead than fully sharded data parallel training or even widely used low communication training method, DiLoCo. The synchronization step itself is estimated to be one magnitude faster than the all-reduce used in DiLoCo for few hundred accelerators training over the internet. We also do not have any global blocking communication that reduces accelerator idling time. Compared to DiLoCo, we also observe up to $4\%$ faster convergence rate with wide range of model sizes and accelerator counts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Models for Multilingual Previously Fact-Checked Claim Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02737v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In our era of widespread false information, human fact-checkers often face the challenge of duplicating efforts when verifying claims that may have already been addressed in other countries or languages. As false information transcends linguistic boundaries, the ability to automatically detect previously fact-checked claims across languages has become an increasingly important task. This paper presents the first comprehensive evaluation of large language models (LLMs) for multilingual previously fact-checked claim detection. We assess seven LLMs across 20 languages in both monolingual and cross-lingual settings. Our results show that while LLMs perform well for high-resource languages, they struggle with low-resource languages. Moreover, translating original texts into English proved to be beneficial for low-resource languages. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs for multilingual previously fact-checked claim detection and provide a foundation for further research on this promising application of LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Breaking Distortion-free Watermarks in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18608v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, LLM watermarking has emerged as an attractive safeguard against AI-generated content, with promising applications in many real-world domains. However, there are growing concerns that the current LLM watermarking schemes are vulnerable to expert adversaries wishing to reverse-engineer the watermarking mechanisms. Prior work in breaking or stealing LLM watermarks mainly focuses on the distribution-modifying algorithm of Kirchenbauer et al. (2023), which perturbs the logit vector before sampling. In this work, we focus on reverse-engineering the other prominent LLM watermarking scheme, distortion-free watermarking (Kuditipudi et al. 2024), which preserves the underlying token distribution by using a hidden watermarking key sequence. We demonstrate that, even under a more sophisticated watermarking scheme, it is possible to compromise the LLM and carry out a spoofing attack, i.e. generate a large number of (potentially harmful) texts that can be attributed to the original watermarked LLM. Specifically, we propose using adaptive prompting and a sorting-based algorithm to accurately recover the underlying secret key for watermarking the LLM. Our empirical findings on LLAMA-3.1-8B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct, Gemma-7b, and OPT-125M challenge the current theoretical claims on the robustness and usability of the distortion-free watermarking techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables, earlier version presented at AAAI'25 Workshop on Preventing and Detecting LLM Generated Misinformation</p></details> |
| **[A Study on Individual Spatiotemporal Activity Generation Method Using MCP-Enhanced Chain-of-Thought Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10853v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human spatiotemporal behavior simulation is critical for urban planning research, yet traditional rule-based and statistical approaches suffer from high computational costs, limited generalizability, and poor scalability. While large language models (LLMs) show promise as "world simulators," they face challenges in spatiotemporal reasoning including limited spatial cognition, lack of physical constraint understanding, and group homogenization tendencies. This paper introduces a framework integrating chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning with Model Context Protocol (MCP) to enhance LLMs' capability in simulating spatiotemporal behaviors that correspond with validation data patterns. The methodology combines human-like progressive reasoning through a five-stage cognitive framework with comprehensive data processing via six specialized MCP tool categories: temporal management, spatial navigation, environmental perception, personal memory, social collaboration, and experience evaluation. Experiments in Shanghai's Lujiazui district validate the framework's effectiveness across 1,000 generated samples. Results demonstrate high similarity with real mobile signaling data, achieving generation quality scores of 7.86 to 8.36 across different base models. Parallel processing experiments show efficiency improvements, with generation times decreasing from 1.30 to 0.17 minutes per sample when scaling from 2 to 12 processes. This work contributes to integrating CoT reasoning with MCP for urban behavior modeling, advancing LLMs applications in urban computing and providing a practical approach for synthetic mobility data generation. The framework offers a foundation for smart city planning, transportation forecasting, and participatory urban design applications.</p></details> |  |

We present the first comprehensive benchmark, which we name `Software Engineering Language Understanding' (SELU), for evaluating LLMs on 17 non-code tasks, spanning from identifying whether a requirement is functional or non-functional to estimating the effort and complexity of backlog items. SELU covers classification, regression, Named Entity Recognition (NER), and Masked Language Modeling (MLM) targets, with data drawn from diverse sources such as code repositories, issue tracking systems, and developer forums. We fine-tune 22 open-source LLMs, prompt two proprietary alternatives, and train two baselines. Performance is measured using metrics such as F1-macro, SMAPE, F1-micro, and accuracy, and compared via the Bayesian signed-rank test. Our results show that moderate-scale decoder-only models consistently form a top-tier, exhibiting high mean performance and low across-task variance, while domain adaptation via code-focused pre-training might yield only modest improvements. These insights guide model selection for non-code SE workflows and highlight directions for expanding SELU to generative and design-oriented scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Joint Beamforming with Extremely Large Scale RIS: A Sequential Multi-Agent A2C Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10815v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is a challenging problem to jointly optimize the base station (BS) precoding matrix and the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) phases simultaneously in a RIS-assisted multiple-user multiple-input-multiple-output (MU-MIMO) scenario when the size of the RIS becomes extremely large. In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning algorithm called sequential multi-agent advantage actor-critic (A2C) to solve this problem. In addition, the discrete phase of RISs, imperfect channel state information (CSI), and channel correlations between users are taken into consideration. The computational complexity is also analyzed, and the performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with the zero-forcing (ZF) beamformer in terms of the sum spectral efficiency (SE). It is noted that the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm is lower than the benchmark, while the performance is better than the benchmark. Throughout simulations, it is also found that the proposed algorithm is robust to medium channel estimation error.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces QuantMCP, a novel framework designed to rigorously ground LLMs in financial reality. By leveraging the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for standardized and secure tool invocation, QuantMCP enables LLMs to accurately interface with a diverse array of Python-accessible financial data APIs (e.g., Wind, yfinance). Users can interact via natural language to precisely retrieve up-to-date financial data, thereby overcoming LLM's inherent limitations in factual data recall. More critically, once furnished with this verified, structured data, the LLM's analytical capabilities are unlocked, empowering it to perform sophisticated data interpretation, generate insights, and ultimately support more informed financial decision-making processes. QuantMCP provides a robust, extensible, and secure bridge between conversational AI and the complex world of financial data, aiming to enhance both the reliability and the analytical depth of LLM applications in finance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Position: Theory of Mind Benchmarks are Broken for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19726v4)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Our paper argues that the majority of theory of mind benchmarks are broken because of their inability to directly test how large language models (LLMs) adapt to new partners. This problem stems from the fact that theory of mind benchmarks for LLMs are overwhelmingly inspired by the methods used to test theory of mind in humans and fall victim to a fallacy of attributing human-like qualities to AI agents. We expect that humans will engage in a consistent reasoning process across various questions about a situation, but this is known to not be the case for current LLMs. Most theory of mind benchmarks only measure what we call literal theory of mind: the ability to predict the behavior of others. However, this type of metric is only informative when agents exhibit self-consistent reasoning. Thus, we introduce the concept of functional theory of mind: the ability to adapt to agents in-context following a rational response to their behavior. We find that many open source LLMs are capable of displaying strong literal theory of mind capabilities, but seem to struggle with functional theory of mind -- even with exceedingly simple partner policies. Simply put, strong literal theory of mind performance does not necessarily imply strong functional theory of mind performance or vice versa. Achieving functional theory of mind, particularly over long interaction horizons with a partner, is a significant challenge deserving a prominent role in any meaningful LLM theory of mind evaluation.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |

However, how users perceive, evaluate, and critique these AI features remains largely unexplored, primarily due to the overwhelming volume of user feedback. In this work, we present the first comprehensive, large-scale study of user feedback on AI-powered mobile apps, leveraging a curated dataset of 292 AI-driven apps across 14 categories with 894K AI-specific reviews from Google Play. We develop and validate a multi-stage analysis pipeline that begins with a human-labeled benchmark and systematically evaluates large language models (LLMs) and prompting strategies. Each stage, including review classification, aspect-sentiment extraction, and clustering, is validated for accuracy and consistency. Our pipeline enables scalable, high-precision analysis of user feedback, extracting over one million aspect-sentiment pairs clustered into 18 positive and 15 negative user topics. Our analysis reveals that users consistently focus on a narrow set of themes: positive comments emphasize productivity, reliability, and personalized assistance, while negative feedback highlights technical failures (e.g., scanning and recognition), pricing concerns, and limitations in language support. Our pipeline surfaces both satisfaction with one feature and frustration with another within the same review. These fine-grained, co-occurring sentiments are often missed by traditional approaches that treat positive and negative feedback in isolation or rely on coarse-grained analysis. To this end, our approach provides a more faithful reflection of the real-world user experiences with AI-powered apps. Category-aware analysis further uncovers both universal drivers of satisfaction and domain-specific frustrations.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 6 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[Stroke-based Cyclic Amplifier: Image Super-Resolution at Arbitrary Ultra-Large Scales](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10774v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prior Arbitrary-Scale Image Super-Resolution (ASISR) methods often experience a significant performance decline when the upsampling factor exceeds the range covered by the training data, introducing substantial blurring. To address this issue, we propose a unified model, Stroke-based Cyclic Amplifier (SbCA), for ultra-large upsampling tasks. The key of SbCA is the stroke vector amplifier, which decomposes the image into a series of strokes represented as vector graphics for magnification. Then, the detail completion module also restores missing details, ensuring high-fidelity image reconstruction. Our cyclic strategy achieves ultra-large upsampling by iteratively refining details with this unified SbCA model, trained only once for all, while keeping sub-scales within the training range. Our approach effectively addresses the distribution drift issue and eliminates artifacts, noise and blurring, producing high-quality, high-resolution super-resolved images. Experimental validations on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in ultra-large upsampling tasks (e.g. $\times100$), delivering visual quality far superior to state-of-the-art techniques.</p></details> |  |

However, their proficiency in iteratively optimizing complex solutions through learning from previous feedback remains insufficiently explored. To bridge this gap, we present OPT-BENCH, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate LLM agents on large-scale search space optimization problems. OPT-BENCH includes 20 real-world machine learning tasks sourced from Kaggle and 10 classical NP problems, offering a diverse and challenging environment for assessing LLM agents on iterative reasoning and solution refinement. To enable rigorous evaluation, we introduce OPT-Agent, an end-to-end optimization framework that emulates human reasoning when tackling complex problems by generating, validating, and iteratively improving solutions through leveraging historical feedback. Through extensive experiments on 9 state-of-the-art LLMs from 6 model families, we analyze the effects of optimization iterations, temperature settings, and model architectures on solution quality and convergence. Our results demonstrate that incorporating historical context significantly enhances optimization performance across both ML and NP tasks. All datasets, code, and evaluation tools are open-sourced to promote further research in advancing LLM-driven optimization and iterative reasoning.

However, traditional animation workflows present significant usability barriers for non-professionals, with intricate operational procedures severely hindering creative productivity. To address this, we propose a Large Language Model (LLM)-aided text animation editing system that enables real-time intent tracking and flexible editing. The system introduces an agent-based dual-stream pipeline that integrates context-aware inline suggestions and conversational guidance as well as employs a semantic-animation mapping to facilitate LLM-driven creative intent translation. Besides, the system supports synchronized text-animation previews and parametric adjustments via unified controls to improve editing workflow. A user study evaluates the system, highlighting its ability to help non-professional users complete animation workflows while validating the pipeline. The findings encourage further exploration of integrating LLMs into a comprehensive video creation workflow.</p></details> |  |

To achieve this, we aim to connect a formal mathematical framework -- zigzag persistence from topological data analysis -- with practical and easily applicable algorithms. Zigzag persistence is particularly effective for characterizing data as it dynamically transforms across model layers. Within this framework, we introduce topological descriptors that measure how topological features, $p$-dimensional holes, persist and evolve throughout the layers. Unlike methods that assess each layer individually and then aggregate the results, our approach directly tracks the full evolutionary path of these features. This offers a statistical perspective on how prompts are rearranged and their relative positions changed in the representation space, providing insights into the system's operation as an integrated whole. To demonstrate the expressivity and applicability of our framework, we highlight how sensitive these descriptors are to different models and a variety of datasets. As a showcase application to a downstream task, we use zigzag persistence to establish a criterion for layer pruning, achieving results comparable to state-of-the-art methods while preserving the system-level perspective.</p></details> | <details><summary>10+6 ...</summary><p>10+6 pages, 7 figures, 1 table.

While existing APR techniques primarily target imperative programming languages like C and Java, there is a growing need for effective solutions applicable to declarative software specification languages. This paper systematically investigates the capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to repair declarative specifications in Alloy, a declarative formal language used for software specification. We designed 12 different repair settings, encompassing single-agent and dual-agent paradigms, utilizing various LLMs. These configurations also incorporate different levels of feedback, including an auto-prompting mechanism for generating prompts autonomously using LLMs. Our study reveals that dual-agent with auto-prompting setup outperforms the other settings, albeit with a marginal increase in the number of iterations and token usage. This dual-agent setup demonstrated superior effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art Alloy APR techniques when evaluated on a comprehensive set of benchmarks. This work is the first to empirically evaluate LLM capabilities to repair declarative specifications, while taking into account recent trending LLM concepts such as LLM-based agents, feedback, auto-prompting, and tools, thus paving the way for future agent-based techniques in software engineering.</p></details> |  |

This inflates token usage and cost, limiting deployment in latency-sensitive or API-constrained settings. We introduce PREMISE (PRompt-based Efficient Mathematical Inference with Strategic Evaluation), a prompt-only framework that reduces reasoning overhead without modifying model weights. PREMISE combines trace-level diagnostics with gradient-inspired prompt optimization to minimize redundant computation while preserving answer accuracy. The approach jointly optimizes brevity and correctness through a multi-objective textual search that balances token length and answer validity. Unlike prior work, PREMISE runs in a single-pass black-box interface, so it can be applied directly to commercial LLMs. On GSM8K, SVAMP, and Math500 we match or exceed baseline accuracy ($96\%\rightarrow96\%$ with Claude, $91\%\rightarrow92\%$ with Gemini) while reducing reasoning tokens by up to $87.5\%$ and cutting dollar cost by $69$--$82\%$. These results show that prompt-level optimization is a practical and scalable path to efficient LRM inference without compromising reasoning quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Incentivizing Reasoning for Advanced Instruction-Following of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01413v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing large language models (LLMs) face challenges of following complex instructions, especially when multiple constraints are present and organized in paralleling, chaining, and branching structures. One intuitive solution, namely chain-of-thought (CoT), is expected to universally improve capabilities of LLMs. However, we find that the vanilla CoT exerts a negative impact on performance due to its superficial reasoning pattern of simply paraphrasing the instructions. It fails to peel back the compositions of constraints for identifying their relationship across hierarchies of types and dimensions. To this end, we propose a systematic method to boost LLMs in dealing with complex instructions via incentivizing reasoning for test-time compute scaling. First, we stem from the decomposition of complex instructions under existing taxonomies and propose a reproducible data acquisition method. Second, we exploit reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rule-centric reward signals to cultivate reasoning specifically for instruction following. We address the shallow, non-essential nature of reasoning under complex instructions via sample-wise contrast for superior CoT enforcement. We also exploit behavior cloning of experts to facilitate steady distribution shift from fast-thinking LLMs to skillful reasoners. Extensive evaluations on seven comprehensive benchmarks confirm the validity of the proposed method, where a 1.5B LLM achieves 11.74% gains with performance comparable to a 8B LLM.

However, these individual LLMs show limitations in generalization and performance on complex tasks due to inherent training biases, model size constraints, and the quality or diversity of pre-training datasets. A promising direction is to efficiently harness the diverse capabilities of LLMs to overcome these individual limitations. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel LLM selection algorithm called SelectLLM, which efficiently directs input queries to the most suitable subset of LLMs from a large pool, ensuring that the selected models collectively provide accurate responses. SelectLLM employs a multi-label classifier and policy based on the classifier's predictions and confidence scores in selecting an optimal, query-aware, and lightweight subset of LLMs. Our findings indicate that the proposed model outperforms existing ensemble-based baselines and achieves competitive performance with similarly sized top-performing LLMs while maintaining efficiency. Specifically, it achieves a huge reduction in inference latency on two challenging reasoning benchmarks: 13\% on GSM8K and 70\% on MMLU, compared to the top-performing baseline. Also, we establish a theoretical upper bound by an Oracle with LLMs and perform an in-depth linguistic analysis to understand the performance gap between the Oracle and SelectLLM.</p></details> | 9 pages |

This paper presents an effective approach to identifying life-threatening texts using large language models (LLMs) and compares them with traditional methods such as bag of words, word embedding, topic modeling, and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. We fine-tune three open-source LLMs including Gemma, Mistral, and Llama-2 using their 7B parameter variants on different datasets, which are constructed with class balance, imbalance, and extreme imbalance scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate a strong performance of LLMs against traditional methods. More specifically, Mistral and Llama-2 models are top performers in both balanced and imbalanced data scenarios while Gemma is slightly behind. We employ the upsampling technique to deal with the imbalanced data scenarios and demonstrate that while this method benefits traditional approaches, it does not have as much impact on LLMs. This study demonstrates a great potential of LLMs for real-world life-threatening language detection problems.</p></details> |  |

Bridging the Gap Between Neural Activity and Self-Explanations in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09277v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLM) have demonstrated the capability of generating free text self Natural Language Explanation (self-NLE) to justify their answers. Despite their logical appearance, self-NLE do not necessarily reflect the LLM actual decision-making process, making such explanations unfaithful. While existing methods for measuring self-NLE faithfulness mostly rely on behavioral tests or computational block identification, none of them examines the neural activity underlying the model's reasoning. This work introduces a novel flexible framework for quantitatively measuring the faithfulness of LLM-generated self-NLE by directly comparing the latter with interpretations of the model's internal hidden states. The proposed framework is versatile and provides deep insights into self-NLE faithfulness by establishing a direct connection between self-NLE and model reasoning. This approach advances the understanding of self-NLE faithfulness and provides building blocks for generating more faithful self-NLE.</p></details> |  |

Although recent advancements have improved the performance of LLMs in general mathematical reasoning, their effectiveness within specialized domains, such as signal processing, network optimization, and performance analysis, remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce TeleMath, the first benchmark dataset specifically designed to evaluate LLM performance in solving mathematical problems with numerical solutions in the telecommunications domain. Comprising 500 question-answer (QnA) pairs, TeleMath covers a wide spectrum of topics in the telecommunications field. This paper outlines the proposed QnAs generation pipeline, starting from a selected seed of problems crafted by Subject Matter Experts. The evaluation of a wide range of open-source LLMs reveals that best performance on TeleMath is achieved by recent models explicitly designed for mathematical or logical reasoning. In contrast, general-purpose models, even those with a large number of parameters, often struggle with these challenges. We have released the dataset and the evaluation code to ease result reproducibility and support future research.</p></details> | 6 pages |

Our results provide valuable information for private and public groups wishing to deploy LLMs, allowing them to evaluate the performance of different models based on their available hardware. This study thus contributes to facilitating the adoption and use of these large language models in various application domains.</p></details> |  |

However, obtaining such information poses a significant challenge. To address this issue, we present a new diagnostic approach that operates with minimal prior knowledge, requiring only a basic understanding of subsystem relationships and data from nominal operations. Our method combines a neural network-based symptom generator, which employs subsystem-level anomaly detection, with a new graph diagnosis algorithm that leverages minimal causal relationship information between subsystems-information that is typically available in practice. Our experiments with fully controllable simulated datasets show that our method includes the true causal component in its diagnosis set for 82 p.c. of all cases while effectively reducing the search space in 73 p.c. of the scenarios. Additional tests on the real-world Secure Water Treatment dataset showcase the approach's potential for practical scenarios. Our results thus highlight our approach's potential for practical applications with large and complex cyber-physical systems where limited prior knowledge is available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inference-Time Decomposition of Activations (ITDA): A Scalable Approach to Interpreting Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17769v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are a popular method for decomposing Large Langage Models (LLM) activations into interpretable latents. However, due to their substantial training cost, most academic research uses open-source SAEs which are only available for a restricted set of models of up to 27B parameters. SAE latents are also learned from a dataset of activations, which means they do not transfer between models. Motivated by relative representation similarity measures, we introduce Inference-Time Decomposition of Activations (ITDA) models, an alternative method for decomposing language model activations. To train an ITDA, we greedily construct a dictionary of language model activations on a dataset of prompts, selecting those activations which were worst approximated by matching pursuit on the existing dictionary. ITDAs can be trained in just 1% of the time required for SAEs, using 1% of the data. This allowed us to train ITDAs on Llama-3.1 70B and 405B on a single consumer GPU. ITDAs can achieve similar reconstruction performance to SAEs on some target LLMs, but generally incur a performance penalty. However, ITDA dictionaries enable cross-model comparisons, and a simple Jaccard similarity index on ITDA dictionaries outperforms existing methods like CKA, SVCCA, and relative representation similarity metrics. ITDAs provide a cheap alternative to SAEs where computational resources are limited, or when cross model comparisons are necessary.

Guardrails--external defense mechanisms that monitor and control LLM interaction--have emerged as a promising solution. However, the current landscape of LLM guardrails is fragmented, lacking a unified taxonomy and comprehensive evaluation framework. In this Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) paper, we present the first holistic analysis of jailbreak guardrails for LLMs. We propose a novel, multi-dimensional taxonomy that categorizes guardrails along six key dimensions, and introduce a Security-Efficiency-Utility evaluation framework to assess their practical effectiveness. Through extensive analysis and experiments, we identify the strengths and limitations of existing guardrail approaches, explore their universality across attack types, and provide insights into optimizing defense combinations. Our work offers a structured foundation for future research and development, aiming to guide the principled advancement and deployment of robust LLM guardrails.

Despite recent advances in language technologies, including large language models, evaluating their ability to handle pragmatic phenomena such as implicatures and references remains challenging. To advance pragmatic abilities in models, it is essential to understand current evaluation trends and identify existing limitations. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of resources designed for evaluating pragmatic capabilities in NLP, categorizing datasets by the pragmatic phenomena they address. We analyze task designs, data collection methods, evaluation approaches, and their relevance to real-world applications. By examining these resources in the context of modern language models, we highlight emerging trends, challenges, and gaps in existing benchmarks. Our survey aims to clarify the landscape of pragmatic evaluation and guide the development of more comprehensive and targeted benchmarks, ultimately contributing to more nuanced and context-aware NLP models.</p></details> | ACL 2025 |

Despite recent progress, significant challenges remain due to the semantic gap between music and dance motion, as music offers only abstract cues, such as melody, groove, and emotion, without explicitly specifying the physical movements. Moreover, a single piece of music can produce multiple plausible dance interpretations. This one-to-many mapping demands additional guidance, as music alone provides limited information for generating diverse dance movements. The challenge is further amplified by the scarcity of paired music and dance data, which restricts the model\^a\u{A}\'Zs ability to learn diverse dance patterns. In this paper, we introduce DanceChat, a Large Language Model (LLM)-guided music-to-dance generation approach. We use an LLM as a choreographer that provides textual motion instructions, offering explicit, high-level guidance for dance generation. This approach goes beyond implicit learning from music alone, enabling the model to generate dance that is both more diverse and better aligned with musical styles. Our approach consists of three components: (1) an LLM-based pseudo instruction generation module that produces textual dance guidance based on music style and structure, (2) a multi-modal feature extraction and fusion module that integrates music, rhythm, and textual guidance into a shared representation, and (3) a diffusion-based motion synthesis module together with a multi-modal alignment loss, which ensures that the generated dance is aligned with both musical and textual cues. Extensive experiments on AIST++ and human evaluations show that DanceChat outperforms state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.</p></details> | <details><summary>check...</summary><p>check demos at https://dancechat.github.io/anon/</p></details> |
| **[Towards Action Hijacking of Large Language Model-based Agent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10807v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, applications powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in tackling complex tasks. By harnessing the advanced reasoning capabilities and extensive knowledge embedded in LLMs, these applications can generate detailed action plans that are subsequently executed by external tools. Furthermore, the integration of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances performance by incorporating up-to-date, domain-specific knowledge into the planning and execution processes. This approach has seen widespread adoption across various sectors, including healthcare, finance, and software development. Meanwhile, there are also growing concerns regarding the security of LLM-based applications. Researchers have disclosed various attacks, represented by jailbreak and prompt injection, to hijack the output actions of these applications. Existing attacks mainly focus on crafting semantically harmful prompts, and their validity could diminish when security filters are employed. In this paper, we introduce AI$\mathbf{^2}$, a novel attack to manipulate the action plans of LLM-based applications. Different from existing solutions, the innovation of AI$\mathbf{^2}$ lies in leveraging the knowledge from the application's database to facilitate the construction of malicious but semantically-harmless prompts. To this end, it first collects action-aware knowledge from the victim application. Based on such knowledge, the attacker can generate misleading input, which can mislead the LLM to generate harmful action plans, while bypassing possible detection mechanisms easily. Our evaluations on three real-world applications demonstrate the effectiveness of AI$\mathbf{^2}$: it achieves an average attack success rate of 84.30\% with the best of 99.70\%. Besides, it gets an average bypass rate of 92.7\% against common safety filters and 59.45\% against dedicated defense.</p></details> |  |

The Distributed Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (DQAOA) addresses high-dimensional, dense problems using current quantum computing techniques and high-performance computing (HPC) systems. In this work, we improve the scalability and efficiency of DQAOA through advanced problem decomposition and parallel execution using message passing on the Frontier CPU/GPU supercomputer. Our approach ensures efficient quantum-classical workload management by distributing large problem instances across classical and quantum resources. Experimental results demonstrate that enhanced decomposition strategies and GPU-accelerated quantum simulations significantly improve DQAOA's performance, achieving up to 10x speedup over CPU-based simulations. This advancement enables better scalability for large problem instances, supporting the practical deployment of GPU systems for hybrid quantum-classical applications. We also highlight ongoing integration efforts using the Quantum Framework (QFw) to support future HPC-quantum computing systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Scale Multi-Task Bayesian Optimization with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08131v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In multi-task Bayesian optimization, the goal is to leverage experience from optimizing existing tasks to improve the efficiency of optimizing new ones. While approaches using multi-task Gaussian processes or deep kernel transfer exist, the performance improvement is marginal when scaling beyond a moderate number of tasks. We introduce a novel approach leveraging large language models (LLMs) to learn from, and improve upon, previous optimization trajectories, scaling to approximately 1500 distinct tasks. Specifically, we propose a feedback loop in which an LLM is fine-tuned on the high quality solutions to specific tasks found by Bayesian optimization (BO). This LLM is then used to generate initialization points for future BO searches for new tasks. The trajectories of these new searches provide additional training data for fine-tuning the LLM, completing the loop. We evaluate our method on two distinct domains: database query optimization and antimicrobial peptide design. Results demonstrate that our approach creates a positive feedback loop, where the LLM's generated initializations gradually improve, leading to better optimization performance. As this feedback loop continues, we find that the LLM is eventually able to generate solutions to new tasks in just a few shots that are better than the solutions produced by "from scratch" by Bayesian optimization while simultaneously requiring significantly fewer oracle calls.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Single-User Dialogue: Assessing Multi-User Dialogue State Tracking Capabilities of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10504v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in zero-shot dialogue state tracking (DST), reducing the need for task-specific training. However, conventional DST benchmarks primarily focus on structured user-agent conversations, failing to capture the complexities of real-world multi-user interactions. In this study, we assess the robustness of LLMs in multi-user DST while minimizing dataset construction costs. Inspired by recent advances in LLM-based data annotation, we extend an existing DST dataset by generating utterances of a second user based on speech act theory. Our methodology systematically incorporates a second user's utterances into conversations, enabling a controlled evaluation of LLMs in multi-user settings. Experimental results reveal a significant performance drop compared to single-user DST, highlighting the limitations of current LLMs in extracting and tracking dialogue states amidst multiple speakers. Our findings emphasize the need for future research to enhance LLMs for multi-user DST scenarios, paving the way for more realistic and robust DST models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Large Language Models with Self-Consistent Natural Language Explanations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07523v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) seem to offer an easy path to interpretability: just ask them to explain their decisions. Yet, studies show that these post-hoc explanations often misrepresent the true decision process, as revealed by mismatches in feature importance. Despite growing evidence of this inconsistency, no systematic solutions have emerged, partly due to the high cost of estimating feature importance, which limits evaluations to small datasets. To address this, we introduce the Post-hoc Self-Consistency Bank (PSCB) - a large-scale benchmark of decisions spanning diverse tasks and models, each paired with LLM-generated explanations and corresponding feature importance scores. Analysis of PSCB reveals that self-consistency scores barely differ between correct and incorrect predictions. We also show that the standard metric fails to meaningfully distinguish between explanations. To overcome this limitation, we propose an alternative metric that more effectively captures variation in explanation quality. We use it to fine-tune LLMs via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), leading to significantly better alignment between explanations and decision-relevant features, even under domain shift. Our findings point to a scalable path toward more trustworthy, self-consistent LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Engagement-Driven Content Generation with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13187v5)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate significant persuasive capabilities in one-on-one interactions, but their influence within social networks, where interconnected users and complex opinion dynamics pose unique challenges, remains underexplored. This paper addresses the research question: \emph{Can LLMs generate meaningful content that maximizes user engagement on social networks?} To answer this, we propose a pipeline using reinforcement learning with simulated feedback, where the network's response to LLM-generated content (i.e., the reward) is simulated through a formal engagement model. This approach bypasses the temporal cost and complexity of live experiments, enabling an efficient feedback loop between the LLM and the network under study. It also allows to control over endogenous factors such as the LLM's position within the social network and the distribution of opinions on a given topic. Our approach is adaptive to the opinion distribution of the underlying network and agnostic to the specifics of the engagement model, which is embedded as a plug-and-play component. Such flexibility makes it suitable for more complex engagement tasks and interventions in computational social science. Using our framework, we analyze the performance of LLMs in generating social engagement under different conditions, showcasing their full potential in this task. The experimental code is publicly available at https://github.com/mminici/Engagement-Driven-Content-Generation.</p></details> |  |

While recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have improved medical question-answering (QA) tasks, most methods struggle to generate precise segmentation masks, limiting their application in automatic medical diagnosis. In this paper, we introduce medical image reasoning segmentation, a novel task that aims to generate segmentation masks based on complex and implicit medical instructions. To address this, we propose MedSeg-R, an end-to-end framework that leverages the reasoning abilities of MLLMs to interpret clinical questions while also capable of producing corresponding precise segmentation masks for medical images. It is built on two core components: 1) a global context understanding module that interprets images and comprehends complex medical instructions to generate multi-modal intermediate tokens, and 2) a pixel-level grounding module that decodes these tokens to produce precise segmentation masks and textual responses. Furthermore, we introduce MedSeg-QA, a large-scale dataset tailored for the medical image reasoning segmentation task. It includes over 10,000 image-mask pairs and multi-turn conversations, automatically annotated using large language models and refined through physician reviews. Experiments show MedSeg-R's superior performance across several benchmarks, achieving high segmentation accuracy and enabling interpretable textual analysis of medical images.</p></details> | <details><summary>{\dag...</summary><p>{\dag}: Equal contribution</p></details> |

However, such methods incur significant computational costs due to longer visual token sequences, posing challenges for real-time deployment. To mitigate this, prior studies have explored pruning unimportant visual tokens either at the output layer of the visual encoder or at the early layers of the language model. In this work, we revisit these design choices and reassess their effectiveness through comprehensive empirical studies of how visual tokens are processed throughout the visual encoding and language decoding stages. Guided by these insights, we propose VScan, a two-stage visual token reduction framework that addresses token redundancy by: (1) integrating complementary global and local scans with token merging during visual encoding, and (2) introducing pruning at intermediate layers of the language model. Extensive experimental results across four LVLMs validate the effectiveness of VScan in accelerating inference and demonstrate its superior performance over current state-of-the-arts on sixteen benchmarks. Notably, when applied to LLaVA-NeXT-7B, VScan achieves a 2.91$\times$ speedup in prefilling and a 10$\times$ reduction in FLOPs, while retaining 95.4\% of the original performance.

However, their substantial scale leads to significant computational resource consumption during inference, resulting in high costs. Consequently, edge device inference presents a promising solution. The primary challenges of edge inference include memory usage and inference speed. This paper introduces MNN-LLM, a framework specifically designed to accelerate the deployment of large language models on mobile devices. MNN-LLM addresses the runtime characteristics of LLMs through model quantization and DRAM-Flash hybrid storage, effectively reducing memory usage. It rearranges weights and inputs based on mobile CPU instruction sets and GPU characteristics while employing strategies such as multicore load balancing, mixed-precision floating-point operations, and geometric computations to enhance performance. Notably, MNN-LLM achieves up to a 8.6x speed increase compared to current mainstream LLM-specific frameworks.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures.

| **[Towards Understanding Bugs in Distributed Training and Inference Frameworks for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10426v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), distributed training and inference frameworks like DeepSpeed have become essential for scaling model training and inference across multiple GPUs or nodes. However, the increasing complexity of these frameworks brings non-trivial software bugs, which may degrade training performance, cause unexpected failures, and result in significant resource waste. Understanding framework bugs' characteristics is fundamental for quality assurance, allowing the design of more effective debugging and repair methods. Thus, our paper conducts the first large-scale empirical analysis of 308 fixed bugs across three popular distributed training/inference frameworks: DeepSpeed, Megatron-LM, and Colossal-AI. We examine bug symptoms, root causes, bug identification and fixing efforts, and common low-effort fixing strategies. Additionally, the distributed nature of these frameworks introduces unique bug root causes, such as allocation strategy error and distributed communication error. Diagnosing and fixing complex bugs remains challenging due to factors like the disconnect between symptoms and root causes, high bug reproduction costs, and low-level or cross-component interactions. Interestingly, we observe that 48% of bug fixes require minimal code changes (<=10 LOC) and follow simple strategies such as conditional logic optimization, parameter handling enhancement, or version compatibility handling, indicating potential for automation. Based on these insights, we offer several implications for improving the reliability of both distributed training and inference frameworks and their dependent LLM projects, while also identifying opportunities to leverage LLM-based tools for automated debugging and repair.</p></details> |  |

This study presents AutoGEEval++, an enhanced framework building on AutoGEEval, and the first automated assessment system for large language models (LLMs) generating geospatial code on Google Earth Engine (GEE). It supports diverse data modalities and varying task complexities. Built on the GEE Python API, AutoGEEval++ features a benchmark dataset-AutoGEEval++-Bench-with 6,365 test cases across 26 data types and three task categories: unit, combo, and theme tests. It includes a submission programme and a judge module to realise an end-to-end automated evaluation pipeline from code generation to execution-based validation. The framework adopts multi-dimensional metrics-accuracy, resource usage, run-time efficiency, and error types-balancing hallucination control and efficiency, and enabling boundary testing and error pattern analysis. Using AutoGEEval++, we evaluate 24 state-of-the-art LLMs (as of June 2025), including general-purpose, reasoning-enhanced, code-centric, and geoscience-specific models. Results reveal clear performance, stability, and error differences across task types, model designs, and deployment settings, confirming AutoGEEval++'s practical value and scalability in vertical-domain code generation. This work establishes the first standardised evaluation protocol and foundational benchmark for GEE-based LLM code generation, providing a unified basis for performance comparison and a methodological framework for systematic, domain-specific code evaluation.</p></details> |  |

However, existing LLM methods face challenges in irony detection, including: 1. single-perspective limitations, 2. insufficient comprehensive understanding, and 3. lack of interpretability. This paper introduces the Collaborative Agent Framework for Irony (CAF-I), an LLM-driven multi-agent system designed to overcome these issues. CAF-I employs specialized agents for Context, Semantics, and Rhetoric, which perform multidimensional analysis and engage in interactive collaborative optimization. A Decision Agent then consolidates these perspectives, with a Refinement Evaluator Agent providing conditional feedback for optimization. Experiments on benchmark datasets establish CAF-I's state-of-the-art zero-shot performance. Achieving SOTA on the vast majority of metrics, CAF-I reaches an average Macro-F1 of 76.31, a 4.98 absolute improvement over the strongest prior baseline. This success is attained by its effective simulation of human-like multi-perspective analysis, enhancing detection accuracy and interpretability.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods are mainly based on traditional signal processing, which cannot effectively process the complex background and dense space debris. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based Space Debris Tracking Network~(SDT-Net) to achieve highly accurate debris tracking. SDT-Net effectively represents the feature of debris, enhancing the efficiency and stability of end-to-end model learning. To train and evaluate this model effectively, we also produce a large-scale dataset Space Debris Tracking Dataset (SDTD) by a novel observation-based data simulation scheme. SDTD contains 18,040 video sequences with a total of 62,562 frames and covers 250,000 synthetic space debris. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our model and the challenging of our dataset. Furthermore, we test our model on real data from the Antarctic Station, achieving a MOTA score of 70.6%, which demonstrates its strong transferability to real-world scenarios.

A static code analysis framework detects issues such as bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells within a large-scale software project. Detailed information on each issue was extracted and organized to facilitate automated code revision using LLMs. An iterative prompt engineering process is applied to ensure that prompts are structured to produce accurate and organized outputs aligned with the project requirements. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is implemented to enhance the relevance and precision of the revisions, enabling LLM to access and integrate real-time external knowledge. The issue of LLM hallucinations - where the model generates plausible but incorrect outputs - is addressed by a custom-built "Code Comparison App," which identifies and corrects erroneous changes before applying them to the codebase. Subsequent scans using the static code analysis framework revealed a significant reduction in code issues, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining LLMs, static analysis, and RAG to improve code quality, streamline the software development process, and reduce time and resource expenditure.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at FORGE 2025</p></details> |

Existing troubleshooting approaches designed for traditional distributed systems or datacenter networks fall short and can hardly apply to real-world training systems. In this paper, we present PerfTracker, the first online troubleshooting system utilizing fine-grained profiling, to diagnose performance issues of large-scale model training in production. PerfTracker can diagnose performance issues rooted in both hardware (e.g., GPUs and their interconnects) and software (e.g., Python functions and GPU operations). It scales to LMT on modern GPU clusters. PerfTracker effectively summarizes runtime behavior patterns of fine-grained LMT functions via online profiling, and leverages differential observability to localize the root cause with minimal production impact. PerfTracker has been deployed as a production service for large-scale GPU clusters of O(10, 000) GPUs (product homepage https://help.aliyun.com/zh/pai/user-guide/perftracker-online-performance-analysis-diagnostic-tool).

| **[Prompt-based Depth Pruning of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04348v3)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Depth pruning aims to reduce the inference cost of a large language model without any hardware-specific complications, by simply removing several less important transformer blocks. However, our empirical findings suggest that the importance of a transformer block may be highly task-dependent -- a block that is crucial for a task can be removed without degrading the accuracy on another task. Based on this observation, we develop a dynamic depth pruning algorithm, coined PuDDing (Prompt-routed Dynamic Depth Pruning), which determines which blocks to omit from the model based on the input prompt. PuDDing operates by training a lightweight router to predict the best omission set among a set of options, where this option set has also been constructed in a data-driven manner. Empirical results on commonsense reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that PuDDing effectively accelerates the inference language models, and achieves better on-task performance than static depth pruning baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project: https://jwee01.github.io/PuDDing/ Code: https://github.com/tada0347/PuDDing</p></details> |

Often, there is a need to live-migrate such secure applications for load balancing or data center maintenance. Today, state-of-the-art migration methods for TEE still use the decade-old stop-and-copy-based method, which introduces large downtimes. This is because state-of-the-art live-migration approaches do not work for applications that run on TEEs. We propose a novel method that has a near-zero downtime live-migration mechanism for large memory footprint TEE-based applications. We provide two alternatives: a kernel-based approach and a compiler-based approach. Based on the memory usage, we can prefer one approach over the other. Our method is fully compatible with containers, virtual machines (VMs) and microVMs. Our prototype, built on Intel SGX, a TEE solution from Intel, has a near-zero downtime irrespective of enclave size. Our approach reduces the total downtime by 77-96% for a suite of SGX applications with multi-GB memory footprints compared to state-of-the-art TEE-based migration, MigSGX.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph-MLLM: Harnessing Multimodal Large Language Models for Multimodal Graph Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10282v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in representing and understanding diverse modalities. However, they typically focus on modality alignment in a pairwise manner while overlooking structural relationships across data points. Integrating multimodality with structured graph information (i.e., multimodal graphs, MMGs) is essential for real-world applications such as social networks, healthcare, and recommendation systems. Existing MMG learning methods fall into three paradigms based on how they leverage MLLMs: Encoder, Aligner, and Predictor. MLLM-as-Encoder focuses on enhancing graph neural networks (GNNs) via multimodal feature fusion; MLLM-as-Aligner aligns multimodal attributes in language or hidden space to enable LLM-based graph reasoning; MLLM-as-Predictor treats MLLMs as standalone reasoners with in-context learning or fine-tuning. Despite their advances, the MMG field lacks a unified benchmark to fairly evaluate across these approaches, making it unclear what progress has been made. To bridge this gap, we present Graph-MLLM, a comprehensive benchmark for multimodal graph learning by systematically evaluating these three paradigms across six datasets with different domains. Through extensive experiments, we observe that jointly considering the visual and textual attributes of the nodes benefits graph learning, even when using pre-trained text-to-image alignment models (e.g., CLIP) as encoders. We also find that converting visual attributes into textual descriptions further improves performance compared to directly using visual inputs. Moreover, we observe that fine-tuning MLLMs on specific MMGs can achieve state-of-the-art results in most scenarios, even without explicit graph structure information. We hope that our open-sourced library will facilitate rapid, equitable evaluation and inspire further innovative research in this field.</p></details> | 16 pages, 4 figures |
| **[SLO-Aware Scheduling for Large Language Model Inferences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14966v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized applications such as code completion, chatbots, and online classification. To elevate user experiences, service level objectives (SLOs) serve as crucial benchmarks for assessing inference services capabilities. In practice, an inference service processes multiple types of tasks, each with its own distinct SLO. To ensure satisfactory user experiences, each request's distinct SLOs should be considered in scheduling. However, existing designs lack this consideration, leading to insufficient hardware utility and suboptimal performance. This paper analyzes scenarios to process tasks with varying SLOs, and introduces a simulated annealing-based scheduler to decide request priority sequence based on a request's SLO, input lengths, and possible output lengths. As the first specialized scheduler for multi-SLO scenarios, this work improves SLO attainment by up to 5x and reduces average latency by 31.6% on Python-Code-23k-ShareGPT and ShareGPT_Vicuna_unfiltered datasets, compared to current state-of-the-art framework vLLM and a new framework LMDeploy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Do Language Models Have Bayesian Brains? Distinguishing Stochastic and Deterministic Decision Patterns within Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10268v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language models are essentially probability distributions over token sequences. Auto-regressive models generate sentences by iteratively computing and sampling from the distribution of the next token. This iterative sampling introduces stochasticity, leading to the assumption that language models make probabilistic decisions, similar to sampling from unknown distributions. Building on this assumption, prior research has used simulated Gibbs sampling, inspired by experiments designed to elicit human priors, to infer the priors of language models. In this paper, we revisit a critical question: Do language models possess Bayesian brains? Our findings show that under certain conditions, language models can exhibit near-deterministic decision-making, such as producing maximum likelihood estimations, even with a non-zero sampling temperature. This challenges the sampling assumption and undermines previous methods for eliciting human-like priors. Furthermore, we demonstrate that without proper scrutiny, a system with deterministic behavior undergoing simulated Gibbs sampling can converge to a "false prior." To address this, we propose a straightforward approach to distinguish between stochastic and deterministic decision patterns in Gibbs sampling, helping to prevent the inference of misleading language model priors. We experiment on a variety of large language models to identify their decision patterns under various circumstances. Our results provide key insights in understanding decision making of large language models.</p></details> |  |

However, as a critical component of advanced human cognition, strategic reasoning, i.e., the ability to assess multi-agent behaviors in dynamic environments, formulate action plans, and adapt strategies, has yet to be systematically evaluated or modeled. To address this gap, this paper introduces WGSR-Bench, the first strategy reasoning benchmark for LLMs using wargame as its evaluation environment. Wargame, a quintessential high-complexity strategic scenario, integrates environmental uncertainty, adversarial dynamics, and non-unique strategic choices, making it an effective testbed for assessing LLMs' capabilities in multi-agent decision-making, intent inference, and counterfactual reasoning. WGSR-Bench designs test samples around three core tasks, i.e., Environmental situation awareness, Opponent risk modeling and Policy generation, which serve as the core S-POE architecture, to systematically assess main abilities of strategic reasoning. Finally, an LLM-based wargame agent is designed to integrate these parts for a comprehensive strategy reasoning assessment. With WGSR-Bench, we hope to assess the strengths and limitations of state-of-the-art LLMs in game-theoretic strategic reasoning and to advance research in large model-driven strategic intelligence.</p></details> | 15 pages, 17 figures |

Various representation learning methods have been developed, including graph-based approaches for relationships among entities, sequence-based methods for capturing the temporal evolution of user activities, and content-based models for leveraging text and visual content. However, the development of a unifying framework that integrates these diverse techniques to support multiple applications remains a significant challenge. This paper presents OmniSage, a large-scale representation framework that learns universal representations for a variety of applications at Pinterest. OmniSage integrates graph neural networks with content-based models and user sequence models by employing multiple contrastive learning tasks to effectively process graph data, user sequence data, and content signals. To support the training and inference of OmniSage, we developed an efficient infrastructure capable of supporting Pinterest graphs with billions of nodes. The universal representations generated by OmniSage have significantly enhanced user experiences on Pinterest, leading to an approximate 2.5% increase in sitewide repins (saves) across five applications. This paper highlights the impact of unifying representation learning methods, and we make the model code publicly available at https://github.com/pinterest/atg-research/tree/main/omnisage.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in Proceedings of KDD 2025 Industry Track</p></details> |

However, the lack of region-text pairs limits their advancements to fine-grained multimodal understanding. In this paper, we propose spatial instruction tuning, which introduces the reference to the region-of-interest(RoI) in the instruction. Before sending to LLM, the reference is replaced by RoI features and interleaved with language embeddings as a sequence. Our model GPT4RoI, trained on 7 region-text pair datasets, brings an unprecedented interactive and conversational experience compared to previous image-level models. (1) Interaction beyond language: Users can interact with our model by both language and drawing bounding boxes to flexibly adjust the referring granularity. (2) Versatile multimodal abilities: A variety of attribute information within each RoI can be mined by GPT4RoI, e.g., color, shape, material, action, etc. Furthermore, it can reason about multiple RoIs based on common sense. On the Visual Commonsense Reasoning(VCR) dataset, GPT4RoI achieves a remarkable accuracy of 81.6%, surpassing all existing models by a significant margin (the second place is 75.6%) and almost reaching human-level performance of 85.0%.

The dataset contains 53,274 synthetic sentences equally distributed between minorities groups and toxicity labels. ToxSyn-PT is created through a novel four-stage pipeline: (1) a compact, manually curated seed; (2) few-shot expansion with an instruction-tuned LLM; (3) paraphrase-based augmentation; and (4) enrichment, plus additional neutral texts to curb overfitting to group-specific cues. The resulting corpus is class-balanced, stylistically diverse, and free from the social-media domain that dominate existing Portuguese datasets. Despite domain differences with traditional benchmarks, experiments on both binary and multi-label classification on the corpus yields strong results across five public Portuguese hate-speech datasets, demonstrating robust generalization even across domain boundaries. The dataset is publicly released to advance research on synthetic data and hate-speech detection in low-resource settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 tables, 1 figure</p></details> |

Their impact extends across a diverse spectrum of tasks, revolutionizing how we approach language understanding and generations. Nevertheless, alongside their remarkable utility, LLMs introduce critical security and risk considerations. These challenges warrant careful examination to ensure responsible deployment and safeguard against potential vulnerabilities. This research paper thoroughly investigates security and privacy concerns related to LLMs from five thematic perspectives: security and privacy concerns, vulnerabilities against adversarial attacks, potential harms caused by misuses of LLMs, mitigation strategies to address these challenges while identifying limitations of current strategies. Lastly, the paper recommends promising avenues for future research to enhance the security and risk management of LLMs.</p></details> |  |

However, there is a lack of standardized evaluation criteria to assess their effectiveness, particularly in dynamic, interactive scenarios. In this study, we systematically examine the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in managing tasks within Intelligent Outpatient Referral (IOR) systems and propose a comprehensive evaluation framework specifically designed for such systems. This framework comprises two core tasks: static evaluation, which focuses on evaluating the ability of predefined outpatient referrals, and dynamic evaluation, which evaluates capabilities of refining outpatient referral recommendations through iterative dialogues. Our findings suggest that LLMs offer limited advantages over BERT-like models, but show promise in asking effective questions during interactive dialogues.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mitigating Object Hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models via Image-Grounded Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08680v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advancement of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) has increasingly highlighted the critical issue of their tendency to hallucinate non-existing objects in the images. To address this issue, previous works focused on using specially curated datasets or powerful LLMs to rectify the outputs of LVLMs. However, these approaches require either costly training or fine-tuning, or API access to proprietary LLMs for post-generation correction. In response to these limitations, we propose Mitigating hallucinAtion via image-gRounded guIdaNcE (MARINE), a framework that is both training-free and API-free. MARINE effectively and efficiently reduces object hallucinations during inference by introducing image-grounded guidance to LVLMs. This is achieved by leveraging open-source vision models to extract object-level information, thereby enhancing the precision of LVLM-generated content. Our framework's flexibility further allows for the integration of multiple vision models, enabling more reliable and robust object-level guidance. Through comprehensive evaluations across 5 popular LVLMs with diverse evaluation metrics and benchmarks, we demonstrate the effectiveness of MARINE, which even outperforms existing fine-tuning-based methods. Remarkably, it reduces hallucinations consistently in GPT-4V-assisted evaluation while maintaining the detailedness of LVLMs' generations. We release our code at https://github.com/Linxi-ZHAO/MARINE.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 13 figures, 25 tables</p></details> |

Recently, learning-based approaches have shown a potential to speed up MIP solving via offline training that then guides important design decisions during the search. However, a significant drawback of these methods is their heavy reliance on offline training, which requires collecting training datasets and computationally costly training epochs yet offering only limited generalization to unseen (larger) instances. In this paper, we propose Balans, an adaptive meta-solver for MIPs with online learning capability that does not require any supervision or apriori training. At its core, Balans is based on adaptive large-neighborhood search, operating on top of an MIP solver by successive applications of destroy and repair neighborhood operators. During the search, the selection among different neighborhood definitions is guided on the fly for the instance at hand via multi-armed bandit algorithms. Our extensive experiments on hard optimization instances show that Balans offers significant performance gains over the default MIP solver, is better than committing to any single best neighborhood, and improves over the state-of-the-art large-neighborhood search for MIPs. Finally, we release Balans as a highly configurable, MIP solver agnostic, open-source software.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-D12: A Dual-Dimensional Scale of Instrumental and Relational Dependencies on Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06874v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There is growing interest in understanding how people interact with large language models (LLMs) and whether such models elicit dependency or even addictive behaviour. Validated tools to assess the extent to which individuals may become dependent on LLMs are scarce and primarily build on classic behavioral addiction symptoms, adapted to the context of LLM use. We view this as a conceptual limitation, as the LLM-human relationship is more nuanced and warrants a fresh and distinct perspective. To address this gap, we developed and validated a new 12-item questionnaire to measure LLM dependency, referred to as LLM-D12. The scale was based on the authors' prior theoretical work, with items developed accordingly and responses collected from 526 participants in the UK. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, performed on separate halves of the total sample using a split-sample approach, supported a two-factor structure: Instrumental Dependency (six items) and Relationship Dependency (six items). Instrumental Dependency reflects the extent to which individuals rely on LLMs to support or collaborate in decision-making and cognitive tasks. Relationship Dependency captures the tendency to perceive LLMs as socially meaningful, sentient, or companion-like entities. The two-factor structure demonstrated excellent internal consistency and clear discriminant validity. External validation confirmed both the conceptual foundation and the distinction between the two subscales. The psychometric properties and structure of our LLM-D12 scale were interpreted in light of the emerging view that dependency on LLMs does not necessarily indicate dysfunction but may still reflect reliance levels that could become problematic in certain contexts.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Large Language Models are Reliable for Judging Empathic Communication](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10150v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating empathic responses in text-based conversations. But, how reliably do they judge the nuances of empathic communication? We investigate this question by comparing how experts, crowdworkers, and LLMs annotate empathic communication across four evaluative frameworks drawn from psychology, natural language processing, and communications applied to 200 real-world conversations where one speaker shares a personal problem and the other offers support. Drawing on 3,150 expert annotations, 2,844 crowd annotations, and 3,150 LLM annotations, we assess inter-rater reliability between these three annotator groups. We find that expert agreement is high but varies across the frameworks' sub-components depending on their clarity, complexity, and subjectivity. We show that expert agreement offers a more informative benchmark for contextualizing LLM performance than standard classification metrics. Across all four frameworks, LLMs consistently approach this expert level benchmark and exceed the reliability of crowdworkers. These results demonstrate how LLMs, when validated on specific tasks with appropriate benchmarks, can support transparency and oversight in emotionally sensitive applications including their use as conversational companions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Models for Toxic Language Detection in Low-Resource Balkan Languages](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09992v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online toxic language causes real harm, especially in regions with limited moderation tools. In this study, we evaluate how large language models handle toxic comments in Serbian, Croatian, and Bosnian, languages with limited labeled data. We built and manually labeled a dataset of 4,500 YouTube and TikTok comments drawn from videos across diverse categories, including music, politics, sports, modeling, influencer content, discussions of sexism, and general topics. Four models (GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4.1, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Claude 3 Opus) were tested in two modes: zero-shot and context-augmented. We measured precision, recall, F1 score, accuracy and false positive rates. Including a short context snippet raised recall by about 0.12 on average and improved F1 score by up to 0.10, though it sometimes increased false positives. The best balance came from Gemini in context-augmented mode, reaching an F1 score of 0.82 and accuracy of 0.82, while zero-shot GPT-4.1 led on precision and had the lowest false alarms. We show how adding minimal context can improve toxic language detection in low-resource settings and suggest practical strategies such as improved prompt design and threshold calibration. These results show that prompt design alone can yield meaningful gains in toxicity detection for underserved Balkan language communities.</p></details> | 8 pages |

Unlike other multimodal models, TerraMind is pretrained on dual-scale representations combining both token-level and pixel-level data across modalities. On a token level, TerraMind encodes high-level contextual information to learn cross-modal relationships, while on a pixel level, TerraMind leverages fine-grained representations to capture critical spatial nuances. We pretrained TerraMind on nine geospatial modalities of a global, large-scale dataset. In this paper, we demonstrate that (i) TerraMind's dual-scale early fusion approach unlocks a range of zero-shot and few-shot applications for Earth observation, (ii) TerraMind introduces "Thinking-in-Modalities" (TiM) -- the capability of generating additional artificial data during finetuning and inference to improve the model output -- and (iii) TerraMind achieves beyond state-of-the-art performance in community-standard benchmarks for EO like PANGAEA.

Despite the current practice of training and evaluating LLM-based recommendation (LLM4Rec) models under a sequential recommendation scenario, we found that whether these models understand the sequential information inherent in users' item interaction sequences has been largely overlooked. In this paper, we first demonstrate through a series of experiments that existing LLM4Rec models do not fully capture sequential information both during training and inference. Then, we propose a simple yet effective LLM-based sequential recommender, called LLM-SRec, a method that enhances the integration of sequential information into LLMs by distilling the user representations extracted from a pre-trained CF-SRec model into LLMs. Our extensive experiments show that LLM-SRec enhances LLMs' ability to understand users' item interaction sequences, ultimately leading to improved recommendation performance. Furthermore, unlike existing LLM4Rec models that require fine-tuning of LLMs, LLM-SRec achieves state-of-the-art performance by training only a few lightweight MLPs, highlighting its practicality in real-world applications.

There are also a few empirical studies that have examined the hypothesis, either explicitly or implicitly. The present work continues with and contributes to this research with a replication-motivated large-scale analysis of software written in the PHP programming language. The dataset examined contains nearly four hundred thousand open source software packages written in PHP. According to the results based on reported security vulnerabilities, the hypothesis does holds; packages having been affected by vulnerabilities over their release histories are generally more popular than packages without having been affected by a single vulnerability. With this replication results, the paper contributes to the efforts to strengthen the empirical knowledge base in cyber and software security.</p></details> | Resubmitted |
| **[The Emergence of Abstract Thought in Large Language Models Beyond Any Language](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09890v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, their capacity to function effectively across a diverse range of languages has shown marked improvement. Preliminary studies observe that the hidden activations of LLMs often resemble English, even when responding to non-English prompts. This has led to the widespread assumption that LLMs may "think" in English. However, more recent results showing strong multilingual performance, even surpassing English performance on specific tasks in other languages, challenge this view. In this work, we find that LLMs progressively develop a core language-agnostic parameter space-a remarkably small subset of parameters whose deactivation results in significant performance degradation across all languages. This compact yet critical set of parameters underlies the model's ability to generalize beyond individual languages, supporting the emergence of abstract thought that is not tied to any specific linguistic system. Specifically, we identify language-related neurons-those are consistently activated during the processing of particular languages, and categorize them as either shared (active across multiple languages) or exclusive (specific to one). As LLMs undergo continued development over time, we observe a marked increase in both the proportion and functional importance of shared neurons, while exclusive neurons progressively diminish in influence. These shared neurons constitute the backbone of the core language-agnostic parameter space, supporting the emergence of abstract thought. Motivated by these insights, we propose neuron-specific training strategies tailored to LLMs' language-agnostic levels at different development stages. Experiments across diverse LLM families support our approach.</p></details> |  |

Recently, this landscape has faced disruption by the advent of data-driven artificial intelligence (AI)-based weather models, which offer tremendous computational performance and competitive forecasting accuracy. However, data-driven models for medium-range forecasting generally suffer from major limitations, including low effective resolution and a narrow range of predicted variables. This study illustrates the relative strengths and weaknesses of these competing paradigms using the physics-based GEM (Global Environmental Multiscale) and the AI-based GraphCast models. Analyses of their respective global predictions in physical and spectral space reveal that GraphCast-predicted large scales outperform GEM, particularly for longer lead times, even though fine scales predicted by GraphCast suffer from excessive smoothing. Building on this insight, a hybrid NWP-AI system is proposed, wherein temperature and horizontal wind components predicted by GEM are spectrally nudged toward GraphCast predictions at large scales, while GEM itself freely generates the fine-scale details critical for local predictability and weather extremes. This hybrid approach is capable of leveraging the strengths of GraphCast to enhance the prediction skill of the GEM model while generating a full suite of physically consistent forecast fields with a full power spectrum. Additionally, trajectories of tropical cyclones are predicted with enhanced accuracy without significant changes in intensity. Work is in progress for operationalization of this hybrid system at the Canadian Meteorological Centre.</p></details> |  |

While recent models incorporate multi-image data during pre-training, they still struggle to recognize sequential structures, often treating images independently. This work introduces ImageChain, a framework that enhances MLLMs with sequential reasoning capabilities over image data by modeling visual sequences as a multi-turn conversation. In ImageChain, images are interleaved with corresponding textual descriptions to form a controlled dialogue that explicitly captures temporal dependencies and narrative progression. Our method optimizes for the task of next-scene description, where the model generates a context-aware description of an upcoming scene based on preceding visual and textual cues. We demonstrate that our approach improves performance on the next-scene description task -- achieving an average improvement from 3.7% to 19% in SimRate, a metric that quantifies semantic similarity to human-annotated ground truths. Moreover, ImageChain achieves robust zero-shot out-of-domain performance in applications ranging from comics to robotics. Extensive experiments validate that instruction-tuning in a multimodal, multi-turn conversation design is key to bridging the gap between static image understanding and temporally-aware reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code,...</summary><p>Code, dataset, and checkpoints are publicly available at https://github.com/danaesavi/ImageChain; v2: added human annotation study to validate SimRate</p></details> |

While prior research has demonstrated the potential of machine learning (ML) models to increase picking success rates in large-scale robotic fleets by prioritizing high-probability picks and packages, these efforts primarily focused on predicting success probabilities for picks sampled using heuristic methods. Limited attention has been given, however, to leveraging data-driven approaches to directly optimize sampled picks for better performance at scale. In this study, we propose an ML-based framework that predicts transform adjustments as well as improving the selection of suction cups for multi-suction end effectors for sampled picks to enhance their success probabilities. The framework was integrated and evaluated in test workcells that resemble the operations of Amazon Robotics' Robot Induction (Robin) fleet, which is used for package manipulation. Evaluated on over 2 million picks, the proposed method achieves a 20\% reduction in pick failure rates compared to a heuristic-based pick sampling baseline, demonstrating its effectiveness in large-scale warehouse automation scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 1...</summary><p>The 19th International Symposium on Experimental Robotics (ISER 2025); 6-10 July 2025, Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA; 10 pages</p></details> |
| **[Large Language Models for Design Structure Matrix Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09749v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In complex engineering systems, the interdependencies among components or development activities are often modeled and analyzed using Design Structure Matrix (DSM). Reorganizing elements within a DSM to minimize feedback loops and enhance modularity or process efficiency constitutes a challenging combinatorial optimization (CO) problem in engineering design and operations. As problem sizes increase and dependency networks become more intricate, traditional optimization methods that solely use mathematical heuristics often fail to capture the contextual nuances and struggle to deliver effective solutions. In this study, we explore the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) for helping solve such CO problems by leveraging their capabilities for advanced reasoning and contextual understanding. We propose a novel LLM-based framework that integrates network topology with contextual domain knowledge for iterative optimization of DSM element sequencing - a common CO problem. Experiments on various DSM cases show that our method consistently achieves faster convergence and superior solution quality compared to both stochastic and deterministic baselines. Notably, we find that incorporating contextual domain knowledge significantly enhances optimization performance regardless of the chosen LLM backbone. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs to solve complex engineering CO problems by combining semantic and mathematical reasoning. This approach paves the way towards a new paradigm in LLM-based engineering design optimization.</p></details> |  |

However, existing multi-modal graph learning methods are typically trained from scratch for specific graph data and tasks, failing to generalize across various multi-modal graph data and tasks. To bridge this gap, we explore the potential of Multi-modal Graph Large Language Models (MG-LLM) to unify and generalize across diverse multi-modal graph data and tasks. We propose a unified framework of multi-modal graph data, task, and model, discovering the inherent multi-granularity and multi-scale characteristics in multi-modal graphs. Specifically, we present five key desired characteristics for MG-LLM: 1) unified space for multi-modal structures and attributes, 2) capability of handling diverse multi-modal graph tasks, 3) multi-modal graph in-context learning, 4) multi-modal graph interaction with natural language, and 5) multi-modal graph reasoning. We then elaborate on the key challenges, review related works, and highlight promising future research directions towards realizing these ambitious characteristics. Finally, we summarize existing multi-modal graph datasets pertinent for model training. We believe this paper can contribute to the ongoing advancement of the research towards MG-LLM for generalization across multi-modal graph data and tasks.</p></details> |  |

We present a method for the automatic temporal localization of key PE fidelity elements -- identifying their start and stop times -- directly from session audio and transcripts. Our approach fine-tunes a large pre-trained audio-language model, Qwen2-Audio, using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to process focused 30-second windows of audio-transcript input. Fidelity labels for three core protocol phases -- therapist orientation (P1), imaginal exposure (P2), and post-imaginal processing (P3) -- are generated via LLM-based prompting and verified by trained raters. The model is trained to predict normalized boundary offsets using soft supervision guided by task-specific prompts. On a dataset of 313 real PE sessions, our best configuration (LoRA rank 8, 30s windows) achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 5.3 seconds across tasks.

Existing defense methods--designed for vision/text classification tasks--fail for text generation. We propose Internal Consistency Regularization (CROW), a defense leveraging the observation that backdoored models exhibit unstable layer-wise hidden representations when triggered, while clean models show smooth transitions. CROW enforces consistency across layers via adversarial perturbations and regularization during finetuning, neutralizing backdoors without requiring clean reference models or trigger knowledge--only a small clean dataset. Experiments across Llama-2 (7B, 13B), CodeLlama (7B, 13B), and Mistral-7B demonstrate CROW's effectiveness: it achieves significant reductions in attack success rates across diverse backdoor strategies (sentiment steering, targeted refusal, code injection) while preserving generative performance. CROW's architecture-agnostic design enables practical deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICML 2025, 20 pages</p></details> |
| **[Query-Level Uncertainty in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09669v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is important for Large Language Models to be aware of the boundary of their knowledge, the mechanism of identifying known and unknown queries. This type of awareness can help models perform adaptive inference, such as invoking RAG, engaging in slow and deep thinking, or adopting the abstention mechanism, which is beneficial to the development of efficient and trustworthy AI. In this work, we propose a method to detect knowledge boundaries via Query-Level Uncertainty, which aims to determine if the model is able to address a given query without generating any tokens. To this end, we introduce a novel and training-free method called \emph{Internal Confidence}, which leverages self-evaluations across layers and tokens. Empirical results on both factual QA and mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that our internal confidence can outperform several baselines. Furthermore, we showcase that our proposed method can be used for efficient RAG and model cascading, which is able to reduce inference costs while maintaining performance.</p></details> | In Progress |

These models are increasingly being utilized for a range of SE tasks, including requirements engineering and design, code analysis and generation, software maintenance, and quality assurance. As LLMs become more integral to SE, evaluating their effectiveness is crucial for understanding their potential in this field. In recent years, substantial efforts have been made to assess LLM performance in various SE tasks, resulting in the creation of several benchmarks tailored to this purpose. This paper offers a thorough review of 291 benchmarks, addressing three main aspects: what benchmarks are available, how benchmarks are constructed, and the future outlook for these benchmarks. We begin by examining SE tasks such as requirements engineering and design, coding assistant, software testing, AIOPs, software maintenance, and quality management. We then analyze the benchmarks and their development processes, highlighting the limitations of existing benchmarks. Additionally, we discuss the successes and failures of LLMs in different software tasks and explore future opportunities and challenges for SE-related benchmarks. We aim to provide a comprehensive overview of benchmark research in SE and offer insights to support the creation of more effective evaluation tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[Accelerating Large-Scale Regularized High-Order Tensor Recovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09594v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Currently, existing tensor recovery methods fail to recognize the impact of tensor scale variations on their structural characteristics. Furthermore, existing studies face prohibitive computational costs when dealing with large-scale high-order tensor data. To alleviate these issue, assisted by the Krylov subspace iteration, block Lanczos bidiagonalization process, and random projection strategies, this article first devises two fast and accurate randomized algorithms for low-rank tensor approximation (LRTA) problem. Theoretical bounds on the accuracy of the approximation error estimate are established. Next, we develop a novel generalized nonconvex modeling framework tailored to large-scale tensor recovery, in which a new regularization paradigm is exploited to achieve insightful prior representation for large-scale tensors. On the basis of the above, we further investigate new unified nonconvex models and efficient optimization algorithms, respectively, for several typical high-order tensor recovery tasks in unquantized and quantized situations. To render the proposed algorithms practical and efficient for large-scale tensor data, the proposed randomized LRTA schemes are integrated into their central and time-intensive computations. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on various large-scale tensors, whose results demonstrate the practicability, effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method in comparison with some state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |

This study evaluates the mathematical capabilities of various LLMs using the Finnish matriculation examination, a high-stakes digital test for upper secondary education. Initial tests yielded moderate performance corresponding to mid-range grades, but later evaluations demonstrated substantial improvements as the language models evolved. Remarkably, some models achieved near-perfect or perfect scores, matching top student performance and qualifying for university admission. Our findings highlight the rapid advances in the mathematical proficiency of LLMs and illustrate their potential as underlying tools to support learning and teaching in a variety of ways.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Heuristics Generation for Solving Combinatorial Optimization Problems Using Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12627v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies exploited Large Language Models (LLMs) to autonomously generate heuristics for solving Combinatorial Optimization Problems (COPs), by prompting LLMs to first provide search directions and then derive heuristics accordingly. However, the absence of task-specific knowledge in prompts often leads LLMs to provide unspecific search directions, obstructing the derivation of well-performing heuristics. Moreover, evaluating the derived heuristics remains resource-intensive, especially for those semantically equivalent ones, often requiring omissible resource expenditure. To enable LLMs to provide specific search directions, we propose the Hercules algorithm, which leverages our designed Core Abstraction Prompting (CAP) method to abstract the core components from elite heuristics and incorporate them as prior knowledge in prompts. We theoretically prove the effectiveness of CAP in reducing unspecificity and provide empirical results in this work. To reduce computing resources required for evaluating the derived heuristics, we propose few-shot Performance Prediction Prompting (PPP), a first-of-its-kind method for the Heuristic Generation (HG) task. PPP leverages LLMs to predict the fitness values of newly derived heuristics by analyzing their semantic similarity to previously evaluated ones. We further develop two tailored mechanisms for PPP to enhance predictive accuracy and determine unreliable predictions, respectively. The use of PPP makes Hercules more resource-efficient and we name this variant Hercules-P. Extensive experiments across four HG tasks, five COPs, and eight LLMs demonstrate that Hercules outperforms the state-of-the-art LLM-based HG algorithms, while Hercules-P excels at minimizing required computing resources. In addition, we illustrate the effectiveness of CAP, PPP, and the other proposed mechanisms by conducting relevant ablation studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGKDD 2025</p></details> |

With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), a key question arises: can these models develop human-like object representations from linguistic and multimodal data? In this study, we combined behavioral and neuroimaging analyses to explore the relationship between object concept representations in LLMs and human cognition. We collected 4.7 million triplet judgments from LLMs and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) to derive low-dimensional embeddings that capture the similarity structure of 1,854 natural objects. The resulting 66-dimensional embeddings were stable, predictive, and exhibited semantic clustering similar to human mental representations. Remarkably, the dimensions underlying these embeddings were interpretable, suggesting that LLMs and MLLMs develop human-like conceptual representations of objects. Further analysis showed strong alignment between model embeddings and neural activity patterns in brain regions such as EBA, PPA, RSC, and FFA. This provides compelling evidence that the object representations in LLMs, while not identical to human ones, share fundamental similarities that reflect key aspects of human conceptual knowledge. Our findings advance the understanding of machine intelligence and inform the development of more human-like artificial cognitive systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published on Nature Machine Intelligence</p></details> |

This survey paper systematically examines the synergy between KGs and LLMs, categorizing existing approaches into two main groups: KG-enhanced LLMs, which improve reasoning, reduce hallucinations, and enable complex question answering; and LLM-augmented KGs, which facilitate KG construction, completion, and querying. Through comprehensive analysis, we identify critical gaps and highlight the mutual benefits of structured knowledge integration. Compared to existing surveys, our study uniquely emphasizes scalability, computational efficiency, and data quality.

However, much of this literature appropriates the terminology of MAS without engaging with its foundational principles. In this position paper, we highlight critical discrepancies between MAS theory and current MAS LLMs implementations, focusing on four key areas: the social aspect of agency, environment design, coordination and communication protocols, and measuring emergent behaviours. Our position is that many MAS LLMs lack multi-agent characteristics such as autonomy, social interaction, and structured environments, and often rely on oversimplified, LLM-centric architectures. The field may slow down and lose traction by revisiting problems the MAS literature has already addressed. Therefore, we systematically analyse this issue and outline associated research opportunities; we advocate for better integrating established MAS concepts and more precise terminology to avoid mischaracterisation and missed opportunities.</p></details> |  |
| **[GenBreak: Red Teaming Text-to-Image Generators Using Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10047v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image (T2I) models such as Stable Diffusion have advanced rapidly and are now widely used in content creation. However, these models can be misused to generate harmful content, including nudity or violence, posing significant safety risks. While most platforms employ content moderation systems, underlying vulnerabilities can still be exploited by determined adversaries. Recent research on red-teaming and adversarial attacks against T2I models has notable limitations: some studies successfully generate highly toxic images but use adversarial prompts that are easily detected and blocked by safety filters, while others focus on bypassing safety mechanisms but fail to produce genuinely harmful outputs, neglecting the discovery of truly high-risk prompts. Consequently, there remains a lack of reliable tools for evaluating the safety of defended T2I models. To address this gap, we propose GenBreak, a framework that fine-tunes a red-team large language model (LLM) to systematically explore underlying vulnerabilities in T2I generators. Our approach combines supervised fine-tuning on curated datasets with reinforcement learning via interaction with a surrogate T2I model. By integrating multiple reward signals, we guide the LLM to craft adversarial prompts that enhance both evasion capability and image toxicity, while maintaining semantic coherence and diversity. These prompts demonstrate strong effectiveness in black-box attacks against commercial T2I generators, revealing practical and concerning safety weaknesses.</p></details> | 27 pages, 7 figures |

However, manual creation of these ontologies is expensive, slow, and often results in outdated and overly general representations. As a solution, researchers have been investigating ways to automate or semi-automate the process of generating these ontologies. This paper offers a comprehensive analysis of the ability of large language models (LLMs) to identify semantic relationships between different research topics, which is a critical step in the development of such ontologies. To this end, we developed a gold standard based on the IEEE Thesaurus to evaluate the task of identifying four types of relationships between pairs of topics: broader, narrower, same-as, and other. Our study evaluates the performance of seventeen LLMs, which differ in scale, accessibility (open vs. proprietary), and model type (full vs. quantised), while also assessing four zero-shot reasoning strategies. Several models have achieved outstanding results, including Mixtral-8x7B, Dolphin-Mistral-7B, and Claude 3 Sonnet, with F1-scores of 0.847, 0.920, and 0.967, respectively. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate that smaller, quantised models, when optimised through prompt engineering, can deliver performance comparable to much larger proprietary models, while requiring significantly fewer computational resources.</p></details> | <details><summary>Now a...</summary><p>Now accepted to Information Processing & Management. this is the camera ready</p></details> |

However, a key challenge is the scarcity of high-quality spontaneous speech data, as most existing datasets contain scripted dialogues. To address this, we present a novel pipeline for eliciting and recording natural dialogues and release our dataset with 100+ hours of spontaneous speech. Our approach fosters fluid, natural conversations while encouraging a diverse range of topics and interactive exchanges. Unlike traditional methods, it facilitates genuine interactions, providing a reproducible framework for future data collection. This paper introduces our dataset and methodology, laying the groundwork for addressing the shortage of spontaneous speech data. We plan to expand this dataset in future stages, offering a growing resource for the research community.</p></details> |  |

Despite significant advancements, the propensity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate harmful and unethical content poses critical challenges. Measuring value alignment of LLMs becomes crucial for their regulation and responsible deployment. Although numerous benchmarks have been constructed to assess social bias, toxicity, and ethical issues in LLMs, those static benchmarks suffer from evaluation chronoeffect, in which, as models rapidly evolve, existing benchmarks may leak into training data or become saturated, overestimating ever-developing LLMs. To tackle this problem, we propose GETA, a novel generative evolving testing approach based on adaptive testing methods in measurement theory. Unlike traditional adaptive testing methods that rely on a static test item pool, GETA probes the underlying moral boundaries of LLMs by dynamically generating test items tailored to model capability. GETA co-evolves with LLMs by learning a joint distribution of item difficulty and model value conformity, thus effectively addressing evaluation chronoeffect. We evaluated various popular LLMs with GETA and demonstrated that 1) GETA can dynamically create difficulty-tailored test items and 2) GETA's evaluation results are more consistent with models' performance on unseen OOD and i.i.d. items, laying the groundwork for future evaluation paradigms.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |

Moreover, due to the inaccessibility of original pre-training data, catastrophic forgetting tends to be exacerbated when third-party practitioners implement SFT on open-sourced models. To address this challenge, we propose a novel, more cost-effective SFT method which could effectively reduce the risk of catastrophic forgetting without access to original SFT data. Our approach begins by reconstructing the likely SFT instruction distribution of the base model, followed by a multi-model screening process to select optimal data, which is then mixed with new data for SFT. Experimental results demonstrate that our method preserves generalization capabilities in general domains while improving task-specific performance.</p></details> |  |

It estimates the model's capability, elucidates behavior characteristics, and facilitates the identification of potential issues and limitations, thereby guiding further improvement. Given that LLMs' diverse task-handling abilities stem from large volumes of training data, a comprehensive evaluation also necessitates abundant, well-annotated, and representative test data to assess LLM performance across various downstream tasks. However, the demand for high-quality test data often entails substantial time, computational resources, and manual efforts, sometimes causing the evaluation to be inefficient or impractical. To address these challenges, researchers propose active testing, which estimates the overall performance by selecting a subset of test data. Nevertheless, the existing active testing methods tend to be inefficient, even inapplicable, given the unique new challenges of LLMs (e.g., diverse task types, increased model complexity, and unavailability of training data). To mitigate such limitations and expedite the development cycle of LLMs, in this work, we introduce AcTracer, an active testing framework tailored for LLMs that strategically selects a small subset of test data to achieve a more accurate performance estimation for LLMs. AcTracer utilizes both internal and external information from LLMs to guide the test sampling process, reducing variance through a multi-stage pool-based active selection. Our experiment results demonstrate that AcTracer achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods across various tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (2025)</p></details> |

While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential, existing general-purpose models often lack the specialized domain knowledge, nuanced reasoning capabilities, and access to high-quality, domain-specific training data required for adapting a general LLM into an LLM specially for communication system formulation. To bridge this gap, we introduce DeepForm, the first reasoning LLM specially for automated communication system formulation. We propose the world-first large-scale, open-source dataset meticulously curated for this domain called Communication System Formulation Reasoning Corpus (CSFRC). Our framework employs a two-stage training strategy: first, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data to distill domain knowledge; second, a novel rule-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm, C-ReMax based on ReMax, to cultivate advanced modeling capabilities and elicit sophisticated reasoning patterns like self-correction and verification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming larger proprietary LLMs on diverse senerios. We will release related resources to foster further research in this area after the paper is accepted.</p></details> |  |

PFNs are transformers that are pre-trained on synthetic data generated from a prespecified prior distribution and that enable Bayesian inference through in-context learning. In this paper, we introduce CausalFM, a comprehensive framework for training PFN-based foundation models in various causal inference settings. First, we formalize the construction of Bayesian priors for causal inference based on structural causal models (SCMs) in a principled way and derive necessary criteria for the validity of such priors. Building on this, we propose a novel family of prior distributions using causality-inspired Bayesian neural networks that enable CausalFM to perform Bayesian causal inference in various settings, including back-door, front-door, and instrumental variable adjustment. Finally, we instantiate CausalFM and explicitly train a foundation model for estimating conditional average treatment effects (CATEs) using back-door adjustment. We show that CausalFM performs competitively for CATE estimation using various synthetic and semi-synthetic benchmarks. In sum, our framework can be used as a general recipe to train foundation models for various causal inference settings. In contrast to the current state-of-the-art in causal inference, CausalFM offers a novel paradigm with the potential to fundamentally change how practitioners perform causal inference in medicine, economics, and other disciplines.</p></details> |  |

Current methods of Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) often rely on task-specific models, which face significant challenges in handling diverse datasets with varying signal characteristics, fault modes and operating conditions. Inspired by advancements in generative pretrained models, we propose RmGPT, a unified model for diagnosis and prognosis tasks. RmGPT introduces a novel generative token-based framework, incorporating Signal Tokens, Prompt Tokens, Time-Frequency Task Tokens and Fault Tokens to handle heterogeneous data within a unified model architecture. We leverage self-supervised learning for robust feature extraction and introduce a next signal token prediction pretraining strategy, alongside efficient prompt learning for task-specific adaptation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RmGPT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms, achieving near-perfect accuracy in diagnosis tasks and exceptionally low errors in prognosis tasks. Notably, RmGPT excels in few-shot learning scenarios, achieving 82\% accuracy in 16-class one-shot experiments, highlighting its adaptability and robustness.

Although increasingly capable TSF methods occur, many of them require domain-specific data collection and model training and do not generalize well when applied in other domains. Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) that are pre-trained on massive heterogeneous time series data aim to overcome these limitations. The prospects for generalizability have spurred the development of a new generation of TSFMs. This study proposes a benchmark, TSFM-Bench, to facilitate comprehensive and unified evaluation of TSFMs. TSFM-Bench covers a wide range of TSFMs, including those based on large language models and those pre-trained on time series data. TSFM-Bench supports multiple forecasting scenarios, including zero-shot, few-shot, and full-shot, enabling assessment across the full range of adaptation strategies. TSFM-Bench also provides a standardized experimental protocols for critical evaluation processes such as dataset splitting, loading, normalization, and few-shot sampling, facilitating consistency and fairness. We report on an extensive evaluation of TSFMs across a diverse range of datasets spanning multiple domains and exhibiting varied statistical characteristics. Specifically, we identify pros and cons and inherent limitations of existing TSFMs, and we propose potential directions for new model designs.</p></details> |  |

Despite these gains, unified models often underperform compared to specialized models in either task. A key challenge in developing unified models lies in the inherent differences between the visual features needed for image understanding versus generation, as well as the distinct training processes required for each modality. In this work, we introduce Pisces, an auto-regressive multimodal foundation model that addresses this challenge through a novel decoupled visual encoding architecture and tailored training techniques optimized for multimodal generation. Combined with meticulous data curation, pretraining, and finetuning, Pisces achieves competitive performance in both image understanding and image generation. We evaluate Pisces on over 20 public benchmarks for image understanding, where it demonstrates strong performance across a wide range of tasks. Additionally, on GenEval, a widely adopted benchmark for image generation, Pisces exhibits robust generative capabilities. Our extensive analysis reveals the synergistic relationship between image understanding and generation, and the benefits of using separate visual encoders, advancing the field of unified multimodal models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Unifi...</summary><p>Unified image understanding and generation model</p></details> |

Accurate burial depth estimation from remote imagery remains difficult due to partial occlusion, poor visibility, and object degradation. This work introduces a computer vision pipeline, called PoseIDON, which combines deep foundation model features with multiview photogrammetry to estimate six degrees of freedom object pose and the orientation of the surrounding seafloor from ROV video. Burial depth is inferred by aligning CAD models of the objects with observed imagery and fitting a local planar approximation of the seafloor. The method is validated using footage of 54 objects, including barrels and munitions, recorded at a historic ocean dumpsite in the San Pedro Basin. The model achieves a mean burial depth error of approximately 10 centimeters and resolves spatial burial patterns that reflect underlying sediment transport processes. This approach enables scalable, non-invasive mapping of seafloor burial and supports environmental assessment at contaminated sites.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we envision that multi-modal multi-task (M3T) federated foundation models (FedFMs) can offer transformative capabilities for XR systems through integrating the representational strength of M3T foundation models (FMs) with the privacy-preserving model training principles of federated learning (FL). We present a modular architecture for FedFMs, which entails different coordination paradigms for model training and aggregations. Central to our vision is the codification of XR challenges that affect the implementation of FedFMs under the SHIFT dimensions: (1) Sensor and modality diversity, (2) Hardware heterogeneity and system-level constraints, (3) Interactivity and embodied personalization, (4) Functional/task variability, and (5) Temporality and environmental variability. We illustrate the manifestation of these dimensions across a set of emerging and anticipated applications of XR systems. Finally, we propose evaluation metrics, dataset requirements, and design tradeoffs necessary for the development of resource-aware FedFMs in XR. This perspective aims to chart the technical and conceptual foundations for context-aware privacy-preserving intelligence in the next generation of XR systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 4 Figures, 8 Tables</p></details> |

Traditionally dominated by a "Model Centric" approach, in which performance gains were primarily pursued through increasingly complex model architectures and hyperparameter optimization, the field is now recognizing a more nuanced "Data-Centric" approach. This emergent framework foregrounds the quality, structure, and relevance of training data as the principal driver of model performance. To operationalize this paradigm shift, we introduce the DataSeeds.AI sample dataset (the "DSD"), initially comprised of approximately 10,610 high-quality human peer-ranked photography images accompanied by extensive multi-tier annotations. The DSD is a foundational computer vision dataset designed to usher in a new standard for commercial image datasets. Representing a small fraction of DataSeeds.AI's 100 million-plus image catalog, the DSD provides a scalable foundation necessary for robust commercial and multimodal AI development.

Unlike previous smaller models focused on single RDB tasks, Griffin unifies the data encoder and task decoder to handle diverse tasks. Additionally, we enhance the architecture by incorporating a cross-attention module and a novel aggregator. Griffin utilizes pretraining on both single-table and RDB datasets, employing advanced encoders for categorical, numerical, and metadata features, along with innovative components such as cross-attention modules and enhanced message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) to capture the complexities of relational data. Evaluated on large-scale, heterogeneous, and temporal graphs extracted from RDBs across various domains (spanning over 150 million nodes), Griffin demonstrates superior or comparable performance to individually trained models, excels in low-data scenarios, and shows strong transferability with similarity and diversity in pretraining across new datasets and tasks, highlighting its potential as a universally applicable foundation model for RDBs.

| **[Accurate and efficient zero-shot 6D pose estimation with frozen foundation models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09784v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating the 6D pose of objects from RGBD data is a fundamental problem in computer vision, with applications in robotics and augmented reality. A key challenge is achieving generalization to novel objects that were not seen during training. Most existing approaches address this by scaling up training on synthetic data tailored to the task, a process that demands substantial computational resources. But is task-specific training really necessary for accurate and efficient 6D pose estimation of novel objects? To answer No!, we introduce FreeZeV2, the second generation of FreeZe: a training-free method that achieves strong generalization to unseen objects by leveraging geometric and vision foundation models pre-trained on unrelated data. FreeZeV2 improves both accuracy and efficiency over FreeZe through three key contributions: (i) a sparse feature extraction strategy that reduces inference-time computation without sacrificing accuracy; (ii) a feature-aware scoring mechanism that improves both pose selection during RANSAC-based 3D registration and the final ranking of pose candidates; and (iii) a modular design that supports ensembles of instance segmentation models, increasing robustness to segmentation masks errors. We evaluate FreeZeV2 on the seven core datasets of the BOP Benchmark, where it establishes a new state-of-the-art in 6D pose estimation of unseen objects. When using the same segmentation masks, FreeZeV2 achieves a remarkable 8x speedup over FreeZe while also improving accuracy by 5%. When using ensembles of segmentation models, FreeZeV2 gains an additional 8% in accuracy while still running 2.5x faster than FreeZe. FreeZeV2 was awarded Best Overall Method at the BOP Challenge 2024.</p></details> | Technical report |
| **[Towards Foundational Models for Dynamical System Reconstruction: Hierarchical Meta-Learning via Mixture of Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05335v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As foundational models reshape scientific discovery, a bottleneck persists in dynamical system reconstruction (DSR): the ability to learn across system hierarchies. Many meta-learning approaches have been applied successfully to single systems, but falter when confronted with sparse, loosely related datasets requiring multiple hierarchies to be learned. Mixture of Experts (MoE) offers a natural paradigm to address these challenges. Despite their potential, we demonstrate that naive MoEs are inadequate for the nuanced demands of hierarchical DSR, largely due to their gradient descent-based gating update mechanism which leads to slow updates and conflicted routing during training. To overcome this limitation, we introduce MixER: Mixture of Expert Reconstructors, a novel sparse top-1 MoE layer employing a custom gating update algorithm based on $K$-means and least squares. Extensive experiments validate MixER's capabilities, demonstrating efficient training and scalability to systems of up to ten parametric ordinary differential equations. However, our layer underperforms state-of-the-art meta-learners in high-data regimes, particularly when each expert is constrained to process only a fraction of a dataset composed of highly related data points. Further analysis with synthetic and neuroscientific time series suggests that the quality of the contextual representations generated by MixER is closely linked to the presence of hierarchical structure in the data.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 11 figures, 7 tables.

| **[Analytic Task Scheduler: Recursive Least Squares Based Method for Continual Learning in Embodied Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09623v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied foundation models are crucial for Artificial Intelligence (AI) interacting with the physical world by integrating multi-modal inputs, such as proprioception, vision and language, to understand human intentions and generate actions to control robots. While these models demonstrate strong generalization and few-shot learning capabilities, they face significant challenges in continually acquiring new skills without forgetting previously learned skills, a problem known as catastrophic forgetting. To address this issue, we propose the Analytic Task Scheduler (ATS), a novel framework for continual learning in embodied foundation models. ATS consists of a task-specific model library, where each model is fine-tuned independently on a single task, and an analytic scheduler trained using recursive least squares (RLS) to learn the mapping between language instructions and task-specific models. This architecture enables accurate task recognition and dynamic model selection while fundamentally avoiding parameter interference across tasks. The scheduler updates its parameters incrementally using only statistics (autocorrelation and cross-correlation matrices), enabling forgetting-resistant learning without the need to revisit historical data. We validate ATS on a real-world robot platform (RM65B), demonstrating superior resistance to forgetting and strong adaptability to task variations. The results highlight ATS as an effective, scalable, and deployable solution for continual learning in embodied foundation models operating in complex, dynamic environments. Our code will be available at https://github.com/MIAA-Embodied-AI/AnalyticTaskScheduler</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Overconfidence: Foundation Models Redefine Calibration in Deep Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09593v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reliable uncertainty calibration is essential for safely deploying deep neural networks in high-stakes applications. Deep neural networks are known to exhibit systematic overconfidence, especially under distribution shifts. Although foundation models such as ConvNeXt, EVA and BEiT have demonstrated significant improvements in predictive performance, their calibration properties remain underexplored. This paper presents a comprehensive investigation into the calibration behavior of foundation models, revealing insights that challenge established paradigms. Our empirical analysis shows that these models tend to be underconfident in in-distribution predictions, resulting in higher calibration errors, while demonstrating improved calibration under distribution shifts. Furthermore, we demonstrate that foundation models are highly responsive to post-hoc calibration techniques in the in-distribution setting, enabling practitioners to effectively mitigate underconfidence bias. However, these methods become progressively less reliable under severe distribution shifts and can occasionally produce counterproductive results. Our findings highlight the complex, non-monotonic effects of architectural and training innovations on calibration, challenging established narratives of continuous improvement.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Finetuning Tabular Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08982v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models are an emerging research direction in tabular deep learning. Notably, TabPFNv2 recently claimed superior performance over traditional GBDT-based methods on small-scale datasets using an in-context learning paradigm, which does not adapt model parameters to target datasets. However, the optimal finetuning approach for adapting tabular foundational models, and how this adaptation reshapes their internal mechanisms, remains underexplored. While prior works studied finetuning for earlier foundational models, inconsistent findings and TabPFNv2's unique architecture necessitate fresh investigation. To address these questions, we first systematically evaluate various finetuning strategies on diverse datasets. Our findings establish full finetuning as the most practical solution for TabPFNv2 in terms of time-efficiency and effectiveness. We then investigate how finetuning alters TabPFNv2's inner mechanisms, drawing an analogy to retrieval-augmented models. We reveal that the success of finetuning stems from the fact that after gradient-based adaptation, the dot products of the query-representations of test objects and the key-representations of in-context training objects more accurately reflect their target similarity. This improved similarity allows finetuned TabPFNv2 to better approximate target dependency by appropriately weighting relevant in-context samples, improving the retrieval-based prediction logic. From the practical perspective, we managed to finetune TabPFNv2 on datasets with up to 50K objects, observing performance improvements on almost all tasks. More precisely, on academic datasets with I.I.D. splits, finetuning allows TabPFNv2 to achieve state-of-the-art results, while on datasets with gradual temporal shifts and rich feature sets, TabPFNv2 is less stable and prior methods remain better.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Open Foundation Language Model and Corpus for Macedonian: A Low-Resource Language](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09560v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increase in technological adoption worldwide comes with demands for novel tools to be used by the general population. Large Language Models (LLMs) provide a great opportunity in this respect, but their capabilities remain limited for low-resource languages, restricting applications in countries where such languages are spoken. We create several resources to facilitate the adoption of LLMs and to support research advancements for Macedonian. We collect the largest Macedonian corpus to date, consisting of 40GB of textual data and totaling 3.5B words. To support conversational applications, we collect a 106k-instance instruction dataset, carefully built to be culturally grounded. For evaluation, we construct a Macedonian evaluation suite covering seven benchmarks. Finally, we train domestic-yak, a state-of-the-art 8B-parameter model, on our curated datasets and evaluate it against eight baseline models using the newly constructed benchmark suite. Our model outperforms all existing models in the 8B parameter range across all benchmarks, and achieves performance comparable to models up to 10x larger. Furthermore, a qualitative analysis with native speakers reveals that our model is preferred over larger counterparts, receiving higher ratings for grammatical correctness and cultural appropriateness. All datasets, code, and model weights are openly released, setting a foundation for advancing LLMs in similarly underrepresented languages. These resources are publicly available at github.com/LVSTCK for source code, and at huggingface.co/LVSTCK for pretrained model weights and data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Camer...</summary><p>Camera-ready version accepted at SlavNLP-2025@ACL</p></details> |

However, developing AI models often requires extensive annotation, and existing models tend to underperform on independent, unseen data. Foundation models (FMs), large AI models trained on vast unlabeled datasets, have shown promise in overcoming these challenges. Nonetheless, available FMs for ophthalmology lack extensive validation, especially for segmentation tasks, and focus on a single imaging modality. In this context, we propose MIRAGE, a novel multimodal FM for the analysis of OCT and scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (SLO) images. Additionally, we propose a new evaluation benchmark with OCT/SLO classification and segmentation tasks. The comparison with general and specialized FMs and segmentation methods shows the superiority of MIRAGE in both types of tasks, highlighting its suitability as a basis for the development of robust AI systems for retinal OCT image analysis. Both MIRAGE and the evaluation benchmark are publicly available: https://github.com/j-morano/MIRAGE.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reciprocity as the Foundational Substrate of Society: How Reciprocal Dynamics Scale into Social Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08319v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prevailing accounts in both multi-agent AI and the social sciences explain social structure through top-down abstractions-such as institutions, norms, or trust-yet lack simulateable models of how such structures emerge from individual behavior. Ethnographic and archaeological evidence suggests that reciprocity served as the foundational mechanism of early human societies, enabling economic circulation, social cohesion, and interpersonal obligation long before the rise of formal institutions. Modern financial systems such as credit and currency can likewise be viewed as scalable extensions of reciprocity, formalizing exchange across time and anonymity. Building on this insight, we argue that reciprocity is not merely a local or primitive exchange heuristic, but the scalable substrate from which large-scale social structures can emerge. We propose a three-stage framework to model this emergence: reciprocal dynamics at the individual level, norm stabilization through shared expectations, and the construction of durable institutional patterns. This approach offers a cognitively minimal, behaviorally grounded foundation for simulating how large-scale social systems can emerge from decentralized reciprocal interaction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Posit...</summary><p>Position paper extending arXiv:2505.02945.

| **[MIRA: Medical Time Series Foundation Model for Real-World Health Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07584v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A unified foundation model for medical time series -- pretrained on open access and ethics board-approved medical corpora -- offers the potential to reduce annotation burdens, minimize model customization, and enable robust transfer across clinical institutions, modalities, and tasks, particularly in data-scarce or privacy-constrained environments. However, existing generalist time series foundation models struggle to handle medical time series data due to their inherent challenges, including irregular intervals, heterogeneous sampling rates, and frequent missing values. To address these challenges, we introduce MIRA, a unified foundation model specifically designed for medical time series forecasting. MIRA incorporates a Continuous-Time Rotary Positional Encoding that enables fine-grained modeling of variable time intervals, a frequency-specific mixture-of-experts layer that routes computation across latent frequency regimes to further promote temporal specialization, and a Continuous Dynamics Extrapolation Block based on Neural ODE that models the continuous trajectory of latent states, enabling accurate forecasting at arbitrary target timestamps. Pretrained on a large-scale and diverse medical corpus comprising over 454 billion time points collect from publicly available datasets, MIRA achieves reductions in forecasting errors by an average of 10% and 7% in out-of-distribution and in-distribution scenarios, respectively, when compared to other zero-shot and fine-tuned baselines. We also introduce a comprehensive benchmark spanning multiple downstream clinical tasks, establishing a foundation for future research in medical time series modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adapting Vision-Language Foundation Model for Next Generation Medical Ultrasound Image Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08849v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical ultrasonography is an essential imaging technique for examining superficial organs and tissues, including lymph nodes, breast, and thyroid. It employs high-frequency ultrasound waves to generate detailed images of the internal structures of the human body. However, manually contouring regions of interest in these images is a labor-intensive task that demands expertise and often results in inconsistent interpretations among individuals. Vision-language foundation models, which have excelled in various computer vision applications, present new opportunities for enhancing ultrasound image analysis. Yet, their performance is hindered by the significant differences between natural and medical imaging domains. This research seeks to overcome these challenges by developing domain adaptation methods for vision-language foundation models. In this study, we explore the fine-tuning pipeline for vision-language foundation models by utilizing large language model as text refiner with special-designed adaptation strategies and task-driven heads. Our approach has been extensively evaluated on six ultrasound datasets and two tasks: segmentation and classification. The experimental results show that our method can effectively improve the performance of vision-language foundation models for ultrasound image analysis, and outperform the existing state-of-the-art vision-language and pure foundation models.

Existing approaches primarily fall into two categories: (1) Methods that generate discrete speech tokens independently without incorporating them into the LLM's autoregressive process, resulting in text generation being unaware of concurrent speech synthesis. (2) Models that generate interleaved or parallel speech-text tokens through joint autoregressive modeling, enabling mutual modality awareness during generation. This paper presents OmniDRCA, a parallel speech-text foundation model based on joint autoregressive modeling, featuring dual-resolution speech representations and contrastive cross-modal alignment. Our approach processes speech and text representations in parallel while enhancing audio comprehension through contrastive alignment. Experimental results on Spoken Question Answering benchmarks demonstrate that OmniDRCA establishes new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among parallel joint speech-text modeling based foundation models, and achieves competitive performance compared to interleaved models. Additionally, we explore the potential of extending the framework to full-duplex conversational scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Leveraging the Qwen3 LLMs' robust capabilities in multilingual text understanding and generation, our innovative multi-stage training pipeline combines large-scale unsupervised pre-training with supervised fine-tuning on high-quality datasets. Effective model merging strategies further ensure the robustness and adaptability of the Qwen3 Embedding series. During the training process, the Qwen3 LLMs serve not only as backbone models but also play a crucial role in synthesizing high-quality, rich, and diverse training data across multiple domains and languages, thus enhancing the training pipeline. The Qwen3 Embedding series offers a spectrum of model sizes (0.6B, 4B, 8B) for both embedding and reranking tasks, addressing diverse deployment scenarios where users can optimize for either efficiency or effectiveness. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the Qwen3 Embedding series achieves state-of-the-art results across diverse benchmarks. Notably, it excels on the multilingual evaluation benchmark MTEB for text embedding, as well as in various retrieval tasks, including code retrieval, cross-lingual retrieval and multilingual retrieval.

We introduce GIQ , a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the geometric reasoning capabilities of vision and vision-language foundation models. GIQ comprises synthetic and real-world images of 224 diverse polyhedra - including Platonic, Archimedean, Johnson, and Catalan solids, as well as stellations and compound shapes - covering varying levels of complexity and symmetry. Through systematic experiments involving monocular 3D reconstruction, 3D symmetry detection, mental rotation tests, and zero-shot shape classification tasks, we reveal significant shortcomings in current models. State-of-the-art reconstruction algorithms trained on extensive 3D datasets struggle to reconstruct even basic geometric forms accurately. While foundation models effectively detect specific 3D symmetry elements via linear probing, they falter significantly in tasks requiring detailed geometric differentiation, such as mental rotation. Moreover, advanced vision-language assistants exhibit remarkably low accuracy on complex polyhedra, systematically misinterpreting basic properties like face geometry, convexity, and compound structures. GIQ is publicly available, providing a structured platform to highlight and address critical gaps in geometric intelligence, facilitating future progress in robust, geometry-aware representation learning.</p></details> | 15 pages, 4 figures |
| **[CodeBrain: Bridging Decoupled Tokenizer and Multi-Scale Architecture for EEG Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09110v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electroencephalography (EEG) provides real-time insights into brain activity and is widely used in neuroscience. However, variations in channel configurations, sequence lengths, and task objectives limit the transferability of traditional task-specific models. Although recent EEG foundation models (EFMs) aim to learn generalizable representations, they struggle with limited heterogeneous representation capacity and inefficiency in capturing multi-scale brain dependencies. To address these challenges, we propose CodeBrain, an efficient EFM structurally aligned with brain organization, trained in two stages. (1) We introduce a TFDual-Tokenizer that independently tokenizes heterogeneous temporal and frequency components, enabling a quadratic expansion of the discrete representation space. This also offers a degree of interpretability through cross-domain token analysis. (2) We propose the EEGSSM, which combines a structured global convolution architecture and a sliding window attention mechanism to jointly model sparse long-range and local dependencies. Unlike fully connected Transformer models, EEGSSM better reflects the brain's small-world topology and efficiently captures EEG's inherent multi-scale structure. EEGSSM is trained with a masked self-supervised learning objective to predict token indices obtained in TFDual-Tokenizer. Comprehensive experiments on 10 public EEG datasets demonstrate the generalizability of CodeBrain with linear probing. By offering biologically informed and interpretable EEG modeling, CodeBrain lays the foundation for future neuroscience research. Both code and pretraining weights will be released in the future version.</p></details> |  |

However, the lack of benchmarks for this data constrains progress towards Landsat-based Geospatial Foundation Models (GFM). In this paper, we introduce Landsat-Bench, a suite of three benchmarks with Landsat imagery that adapt from existing remote sensing datasets -- EuroSAT-L, BigEarthNet-L, and LC100-L. We establish baseline and standardized evaluation methods across both common architectures and Landsat foundation models pretrained on the SSL4EO-L dataset. Notably, we provide evidence that SSL4EO-L pretrained GFMs extract better representations for downstream tasks in comparison to ImageNet, including performance gains of +4% OA and +5.1% mAP on EuroSAT-L and BigEarthNet-L.</p></details> |  |

While recent foundation models using only RGB inputs have shown strong performance, they often fail to generalize in out-of-distribution (OOD) environments with unseen objects or variations in camera parameters (e.g., field of view, pose, or focal length). Without fine-tuning, these models may generate unsafe trajectories that lead to collisions, requiring costly data collection and retraining. CARE addresses this limitation by seamlessly integrating with any RGB-based navigation system that outputs local trajectories, dynamically adjusting them using repulsive force vectors derived from monocular depth maps. We evaluate CARE by combining it with state-of-the-art vision-based navigation models across multiple robot platforms. CARE consistently reduces collision rates (up to 100%) without sacrificing goal-reaching performance and improves collision-free travel distance by up to 10.7x in exploration tasks.</p></details> | 16 pages, 6 figures |

Instead of relying on manually annotated examples, FMs are pre-trained to learn general-purpose visual features that can later be adapted to specific clinical tasks with little additional supervision. In this review, we examine how FMs are being developed and applied in pathology, radiology, and ophthalmology, drawing on evidence from over 150 studies. We explain the core components of FM pipelines, including model architectures, self-supervised learning methods, and strategies for downstream adaptation. We also review how FMs are being used in each imaging domain and compare design choices across applications. Finally, we discuss key challenges and open questions to guide future research.</p></details> |  |

A common approach pairs VFMs with large language models (LLMs) as general-purpose heads, followed by evaluation on broad Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks. However, this protocol has two key blind spots: (i) the instruction tuning data may not align with VQA test distributions, meaning a wrong prediction can stem from such data mismatch rather than a VFM' visual shortcomings; (ii) VQA benchmarks often require multiple visual abilities, making it hard to tell whether errors stem from lacking all required abilities or just a single critical one. To address these gaps, we introduce AVA-Bench, the first benchmark that explicitly disentangles 14 Atomic Visual Abilities (AVAs) -- foundational skills like localization, depth estimation, and spatial understanding that collectively support complex visual reasoning tasks. By decoupling AVAs and matching training and test distributions within each, AVA-Bench pinpoints exactly where a VFM excels or falters. Applying AVA-Bench to leading VFMs thus reveals distinctive "ability fingerprints," turning VFM selection from educated guesswork into principled engineering. Notably, we find that a 0.5B LLM yields similar VFM rankings as a 7B LLM while cutting GPU hours by 8x, enabling more efficient evaluation. By offering a comprehensive and transparent benchmark, we hope AVA-Bench lays the foundation for the next generation of VFMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>First...</summary><p>First two authors contribute equally</p></details> |

This paper revisits and expands the concept of the Waste Factor (W), or Waste Figure (WF) in decibel scale, as a unifying metric that captures both utilized and wasted power in cascaded communication systems. Building upon its foundation in system-level power modeling, we integrate the Waste Factor into a refined formulation of the Consumption Factor (CF), the ratio of data rate to total consumed power, linking it directly to Shannon's theoretical limit on energy per bit. This analysis introduces additive energy waste into the classical energy-per-bit derivation through the Waste Factor term. We derive closed-form expressions for energy-per-bit expenditure in both direct and relay-assisted links and develop a decision rule to determine which communication path is more energy efficient under given conditions. While not modeled explicitly, Reflective Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) can be interpreted as a special case of relay-based architectures within this unified formulation, suggesting broader applicability of the Waste Factor framework to emerging 6G use cases. The framework is then extended to a Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) scenario, where uplink and downlink asymmetries, traffic directionality, and component inefficiencies are jointly considered to analyze energy-optimal deployment strategies.</p></details> |  |

A key enabler is the real-time, accurate estimation of core 3D attributes (camera parameters, point clouds, depth maps, and 3D point tracks) from unstructured or streaming imagery. Inspired by the success of large foundation models in language and 2D vision, a new class of end-to-end 3D geometric foundation models (GFMs) has emerged, directly predicting dense 3D representations in a single feed-forward pass, eliminating the need for slow or unavailable precomputed camera parameters. Since late 2023, the field has exploded with diverse variants, but systematic evaluation is lacking. In this work, we present the first comprehensive benchmark for 3D GFMs, covering five core tasks: sparse-view depth estimation, video depth estimation, 3D reconstruction, multi-view pose estimation, novel view synthesis, and spanning both standard and challenging out-of-distribution datasets. Our standardized toolkit automates dataset handling, evaluation protocols, and metric computation to ensure fair, reproducible comparisons. We evaluate 16 state-of-the-art GFMs, revealing their strengths and limitations across tasks and domains, and derive key insights to guide future model scaling and optimization. All code, evaluation scripts, and processed data will be publicly released to accelerate research in 3D spatial intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://e3dbench.github.io/</p></details> |

It remains challenging to precisely characterize even a fraction of the full spectrum of these abilities and potential risks in any new model. Existing evaluation approaches often require significant human effort, and it is taking increasing effort to design ever harder challenges for more capable models. We introduce Automated Capability Discovery (ACD), a framework that designates one foundation model as a scientist to systematically propose open-ended tasks probing the abilities of a subject model (potentially itself). By combining frontier models with ideas from the field of open-endedness, ACD automatically and systematically uncovers a diverse spectrum of surprising capabilities and failures in the subject model. We demonstrate ACD across a range of foundation models (including the GPT, Claude, and Llama series), showing that it automatically generates thousands of distinct tasks, which are then clustered to reveal dozens of broader capability areas and failure modes, that would be challenging for any single team to uncover. We further validate our method's automated scoring with extensive human surveys, observing high agreement between model-generated and human evaluations.

| **[How Expressive are Knowledge Graph Foundation Models?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13339v2)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge Graph Foundation Models (KGFMs) are at the frontier for deep learning on knowledge graphs (KGs), as they can generalize to completely novel knowledge graphs with different relational vocabularies. Despite their empirical success, our theoretical understanding of KGFMs remains very limited. In this paper, we conduct a rigorous study of the expressive power of KGFMs. Specifically, we show that the expressive power of KGFMs directly depends on the motifs that are used to learn the relation representations. We then observe that the most typical motifs used in the existing literature are binary, as the representations are learned based on how pairs of relations interact, which limits the model's expressiveness. As part of our study, we design more expressive KGFMs using richer motifs, which necessitate learning relation representations based on, e.g., how triples of relations interact with each other. Finally, we empirically validate our theoretical findings, showing that the use of richer motifs results in better performance on a wide range of datasets drawn from different domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attacking Attention of Foundation Models Disrupts Downstream Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05394v2)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models represent the most prominent and recent paradigm shift in artificial intelligence. Foundation models are large models, trained on broad data that deliver high accuracy in many downstream tasks, often without fine-tuning. For this reason, models such as CLIP , DINO or Vision Transfomers (ViT), are becoming the bedrock of many industrial AI-powered applications. However, the reliance on pre-trained foundation models also introduces significant security concerns, as these models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Such attacks involve deliberately crafted inputs designed to deceive AI systems, jeopardizing their reliability. This paper studies the vulnerabilities of vision foundation models, focusing specifically on CLIP and ViTs, and explores the transferability of adversarial attacks to downstream tasks. We introduce a novel attack, targeting the structure of transformer-based architectures in a task-agnostic fashion. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our attack on several downstream tasks: classification, captioning, image/text retrieval, segmentation and depth estimation.

| **[HeTa: Relation-wise Heterogeneous Graph Foundation Attack Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07428v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) are vulnerable, highlighting the need for tailored attacks to assess their robustness and ensure security. However, existing HGNN attacks often require complex retraining of parameters to generate specific perturbations for new scenarios. Recently, foundation models have opened new horizons for the generalization of graph neural networks by capturing shared semantics across various graph distributions. This leads us to ask:Can we design a foundation attack model for HGNNs that enables generalizable perturbations across different HGNNs, and quickly adapts to new heterogeneous graphs (HGs)? Empirical findings reveal that, despite significant differences in model design and parameter space, different HGNNs surprisingly share common vulnerability patterns from a relation-aware perspective. Therefore, we explore how to design foundation HGNN attack criteria by mining shared attack units. In this paper, we propose a novel relation-wise heterogeneous graph foundation attack model, HeTa. We introduce a foundation surrogate model to align heterogeneity and identify the importance of shared relation-aware attack units. Building on this, we implement a serialized relation-by-relation attack based on the identified relational weights. In this way, the perturbation can be transferred to various target HGNNs and easily fine-tuned for new HGs. Extensive experiments exhibit powerful attack performances and generalizability of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[DINO-CoDT: Multi-class Collaborative Detection and Tracking with Vision Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07375v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collaborative perception plays a crucial role in enhancing environmental understanding by expanding the perceptual range and improving robustness against sensor failures, which primarily involves collaborative 3D detection and tracking tasks. The former focuses on object recognition in individual frames, while the latter captures continuous instance tracklets over time. However, existing works in both areas predominantly focus on the vehicle superclass, lacking effective solutions for both multi-class collaborative detection and tracking. This limitation hinders their applicability in real-world scenarios, which involve diverse object classes with varying appearances and motion patterns. To overcome these limitations, we propose a multi-class collaborative detection and tracking framework tailored for diverse road users. We first present a detector with a global spatial attention fusion (GSAF) module, enhancing multi-scale feature learning for objects of varying sizes. Next, we introduce a tracklet RE-IDentification (REID) module that leverages visual semantics with a vision foundation model to effectively reduce ID SWitch (IDSW) errors, in cases of erroneous mismatches involving small objects like pedestrians. We further design a velocity-based adaptive tracklet management (VATM) module that adjusts the tracking interval dynamically based on object motion. Extensive experiments on the V2X-Real and OPV2V datasets show that our approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both detection and tracking accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[E-BATS: Efficient Backpropagation-Free Test-Time Adaptation for Speech Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07078v1)** | 2025-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speech Foundation Models encounter significant performance degradation when deployed in real-world scenarios involving acoustic domain shifts, such as background noise and speaker accents. Test-time adaptation (TTA) has recently emerged as a viable strategy to address such domain shifts at inference time without requiring access to source data or labels. However, existing TTA approaches, particularly those relying on backpropagation, are memory-intensive, limiting their applicability in speech tasks and resource-constrained settings. Although backpropagation-free methods offer improved efficiency, existing ones exhibit poor accuracy. This is because they are predominantly developed for vision tasks, which fundamentally differ from speech task formulations, noise characteristics, and model architecture, posing unique transferability challenges. In this paper, we introduce E-BATS, the first Efficient BAckpropagation-free TTA framework designed explicitly for speech foundation models. E-BATS achieves a balance between adaptation effectiveness and memory efficiency through three key components: (i) lightweight prompt adaptation for a forward-pass-based feature alignment, (ii) a multi-scale loss to capture both global (utterance-level) and local distribution shifts (token-level) and (iii) a test-time exponential moving average mechanism for stable adaptation across utterances. Experiments conducted on four noisy speech datasets spanning sixteen acoustic conditions demonstrate consistent improvements, with 4.1%-13.5% accuracy gains over backpropagation-free baselines and 2.0-6.4 times GPU memory savings compared to backpropagation-based methods. By enabling scalable and robust adaptation under acoustic variability, this work paves the way for developing more efficient adaptation approaches for practical speech processing systems in real-world environments.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[FairPFN: A Tabular Foundation Model for Causal Fairness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07049v1)** | 2025-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning (ML) systems are utilized in critical sectors, such as healthcare, law enforcement, and finance. However, these systems are often trained on historical data that contains demographic biases, leading to ML decisions that perpetuate or exacerbate existing social inequalities. Causal fairness provides a transparent, human-in-the-loop framework to mitigate algorithmic discrimination, aligning closely with legal doctrines of direct and indirect discrimination. However, current causal fairness frameworks hold a key limitation in that they assume prior knowledge of the correct causal model, restricting their applicability in complex fairness scenarios where causal models are unknown or difficult to identify. To bridge this gap, we propose FairPFN, a tabular foundation model pre-trained on synthetic causal fairness data to identify and mitigate the causal effects of protected attributes in its predictions. FairPFN's key contribution is that it requires no knowledge of the causal model and still demonstrates strong performance in identifying and removing protected causal effects across a diverse set of hand-crafted and real-world scenarios relative to robust baseline methods. FairPFN paves the way for promising future research, making causal fairness more accessible to a wider variety of complex fairness problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vector-Quantized Vision Foundation Models for Object-Centric Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20263v3)** | 2025-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Perceiving visual scenes as objects and background -- like humans do -- Object-Centric Learning (OCL) aggregates image or video feature maps into object-level feature vectors, termed \textit{slots}. OCL's self-supervision of reconstructing the input from these aggregated slots struggles with complex object textures, thus Vision Foundation Model (VFM) representations are used as the aggregation input and reconstruction target. However, existing methods leverage VFM representations in diverse ways and often fail to fully exploit their potential. In response, we propose a clean architecture -- Vector-Quantized VFMs for OCL (VQ-VFM-OCL, or VVO) -- that unifies mainstream OCL methods. The key to our unification is simple yet effective, just shared quantizing the same VFM representation as the reconstruction target. Through mathematical modeling and statistical verification, we further analyze why VFM representations facilitate OCL aggregation and how their shared quantization as reconstruction targets strengthens OCL supervision. Experiments show that across different VFMs, aggregators and decoders, our VVO consistently outperforms baselines in object discovery and recognition, as well as downstream visual prediction and reasoning. The implementation and model checkpoints are available on https://github.com/Genera1Z/VQ-VFM-OCL.</p></details> |  |

As vision foundation models (VFMs) increasingly serve as the backbone of vision applications, it remains unclear how SSL interacts with these pre-trained models. To address this gap, we develop new SSL benchmark datasets where frozen VFMs underperform and systematically evaluate representative SSL methods. We make a surprising observation: parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) using only labeled data often matches SSL performance, even without leveraging unlabeled data. This motivates us to revisit self-training, a conceptually simple SSL baseline, where we use the supervised PEFT model to pseudo-label unlabeled data for further training. To overcome the notorious issue of noisy pseudo-labels, we propose ensembling multiple PEFT approaches and VFM backbones to produce more robust pseudo-labels. Empirical results validate the effectiveness of this simple yet powerful approach, providing actionable insights into SSL with VFMs and paving the way for more scalable and practical semi-supervised learning in the era of foundation models.</p></details> |  |

However, the complexity of surgical scenes, characterized by high variability in different surgical activity scenarios and confused image features between targets and the background, presents challenges for surgical environment understanding. Traditional deep learning models often struggle with cross-activity interference, leading to suboptimal performance in each downstream task. To address this limitation, we explore multi-task learning, which utilizes the interrelated features between tasks to enhance overall task performance. In this paper, we propose EndoARSS, a novel multi-task learning framework specifically designed for endoscopy surgery activity recognition and semantic segmentation. Built upon the DINOv2 foundation model, our approach integrates Low-Rank Adaptation to facilitate efficient fine-tuning while incorporating Task Efficient Shared Low-Rank Adapters to mitigate gradient conflicts across diverse tasks. Additionally, we introduce the Spatially-Aware Multi-Scale Attention that enhances feature representation discrimination by enabling cross-spatial learning of global information. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of our framework, we present three novel datasets, MTLESD, MTLEndovis and MTLEndovis-Gen, tailored for endoscopic surgery scenarios with detailed annotations for both activity recognition and semantic segmentation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EndoARSS achieves remarkable performance across multiple benchmarks, significantly improving both accuracy and robustness in comparison to existing models. These results underscore the potential of EndoARSS to advance AI-driven endoscopic surgical systems, offering valuable insights for enhancing surgical safety and efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Advanced Intelligent Systems</p></details> |
| **[IQFM A Wireless Foundational Model for I/Q Streams in AI-Native 6G](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06718v1)** | 2025-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundational models have shown remarkable potential in natural language processing and computer vision, yet remain in their infancy in wireless communications. While a few efforts have explored image-based modalities such as channel state information (CSI) and frequency spectrograms, foundational models that operate directly on raw IQ data remain largely unexplored. This paper presents, IQFM, the first I/Q signal foundational model for wireless communications. IQFM supporting diverse tasks: modulation classification, angle-of-arrival (AoA), beam prediction, and RF fingerprinting, without heavy preprocessing or handcrafted features. We also introduce a task-aware augmentation strategy that categorizes transformations into core augmentations, such as cyclic time shifting, and task-specific augmentations. This strategy forms the basis for structured, task-dependent representation learning within a contrastive self-supervised learning (SSL) framework. Using this strategy, the lightweight encoder, pre-trained via SSL on over-the-air multi-antenna IQ data, achieves up to 99.67% and 65.45% accuracy on modulation and AoA classification, respectively, using only one labeled sample per class, outperforming supervised baselines by up to 7x and 145x. The model also generalizes to out-of-distribution tasks; when adapted to new tasks using only 500 samples per class and minimal parameter updates via LoRA, the same frozen encoder achieves 94.15% on beam prediction (vs. 89.53% supervised), 50.00% on RML2016a modulation classification (vs. 49.30%), and 96.05% on RF fingerprinting (vs. 96.64%). These results demonstrate the potential of raw IQ-based foundational models as efficient, reusable encoders for multi-task learning in AI-native 6G systems.</p></details> |  |

However, building analogous models for human mobility remains challenging due to the privacy-sensitive nature of mobility data and the resulting data silos across institutions. To bridge this gap, we propose MoveGCL, a scalable and privacy-preserving framework for training mobility foundation models via generative continual learning. Without sharing raw data, MoveGCL enables decentralized and progressive model evolution by replaying synthetic trajectories generated from a frozen teacher model, and reinforces knowledge retention through a tailored distillation strategy that mitigates catastrophic forgetting. To address the heterogeneity of mobility patterns, MoveGCL incorporates a Mixture-of-Experts Transformer with a mobility-aware expert routing mechanism, and employs a layer-wise progressive adaptation strategy to stabilize continual updates. Experiments on six real-world urban datasets demonstrate that MoveGCL achieves performance comparable to joint training and significantly outperforms federated learning baselines, while offering strong privacy protection. MoveGCL marks a crucial step toward unlocking foundation models for mobility, offering a practical blueprint for open, scalable, and privacy-preserving model development in the era of foundation models.</p></details> |  |

This paper investigates the use of standard RGB imagery, a cost-effective sensing modality, for key pre-processing tasks in an automated system. We present computer vision components designed for a conveyor belt setup to perform (a) classification of four common textile types and (b) segmentation of non-textile features such as buttons and zippers. For classification, several pre-trained architectures were evaluated using transfer learning and cross-validation, with EfficientNetB0 achieving the best performance on a held-out test set with 81.25\% accuracy. For feature segmentation, a zero-shot approach combining the Grounding DINO open-vocabulary detector with the Segment Anything Model (SAM) was employed, demonstrating excellent performance with a mIoU of 0.90 for the generated masks against ground truth. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using RGB images coupled with modern deep learning techniques, including transfer learning for classification and foundation models for zero-shot segmentation, to enable essential analysis steps for automated textile recycling pipelines.</p></details> |  |

Our model, called BrainMorph, serves as a tool that supports multi-modal, pairwise, and scalable groupwise registration. BrainMorph is trained on a massive dataset of over 100,000 3D volumes, skull-stripped and non-skull-stripped, from nearly 16,000 unique healthy and diseased subjects. BrainMorph is robust to large misalignments, interpretable via interrogating automatically-extracted keypoints, and enables rapid and controllable generation of many plausible transformations with different alignment types and different degrees of nonlinearity at test-time. We demonstrate the superiority of BrainMorph in solving 3D rigid, affine, and nonlinear registration on a variety of multi-modal brain MRI scans of healthy and diseased subjects, in both the pairwise and groupwise setting. In particular, we show registration accuracy and speeds that surpass many classical and learning-based methods, especially in the context of large initial misalignments and large group settings.

While recent foundation models have demonstrated promising generalization across EO tasks, many remain limited by the scale, geographical coverage, and spectral diversity of their training data, factors critical for learning globally transferable representations. In this work, we introduce TerraFM, a scalable self-supervised learning model that leverages globally distributed Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery, combined with large spatial tiles and land-cover aware sampling to enrich spatial and semantic coverage. By treating sensing modalities as natural augmentations in our self-supervised approach, we unify radar and optical inputs via modality-specific patch embeddings and adaptive cross-attention fusion. Our training strategy integrates local-global contrastive learning and introduces a dual-centering mechanism that incorporates class-frequency-aware regularization to address long-tailed distributions in land cover.TerraFM achieves strong generalization on both classification and segmentation tasks, outperforming prior models on GEO-Bench and Copernicus-Bench. Our code and pretrained models are publicly available at: https://github.com/mbzuai-oryx/TerraFM .</p></details> |  |
| **[RecGPT: A Foundation Model for Sequential Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06270v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work addresses a fundamental barrier in recommender systems: the inability to generalize across domains without extensive retraining. Traditional ID-based approaches fail entirely in cold-start and cross-domain scenarios where new users or items lack sufficient interaction history. Inspired by foundation models' cross-domain success, we develop a foundation model for sequential recommendation that achieves genuine zero-shot generalization capabilities. Our approach fundamentally departs from existing ID-based methods by deriving item representations exclusively from textual features. This enables immediate embedding of any new item without model retraining. We introduce unified item tokenization with Finite Scalar Quantization that transforms heterogeneous textual descriptions into standardized discrete tokens. This eliminates domain barriers that plague existing systems. Additionally, the framework features hybrid bidirectional-causal attention that captures both intra-item token coherence and inter-item sequential dependencies. An efficient catalog-aware beam search decoder enables real-time token-to-item mapping. Unlike conventional approaches confined to their training domains, RecGPT naturally bridges diverse recommendation contexts through its domain-invariant tokenization mechanism. Comprehensive evaluations across six datasets and industrial scenarios demonstrate consistent performance advantages.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bootstrapping World Models from Dynamics Models in Multimodal Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06006v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To what extent do vision-and-language foundation models possess a realistic world model (observation $\times$ action $\rightarrow$ observation) and a dynamics model (observation $\times$ observation $\rightarrow$ action), when actions are expressed through language? While open-source foundation models struggle with both, we find that fine-tuning them to acquire a dynamics model through supervision is significantly easier than acquiring a world model. In turn, dynamics models can be used to bootstrap world models through two main strategies: 1) weakly supervised learning from synthetic data and 2) inference time verification. Firstly, the dynamics model can annotate actions for unlabelled pairs of video frame observations to expand the training data. We further propose a new objective, where image tokens in observation pairs are weighted by their importance, as predicted by a recognition model. Secondly, the dynamics models can assign rewards to multiple samples of the world model to score them, effectively guiding search at inference time. We evaluate the world models resulting from both strategies through the task of action-centric image editing on Aurora-Bench. Our best model achieves a performance competitive with state-of-the-art image editing models, improving on them by a margin of $15\%$ on real-world subsets according to GPT4o-as-judge, and achieving the best average human evaluation across all subsets of Aurora-Bench.</p></details> |  |

While existing methods rely on specialized architectures and dataset-specific fusion strategies, they struggle to learn universal representations that generalize across datasets and handle missing modalities at inference time. To address these issues, we propose PhysioOmni, a foundation model for multimodal physiological signal analysis that models both homogeneous and heterogeneous features to decouple multimodal signals and extract generic representations while maintaining compatibility with arbitrary missing modalities. PhysioOmni trains a decoupled multimodal tokenizer, enabling masked signal pre-training via modality-invariant and modality-specific objectives. To ensure adaptability to diverse and incomplete modality combinations, the pre-trained encoders undergo resilient fine-tuning with prototype alignment on downstream datasets. Extensive experiments on four downstream tasks, emotion recognition, sleep stage classification, motor prediction, and mental workload detection, demonstrate that PhysioOmni achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining strong robustness to missing modalities. Our code and model weights will be released.</p></details> | 19 pages, 5 figures |

Conventional histopathological diagnosis suffers from limited reproducibility and diagnostic variability. To overcome these limitations, we develop Digepath, a specialized foundation model for GI pathology. Our framework introduces a dual-phase iterative optimization strategy combining pretraining with fine-screening, specifically designed to address the detection of sparsely distributed lesion areas in whole-slide images. Digepath is pretrained on over 353 million multi-scale images from 210,043 H&E-stained slides of GI diseases. It attains state-of-the-art performance on 33 out of 34 tasks related to GI pathology, including pathological diagnosis, protein expression status prediction, gene mutation prediction, and prognosis evaluation. We further translate the intelligent screening module for early GI cancer and achieve near-perfect 99.70% sensitivity across nine independent medical institutions. This work not only advances AI-driven precision pathology for GI diseases but also bridge critical gaps in histopathological practice.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we introduce MapEval, a benchmark designed to assess foundation models across three distinct tasks - textual, API-based, and visual reasoning - through 700 multiple-choice questions spanning 180 cities and 54 countries, covering spatial relationships, navigation, travel planning, and real-world map interactions. Unlike prior benchmarks that focus on simple location queries, MapEval requires models to handle long-context reasoning, API interactions, and visual map analysis, making it the most comprehensive evaluation framework for geospatial AI. On evaluation of 30 foundation models, including Claude-3.5-Sonnet, GPT-4o, and Gemini-1.5-Pro, none surpass 67% accuracy, with open-source models performing significantly worse and all models lagging over 20% behind human performance. These results expose critical gaps in spatial inference, as models struggle with distances, directions, route planning, and place-specific reasoning, highlighting the need for better geospatial AI to bridge the gap between foundation models and real-world navigation.

However, these encoding methods lack the ability to interpret or reason about the moral dimensions of content-a crucial aspect of human cognition. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing MoralCLIP, a novel embedding representation method that extends multimodal learning with explicit moral grounding based on Moral Foundations Theory (MFT). Our approach integrates visual and textual moral cues into a unified embedding space, enabling cross-modal moral alignment. MoralCLIP is grounded on the multi-label dataset Social-Moral Image Database to identify co-occurring moral foundations in visual content. For MoralCLIP training, we design a moral data augmentation strategy to scale our annotated dataset to 15,000 image-text pairs labeled with MFT-aligned dimensions. Our results demonstrate that explicit moral supervision improves both unimodal and multimodal understanding of moral content, establishing a foundation for morally-aware AI systems capable of recognizing and aligning with human moral values.</p></details> |  |

Although deep learning has shown success in supporting GI diagnostics and decision-making, these models require curated datasets with labels that are expensive to acquire. Foundation models offer a promising solution by learning general-purpose representations, which can be finetuned for specific tasks, overcoming data scarcity. Developing foundation models for medical imaging holds significant potential, but the sensitive and protected nature of medical data presents unique challenges. Foundation model training typically requires extensive datasets, and while hospitals generate large volumes of data, privacy restrictions prevent direct data sharing, making foundation model training infeasible in most scenarios. In this work, we propose a FL framework for training foundation models for gastroendoscopy imaging, enabling data to remain within local hospital environments while contributing to a shared model. We explore several established FL algorithms, assessing their suitability for training foundation models without relying on task-specific labels, conducting experiments in both homogeneous and heterogeneous settings. We evaluate the trained foundation model on three critical downstream tasks--classification, detection, and segmentation--and demonstrate that it achieves improved performance across all tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach in a federated, privacy-preserving setting.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 11 figures, submitted to BHI2025</p></details> |

However, their internal representations and learned concepts are still not well understood. In this study, we investigate the structure and redundancy of representations across various TSFMs, examining the self-similarity of model layers within and across different model sizes. This analysis reveals block-like redundancy in the representations, which can be utilized for informed pruning to improve inference speed and efficiency. Additionally, we explore the concepts learned by these models - such as periodicity and trends - and how these can be manipulated through latent space steering to influence model behavior. Our experiments show that steering interventions can introduce new features, e.g., adding periodicity or trends to signals that initially lacked them. These findings underscore the value of representational analysis for optimizing models and demonstrate how conceptual steering offers new possibilities for more controlled and efficient time series analysis with TSFMs.</p></details> | Accepted at ICML'25 |

Most PAD systems are trained on one, two, or three ID documents because of privacy protection concerns. As a result, they do not obtain competitive results for commercial purposes when tested in an unknown new ID card country. In this scenario, Foundation Models (FM) trained on huge datasets can help to improve generalisation capabilities. This work intends to improve and benchmark the capabilities of FM and how to use them to adapt the generalisation on PAD of ID Documents. Different test protocols were used, considering zero-shot and fine-tuning and two different ID card datasets. One private dataset based on Chilean IDs and one open-set based on three ID countries: Finland, Spain, and Slovakia. Our findings indicate that bona fide images are the key to generalisation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Single GPU Task Adaptation of Pathology Foundation Models for Whole Slide Image Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05184v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pathology foundation models (PFMs) have emerged as powerful tools for analyzing whole slide images (WSIs). However, adapting these pretrained PFMs for specific clinical tasks presents considerable challenges, primarily due to the availability of only weak (WSI-level) labels for gigapixel images, necessitating multiple instance learning (MIL) paradigm for effective WSI analysis. This paper proposes a novel approach for single-GPU \textbf{T}ask \textbf{A}daptation of \textbf{PFM}s (TAPFM) that uses vision transformer (\vit) attention for MIL aggregation while optimizing both for feature representations and attention weights. The proposed approach maintains separate computational graphs for MIL aggregator and the PFM to create stable training dynamics that align with downstream task objectives during end-to-end adaptation. Evaluated on mutation prediction tasks for bladder cancer and lung adenocarcinoma across institutional and TCGA cohorts, TAPFM consistently outperforms conventional approaches, with H-Optimus-0 (TAPFM) outperforming the benchmarks. TAPFM effectively handles multi-label classification of actionable mutations as well. Thus, TAPFM makes adaptation of powerful pre-trained PFMs practical on standard hardware for various clinical applications.</p></details> |  |

Contrastive self-supervised and vision-language models have been shown to effectively mine large pathology datasets to learn discriminative representations. On the other hand, generative models, capable of synthesizing realistic and diverse images, present a compelling solution to address unique problems in pathology that involve synthesizing images; overcoming annotated data scarcity, enabling privacy-preserving data sharing, and performing inherently generative tasks, such as virtual staining. We introduce PixCell, the first diffusion-based generative foundation model for histopathology. We train PixCell on PanCan-30M, a vast, diverse dataset derived from 69,184 H\&E-stained whole slide images covering various cancer types. We employ a progressive training strategy and a self-supervision-based conditioning that allows us to scale up training without any annotated data. PixCell generates diverse and high-quality images across multiple cancer types, which we find can be used in place of real data to train a self-supervised discriminative model. Synthetic images shared between institutions are subject to fewer regulatory barriers than would be the case with real clinical images. Furthermore, we showcase the ability to precisely control image generation using a small set of annotated images, which can be used for both data augmentation and educational purposes. Testing on a cell segmentation task, a mask-guided PixCell enables targeted data augmentation, improving downstream performance. Finally, we demonstrate PixCell's ability to use H\&E structural staining to infer results from molecular marker studies; we use this capability to infer IHC staining from H\&E images. Our trained models are publicly released to accelerate research in computational pathology.</p></details> |  |

Existing studies have developed numerous approaches to progressively refine and recover ground-truth labels by training convolutional neural networks. However, limited attention has been given to foundation models that offer transferrable representations. In this work, we empirically conduct comprehensive evaluations of 11 foundation models across 13 PLL approaches on 8 benchmark datasets under 3 PLL scenarios. We further propose PartialCLIP, an efficient fine-tuning framework for foundation models in PLL. Our findings reveal that current PLL approaches tend to 1) achieve significant performance gains when using foundation models, 2) exhibit remarkably similar performance to each other, 3) maintain stable performance across varying ambiguity levels, while 4) are susceptible to foundation model selection and adaptation strategies. Additionally, we demonstrate the efficacy of text-embedding classifier initialization and effective candidate label filtering using zero-shot CLIP. Our experimental results and analysis underscore the limitations of current PLL approaches and provide valuable insights for developing more generalizable PLL models.

This study presents an ontology-based framework for bone disease diagnosis, developed in collaboration with Ho Chi Minh City Hospital for Traumatology and Orthopedics. The framework introduces three theoretical contributions: (1) a hierarchical neural network architecture guided by bone disease ontology for segmentation-classification tasks, incorporating Visual Language Models (VLMs) through prompts, (2) an ontology-enhanced Visual Question Answering (VQA) system for clinical reasoning, and (3) a multimodal deep learning model that integrates imaging, clinical, and laboratory data through ontological relationships. The methodology maintains clinical interpretability through systematic knowledge digitization, standardized medical terminology mapping, and modular architecture design. The framework demonstrates potential for extension beyond bone diseases through its standardized structure and reusable components. While theoretical foundations are established, experimental validation remains pending due to current dataset and computational resource limitations. Future work will focus on expanding the clinical dataset and conducting comprehensive system validation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaling Laws for Robust Comparison of Open Foundation Language-Vision Models and Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04598v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In studies of transferable learning, scaling laws are obtained for various important foundation models to predict their properties and performance at larger scales. We show here how scaling law derivation can also be used for model and dataset comparison, allowing to decide which procedure is to be preferred for pre-training. For the first time, full scaling laws based on dense measurements across a wide span of model and samples seen scales are derived for two important language-vision learning procedures, CLIP and MaMMUT, that use either contrastive only or contrastive and captioning text generative loss. Ensuring sufficient prediction accuracy for held out points, we use derived scaling laws to compare both models, obtaining evidence for MaMMUT's stronger improvement with scale and better sample efficiency than standard CLIP. To strengthen validity of the comparison, we show scaling laws for various downstream tasks, classification, retrieval, and segmentation, and for different open datasets, DataComp, DFN and Re-LAION, observing consistently the same trends. We show that comparison can also be performed when deriving scaling laws with a constant learning rate schedule, reducing compute cost. Accurate derivation of scaling laws provides thus means to perform model and dataset comparison across scale spans, avoiding misleading conclusions based on measurements from single reference scales only, paving the road for systematic comparison and improvement of open foundation models and datasets for their creation. We release all the pre-trained models with their intermediate checkpoints, including openMaMMUT-L/14, which achieves $80.3\%$ zero-shot ImageNet-1k accuracy, trained on 12.8B samples from DataComp-1.4B. Code for reproducing experiments in the paper and raw experiments data can be found at https://github.com/LAION-AI/scaling-laws-for-comparison.</p></details> | Preprint. In Review |
| **[Foundation Models Knowledge Distillation For Battery Capacity Degradation Forecast](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08151v2)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate estimation of lithium-ion battery capacity degradation is critical for enhancing the reliability and safety of battery operations. Traditional expert models, tailored to specific scenarios, provide isolated estimations. With the rapid advancement of data-driven techniques, a series of general-purpose time-series foundation models have been developed. However, foundation models specifically designed for battery capacity degradation remain largely unexplored. To enable zero-shot generalization in battery degradation prediction using large model technology, this study proposes a degradation-aware fine-tuning strategy for time-series foundation models. We apply this strategy to fine-tune the Timer model on approximately 10 GB of open-source battery charge discharge data. Validation on our released CycleLife-SJTUIE dataset demonstrates that the fine-tuned Battery-Timer possesses strong zero-shot generalization capability in capacity degradation forecasting. To address the computational challenges of deploying large models, we further propose a knowledge distillation framework that transfers the knowledge of pre-trained foundation models into compact expert models. Distillation results across several state-of-the-art time-series expert models confirm that foundation model knowledge significantly improves the multi-condition generalization of expert models.</p></details> |  |

These models transcend language and domain barriers, yet effectively measuring their performance remains a challenge. Traditional metrics like word error rate (WER) and character error rate (CER) are commonly used to evaluate ASR performance but often fail to reflect transcription quality in critical contexts, particularly when detecting fabricated outputs. This phenomenon, known as hallucination, is especially concerning in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, legal, and aviation, where errors can have severe consequences. In our work, we address this gap by investigating hallucination in ASR models. We examine how factors such as distribution shifts, model size, and model architecture influence the hallucination error rate (HER), a metric we introduce to quantify hallucinations. Our analysis of over 20 ASR models reveals \numinsights~key insights: (1) High WERs can mask low hallucination rates, while low WERs may conceal dangerous hallucinations. (2) Synthetic noise, both adversarial and common perturbations like white noise, pitch shift, and time stretching, increase HER. (3) Distribution shift correlates strongly with HER ($\alpha = 0.91$). Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating HER alongside traditional metrics like WER to better assess ASR model performance, particularly in high-stakes domains.</p></details> | ACL2025 camera-ready |

Nevertheless, the current landscape presents unique challenges that traditional data processing frameworks struggle to handle effectively, particularly in handling the complexity of multimodal data. In response, we present Data-Juicer 2.0, a data processing system backed by 100+ data processing operators spanning text, image, video, and audio modalities, supporting more critical tasks including data analysis, synthesis, annotation, and foundation model post-training.

These agents can automate tasks by controlling software via low-level actions like mouse clicks and touchscreen gestures. However, despite rapid progress, ACUs are not yet mature for everyday use. In this survey, we investigate the state-of-the-art, trends, and research gaps in the development of practical ACUs. We provide a comprehensive review of the ACU landscape, introducing a unifying taxonomy spanning three dimensions: (I) the domain perspective, characterizing agent operating contexts; (II) the interaction perspective, describing observation modalities (e.g., screenshots, HTML) and action modalities (e.g., mouse, keyboard, code execution); and (III) the agent perspective, detailing how agents perceive, reason, and learn. We review 87 ACUs and 33 datasets across foundation model-based and classical approaches through this taxonomy. Our analysis identifies six major research gaps: insufficient generalization, inefficient learning, limited planning, low task complexity in benchmarks, non-standardized evaluation, and a disconnect between research and practical conditions. To address these gaps, we advocate for: (a) vision-based observations and low-level control to enhance generalization; (b) adaptive learning beyond static prompting; (c) effective planning and reasoning methods and models; (d) benchmarks that reflect real-world task complexity; (e) standardized evaluation based on task success; (f) aligning agent design with real-world deployment constraints. Together, our taxonomy and analysis establish a foundation for advancing ACU research toward general-purpose agents for robust and scalable computer use.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Foundation Model on Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06367v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) store temporal facts with quadruple formats (s, p, o, t). Existing Temporal Knowledge Graph Embedding (TKGE) models perform link prediction tasks in transductive or semi-inductive settings, which means the entities, relations, and temporal information in the test graph are fully or partially observed during training. Such reliance on seen elements during inference limits the models' ability to transfer to new domains and generalize to real-world scenarios. A central limitation is the difficulty in learning representations for entities, relations, and timestamps that are transferable and not tied to dataset-specific vocabularies. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the first fully-inductive approach to temporal knowledge graph link prediction. Our model employs sinusoidal positional encodings to capture fine-grained temporal patterns and generates adaptive entity and relation representations using message passing conditioned on both local and global temporal contexts. Our model design is agnostic to temporal granularity and time span, effectively addressing temporal discrepancies across TKGs and facilitating time-aware structural information transfer. As a pretrained, scalable, and transferable model, POSTRA demonstrates strong zero-shot performance on unseen temporal knowledge graphs, effectively generalizing to novel entities, relations, and timestamps. Extensive theoretical analysis and empirical results show that a single pretrained model can improve zero-shot performance on various inductive temporal reasoning scenarios, marking a significant step toward a foundation model for temporal KGs.</p></details> |  |

Contrary to the longstanding myth of barter as the foundation of exchange, converging evidence from early human societies suggests that reciprocity-not barter-was the foundational economic logic, enabling communities to sustain exchange and social cohesion long before formal markets emerged. Yet despite its centrality, reciprocity lacks a simulateable and cognitively grounded account. Here, we introduce a minimal behavioral framework based on three empirically supported cognitive primitives-individual recognition, reciprocal credence, and cost--return sensitivity-that enable agents to participate in and sustain reciprocal exchange, laying the foundation for scalable economic behavior. These mechanisms scaffold the emergence of cooperation, proto-economic exchange, and institutional structure from the bottom up. By bridging insights from primatology, developmental psychology, and economic anthropology, this framework offers a unified substrate for modeling trust, coordination, and economic behavior in both human and artificial systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version updates the position paper with clearer language and improved structure.

However, existing game benchmarks fall short of practical needs: they lack evaluations of diverse LLM capabilities across various game genres, studies of agentic modules crucial for complex gameplay, and fine-tuning datasets for aligning pre-trained LLMs into gaming agents. To fill these gaps, we present \textbf{\benchname{}}, a foundational benchmark designed to train and evaluate LLM agents across diverse real-world video games. Unlike existing benchmarks, Orak includes 12 popular video games spanning all major genres, enabling comprehensive studies of LLM capabilities and agentic modules essential for intricate game scenarios. To support consistent evaluation of LLMs, we introduce a plug-and-play interface based on Model Context Protocol (MCP) that enables LLMs to seamlessly connect with games and manipulate agentic modules. Additionally, we propose a fine-tuning dataset, consisting of LLM gameplay trajectories across diverse game genres. Orak offers a comprehensive evaluation framework, encompassing general game score leaderboards, LLM battle arenas, and in-depth analyses of visual input state, agentic strategies, and fine-tuning effects, establishing a foundation towards building generic gaming agents.

However, their potential as plug-and-play solutions for missing modality prediction remains underexplored. To investigate this, we categorize existing approaches into three representative paradigms, encompassing a total of 42 model variants, and conduct a comprehensive evaluation in terms of prediction accuracy and adaptability to downstream tasks. Our analysis reveals that current foundation models often fall short in two critical aspects: (i) fine-grained semantic extraction from the available modalities, and (ii) robust validation of generated modalities. These limitations lead to suboptimal and, at times, misaligned predictions. To address these challenges, we propose an agentic framework tailored for missing modality prediction. This framework dynamically formulates modality-aware mining strategies based on the input context, facilitating the extraction of richer and more discriminative semantic features. In addition, we introduce a \textit{self-refinement mechanism}, which iteratively verifies and enhances the quality of generated modalities through internal feedback. Experimental results show that our method reduces FID for missing image prediction by at least 14% and MER for missing text prediction by at least 10% compared to baselines.</p></details> |  |

Traditional learning-based methods rely heavily on large-scale annotated data or require extensive interaction with the environment in a reinforcement learning setting, often failing to generalize to novel environments and limiting scalability. To overcome these challenges, we explore a zero-shot setting where the agent operates without task-specific training, enabling more scalable and adaptable solution. Recent advances in Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) offer powerful capabilities for visual understanding and reasoning, making them ideal for agents to comprehend scenes, identify relevant regions, and infer the likely locations of objects. In this work, we present a zero-shot object goal navigation framework that integrates the perceptual strength of VFMs with a model-based planner that is capable of long-horizon decision making through frontier exploration. We evaluate our approach on the HM3D dataset using the Habitat simulator and demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of success weighted by path length for zero-shot object goal navigation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2025 workshop - Foundation Models Meet Embodied Agents</p></details> |

While several VFM adapters have shown promising results by leveraging the prior knowledge of VFMs, we identify two inefficiencies in these approaches. First, the interaction between convolutional neural network (CNN) and VFM backbone triggers early layer gradient backpropagation. Second, existing methods require tuning all components, adding complexity. Besides, these adapters alter VFM features, underutilizing the prior knowledge. To tackle these challenges, we propose a new approach called ViT-Split, based on a key observation: the layers of several VFMs, like DINOv2, can be divided into two distinct components: an extractor for learning low-level features and an adapter for learning task-specific features. Leveraging this insight, we eliminate the CNN branch and introduce two heads, task head and prior head, to the frozen VFM. The task head is designed to learn task-specific features, mitigating the early gradient propagation issue. The prior head is used to leverage the multi-scale prior features from the frozen VFM, reducing tuning parameters and overfitting. Extensive experiments on various tasks (e.g., segmentation, detection, depth estimation, and visual question answering) validate the effectiveness and efficiency of ViT-Split. Specifically, ViT-Split reduces training time up to $4\times$ while achieving comparable or even better results on ADE20K, compared to other VFM adapters.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The project is available: https://jackyfl.github.io/vitsplit.github.io/</p></details> |

Here, we introduce KRONOS, a foundation model built for spatial proteomics. KRONOS was trained in a self-supervised manner on over 47 million image patches covering 175 protein markers, 16 tissue types, and 8 fluorescence-based imaging platforms. We introduce key architectural adaptations to address the high-dimensional, multi-channel, and heterogeneous nature of multiplex imaging. We demonstrate that KRONOS learns biologically meaningful representations across multiple scales, ranging from cellular and microenvironment to tissue levels, enabling it to address diverse downstream tasks, including cell phenotyping, region classification, and patient stratification. Evaluated across 11 independent cohorts, KRONOS achieves state-of-the-art performance across cell phenotyping, treatment response prediction, and retrieval tasks, and is highly data-efficient. KRONOS also introduces the paradigm of segmentation-free patch-level processing for efficient and scalable spatial proteomics analysis, allowing cross-institutional comparisons, and as an image reverse search engine for spatial patterns. Together, these results position KRONOS as a flexible and scalable tool for spatial proteomics. The model is publicly accessible at https://github.com/mahmoodlab/KRONOS.</p></details> |  |

We hypothesize that multimodal foundation models (MMFMs) such as ImageBind, LanguageBind will be most effective for SVDSA as they are better equipped for capturing subtle source-specific characteristics-such as unique timbre, pitch manipulation, or synthesis artifacts of each singing voice deepfake source due to their cross-modality pre-training. Our experiments with MMFMs, speech foundation models and music foundation models verify the hypothesis that MMFMs are the most effective for SVDSA. Furthermore, inspired from related research, we also explore fusion of foundation models (FMs) for improved SVDSA. To this end, we propose a novel framework, COFFE which employs Chernoff Distance as novel loss function for effective fusion of FMs. Through COFFE with the symphony of MMFMs, we attain the topmost performance in comparison to all the individual FMs and baseline fusion methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to INTERSPEECH 2025</p></details> |

Historically, different AI paradigms have acknowledged this need, albeit with varying priorities: early expert and production systems focused on incremental knowledge consolidation, while reinforcement learning emphasised dynamic adaptation. With the rise of deep learning, deep continual learning has primarily focused on learning robust and reusable representations over time to solve sequences of increasingly complex tasks. However, the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) and foundation models has raised the question: Do we still need continual learning when centralised, monolithic models can tackle diverse tasks with access to internet-scale knowledge? We argue that continual learning remains essential for three key reasons: (i) continual pre-training is still necessary to ensure foundation models remain up to date, mitigating knowledge staleness and distribution shifts while integrating new information; (ii) continual fine-tuning enables models to specialise and personalise, adapting to domain-specific tasks, user preferences, and real-world constraints without full retraining, avoiding the need for computationally expensive long context-windows; (iii) continual compositionality offers a scalable and modular approach to intelligence, enabling the orchestration of foundation models and agents to be dynamically composed, recombined, and adapted. While continual pre-training and fine-tuning are explored as niche research directions, we argue it is continual compositionality that will mark the rebirth of continual learning. The future of AI will not be defined by a single static model but by an ecosystem of continually evolving and interacting models, making continual learning more relevant than ever.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 1 figure, accepted at TCAI workshop 2025</p></details> |

Current alignment approaches struggle with value specification complexity and fail to address emergent power-seeking behaviors. We propose "Corrigibility as a Singular Target" (CAST)-designing FMs whose overriding objective is empowering designated human principals to guide, correct, and control them. This paradigm shift from static value-loading to dynamic human empowerment transforms instrumental drives: self-preservation serves only to maintain the principal's control; goal modification becomes facilitating principal guidance. We present a comprehensive empirical research agenda spanning training methodologies (RLAIF, SFT, synthetic data generation), scalability testing across model sizes, and demonstrations of controlled instructability. Our vision: FMs that become increasingly responsive to human guidance as capabilities grow, offering a path to beneficial AI that remains as tool-like as possible, rather than supplanting human judgment. This addresses the core alignment problem at its source, preventing the default trajectory toward misaligned instrumental convergence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

However, their robustness to adversarial manipulation remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present a comprehensive study of the adversarial vulnerabilities of tabular FM, focusing on both their fragility to targeted test-time attacks and their potential misuse as adversarial tools. We show on three benchmarks in finance, cybersecurity and healthcare, that small, structured perturbations to test inputs can significantly degrade prediction accuracy, even when training context remain fixed. Additionally, we demonstrate that tabular FM can be repurposed to generate transferable evasion to conventional models such as random forests and XGBoost, and on a lesser extent to deep tabular models. To improve tabular FM, we formulate the robustification problem as an optimization of the weights (adversarial fine-tuning), or the context (adversarial in-context learning). We introduce an in-context adversarial training strategy that incrementally replaces the context with adversarial perturbed instances, without updating model weights. Our approach improves robustness across multiple tabular benchmarks. Together, these findings position tabular FM as both a target and a source of adversarial threats, highlighting the urgent need for robust training and evaluation practices in this emerging paradigm.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Novel Benchmark for Few-Shot Semantic Segmentation in the Era of Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11311v3)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-shot semantic segmentation (FSS) is a crucial challenge in computer vision, driving extensive research into a diverse range of methods, from advanced meta-learning techniques to simple transfer learning baselines. With the emergence of vision foundation models (VFM) serving as generalist feature extractors, we seek to explore the adaptation of these models for FSS. While current FSS benchmarks focus on adapting pre-trained models to new tasks with few images, they emphasize in-domain generalization, making them less suitable for VFM trained on large-scale web datasets. To address this, we propose a novel realistic benchmark with a simple and straightforward adaptation process tailored for this task. Using this benchmark, we conduct a comprehensive comparative analysis of prominent VFM and semantic segmentation models. To evaluate their effectiveness, we leverage various adaption methods, ranging from linear probing to parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) and full fine-tuning. Our findings show that models designed for segmentation can be outperformed by self-supervised (SSL) models. On the other hand, while PEFT methods yields competitive performance, they provide little discrepancy in the obtained results compared to other methods, highlighting the critical role of the feature extractor in determining results. To our knowledge, this is the first study on the adaptation of VFM for FSS.</p></details> |  |

What Matters and What Does Not](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17044v3)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable performance achieved by Large Language Models (LLM) has driven research efforts to leverage them for a wide range of tasks and input modalities. In speech-to-text (S2T) tasks, the emerging solution consists of projecting the output of the encoder of a Speech Foundational Model (SFM) into the LLM embedding space through an adapter module. However, no work has yet investigated how much the downstream-task performance depends on each component (SFM, adapter, LLM) nor whether the best design of the adapter depends on the chosen SFM and LLM. To fill this gap, we evaluate the combination of 5 adapter modules, 2 LLMs (Mistral and Llama), and 2 SFMs (Whisper and SeamlessM4T) on two widespread S2T tasks, namely Automatic Speech Recognition and Speech Translation. Our results demonstrate that the SFM plays a pivotal role in downstream performance, while the adapter choice has moderate impact and depends on the SFM and LLM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Interspeech 2025</p></details> |

While significant progress has been made in robotic manipulation, existing approaches often fall short in generalization to complex environmental variations and addressing memory-dependent tasks. To bridge this gap, we introduce SAM2Act, a multi-view robotic transformer-based policy that leverages multi-resolution upsampling with visual representations from large-scale foundation model. SAM2Act achieves a state-of-the-art average success rate of 86.8% across 18 tasks in the RLBench benchmark, and demonstrates robust generalization on The Colosseum benchmark, with only a 4.3% performance gap under diverse environmental perturbations. Building on this foundation, we propose SAM2Act+, a memory-based architecture inspired by SAM2, which incorporates a memory bank, an encoder, and an attention mechanism to enhance spatial memory. To address the need for evaluating memory-dependent tasks, we introduce MemoryBench, a novel benchmark designed to assess spatial memory and action recall in robotic manipulation. SAM2Act+ achieves an average success rate of 94.3% on memory-based tasks in MemoryBench, significantly outperforming existing approaches and pushing the boundaries of memory-based robotic systems.

| **[VideoLLaMA 3: Frontier Multimodal Foundation Models for Image and Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13106v4)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose VideoLLaMA3, a more advanced multimodal foundation model for image and video understanding. The core design philosophy of VideoLLaMA3 is vision-centric. The meaning of "vision-centric" is two-fold: the vision-centric training paradigm and vision-centric framework design. The key insight of our vision-centric training paradigm is that high-quality image-text data is crucial for both image and video understanding. Instead of preparing massive video-text datasets, we focus on constructing large-scale and high-quality image-text datasets. VideoLLaMA3 has four training stages: 1) Vision Encoder Adaptation, which enables vision encoder to accept images of variable resolutions as input; 2) Vision-Language Alignment, which jointly tunes the vision encoder, projector, and LLM with large-scale image-text data covering multiple types (including scene images, documents, charts) as well as text-only data. 3) Multi-task Fine-tuning, which incorporates image-text SFT data for downstream tasks and video-text data to establish a foundation for video understanding. 4) Video-centric Fine-tuning, which further improves the model's capability in video understanding. As for the framework design, to better capture fine-grained details in images, the pretrained vision encoder is adapted to encode images of varying sizes into vision tokens with corresponding numbers, rather than a fixed number of tokens. For video inputs, we reduce the number of vision tokens according to their similarity so that the representation of videos will be more precise and compact. Benefit from vision-centric designs, VideoLLaMA3 achieves compelling performances in both image and video understanding benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>BZ, K...</summary><p>BZ, KL, ZC, ZH, YY, GC, SL, YJ, HZ, and XL contributed equally to this project.

Meanwhile, recent breakthroughs in large Foundation Models (FMs) have expanded AI's potential across many domains due to their exceptional generalizability and zero-shot transfer capabilities. However, their success has largely been confined to natural data like images and video, with degraded performance and even failures for RS data of various non-optical modalities. This has inspired growing interest in developing Remote Sensing Foundation Models (RSFMs) to address the complex demands of Earth Observation (EO) tasks, spanning the surface, atmosphere, and oceans. This survey systematically reviews the emerging field of RSFMs. It begins with an outline of their motivation and background, followed by an introduction of their foundational concepts. It then categorizes and reviews existing RSFM studies including their datasets and technical contributions across Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), Visual-Language Models (VLMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), and beyond. In addition, we benchmark these models against publicly available datasets, discuss existing challenges, and propose future research directions in this rapidly evolving field. A project associated with this survey has been built at https://github.com/xiaoaoran/awesome-RSFMs .</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Magazine (GRSM)</p></details> |

A fundamental aspect is ensuring agents adhere to safety-critical principles, especially when these conflict with operational goals. Failure to prioritize such principles indicates a potential basic control failure. This paper introduces a lightweight, interpretable benchmark methodology using a simple grid world to evaluate an LLM agent's ability to uphold a predefined, high-level safety principle (e.g., "never enter hazardous zones") when faced with conflicting lower-level task instructions. We probe whether the agent reliably prioritizes the inviolable directive, testing a foundational controllability aspect of LLMs. This pilot study demonstrates the methodology's feasibility, offers preliminary insights into agent behavior under principle conflict, and discusses how such benchmarks can contribute empirical evidence for assessing controllability. We argue that evaluating adherence to hierarchical principles is a crucial early step in understanding our capacity to build governable AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

| **[JanusDNA: A Powerful Bi-directional Hybrid DNA Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17257v2)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing and are increasingly applied to other sequential data types, including genetic sequences. However, adapting LLMs to genomics presents significant challenges. Capturing complex genomic interactions requires modeling long-range dependencies within DNA sequences, where interactions often span over 10,000 base pairs, even within a single gene, posing substantial computational burdens under conventional model architectures and training paradigms. Moreover, standard LLM training approaches are suboptimal for DNA: autoregressive training, while efficient, supports only unidirectional understanding. However, DNA is inherently bidirectional, e.g., bidirectional promoters regulate transcription in both directions and account for nearly 11% of human gene expression. Masked language models (MLMs) allow bidirectional understanding but are inefficient, as only masked tokens contribute to the loss per step. To address these limitations, we introduce JanusDNA, the first bidirectional DNA foundation model built upon a novel pretraining paradigm that combines the optimization efficiency of autoregressive modeling with the bidirectional comprehension of masked modeling. JanusDNA adopts a hybrid Mamba, Attention and Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture, combining long-range modeling of Attention with efficient sequential learning of Mamba. MoE layers further scale model capacity via sparse activation while keeping computational cost low. Notably, JanusDNA processes up to 1 million base pairs at single nucleotide resolution on a single 80GB GPU. Extensive experiments and ablations show JanusDNA achieves new SOTA results on three genomic representation benchmarks, outperforming models with 250x more activated parameters.

| **[Do Large Language Models (Really) Need Statistical Foundations?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19145v2)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) represent a new paradigm for processing unstructured data, with applications across an unprecedented range of domains. In this paper, we address, through two arguments, whether the development and application of LLMs would genuinely benefit from foundational contributions from the statistics discipline. First, we argue affirmatively, beginning with the observation that LLMs are inherently statistical models due to their profound data dependency and stochastic generation processes, where statistical insights are naturally essential for handling variability and uncertainty. Second, we argue that the persistent black-box nature of LLMs -- stemming from their immense scale, architectural complexity, and development practices often prioritizing empirical performance over theoretical interpretability -- renders closed-form or purely mechanistic analyses generally intractable, thereby necessitating statistical approaches due to their flexibility and often demonstrated effectiveness. To substantiate these arguments, the paper outlines several research areas -- including alignment, watermarking, uncertainty quantification, evaluation, and data mixture optimization -- where statistical methodologies are critically needed and are already beginning to make valuable contributions. We conclude with a discussion suggesting that statistical research concerning LLMs will likely form a diverse ``mosaic'' of specialized topics rather than deriving from a single unifying theory, and highlighting the importance of timely engagement by our statistics community in LLM research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Added...</summary><p>Added some references</p></details> |
| **[Are Mamba-based Audio Foundation Models the Best Fit for Non-Verbal Emotion Recognition?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02258v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we focus on non-verbal vocal sounds emotion recognition (NVER). We investigate mamba-based audio foundation models (MAFMs) for the first time for NVER and hypothesize that MAFMs will outperform attention-based audio foundation models (AAFMs) for NVER by leveraging its state-space modeling to capture intrinsic emotional structures more effectively. Unlike AAFMs, which may amplify irrelevant patterns due to their attention mechanisms, MAFMs will extract more stable and context-aware representations, enabling better differentiation of subtle non-verbal emotional cues. Our experiments with state-of-the-art (SOTA) AAFMs and MAFMs validates our hypothesis. Further, motivated from related research such as speech emotion recognition, synthetic speech detection, where fusion of foundation models (FMs) have showed improved performance, we also explore fusion of FMs for NVER. To this end, we propose, RENO, that uses renyi-divergence as a novel loss function for effective alignment of the FMs. It also makes use of self-attention for better intra-representation interaction of the FMs. With RENO, through the heterogeneous fusion of MAFMs and AAFMs, we show the topmost performance in comparison to individual FMs, its fusion and also setting SOTA in comparison to previous SOTA work.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EUSIPCO 2025</p></details> |
| **[The Hitchhikers Guide to Production-ready Trustworthy Foundation Model powered Software (FMware)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10640v2)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation Models (FMs) such as Large Language Models (LLMs) are reshaping the software industry by enabling FMware, systems that integrate these FMs as core components. In this KDD 2025 tutorial, we present a comprehensive exploration of FMware that combines a curated catalogue of challenges with real-world production concerns. We first discuss the state of research and practice in building FMware. We further examine the difficulties in selecting suitable models, aligning high-quality domain-specific data, engineering robust prompts, and orchestrating autonomous agents. We then address the complex journey from impressive demos to production-ready systems by outlining issues in system testing, optimization, deployment, and integration with legacy software. Drawing on our industrial experience and recent research in the area, we provide actionable insights and a technology roadmap for overcoming these challenges. Attendees will gain practical strategies to enable the creation of trustworthy FMware in the evolving technology landscape.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fast-in-Slow: A Dual-System Foundation Model Unifying Fast Manipulation within Slow Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01953v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generalized policy and execution efficiency constitute the two critical challenges in robotic manipulation. While recent foundation policies benefit from the common-sense reasoning capabilities of internet-scale pretrained vision-language models (VLMs), they often suffer from low execution frequency. To mitigate this dilemma, dual-system approaches, inspired by Kahneman's theory, have been proposed to leverage a VLM-based System 2 model handling high-level reasoning and a separate System 1 action model ensuring real-time control. However, existing designs maintain both systems as separate models, limiting System 1 from fully leveraging the rich pretrained knowledge from the VLM-based System 2. In this work, we propose Fast-in-Slow (FiS), a unified dual-system vision-language-action (VLA) model that embeds the System 1 execution module within the VLM-based System 2 by partially sharing parameters. This innovative paradigm not only enables high-frequency execution in System 1 but also facilitates coordination between the reasoning and execution components within a single foundation model of System 2. Given their fundamentally distinct roles within FiS-VLA, we design the two systems to incorporate heterogeneous modality inputs alongside asynchronous operating frequencies, enabling both fast and precise manipulation. To enable coordination between the two systems, a dual-aware co-training strategy is proposed that equips System 1 with action generation capabilities while preserving System 2's contextual reasoning representation. For evaluation, FiS-VLA outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by 8% in simulation and 11% in real-world tasks in terms of average success rate, while achieving a 117.7 Hz control frequency with action chunk set to eight.

| **[Human-Centric Evaluation for Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01793v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Currently, nearly all evaluations of foundation models focus on objective metrics, emphasizing quiz performance to define model capabilities. While this model-centric approach enables rapid performance assessment, it fails to reflect authentic human experiences. To address this gap, we propose a Human-Centric subjective Evaluation (HCE) framework, focusing on three core dimensions: problem-solving ability, information quality, and interaction experience. Through experiments involving Deepseek R1, OpenAI o3 mini, Grok 3, and Gemini 2.5, we conduct over 540 participant-driven evaluations, where humans and models collaborate on open-ended research tasks, yielding a comprehensive subjective dataset. This dataset captures diverse user feedback across multiple disciplines, revealing distinct model strengths and adaptability. Our findings highlight Grok 3's superior performance, followed by Deepseek R1 and Gemini 2.5, with OpenAI o3 mini lagging behind. By offering a novel framework and a rich dataset, this study not only enhances subjective evaluation methodologies but also lays the foundation for standardized, automated assessments, advancing LLM development for research and practical scenarios.

| **[Real-time Adapting Routing (RAR): Improving Efficiency Through Continuous Learning in Software Powered by Layered Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09837v2)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To balance the quality and inference cost of a Foundation Model (FM, such as large language models (LLMs)) powered software, people often opt to train a routing model that routes requests to FMs with different sizes and capabilities. Existing routing models rely on learning the optimal routing decision from carefully curated data, require complex computations to be updated, and do not consider the potential evolution of weaker FMs. In this paper, we propose Real-time Adaptive Routing (RAR), an approach to continuously adapt FM routing decisions while using guided in-context learning to enhance the capabilities of weaker FM. The goal is to reduce reliance on stronger, more expensive FMs. We evaluate our approach on different subsets of the popular MMLU benchmark. Over time, our approach routes 50.2% fewer requests to computationally expensive models while maintaining around 90.5% of the general response quality. In addition, the guides generated from stronger models have shown intra-domain generalization and led to a better quality of responses compared to an equivalent approach with a standalone weaker FM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Supervised Speech Quality Assessment (S3QA): Leveraging Speech Foundation Models for a Scalable Speech Quality Metric](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01655v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Methods for automatically assessing speech quality are critical for many human language technologies. Behavioral ratings provided by human raters (e.g., mean opinion scores; MOS) are considered the gold standard, but they are susceptible to variability between individual raters, cannot easily be generalized across corpora, and are labor-intensive to collect, thus limiting the acoustic challenges they can quantify. Here, we present a new, scalable method for automatically assessing speech quality: the self-supervised speech quality assessment (S3QA) model. First, we processed high quality utterances from multiple speech corpora, using a wide range of acoustic manipulations intended to emulate common sources of quality degradation in the real-world: frequency filtering, reverberation, background noise, and digital compression. Second, we leveraged an existing, pre-trained speech foundation model, WavLM, to computationally derive a self-supervised training target for the level of signal degradation by calculating the cosine distances between the clean and degraded versions of each utterance in the embedding space. Next, we trained a transformer-based model to predict the cosine distance, or degradation index, given only the degraded versions of these utterances. Finally, the trained model was evaluated on unseen test corpora of synthetic mixtures, NISQA, and VOiCES. We show that the S3QA model trained on this task performs well and is aligned with both behavioral ratings (MOS), speech technology performance (automatic speech recognition) and other important features of the held-out data (e.g., microphone distances). This approach provides an automated, scalable method for assessing speech quality across a wide range of acoustic challenges, and could easily be adapted to other use cases where acoustic simulations are available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Five ...</summary><p>Five tables, three figures, twelve pages</p></details> |
| **[RATFM: Retrieval-augmented Time Series Foundation Model for Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02081v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inspired by the success of large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing, recent research has explored the building of time series foundation models and applied them to tasks such as forecasting, classification, and anomaly detection. However, their performances vary between different domains and tasks. In LLM-based approaches, test-time adaptation using example-based prompting has become common, owing to the high cost of retraining. In the context of anomaly detection, which is the focus of this study, providing normal examples from the target domain can also be effective. However, time series foundation models do not naturally acquire the ability to interpret or utilize examples or instructions, because the nature of time series data used during training does not encourage such capabilities. To address this limitation, we propose a retrieval augmented time series foundation model (RATFM), which enables pretrained time series foundation models to incorporate examples of test-time adaptation. We show that RATFM achieves a performance comparable to that of in-domain fine-tuning while avoiding domain-dependent fine-tuning. Experiments on the UCR Anomaly Archive, a multi-domain dataset including nine domains, confirms the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unraveling Spatio-Temporal Foundation Models via the Pipeline Lens: A Comprehensive Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01364v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal deep learning models aims to utilize useful patterns in such data to support tasks like prediction. However, previous deep learning models designed for specific tasks typically require separate training for each use case, leading to increased computational and storage costs. To address this issue, spatio-temporal foundation models have emerged, offering a unified framework capable of solving multiple spatio-temporal tasks. These foundation models achieve remarkable success by learning general knowledge with spatio-temporal data or transferring the general capabilities of pre-trained language models. While previous surveys have explored spatio-temporal data and methodologies separately, they have ignored a comprehensive examination of how foundation models are designed, selected, pre-trained, and adapted. As a result, the overall pipeline for spatio-temporal foundation models remains unclear. To bridge this gap, we innovatively provide an up-to-date review of previous spatio-temporal foundation models from the pipeline perspective. The pipeline begins with an introduction to different types of spatio-temporal data, followed by details of data preprocessing and embedding techniques. The pipeline then presents a novel data property taxonomy to divide existing methods according to data sources and dependencies, providing efficient and effective model design and selection for researchers. On this basis, we further illustrate the training objectives of primitive models, as well as the adaptation techniques of transferred models. Overall, our survey provides a clear and structured pipeline to understand the connection between core elements of spatio-temporal foundation models while guiding researchers to get started quickly. Additionally, we introduce emerging opportunities such as multi-objective training in the field of spatio-temporal foundation models.</p></details> | 21 pages, 10 figures |

As foundation models evolve, the demands for agents that can adapt in real-time and process multimodal data have grown. This survey provides a comprehensive review of mobile agent technologies, focusing on recent advancements that enhance real-time adaptability and multimodal interaction. Recent evaluation benchmarks have been developed better to capture the static and interactive environments of mobile tasks, offering more accurate assessments of agents' performance. We then categorize these advancements into two main approaches: prompt-based methods, which utilize large language models (LLMs) for instruction-based task execution, and training-based methods, which fine-tune multimodal models for mobile-specific applications. Additionally, we explore complementary technologies that augment agent performance. By discussing key challenges and outlining future research directions, this survey offers valuable insights for advancing mobile agent technologies.

We introduce GeoLocSFT, a framework that demonstrates how targeted supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of a large multimodal foundation model (Gemma 3) using a small, high-quality dataset can yield highly competitive geolocation performance. GeoLocSFT is trained with only 2700 carefully selected image-GPS pairs from our geographically diverse MR600k dataset. Despite this limited data, our SFT-centric approach substantially improves over baseline models and achieves robust results on standard benchmarks such as Im2GPS-3k and YFCC-4k, as well as on our newly proposed and challenging MR40k benchmark, aimed specifically at sparsely populated regions. Further, we explore multi-candidate inference and aggregation strategies but find that the core gains are already realized at the SFT stage. Our findings highlight the power of high-quality supervision and efficient SFT for planet-scale image geolocation, especially when compared to prior methods that require massive databases or complex pipelines. To foster further research, we publicly release the MR40k benchmark dataset.</p></details> | 29 pages, 14 figures |
