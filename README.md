| **[Counting and Entropy Bounds for Structure-Avoiding Spatially-Coupled LDPC Constructions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09674v1)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Designing large coupling memory quasi-cyclic spatially-coupled LDPC (QC-SC-LDPC) codes with low error floors requires eliminating specific harmful substructures (e.g., short cycles) induced by edge spreading and lifting. Building on our work~\cite{r15} that introduced a Clique Lovász Local Lemma (CLLL)-based design principle and a Moser--Tardos (MT)-type constructive approach, this work quantifies the size and structure of the feasible design space. Using the quantitative CLLL, we derive explicit lower bounds on the number of partition matrices satisfying a given family of structure-avoidance constraints, and further obtain bounds on the number of non-equivalent solutions under row/column permutations. Moreover, via Rényi-entropy bounds for the MT distribution, we provide a computable lower bound on the number of distinct solutions that the MT algorithm can output, giving a concrete diversity guarantee for randomized constructions. Specializations for eliminating 4-cycle candidates yield closed-form bounds as functions of system parameters, offering a principled way to size memory/lifting and to estimate the remaining search space.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Federated Class-Incremental Learning via Spatial-Temporal Statistics Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01327v2)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Class-Incremental Learning (FCIL) enables Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) from distributed data. Existing FCIL methods typically integrate old knowledge preservation into local client training. However, these methods cannot avoid spatial-temporal client drift caused by data heterogeneity and often incur significant computational and communication overhead, limiting practical deployment. To address these challenges simultaneously, we propose a novel approach, Spatial-Temporal Statistics Aggregation (STSA), which provides a unified framework to aggregate feature statistics both spatially (across clients) and temporally (across stages). The aggregated feature statistics are unaffected by data heterogeneity and can be used to update the classifier in closed form at each stage. Additionally, we introduce STSA-E, a communication-efficient variant with theoretical guarantees, achieving similar performance to STSA-E with much lower communication overhead. Extensive experiments on three widely used FCIL datasets, with varying degrees of data heterogeneity, show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art FCIL methods in terms of performance, flexibility, and both communication and computation efficiency. The code is available at https://github.com/Yuqin-G/STSA.</p></details> | WWW 2026 |
| **[Coarse-to-fine spatial modeling: A scalable, machine-learning-compatible spatial model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00968v2)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study proposes coarse-to-fine spatial modeling (CFSM) as a scalable and machine learning-compatible alternative to conventional spatial process models. Unlike conventional covariance-based spatial models, CFSM represents spatial processes using a multiscale ensemble of local models. To ensure stable model training, larger-scale patterns that are easier to learn are modeled first, followed by smaller-scale patterns, with training terminated once the validation score stops improving. The training procedure, which is based on holdout validation, can be easily integrated with other machine learning algorithms, including random forests and neural networks. CFSM training is computationally efficient because it avoids explicit matrix inversion, which is a major computational bottleneck in conventional spatial Gaussian processes. Comparative Monte Carlo experiments demonstrated that the CFSM, as well as its integration with random forests, achieved superior predictive performance compared to existing models. Finally, we applied the proposed methods to an analysis of residential land prices in the Tokyo metropolitan area, Japan. The CFSM is implemented in an R package spCF (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/spCF/).</p></details> |  |
| **[Video-MSR: Benchmarking Multi-hop Spatial Reasoning Capabilities of MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09430v1)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial reasoning has emerged as a critical capability for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), drawing increasing attention and rapid advancement. However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on single-step perception-to-judgment tasks, leaving scenarios requiring complex visual-spatial logical chains significantly underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce Video-MSR, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate Multi-hop Spatial Reasoning (MSR) in dynamic video scenarios. Video-MSR systematically probes MSR capabilities through four distinct tasks: Constrained Localization, Chain-based Reference Retrieval, Route Planning, and Counterfactual Physical Deduction. Our benchmark comprises 3,052 high-quality video instances with 4,993 question-answer pairs, constructed via a scalable, visually-grounded pipeline combining advanced model generation with rigorous human verification. Through a comprehensive evaluation of 20 state-of-the-art MLLMs, we uncover significant limitations, revealing that while models demonstrate proficiency in surface-level perception, they exhibit distinct performance drops in MSR tasks, frequently suffering from spatial disorientation and hallucination during multi-step deductions. To mitigate these shortcomings and empower models with stronger MSR capabilities, we further curate MSR-9K, a specialized instruction-tuning dataset, and fine-tune Qwen-VL, achieving a +7.82% absolute improvement on Video-MSR. Our results underscore the efficacy of multi-hop spatial instruction data and establish Video-MSR as a vital foundation for future research. The code and data will be available at https://github.com/ruiz-nju/Video-MSR.</p></details> |  |
| **[FeatInv: Spatially resolved mapping from feature space to input space using conditional diffusion models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21032v2)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Internal representations are crucial for understanding deep neural networks, such as their properties and reasoning patterns, but remain difficult to interpret. While mapping from feature space to input space aids in interpreting the former, existing approaches often rely on crude approximations. We propose using a conditional diffusion model - a pretrained high-fidelity diffusion model conditioned on spatially resolved feature maps - to learn such a mapping in a probabilistic manner. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach across various pretrained image classifiers from CNNs to ViTs, showing excellent reconstruction capabilities. Through qualitative comparisons and robustness analysis, we validate our method and showcase possible applications, such as the visualization of concept steering in input space or investigations of the composite nature of the feature space. This approach has broad potential for improving feature space understanding in computer vision models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Versi...</summary><p>Version published by Transactions on Machine Learning Research in 2025 (TMLR ISSN 2835-8856) at https://openreview.net/forum?id=UtE1YnPNgZ. 32 pages, 27 figures.

| **[Enhancing Spatial Reasoning in Large Language Models for Metal-Organic Frameworks Structure Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09285v1)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are porous crystalline materials with broad applications such as carbon capture and drug delivery, yet accurately predicting their 3D structures remains a significant challenge. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating crystals, their application to MOFs is hindered by MOFs' high atomic complexity. Inspired by the success of block-wise paradigms in deep generative models, we pioneer the use of LLMs in this domain by introducing MOF-LLM, the first LLM framework specifically adapted for block-level MOF structure prediction. To effectively harness LLMs for this modular assembly task, our training paradigm integrates spatial-aware continual pre-training (CPT), structural supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and matching-driven reinforcement learning (RL). By incorporating explicit spatial priors and optimizing structural stability via Soft Adaptive Policy Optimization (SAPO), our approach substantially enhances the spatial reasoning capability of a Qwen-3 8B model for accurate MOF structure prediction. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that MOF-LLM outperforms state-of-the-art denoising-based and LLM-based methods while exhibiting superior sampling efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Universal Few-Shot Spatial Control for Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07530v2)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial conditioning in pretrained text-to-image diffusion models has significantly improved fine-grained control over the structure of generated images. However, existing control adapters exhibit limited adaptability and incur high training costs when encountering novel spatial control conditions that differ substantially from the training tasks. To address this limitation, we propose Universal Few-Shot Control (UFC), a versatile few-shot control adapter capable of generalizing to novel spatial conditions. Given a few image-condition pairs of an unseen task and a query condition, UFC leverages the analogy between query and support conditions to construct task-specific control features, instantiated by a matching mechanism and an update on a small set of task-specific parameters. Experiments on six novel spatial control tasks show that UFC, fine-tuned with only 30 annotated examples of novel tasks, achieves fine-grained control consistent with the spatial conditions. Notably, when fine-tuned with 0.1% of the full training data, UFC achieves competitive performance with the fully supervised baselines in various control tasks. We also show that UFC is applicable agnostically to various diffusion backbones and demonstrate its effectiveness on both UNet and DiT architectures. Code is available at https://github.com/kietngt00/UFC.</p></details> |  |
| **[DyDiT++: Diffusion Transformers with Timestep and Spatial Dynamics for Efficient Visual Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06803v4)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Transformer (DiT), an emerging diffusion model for visual generation, has demonstrated superior performance but suffers from substantial computational costs. Our investigations reveal that these costs primarily stem from the static inference paradigm, which inevitably introduces redundant computation in certain diffusion timesteps and spatial regions. To overcome this inefficiency, we propose Dynamic Diffusion Transformer (DyDiT), an architecture that dynamically adjusts its computation along both timestep and spatial dimensions. Building on these designs, we present an extended version, DyDiT++, with improvements in three key aspects. First, it extends the generation mechanism of DyDiT beyond diffusion to flow matching, demonstrating that our method can also accelerate flow-matching-based generation, enhancing its versatility. Furthermore, we enhance DyDiT to tackle more complex visual generation tasks, including video generation and text-to-image generation, thereby broadening its real-world applications. Finally, to address the high cost of full fine-tuning and democratize technology access, we investigate the feasibility of training DyDiT in a parameter-efficient manner and introduce timestep-based dynamic LoRA (TD-LoRA). Extensive experiments on diverse visual generation models, including DiT, SiT, Latte, and FLUX, demonstrate the effectiveness of DyDiT++. Remarkably, with <3% additional fine-tuning iterations, our approach reduces the FLOPs of DiT-XL by 51%, yielding 1.73x realistic speedup on hardware, and achieves a competitive FID score of 2.07 on ImageNet. The code is available at https://github.com/alibaba-damo-academy/DyDiT.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was accepted to the IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (TPAMI) on January 9, 2026. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2410.03456</p></details> |
| **[Changes in Visual Attention Patterns for Detection Tasks due to Dependencies on Signal and Background Spatial Frequencies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09008v1)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We aim to investigate the impact of image and signal properties on visual attention mechanisms during a signal detection task in digital images. The application of insight yielded from this work spans many areas of digital imaging where signal or pattern recognition is involved in complex heterogenous background. We used simulated tomographic breast images as the platform to investigate this question. While radiologists are highly effective at analyzing medical images to detect and diagnose diseases, misdiagnosis still occurs. We selected digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) images as a sample medical images with different breast densities and structures using digital breast phantoms (Bakic and XCAT). Two types of lesions (with distinct spatial frequency properties) were randomly inserted in the phantoms during projections to generate abnormal cases. Six human observers participated in observer study designed for a locating and detection of an 3-mm sphere lesion and 6-mm spicule lesion in reconstructed in-plane DBT slices. We collected eye-gaze data to estimate gaze metrics and to examine differences in visual attention mechanisms. We found that detection performance in complex visual environments is strongly constrained by later perceptual stages, with decision failures accounting for the largest proportion of errors. Signal detectability is jointly influenced by both target morphology and background complexity, revealing a critical interaction between local signal features and global anatomical noise. Increased fixation duration on spiculated lesions suggests that visual attention is differentially engaged depending on background and signal spatial frequency dependencies.</p></details> | 21 pages, 7 images |
| **[Spatial Context Improves the Integration of Text with Remote Sensing for Mapping Environmental Variables](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08750v1)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent developments in natural language processing highlight text as an emerging data source for ecology. Textual resources carry unique information that can be used in complementarity with geospatial data sources, thus providing insights at the local scale into environmental conditions and properties hidden from more traditional data sources. Leveraging textual information in a spatial context presents several challenges. First, the contribution of textual data remains poorly defined in an ecological context, and it is unclear for which tasks it should be incorporated. Unlike ubiquitous satellite imagery or environmental covariates, the availability of textual data is sparse and irregular; its integration with geospatial data is not straightforward. In response to these challenges, this work proposes an attention-based approach that combines aerial imagery and geolocated text within a spatial neighbourhood, i.e. integrating contributions from several nearby observations. Our approach combines vision and text representations with a geolocation encoding, with an attention-based module that dynamically selects spatial neighbours that are useful for predictive tasks.The proposed approach is applied to the EcoWikiRS dataset, which combines high-resolution aerial imagery with sentences extracted from Wikipedia describing local environmental conditions across Switzerland. Our model is evaluated on the task of predicting 103 environmental variables from the SWECO25 data cube. Our approach consistently outperforms single-location or unimodal, i.e. image-only or text-only, baselines. When analysing variables by thematic groups, results show a significant improvement in performance for climatic, edaphic, population and land use/land cover variables, underscoring the benefit of including the spatial context when combining text and image data.</p></details> | submitted |
| **[Note on High Dimensional Spatial-Sign Test for One Sample Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08736v1)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We revisit the null distribution of the high-dimensional spatial-sign test of Wang et al. (2015) under mild structural assumptions on the scatter matrix. We show that the standardized test statistic converges to a non-Gaussian limit, characterized as a mixture of a normal component and a weighted chi-square component. To facilitate practical implementation, we propose a wild bootstrap procedure for computing critical values and establish its asymptotic validity. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed bootstrap test delivers accurate size control across a wide range of dependence settings and dimension-sample-size regimes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Joint Reproduction Number and Spatial Connectivity Structure Estimation via Graph Sparsity-Promoting Penalized Functional](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20034v2)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>During an epidemic outbreak, decision makers crucially need accurate and robust tools to monitor the pathogen propagation. The effective reproduction number, defined as the expected number of secondary infections stemming from one contaminated individual, is a state-of-the-art indicator quantifying the epidemic intensity. Numerous estimators have been developed to precisely track the reproduction number temporal evolution. Yet, COVID-19 pandemic surveillance raised unprecedented challenges due to the poor quality of worldwide reported infection counts. When monitoring the epidemic in different territories simultaneously, leveraging the spatial structure of data significantly enhances both the accuracy and robustness of reproduction number estimates. However, this requires a good estimate of the spatial structure. To tackle this major limitation, the present work proposes a joint estimator of the reproduction number and connectivity structure. The procedure is assessed through intensive numerical simulations on carefully designed synthetic data and illustrated on real COVID-19 spatiotemporal infection counts.</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Real-Time LiDAR Point Cloud Densification for Low-Latency Spatial Data Transmission](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01210v2)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To realize low-latency spatial transmission system for immersive telepresence, there are two major problems: capturing dynamic 3D scene densely and processing them in real time. LiDAR sensors capture 3D in real time, but produce sparce point clouds. Therefore, this paper presents a high-speed LiDAR point cloud densification method to generate dense 3D scene with minimal latency, addressing the need for on-the-fly depth completion while maintaining real-time performance. Our approach combines multiple LiDAR inputs with high-resolution color images and applies a joint bilateral filtering strategy implemented through a convolutional neural network architecture. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method produces dense depth maps at full HD resolution in real time (30 fps), which is over 15x faster than a recent training-based depth completion approach. The resulting dense point clouds exhibit accurate geometry without multiview inconsistencies or ghosting artifacts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Engineering Spatial and Molecular Features from Cellular Niches to Inform Predictions of Inflammatory Bowel Disease](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09923v2)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentiating between the two main subtypes of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD): Crohns disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) is a persistent clinical challenge due to overlapping presentations. This study introduces a novel computational framework that employs spatial transcriptomics (ST) to create an explainable machine learning model for IBD classification. We analyzed ST data from the colonic mucosa of healthy controls (HC), UC, and CD patients. Using Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), we first identified four recurring cellular niches, representing distinct functional microenvironments within the tissue. From these niches, we systematically engineered 44 features capturing three key aspects of tissue pathology: niche composition, neighborhood enrichment, and niche-gene signals. A multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier trained on these features achieved an accuracy of $0.774 \pm 0.161$ for the more challenging three-class problem (HC, UC, and CD) and $0.916 \pm 0.118$ in the two-class problem of distinguishing IBD from healthy tissue. Crucially, model explainability analysis revealed that disruptions in the spatial organization of niches were the strongest predictors of general inflammation, while the classification between UC and CD relied on specific niche-gene expression signatures. This work provides a robust, proof-of-concept pipeline that transforms descriptive spatial data into an accurate and explainable predictive tool, offering not only a potential new diagnostic paradigm but also deeper insights into the distinct biological mechanisms that drive IBD subtypes.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 8 figures, 7 tables.

| **[Spatial Covariance Constraints for Gaussian Mixture Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07979v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although extensive research exists in spatial modeling, few studies have addressed finite mixture model-based clustering methods for spatial data. Finite mixture models, especially Gaussian mixture models, particularly suffer from high dimensionality due to the number of free covariance parameters. This study introduces a spatial covariance constraint for Gaussian mixture models that requires only four free parameters for each component, independent of dimensionality. Using a coordinate system, the spatially constrained Gaussian mixture model enables clustering of multi-way spatial data and inference of spatial patterns. The parameter estimation is conducted by combining the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm with the generalized least squares (GLS) estimator. Simulation studies and applications to Raman spectroscopy data are provided to demonstrate the proposed model.</p></details> | 19 pages, 7 figures |
| **[SpatialActor: Exploring Disentangled Spatial Representations for Robust Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09555v2)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic manipulation requires precise spatial understanding to interact with objects in the real world. Point-based methods suffer from sparse sampling, leading to the loss of fine-grained semantics. Image-based methods typically feed RGB and depth into 2D backbones pre-trained on 3D auxiliary tasks, but their entangled semantics and geometry are sensitive to inherent depth noise in real-world that disrupts semantic understanding. Moreover, these methods focus on high-level geometry while overlooking low-level spatial cues essential for precise interaction. We propose SpatialActor, a disentangled framework for robust robotic manipulation that explicitly decouples semantics and geometry. The Semantic-guided Geometric Module adaptively fuses two complementary geometry from noisy depth and semantic-guided expert priors. Also, a Spatial Transformer leverages low-level spatial cues for accurate 2D-3D mapping and enables interaction among spatial features. We evaluate SpatialActor on multiple simulation and real-world scenarios across 50+ tasks. It achieves state-of-the-art performance with 87.4% on RLBench and improves by 13.9% to 19.4% under varying noisy conditions, showing strong robustness. Moreover, it significantly enhances few-shot generalization to new tasks and maintains robustness under various spatial perturbations.

| **[Engineering Favorable Propagation: Near-Field IRS Deployment for Spatial Multiplexing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07317v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In intelligent reflecting surface IRS assisted multiple input multiple output MIMO systems, a strong line of sight LoS link is required to compensate for the severe cascaded path loss. However, such a link renders the effective channel highly rank deficient and fundamentally limits spatial multiplexing. To overcome this limitation, this paper leverages the large aperture of sparse arrays to harness near field spherical wavefronts, and establishes a deterministic deployment criterion that strategically positions the IRS in the near field of a base station BS. This placement exploits the spherical wavefronts of the BS IRS link to engineer decorrelated channels, thereby fundamentally overcoming the rank deficiency issue in far field cascaded channels. Based on a physical channel model for the sparse BS array and the IRS, we characterize the rank properties and inter user correlation of the cascaded BS IRS user channel. We further derive a closed form favorable propagation metric that reveals how the sparse array geometry and the IRS position can be tuned to reduce inter user channel correlation. The resulting geometry driven deployment rule provides a simple guideline for creating a favorable propagation environment with enhanced effective degrees of freedom. The favorable channel statistics induced by our deployment criterion enable a low complexity maximum ratio transmission MRT precoding scheme. This serves as the foundation for an efficient algorithm that jointly optimizes the IRS phase shifts and power allocation based solely on long term statistical channel state information CSI. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of our deployment criterion and demonstrate that our optimization framework achieves significant performance gains over benchmark schemes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting the Ordering of Channel and Spatial Attention: A Comprehensive Study on Sequential and Parallel Designs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07310v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Attention mechanisms have become a core component of deep learning models, with Channel Attention and Spatial Attention being the two most representative architectures. Current research on their fusion strategies primarily bifurcates into sequential and parallel paradigms, yet the selection process remains largely empirical, lacking systematic analysis and unified principles. We systematically compare channel-spatial attention combinations under a unified framework, building an evaluation suite of 18 topologies across four classes: sequential, parallel, multi-scale, and residual. Across two vision and nine medical datasets, we uncover a "data scale-method-performance" coupling law: (1) in few-shot tasks, the "Channel-Multi-scale Spatial" cascaded structure achieves optimal performance; (2) in medium-scale tasks, parallel learnable fusion architectures demonstrate superior results; (3) in large-scale tasks, parallel structures with dynamic gating yield the best performance. Additionally, experiments indicate that the "Spatial-Channel" order is more stable and effective for fine-grained classification, while residual connections mitigate vanishing gradient problems across varying data scales. We thus propose scenario-based guidelines for building future attention modules. Code is open-sourced at https://github.com/DWlzm.</p></details> |  |

To facilitate the development of fine-grained spatial and temporal localization capabilities, we curate LoomData-8.7k, a human-centric video dataset with temporally grounded and spatially localized captions. With this, VideoLoom achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance across a variety of spatial and temporal benchmarks (e.g., 63.1 J&F on ReVOS for referring video object segmentation, and 48.3 R1@0.7 on Charades-STA for temporal grounding). In addition, we introduce LoomBench, a novel benchmark consisting of temporal, spatial, and compositional video-question pairs, enabling a comprehensive evaluation of Video LLMs from diverse aspects. Collectively, these contributions offer a universal and effective suite for joint spatial-temporal video understanding, setting a new standard in multimodal intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Automated Diagnosis of Inherited Arrhythmias: Combined Arrhythmia Classification Using Lead-Aware Spatial Attention Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07124v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) and long QT syndrome (LQTS) are inherited arrhythmia syndromes associated with sudden cardiac death. Deep learning shows promise for ECG interpretation, but multi-class inherited arrhythmia classification with clinically grounded interpretability remains underdeveloped. Our objective was to develop and validate a lead-aware deep learning framework for multi-class (ARVC vs LQTS vs control) and binary inherited arrhythmia classification, and to determine optimal strategies for integrating ECG foundation models within arrhythmia screening tools. We assembled a 13-center Canadian cohort (645 patients; 1,344 ECGs). We evaluated four ECG foundation models using three transfer learning approaches: linear probing, fine-tuning, and combined strategies. We developed lead-aware spatial attention networks (LASAN) and assessed integration strategies combining LASAN with foundation models. Performance was compared against the established foundation model baselines. Lead-group masking quantified disease-specific lead dependence. Fine-tuning outperformed linear probing and combined strategies across all foundation models (mean macro-AUROC 0.904 vs 0.825). The best lead-aware integrations achieved near-ceiling performance (HuBERT-ECG hybrid: macro-AUROC 0.990; ARVC vs control AUROC 0.999; LQTS vs control AUROC 0.994). Lead masking demonstrated physiologic plausibility: V1-V3 were most critical for ARVC detection (4.54% AUROC reduction), while lateral leads were preferentially important for LQTS (2.60% drop). Lead-aware architectures achieved state-of-the-art performance for inherited arrhythmia classification, outperforming all existing published models on both binary and multi-class tasks while demonstrating clinically aligned lead dependence. These findings support potential utility for automated ECG screening pending validation.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 2 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Symmetry Breaking, Hysteresis, and Convergence to the Mean Voter in two-party Spatial Competition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07108v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classical spatial models of two-party competition typically predict convergence to the median voter, yet real-world party systems often exhibit persistent and asymmetric polarization. We develop a spatial model of two-party competition in which voters evaluate parties through general satisfaction functions, and a width parameter $q$ captures how tolerant they are of ideological distance. This parameter governs the balance between centripetal and centrifugal incentives and acts as the bifurcation parameter governing equilibrium configurations. Under mild regularity assumptions, we characterize Nash equilibria through center-distance coordinates, which separate the endogenous political center from polarization. When the voter density is symmetric, the reduced equilibrium condition exhibits a generic supercritical pitchfork bifurcation at a critical value $q_{c}$. Above $q_{c}$, the unique stable equilibrium features convergence to the center, recovering the classical median voter result, whereas below it two symmetric polarized equilibria arise. Asymmetry in the voter distribution unfolds the pitchfork, producing drift in the endogenous center and asymmetric polarized equilibria. The resulting equilibrium diagram has an S-shaped geometry that generates hysteresis, allowing polarization to persist even after tolerance returns to levels that would support convergence in a symmetric environment. In the high-tolerance regime, we show that the unique non-polarized equilibrium converges to the mean of the voter distribution, while the median is recovered only under symmetry. Hence, unlike the Hotelling--Downs model, where convergence to the median is universal, the median voter appears here as an asymptotic benchmark rather than a robust predictor.</p></details> | 28 pages, 8 figure |
| **[Adversarial Attacks on Medical Hyperspectral Imaging Exploiting Spectral-Spatial Dependencies and Multiscale Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07056v1)** | 2026-01-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical hyperspectral imaging (HSI) enables accurate disease diagnosis by capturing rich spectral-spatial tissue information, but recent advances in deep learning have exposed its vulnerability to adversarial attacks. In this work, we identify two fundamental causes of this fragility: the reliance on local pixel dependencies for preserving tissue structure and the dependence on multiscale spectral-spatial representations for hierarchical feature encoding. Building on these insights, we propose a targeted adversarial attack framework for medical HSI, consisting of a Local Pixel Dependency Attack that exploits spatial correlations among neighboring pixels, and a Multiscale Information Attack that perturbs features across hierarchical spectral-spatial scales. Experiments on the Brain and MDC datasets demonstrate that our attacks significantly degrade classification performance, especially in tumor regions, while remaining visually imperceptible. Compared with existing methods, our approach reveals the unique vulnerabilities of medical HSI models and underscores the need for robust, structure-aware defenses in clinical applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial Multi-Task Learning for Breast Cancer Molecular Subtype Prediction from Single-Phase DCE-MRI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07001v1)** | 2026-01-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate molecular subtype classification is essential for personalized breast cancer treatment, yet conventional immunohistochemical analysis relies on invasive biopsies and is prone to sampling bias. Although dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) enables non-invasive tumor characterization, clinical workflows typically acquire only single-phase post-contrast images to reduce scan time and contrast agent dose. In this study, we propose a spatial multi-task learning framework for breast cancer molecular subtype prediction from clinically practical single-phase DCE-MRI. The framework simultaneously predicts estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status, and the Ki-67 proliferation index -- biomarkers that collectively define molecular subtypes. The architecture integrates a deep feature extraction network with multi-scale spatial attention to capture intratumoral and peritumoral characteristics, together with a region-of-interest weighting module that emphasizes the tumor core, rim, and surrounding tissue. Multi-task learning exploits biological correlations among biomarkers through shared representations with task-specific prediction branches. Experiments on a dataset of 960 cases (886 internal cases split 7:1:2 for training/validation/testing, and 74 external cases evaluated via five-fold cross-validation) demonstrate that the proposed method achieves an AUC of 0.893, 0.824, and 0.857 for ER, PR, and HER2 classification, respectively, and a mean absolute error of 8.2\% for Ki-67 regression, significantly outperforming radiomics and single-task deep learning baselines. These results indicate the feasibility of accurate, non-invasive molecular subtype prediction using standard imaging protocols.</p></details> |  |
| **[SpatialNav: Leveraging Spatial Scene Graphs for Zero-Shot Vision-and-Language Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06806v1)** | 2026-01-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although learning-based vision-and-language navigation (VLN) agents can learn spatial knowledge implicitly from large-scale training data, zero-shot VLN agents lack this process, relying primarily on local observations for navigation, which leads to inefficient exploration and a significant performance gap. To deal with the problem, we consider a zero-shot VLN setting that agents are allowed to fully explore the environment before task execution. Then, we construct the Spatial Scene Graph (SSG) to explicitly capture global spatial structure and semantics in the explored environment. Based on the SSG, we introduce SpatialNav, a zero-shot VLN agent that integrates an agent-centric spatial map, a compass-aligned visual representation, and a remote object localization strategy for efficient navigation. Comprehensive experiments in both discrete and continuous environments demonstrate that SpatialNav significantly outperforms existing zero-shot agents and clearly narrows the gap with state-of-the-art learning-based methods. Such results highlight the importance of global spatial representations for generalizable navigation.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 4 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

Health systems now routinely generate large volumes of cardiac MRI, CT and echocardiography together with bulk, single-cell and spatial transcriptomics, yet these data are still analysed in separate pipelines. This review examines joint representations that link cardiac imaging phenotypes to transcriptomic and spatially resolved molecular states. An imaging-anchored perspective is adopted in which echocardiography, cardiac MRI and CT define a spatial phenotype of the heart, and bulk, single-cell and spatial transcriptomics provide cell-type- and location-specific molecular context. The biological and technical characteristics of these modalities are first summarised, and representation-learning strategies for each are outlined. Multimodal fusion approaches are reviewed, with emphasis on handling missing data, limited sample size, and batch effects. Finally, integrative pipelines for radiogenomics, spatial molecular alignment, and image-based prediction of gene expression are discussed, together with common failure modes, practical considerations, and open challenges. Spatial multiomics of human myocardium and atherosclerotic plaque, single-cell and spatial foundation models, and multimodal medical foundation models are collectively bringing imaging-anchored multiomics closer to large-scale cardiovascular translation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stereo Audio Rendering for Personal Sound Zones Using a Binaural Spatially Adaptive Neural Network (BSANN)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06621v1)** | 2026-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A binaural rendering framework for personal sound zones (PSZs) is proposed to enable multiple head-tracked listeners to receive fully independent stereo audio programs. Current PSZ systems typically rely on monophonic rendering and therefore cannot control the left and right ears separately, which limits the quality and accuracy of spatial imaging. The proposed method employs a Binaural Spatially Adaptive Neural Network (BSANN) to generate ear-optimized loudspeaker filters that reconstruct the desired acoustic field at each ear of multiple listeners. The framework integrates anechoically measured loudspeaker frequency responses, analytically modeled transducer directivity, and rigid-sphere head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) to enhance acoustic accuracy and spatial rendering fidelity. An explicit active crosstalk cancellation (XTC) stage further improves three-dimensional spatial perception. Experiments show significant gains in measured objective performance metrics, including inter-zone isolation (IZI), inter-program isolation (IPI), and crosstalk cancellation (XTC), with log-frequency-weighted values of 10.23/10.03 dB (IZI), 11.11/9.16 dB (IPI), and 10.55/11.13 dB (XTC), respectively, over 100-20,000 Hz. The combined use of ear-wise control, accurate acoustic modeling, and integrated active XTC produces a unified rendering method that delivers greater isolation performance, increased robustness to room asymmetry, and more faithful spatial reproduction in real acoustic environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing (TASLP)</p></details> |

To address this challenge, we propose 3D CoCa v2, a generalizable 3D captioning framework that unifies contrastive vision-language learning with 3D caption generation and further improves robustness via test-time search (TTS) without updating the captioner parameters. 3D CoCa v2 builds on a frozen CLIP-based semantic prior, a spatially-aware 3D scene encoder for geometry, and a multimodal decoder jointly optimized with contrastive and captioning objectives, avoiding external detectors or handcrafted proposals. At inference, TTS produces diverse caption candidates and performs reward-guided selection using a compact scene summary. Experiments show improvements over 3D CoCa of +1.50 CIDEr@0.5IoU on ScanRefer and +1.61 CIDEr@0.5IoU on Nr3D, and +3.8 CIDEr@0.25 in zero-shot OOD evaluation on TOD3Cap.

| **[From Easy to Hard++: Promoting Differentially Private Image Synthesis Through Spatial-Frequency Curriculum](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06368v1)** | 2026-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To improve the quality of Differentially private (DP) synthetic images, most studies have focused on improving the core optimization techniques (e.g., DP-SGD). Recently, we have witnessed a paradigm shift that takes these techniques off the shelf and studies how to use them together to achieve the best results. One notable work is DP-FETA, which proposes using `central images' for `warming up' the DP training and then using traditional DP-SGD. Inspired by DP-FETA, we are curious whether there are other such tools we can use together with DP-SGD. We first observe that using `central images' mainly works for datasets where there are many samples that look similar. To handle scenarios where images could vary significantly, we propose FETA-Pro, which introduces frequency features as `training shortcuts.' The complexity of frequency features lies between that of spatial features (captured by `central images') and full images, allowing for a finer-grained curriculum for DP training. To incorporate these two types of shortcuts together, one challenge is to handle the training discrepancy between spatial and frequency features. To address it, we leverage the pipeline generation property of generative models (instead of having one model trained with multiple features/objectives, we can have multiple models working on different features, then feed the generated results from one model into another) and use a more flexible design. Specifically, FETA-Pro introduces an auxiliary generator to produce images aligned with noisy frequency features. Then, another model is trained with these images, together with spatial features and DP-SGD. Evaluated across five sensitive image datasets, FETA-Pro shows an average of 25.7% higher fidelity and 4.1% greater utility than the best-performing baseline, under a privacy budget $ε= 1$.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Usenix Security 2026; code available at https://github.com/2019ChenGong/Feta-Pro</p></details> |
| **[Circuit Mechanisms for Spatial Relation Generation in Diffusion Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06338v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have greatly advanced text-to-image generation, but models still struggle to generate the correct spatial relations between objects as specified in the text prompt. In this study, we adopt a mechanistic interpretability approach to investigate how a DiT can generate correct spatial relations between objects. We train, from scratch, DiTs of different sizes with different text encoders to learn to generate images containing two objects whose attributes and spatial relations are specified in the text prompt. We find that, although all the models can learn this task to near-perfect accuracy, the underlying mechanisms differ drastically depending on the choice of text encoder. When using random text embeddings, we find that the spatial-relation information is passed to image tokens through a two-stage circuit, involving two cross-attention heads that separately read the spatial relation and single-object attributes in the text prompt. When using a pretrained text encoder (T5), we find that the DiT uses a different circuit that leverages information fusion in the text tokens, reading spatial-relation and single-object information together from a single text token. We further show that, although the in-domain performance is similar for the two settings, their robustness to out-of-domain perturbations differs, potentially suggesting the difficulty of generating correct relations in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | 31 pages, 23 figures |
| **[GeoSurDepth: Spatial Geometry-Consistent Self-Supervised Depth Estimation for Surround-View Cameras](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05839v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate surround-view depth estimation provides a competitive alternative to laser-based sensors and is essential for 3D scene understanding in autonomous driving. While prior studies have proposed various approaches that primarily focus on enforcing cross-view constraints at the photometric level, few explicitly exploit the rich geometric structure inherent in both monocular and surround-view setting. In this work, we propose GeoSurDepth, a framework that leverages geometry consistency as the primary cue for surround-view depth estimation. Concretely, we utilize foundation models as a pseudo geometry prior and feature representation enhancement tool to guide the network to maintain surface normal consistency in spatial 3D space and regularize object- and texture-consistent depth estimation in 2D. In addition, we introduce a novel view synthesis pipeline where 2D-3D lifting is achieved with dense depth reconstructed via spatial warping, encouraging additional photometric supervision across temporal, spatial, and spatial-temporal contexts, and compensating for the limitations of single-view image reconstruction. Finally, a newly-proposed adaptive joint motion learning strategy enables the network to adaptively emphasize informative spatial geometry cues for improved motion reasoning. Extensive experiments on DDAD and nuScenes demonstrate that GeoSurDepth achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness of our approach. Our framework highlights the importance of exploiting geometry coherence and consistency for robust self-supervised multi-view depth estimation.</p></details> |  |
| **[CoV: Chain-of-View Prompting for Spatial Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05172v2)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied question answering (EQA) in 3D environments often requires collecting context that is distributed across multiple viewpoints and partially occluded. However, most recent vision--language models (VLMs) are constrained to a fixed and finite set of input views, which limits their ability to acquire question-relevant context at inference time and hinders complex spatial reasoning. We propose Chain-of-View (CoV) prompting, a training-free, test-time reasoning framework that transforms a VLM into an active viewpoint reasoner through a coarse-to-fine exploration process. CoV first employs a View Selection agent to filter redundant frames and identify question-aligned anchor views. It then performs fine-grained view adjustment by interleaving iterative reasoning with discrete camera actions, obtaining new observations from the underlying 3D scene representation until sufficient context is gathered or a step budget is reached. We evaluate CoV on OpenEQA across four mainstream VLMs and obtain an average +11.56% improvement in LLM-Match, with a maximum gain of +13.62% on Qwen3-VL-Flash. CoV further exhibits test-time scaling: increasing the minimum action budget yields an additional +2.51% average improvement, peaking at +3.73% on Gemini-2.5-Flash. On ScanQA and SQA3D, CoV delivers strong performance (e.g., 116 CIDEr / 31.9 EM@1 on ScanQA and 51.1 EM@1 on SQA3D). Overall, these results suggest that question-aligned view selection coupled with open-view search is an effective, model-agnostic strategy for improving spatial reasoning in 3D EQA without additional training.

| **[DIFF-MF: A Difference-Driven Channel-Spatial State Space Model for Multi-Modal Image Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05538v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-modal image fusion aims to integrate complementary information from multiple source images to produce high-quality fused images with enriched content. Although existing approaches based on state space model have achieved satisfied performance with high computational efficiency, they tend to either over-prioritize infrared intensity at the cost of visible details, or conversely, preserve visible structure while diminishing thermal target salience. To overcome these challenges, we propose DIFF-MF, a novel difference-driven channel-spatial state space model for multi-modal image fusion. Our approach leverages feature discrepancy maps between modalities to guide feature extraction, followed by a fusion process across both channel and spatial dimensions. In the channel dimension, a channel-exchange module enhances channel-wise interaction through cross-attention dual state space modeling, enabling adaptive feature reweighting. In the spatial dimension, a spatial-exchange module employs cross-modal state space scanning to achieve comprehensive spatial fusion. By efficiently capturing global dependencies while maintaining linear computational complexity, DIFF-MF effectively integrates complementary multi-modal features. Experimental results on the driving scenarios and low-altitude UAV datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in both visual quality and quantitative evaluation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward an Integrated Cross-Urban Accident Prevention System: A Multi-Task Spatial-Temporal Learning Framework for Urban Safety Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05521v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of a cross-city accident prevention system is particularly challenging due to the heterogeneity, inconsistent reporting, and inherently clustered, sparse, cyclical, and noisy nature of urban accident data. These intrinsic data properties, combined with fragmented governance and incompatible reporting standards, have long hindered the creation of an integrated, cross-city accident prevention framework. To address this gap, we propose the Mamba Local-ttention Spatial-Temporal Network MLA-STNet, a unified system that formulates accident risk prediction as a multi-task learning problem across multiple cities. MLA-STNet integrates two complementary modules: (i)the Spatio-Temporal Geographical Mamba-Attention (STG-MA), which suppresses unstable spatio-temporal fluctuations and strengthens long-range temporal dependencies; and (ii) the Spatio-Temporal Semantic Mamba-Attention (STS-MA), which mitigates cross-city heterogeneity through a shared-parameter design that jointly trains all cities while preserving individual semantic representation spaces. We validate the proposed framework through 75 experiments under two forecasting scenarios, full-day and high-frequency accident periods, using real-world datasets from New York City and Chicago. Compared with the state-of-the-art baselines, MLA-STNet achieves up to 6% lower RMSE, 8% higher Recall, and 5% higher MAP, while maintaining less than 1% performance variation under 50% input noise. These results demonstrate that MLA-STNet effectively unifies heterogeneous urban datasets within a scalable, robust, and interpretable Cross-City Accident Prevention System, paving the way for coordinated and data-driven urban safety management.</p></details> | 38pages, 18figures |
| **[Parallel Dynamic Spatial Indexes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05347v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Maintaining spatial data (points in two or three dimensions) is crucial and has a wide range of applications, such as graphics, GIS, and robotics. To handle spatial data, many data structures, called spatial indexes, have been proposed, e.g. kd-trees, oct/quadtrees (also called Orth-trees), R-trees, and bounding volume hierarchies (BVHs). In real-world applications, spatial datasets tend to be highly dynamic, requiring batch updates of points with low latency. This calls for efficient parallel batch updates on spatial indexes. Unfortunately, there is very little work that achieves this. In this paper, we systematically study parallel spatial indexes, with a special focus on achieving high-performance update performance for highly dynamic workloads. We select two types of spatial indexes that are considered optimized for low-latency updates: Orth-tree and R-tree/BVH. We propose two data structures: the P-Orth tree, a parallel Orth-tree, and the SPaC-tree family, a parallel R-tree/BVH. Both the P-Orth tree and the SPaC-tree deliver superior performance in batch updates compared to existing parallel kd-trees and Orth-trees, while preserving better or competitive query performance relative to their corresponding Orth-tree and R-tree counterparts. We also present comprehensive experiments comparing the performance of various parallel spatial indexes and share our findings at the end of the paper.</p></details> |  |

However, existing models predominantly focus on short-horizon predictions and suffer from notorious computational costs and memory consumption when scaling to long-horizon predictions and large graphs. Targeting the above challenges, we present FaST, an effective and efficient framework based on heterogeneity-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoEs) for long-horizon and large-scale STG forecasting, which unlocks one-week-ahead (672 steps at a 15-minute granularity) prediction with thousands of nodes. FaST is underpinned by two key innovations. First, an adaptive graph agent attention mechanism is proposed to alleviate the computational burden inherent in conventional graph convolution and self-attention modules when applied to large-scale graphs. Second, we propose a new parallel MoE module that replaces traditional feed-forward networks with Gated Linear Units (GLUs), enabling an efficient and scalable parallel structure. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that FaST not only delivers superior long-horizon predictive accuracy but also achieves remarkable computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

| **[Model of Spatial Human-Agent Interaction with Consideration for Others](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04657v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Communication robots often need to initiate conversations with people in public spaces. At the same time, such robots must not disturb pedestrians. To handle these two requirements, an agent needs to estimate the communication desires of others based on their behavior and then adjust its own communication activities accordingly. In this study, we construct a computational spatial interaction model that considers others. Consideration is expressed as a quantitative parameter: the amount of adjustment of one's internal state to the estimated internal state of the other. To validate the model, we experimented with a human and a virtual robot interacting in a VR environment. The results show that when the participant moves to the target, a virtual robot with a low consideration value inhibits the participant's movement, while a robot with a higher consideration value did not inhibit the participant's movement. When the participant approached the robot, the robot also exhibited approaching behavior, regardless of the consideration value, thus decreasing the participant's movement. These results appear to verify the proposed model's ability to clarify interactions with consideration for others.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial-Temporal Feedback Diffusion Guidance for Controlled Traffic Imputation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04572v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imputing missing values in spatial-temporal traffic data is essential for intelligent transportation systems. Among advanced imputation methods, score-based diffusion models have demonstrated competitive performance. These models generate data by reversing a noising process, using observed values as conditional guidance. However, existing diffusion models typically apply a uniform guidance scale across both spatial and temporal dimensions, which is inadequate for nodes with high missing data rates. Sparse observations provide insufficient conditional guidance, causing the generative process to drift toward the learned prior distribution rather than closely following the conditional observations, resulting in suboptimal imputation performance. To address this, we propose FENCE, a spatial-temporal feedback diffusion guidance method designed to adaptively control guidance scales during imputation. First, FENCE introduces a dynamic feedback mechanism that adjusts the guidance scale based on the posterior likelihood approximations. The guidance scale is increased when generated values diverge from observations and reduced when alignment improves, preventing overcorrection. Second, because alignment to observations varies across nodes and denoising steps, a global guidance scale for all nodes is suboptimal. FENCE computes guidance scales at the cluster level by grouping nodes based on their attention scores, leveraging spatial-temporal correlations to provide more accurate guidance. Experimental results on real-world traffic datasets show that FENCE significantly enhances imputation accuracy.</p></details> |  |

However, the wide range and high variability of permeability prevent existing methods from providing reliable predictions. For the first time in subsurface spatial prediction, this study presents a quantum-enhanced long short-term memory with attention (QLSTMA) model that incorporates variational quantum circuits (VQCs) into the recurrent cell. Using quantum entanglement and superposition principles, the QLSTMA significantly improves the ability to predict complex geological parameters such as permeability. Two quantization structures, QLSTMA with Shared Gates (QLSTMA-SG) and with Independent Gates (QLSTMA-IG), are designed to investigate and evaluate the effects of quantum structure configurations and the number of qubits on model performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the 8-qubit QLSTMA-IG model significantly outperforms the traditional long short-term memory with attention (LSTMA), reducing Mean Absolute Error (MAE) by 19% and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) by 20%, with particularly strong performance in regions featuring complex well-logging data. These findings validate the potential of quantum-classical hybrid neural networks for reservoir prediction, indicating that increasing the number of qubits yields further accuracy gains despite the reliance on classical simulations. This study establishes a foundational framework for the eventual deployment of such models on real quantum hardware and their extension to broader applications in petroleum engineering and geoscience.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence.

While foundation models excel in single-modal contexts, integrating their capabilities across diverse sensors like cameras and LiDAR to create a unified understanding remains a formidable challenge. This paper presents a comprehensive framework for multi-modal pre-training, identifying the core set of techniques driving progress toward this goal. We dissect the interplay between foundational sensor characteristics and learning strategies, evaluating the role of platform-specific datasets in enabling these advancements. Our central contribution is the formulation of a unified taxonomy for pre-training paradigms: ranging from single-modality baselines to sophisticated unified frameworks that learn holistic representations for advanced tasks like 3D object detection and semantic occupancy prediction. Furthermore, we investigate the integration of textual inputs and occupancy representations to facilitate open-world perception and planning. Finally, we identify critical bottlenecks, such as computational efficiency and model scalability, and propose a roadmap toward general-purpose multi-modal foundation models capable of achieving robust Spatial Intelligence for real-world deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Surve...</summary><p>Survey; 40 pages, 7 figures, 9 tables; GitHub Repo at https://github.com/worldbench/awesome-spatial-intelligence</p></details> |

Nonetheless, these models have significant storage requirements for large and medium-sized scenes, hindering their deployment over cloud and streaming services. Some of the most recent progressive compression techniques for these models rely on progressive masking and scalar quantization techniques to reduce the bitrate of Gaussian attributes using spatial context models. While effective, scalar quantization may not optimally capture the correlations of high-dimensional feature vectors, which can potentially limit the rate-distortion performance. In this work, we introduce a novel progressive codec for 3D Gaussian Splatting that replaces traditional methods with a more powerful Residual Vector Quantization approach to compress the primitive features. Our key contribution is an auto-regressive entropy model, guided by a multi-resolution hash grid, that accurately predicts the conditional probability of each successive transmitted index, allowing for coarse and refinement layers to be compressed with high efficiency.</p></details> |  |

Yet in multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), this hierarchy remains poorly understood, as most studies focus on a narrow set of tasks. We introduce SpatialTree, a cognitive-science-inspired hierarchy that organizes spatial abilities into four levels: low-level perception (L1), mental mapping (L2), simulation (L3), and agentic competence (L4). Based on this taxonomy, we construct the first capability-centric hierarchical benchmark, thoroughly evaluating mainstream MLLMs across 27 sub-abilities. The evaluation results reveal a clear structure: L1 skills are largely orthogonal, whereas higher-level skills are strongly correlated, indicating increasing interdependency. Through targeted supervised fine-tuning, we uncover a surprising transfer dynamic-negative transfer within L1, but strong cross-level transfer from low- to high-level abilities with notable synergy. Finally, we explore how to improve the entire hierarchy. We find that naive RL that encourages extensive "thinking" is unreliable: it helps complex reasoning but hurts intuitive perception. We propose a simple auto-think strategy that suppresses unnecessary deliberation, enabling RL to consistently improve performance across all levels. By building SpatialTree, we provide a proof-of-concept framework for understanding and systematically scaling spatial abilities in MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>webpa...</summary><p>webpage: https://spatialtree.github.io/</p></details> |

Existing learning-based approaches ground spatial understanding in limited scene dataset, restricting generalization to new layouts. We instead reprogram a pre-trained 3D instance generator to act as a scene level learner, replacing dataset-bounded supervision with model-centric spatial supervision. This reprogramming unlocks the generator transferable spatial knowledge, enabling generalization to unseen layouts and novel object compositions. Remarkably, spatial reasoning still emerges even when the training scenes are randomly composed objects. This demonstrates that the generator's transferable scene prior provides a rich learning signal for inferring proximity, support, and symmetry from purely geometric cues. Replacing widely used canonical space, we instantiate this insight with a view-centric formulation of the scene space, yielding a fully feed-forward, generalizable scene generator that learns spatial relations directly from the instance model. Quantitative and qualitative results show that a 3D instance generator is an implicit spatial learner and reasoner, pointing toward foundation models for interactive 3D scene understanding and generation.

Inspired by this question, we introduce SiT-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the SI performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) without pixel-level input, comprises over 3,800 expert-annotated items across five primary categories and 17 subtasks, ranging from egocentric navigation and perspective transformation to fine-grained robotic manipulation. By converting single/multi-view scenes into high-fidelity, coordinate-aware textual descriptions, we challenge LLMs to perform symbolic textual reasoning rather than visual pattern matching. Evaluation results of state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs reveals that while models achieve proficiency in localized semantic tasks, a significant "spatial gap" remains in global consistency. Notably, we find that explicit spatial reasoning significantly boosts performance, suggesting that LLMs possess latent world-modeling potential. Our proposed dataset SiT-Bench serves as a foundational resource to foster the development of spatially-grounded LLM backbones for future VLMs and embodied agents.

In this task, objects often recur across text and point clouds, making spatial relationships the most discriminative cues for localization. Given this characteristic, we present SpatiaLoc, a framework utilizing a coarse-to-fine strategy that emphasizes spatial relationships at both the instance and global levels. In the coarse stage, we introduce a Bezier Enhanced Object Spatial Encoder (BEOSE) that models spatial relationships at the instance level using quadratic Bezier curves. Additionally, a Frequency Aware Encoder (FAE) generates spatial representations in the frequency domain at the global level. In the fine stage, an Uncertainty Aware Gaussian Fine Localizer (UGFL) regresses 2D positions by modeling predictions as Gaussian distributions with a loss function aware of uncertainty. Extensive experiments on KITTI360Pose demonstrate that SpatiaLoc significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.</p></details> |  |

This capability is vital for high-stakes decision-making in systems such as traffic networks, power grids, and disease propagation. However, the field remains underdeveloped because most existing works prioritize predictive accuracy over reasoning. To address the gap, we introduce ST-Bench, a benchmark consisting of four core tasks, including etiological reasoning, entity identification, correlation reasoning, and in-context forecasting, developed via a network SDE-based multi-agent data synthesis pipeline. We then propose STReasoner, which empowers LLM to integrate time series, graph structure, and text for explicit reasoning. To promote spatially grounded logic, we introduce S-GRPO, a reinforcement learning algorithm that rewards performance gains specifically attributable to spatial information. Experiments show that STReasoner achieves average accuracy gains between 17% and 135% at only 0.004X the cost of proprietary models and generalizes robustly to real-world data.</p></details> | <details><summary>prepr...</summary><p>preprint, we release our code publicly at https://github.com/LingFengGold/STReasoner</p></details> |
| **[On the Intrinsic Limits of Transformer Image Embeddings in Non-Solvable Spatial Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03048v1)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Transformers (ViTs) excel in semantic recognition but exhibit systematic failures in spatial reasoning tasks such as mental rotation. While often attributed to data scale, we propose that this limitation arises from the intrinsic circuit complexity of the architecture. We formalize spatial understanding as learning a Group Homomorphism: mapping image sequences to a latent space that preserves the algebraic structure of the underlying transformation group. We demonstrate that for non-solvable groups (e.g., the 3D rotation group $\mathrm{SO}(3)$), maintaining such a structure-preserving embedding is computationally lower-bounded by the Word Problem, which is $\mathsf{NC^1}$-complete. In contrast, we prove that constant-depth ViTs with polynomial precision are strictly bounded by $\mathsf{TC^0}$. Under the conjecture $\mathsf{TC^0} \subsetneq \mathsf{NC^1}$, we establish a complexity boundary: constant-depth ViTs fundamentally lack the logical depth to efficiently capture non-solvable spatial structures. We validate this complexity gap via latent-space probing, demonstrating that ViT representations suffer a structural collapse on non-solvable tasks as compositional depth increases.</p></details> |  |
| **[The World is Not Mono: Enabling Spatial Understanding in Large Audio-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02954v1)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing large audio-language models perceive the world as "mono" -- a single stream of audio that ignores the critical spatial dimension ("where") required for universal acoustic scene analysis. To bridge this gap, we first introduce a hierarchical framework for Auditory Scene Analysis (ASA). Guided by this framework, we introduce a system that enables models like Qwen2-Audio to understand and reason about the complex acoustic world. Our framework achieves this through three core contributions: First, we build a large-scale, synthesized binaural audio dataset to provide the rich spatial cues. Second, we design a hybrid feature projector, which leverages parallel semantic and spatial encoders to extract decoupled representations. These distinct streams are integrated via a dense fusion mechanism, ensuring the model receives a holistic view of the acoustic scene. Finally, we employ a progressive training curriculum, advancing from supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), to explicitly evolve the model's capabilities towards reasoning. On our comprehensive benchmark, the model demonstrates comparatively strong capability for spatial understanding. By enabling this spatial perception, our work provides a clear pathway for leveraging the powerful reasoning abilities of large models towards holistic acoustic scene analysis, advancing from "mono" semantic recognition to spatial intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modeling ICD-10 Morbidity and Multidimensional Poverty as a Spatial Network: Evidence from Thailand](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02848v1)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Health and poverty in Thailand exhibit pronounced geographic structuring, yet the extent to which they operate as interconnected regional systems remains insufficiently understood. This study analyzes ICD-10 chapter-level morbidity and multidimensional poverty as outcomes embedded in a spatial interaction network. Interpreting Thailand's 76 provinces as nodes within a fixed-degree regional graph, we apply tools from spatial econometrics and social network analysis, including Moran's I, Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA), and Spatial Durbin Models (SDM), to assess spatial dependence and cross-provincial spillovers. Our findings reveal strong spatial clustering across multiple ICD-10 chapters, with persistent high-high morbidity zones, particularly for digestive, respiratory, musculoskeletal, and symptom-based diseases, emerging in well-defined regional belts. SDM estimates demonstrate that spillover effects from neighboring provinces frequently exceed the influence of local deprivation, especially for living-condition, health-access, accessibility, and poor-household indicators. These patterns are consistent with contagion and contextual influence processes well established in social network theory. By framing morbidity and poverty as interdependent attributes on a spatial network, this study contributes to the growing literature on structural diffusion, health inequality, and regional vulnerability. The results highlight the importance of coordinated policy interventions across provincial boundaries and demonstrate how network-based modeling can uncover the spatial dynamics of health and deprivation.</p></details> | First draft |
| **[Spatial Polarization Multiplexing: Single-Shot Invisible Shape and Reflectance Recovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13177v3)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose spatial polarization multiplexing (SPM) for joint sensing of shape and reflectance of a static or dynamic deformable object, which is also invisible to the naked eye. Past structured-light methods are limited to shape acquisition and cannot recover reflectance as they alter scene appearance. Our key idea is to spatially multiplex a polarization pattern to encode the incident ray and also densely sample the reflected light. We derive a quantized polarized light pattern that can be robustly and uniquely decoded from the reflected Angle of Linear Polarization (AoLP) values. It also enables single-shot disentanglement of polarimetric diffuse and specular reflections for accurate BRDF estimation. We achieve this spatial polarization multiplexing (SPM) with a constrained de Bruijn sequence. We validate this novel invisible single-shot shape and reflectance method with real static and dynamic objects. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of SPM for accurate shape and BRDF measurement which opens new avenues of application for 3D sensing thanks to its invisibility and ability to jointly recover the radiometric properties.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://vision.ist.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp/research/spm/</p></details> |
| **[RoboTracer: Mastering Spatial Trace with Reasoning in Vision-Language Models for Robotics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13660v2)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial tracing, as a fundamental embodied interaction ability for robots, is inherently challenging as it requires multi-step metric-grounded reasoning compounded with complex spatial referring and real-world metric measurement. However, existing methods struggle with this compositional task. To this end, we propose RoboTracer, a 3D-aware VLM that first achieves both 3D spatial referring and measuring via a universal spatial encoder and a regression-supervised decoder to enhance scale awareness during supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Moreover, RoboTracer advances multi-step metric-grounded reasoning via reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) with metric-sensitive process rewards, supervising key intermediate perceptual cues to accurately generate spatial traces. To support SFT and RFT training, we introduce TraceSpatial, a large-scale dataset of 30M QA pairs, spanning outdoor/indoor/tabletop scenes and supporting complex reasoning processes (up to 9 steps). We further present TraceSpatial-Bench, a challenging benchmark filling the gap to evaluate spatial tracing. Experimental results show that RoboTracer surpasses baselines in spatial understanding, measuring, and referring, with an average success rate of 79.1%, and also achieves SOTA performance on TraceSpatial-Bench by a large margin, exceeding Gemini-2.5-Pro by 36% accuracy. Notably, RoboTracer can be integrated with various control policies to execute long-horizon, dynamic tasks across diverse robots (UR5, G1 humanoid) in cluttered real-world scenes.

We present a novel geospatial agent-based model that integrates climate hazard data with evolutionary learning for economic agents. Our framework combines geospatial agent-based modelling with asset-level damage functions, featuring an illustrative three-sector economy (commodity, manufacturing, retail) with adaptive learning behaviours that allow firms to evolve strategies for budget allocation, pricing, wages, and risk adaptation through fitness-based selection and mutation. We demonstrate the framework using riverine flood projections under RCP8.5 until 2100, comparing four scenarios: baseline and hazard conditions with and without evolutionary learning. Our results show that increasingly frequent and intense acute hazards lower firm production levels, liquidity, and capital, while increasing the prices of goods and unemployment. The framework reveals systemic risks where even agents not directly exposed to floods face impacts through supply chain disruptions. Importantly, evolutionary adaptation enables firms to maintain higher production, capital, liquidity, wages and employment levels while keeping prices lower compared to non-learning counterparts. This open-source framework provides financial institutions and companies with tools to quantify both direct and cascading climate risks while evaluating cost-effective adaptation strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Earli...</summary><p>Earlier version accepted to and presented at NeurIPS 2025 Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning workshop.

Such capabilities are crucial for content-aware graphic layout design, where the goal is to arrange heterogeneous elements onto a canvas so that final design remains visually balanced and structurally feasible. This problem requires precise coordination of placement, alignment, and structural organization of multiple elements within a constrained visual space. To address this limitation, we introduce LaySPA, a reinforcement learning-based framework that augments LLM-based agents with explicit spatial reasoning capabilities for layout design. LaySPA employs hybrid reward signals that jointly capture geometric constraints, structural fidelity, and visual quality, enabling agents to navigate the canvas, model inter-element relationships, and optimize spatial arrangements. Through group-relative policy optimization, the agent generates content-aware layouts that reflect salient regions, respect spatial constraints, and produces an interpretable reasoning trace explaining placement decisions and a structured layout specification. Experimental results show that LaySPA substantially improves the generation of structurally valid and visually appealing layouts, outperforming larger general-purpose LLMs and achieving performance comparable to state-of-the-art specialized layout models.</p></details> |  |
| **[SpatialBench: Can Agents Analyze Real-World Spatial Biology Data?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21907v2)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial transcriptomics assays are rapidly increasing in scale and complexity, making computational analysis a major bottleneck in biological discovery. Although frontier AI agents have improved dramatically at software engineering and general data analysis, it remains unclear whether they can extract biological insight from messy, real-world spatial datasets. We introduce SpatialBench, a benchmark of 146 verifiable problems derived from practical spatial analysis workflows spanning five spatial technologies and seven task categories. Each problem provides a snapshot of experimental data immediately prior to an analysis step and a deterministic grader that evaluates recovery of a key biological result. Benchmark data on frontier models shows that base model accuracy remains low (20-38% across model families), with strong model-task and model-platform interactions. Harness design has a large empirical effect on performance, indicating that tools, prompts, control flow, and execution environment should be evaluated and improved as first-class objects. SpatialBench serves both as a measurement tool and a diagnostic lens for developing agents that can interact with real spatial datasets faithfully, transparently, and reproducibly.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 9 figures, 4 tables; NeurIPS 2024 format</p></details> |
| **[On Statistical Inference for Rates of Change in Spatial Processes over Riemannian Manifolds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02305v1)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Statistical inference for spatial processes from partially realized or scattered data has seen voluminous developments in diverse areas ranging from environmental sciences to business and economics. Inference on the associated rates of change has seen some recent developments. The literature has been restricted to Euclidean domains, where inference is sought on directional derivatives, rates along a chosen direction of interest, at arbitrary locations. Inference for higher order rates, particularly directional curvature has also proved useful in these settings. Modern spatial data often arise from non-Euclidean domains. This manuscript particularly considers spatial processes defined over compact Riemannian manifolds. We develop a comprehensive inferential framework for spatial rates of change for such processes over vector fields. In doing so, we formalize smoothness of process realizations and construct differential processes -- the derivative and curvature processes. We derive conditions for kernels that ensure the existence of these processes and establish validity of the joint multivariate process consisting of the ``parent'' Gaussian process (GP) over the manifold and the associated differential processes. Predictive inference on these rates is devised conditioned on the realized process over the manifold. Manifolds arise as polyhedral meshes in practice. The success of our simulation experiments for assessing derivatives for processes observed over such meshes validate our theoretical findings. By enhancing our understanding of GPs on manifolds, this manuscript unlocks a variety of potential applications in machine learning and statistics where GPs have seen wide usage. We propose a fully model-based approach to inference on the differential processes arising from a spatial process from partially observed or realized data across scattered location on a manifold.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative Site-Specific Beamforming for Next-Generation Spatial Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02301v1)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This article proposes generative site-specific beamforming (GenSSBF) for next-generation spatial intelligence in wireless networks. Site-specific beamforming (SSBF) has emerged as a promising paradigm to mitigate the channel acquisition bottleneck in multiantenna systems by exploiting environmental priors. However, classical SSBF based on discriminative deep learning struggles: 1) to properly represent the inherent multimodality of wireless propagation and 2) to effectively capture the structural features of beamformers. In contrast, by leveraging conditional generative models, GenSSBF addresses these issues via learning a conditional distribution over feasible beamformers. By doing so, the synthesis of diverse and high-fidelity beam candidates from coarse channel sensing measurements can be guaranteed. This article presents the fundamentals, system designs, and implementation methods of GenSSBF. Case studies in both indoor and outdoor scenarios show that GenSSBF attains near-optimal beamforming gain with ultra-low channel acquisition overhead. Finally, several open research problems are highlighted.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Kriging prior Regression: A Case for Kriging-Based Spatial Features with TabPFN in Soil Mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09408v3)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning and geostatistics are two fundamentally different frameworks for predicting and spatially mapping soil properties. Geostatistics leverages the spatial structure of soil properties, while machine learning captures the relationship between available environmental features and soil properties. We propose a hybrid framework that enriches ML with spatial context through engineering of 'spatial lag' features from ordinary kriging. We call this approach 'kriging prior regression' (KpR), as it follows the inverse logic of regression kriging. To evaluate this approach, we assessed both the point and probabilistic prediction performance of KpR, using the TabPFN model across six fieldscale datasets from LimeSoDa. These datasets included soil organic carbon, clay content, and pH, along with features derived from remote sensing and in-situ proximal soil sensing. KpR with TabPFN demonstrated reliable uncertainty estimates and more accurate predictions in comparison to several other spatial techniques (e.g., regression/residual kriging with TabPFN), as well as to established non-spatial machine learning algorithms (e.g., random forest). Most notably, it significantly improved the average R2 by around 30% compared to machine learning algorithms without spatial context. This improvement was due to the strong prediction performance of the TabPFN algorithm itself and the complementary spatial information provided by KpR features. TabPFN is particularly effective for prediction tasks with small sample sizes, common in precision agriculture, whereas KpR can compensate for weak relationships between sensing features and soil properties when proximal soil sensing data are limited. Hence, we conclude that KpR with TabPFN is a very robust and versatile modelling framework for digital soil mapping in precision agriculture.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods often rely on lightweight modules for fast feature extraction, which struggles to preserve structured patterns and fine-grained details, leading to texture attenuation during generation.To address these issues, we propose AlignVTOFF, a novel parallel U-Net framework built upon a Reference U-Net and Texture-Spatial Feature Alignment (TSFA). The Reference U-Net performs multi-scale feature extraction and enhances geometric fidelity, enabling robust modeling of deformation while retaining complex structured patterns. TSFA then injects the reference garment features into a frozen denoising U-Net via a hybrid attention design, consisting of a trainable cross-attention module and a frozen self-attention module. This design explicitly aligns texture and spatial cues and alleviates the loss of high-frequency information during the denoising process.Extensive experiments across multiple settings demonstrate that AlignVTOFF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, producing flat-lay garment results with improved structural realism and high-frequency detail fidelity.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches either revisit local image patches, improving fine-grained perception but weakening global spatial awareness, or mark isolated coordinates, which capture object locations but overlook their overall organization. In this work, we integrate the cognitive concept of an object-centric blueprint into VLMs to enhance spatial reasoning. Given an image and a question, the model first constructs a JSON-style blueprint that records the positions, sizes, and attributes of relevant objects, and then reasons over this structured representation to produce the final answer. To achieve this, we introduce three key techniques: (1) blueprint-embedded reasoning traces for supervised fine-tuning to elicit basic reasoning skills; (2) blueprint-aware rewards in reinforcement learning to encourage the blueprint to include an appropriate number of objects and to align final answers with this causal reasoning; and (3) anti-shortcut data augmentation that applies targeted perturbations to images and questions, discouraging reliance on superficial visual or linguistic cues. Experiments show that our method consistently outperforms existing VLMs and specialized spatial reasoning models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

However, most of the works have focused on non-scalable image compression (single-layer coding) while spatially scalable image compression has drawn less attention although it has many applications. In this paper, we propose a novel NN-based spatially scalable image compression method, called COMPASS, which supports arbitrary-scale spatial scalability. Our proposed COMPASS has a very flexible structure where the number of layers and their respective scale factors can be arbitrarily determined during inference. To reduce the spatial redundancy between adjacent layers for arbitrary scale factors, our COMPASS adopts an inter-layer arbitrary scale prediction method, called LIFF, based on implicit neural representation. We propose a combined RD loss function to effectively train multiple layers. Experimental results show that our COMPASS achieves BD-rate gain of -58.33% and -47.17% at maximum compared to SHVC and the state-of-the-art NN-based spatially scalable image compression method, respectively, for various combinations of scale factors. Our COMPASS also shows comparable or even better coding efficiency than the single-layer coding for various scale factors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ICCV 2023.

In this work, we introduce SpatialReasoner-R1, a vision-language reasoning model designed to address these limitations. To construct high-quality supervision for spatial reasoning, we design a Multi-Model Monte Carlo Tree Search (M3CTS) method that generates diverse, logically consistent Long Chain-of-Thought (LongCOT) reasoning trajectories. In addition, we propose a fine-grained Direct Preference Optimization (fDPO) method that introduces segment-specific preference granularity for descriptive grounding and logical reasoning, guided by a spatial reward mechanism that evaluates candidate responses based on visual consistency, spatial grounding, and logical coherence. Experimental results demonstrate that fDPO achieves relative performance gains of 4.1% and 9.0% over standard DPO on spatial qualitative and quantitative tasks, respectively. SpatialReasoner-R1, trained with fDPO, sets a new SoTA on SpatialRGPT-Bench, outperforming the strongest baseline by 9.4% in average accuracy, while maintaining competitive performance on general vision-language tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Emergence of Linear Behavior in Large-Scale Dynamical Systems via Spatial Averaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25589v2)** | 2026-01-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Various natural and engineered systems, from urban traffic flow to the human brain, can be described by large-scale networked dynamical systems. These systems are similar in being comprised of a large number of microscopic subsystems, each with complex nonlinear dynamics and interactions, that collectively give rise to different forms of macroscopic dynamics. Despite significant research, why and how various forms of macroscopic dynamics emerge from underlying micro-dynamics remains largely unknown. In this work we focus on linearity as one of the most fundamental aspects of system dynamics. By extending the theory of mixing sequences, we show that \textit{in a broad class of autonomous nonlinear networked systems, the dynamics of the average of all subsystems' states becomes asymptotically linear as the number of subsystems grows to infinity, provided that, in addition to technical assumptions, pairwise correlations between subsystems decay to 0 as their pairwise distance grows to infinity}. We prove this result when the latter distance is between subsystems' linear indices or spatial locations, and provide extensions to linear time-invariant (LTI) limit dynamics, finite-sample analysis of rates of convergence, and networks of spatially-embedded subsystems with random locations. To our knowledge, this work is the first rigorous analysis of macroscopic linearity in large-scale heterogeneous networked dynamical systems, and provides a solid foundation for further theoretical and empirical analyses in various domains of science and engineering.</p></details> |  |

To address these limitations, we introduce Teleo-Spatial Intelligence (TSI), a new paradigm that unifies two critical pillars: Physical-Dynamic Reasoning--understanding the physical principles of object interactions--and Intent-Driven Reasoning--inferring the human goals behind these actions. To catalyze research in TSI, we present EscherVerse, consisting of a large-scale, open-world benchmark (Escher-Bench), a dataset (Escher-35k), and models (Escher series). Derived from real-world videos, EscherVerse moves beyond constrained settings to explicitly evaluate an agent's ability to reason about object permanence, state transitions, and trajectory prediction in dynamic, human-centric scenarios. Crucially, it is the first benchmark to systematically assess Intent-Driven Reasoning, challenging models to connect physical events to their underlying human purposes. Our work, including a novel data curation pipeline, provides a foundational resource to advance spatial intelligence from passive scene description toward a holistic, purpose-driven understanding of the world.</p></details> |  |

To push the boundaries of VLMs in remote sensing, we specifically address vehicle imagery captured by drones and introduce a spatially-aware dataset AirSpatial, which comprises over 206K instructions and introduces two novel tasks: Spatial Grounding and Spatial Question Answering. It is also the first remote sensing grounding dataset to provide 3DBB. To effectively leverage existing image understanding of VLMs to spatial domains, we adopt a two-stage training strategy comprising Image Understanding Pre-training and Spatial Understanding Fine-tuning. Utilizing this trained spatially-aware VLM, we develop an aerial agent, AirSpatialBot, which is capable of fine-grained vehicle attribute recognition and retrieval. By dynamically integrating task planning, image understanding, spatial understanding, and task execution capabilities, AirSpatialBot adapts to diverse query requirements. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach, revealing the spatial limitations of existing VLMs while providing valuable insights.

However, the scarcity of high-quality spatial natural language query corpora limits the performance of such systems. Existing methods rely on manual knowledge base construction and template-based dynamic generation, which suffer from low construction efficiency and unstable corpus quality. This paper presents semantic-aware spatial corpus construction (SSCC), a tool designed for constructing high-quality spatial natural language query and executable language query pair corpora. SSCC consists of two core modules: (i) a knowledge base construction module based on spatial relations, which extracts and determines spatial relations from datasets, and (ii) a template-augmented query pair corpus generation module, which produces query pairs via template matching and parameter substitution. The tool ensures geometric consistency and adherence to spatial logic in the generated spatial relations. Experimental results demonstrate that SSCC achieves (i) a 53x efficiency improvement for knowledge base construction and (ii) a 2.5x effectiveness improvement for query pair corpus. SSCC provides high-quality corpus support for spatial natural language interface training, substantially reducing both time and labor costs in corpus construction.</p></details> |  |
| **[ManiBox: Enhancing Embodied Spatial Generalization via Scalable Simulation Data Generations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01850v3)** | 2026-01-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied agents require robust spatial intelligence to execute precise real-world manipulations. However, this remains a significant challenge, as current methods often struggle to accurately position objects in space. Collecting extensive data can help address this issue by enhancing the agent's spatial understanding. Nonetheless, obtaining such data with real robots is prohibitively expensive, and relying on simulation data frequently leads to visual generalization gaps during real-world deployment. To tackle these challenges, we propose ManiBox, a novel bounding-box-guided framework. By decoupling perception from policy generalization, ManiBox effectively reduces the Sim2Real gap, leverages Internet-scale data, and scales our policy data collection in simulation. Specifically, within ManiBox, the RL teacher policy efficiently generates scalable simulation data. The student policy is distilled from this data and takes bounding boxes as input, which is proven sufficient for determining objects' spatial positions, thus enabling zero-shot transfer to real robots. Comprehensive evaluations in both simulated and real-world environments demonstrate that ManiBox exhibits strong spatial generalization and adaptability across various manipulation tasks and settings. Furthermore, our empirical study provides preliminary verification of spatial scaling laws, i.e., the amount of data required for spatial generalization scales with spatial volume following a power-law relationship. At a given spatial volume level, the success rate of manipulation tasks follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics with respect to data volume, exhibiting a saturation effect as data increases.

Although convolutional networks provide local precision at $\mathcal{O}(n)$ cost but limited receptive fields, vision transformers achieve global context through $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ self-attention at prohibitive computational expense, causing overfitting on small clinical datasets. We propose S2M-Net, a 4.7M-parameter architecture that achieves $\mathcal{O}(HW \log HW)$ global context through two synergistic innovations: (i) Spectral-Selective Token Mixer (SSTM), which exploits the spectral concentration of medical images via truncated 2D FFT with learnable frequency filtering and content-gated spatial projection, avoiding quadratic attention cost while maintaining global receptive fields; and (ii) Morphology-Aware Adaptive Segmentation Loss (MASL), which automatically analyzes structure characteristics (compactness, tubularity, irregularity, scale) to modulate five complementary loss components through constrained learnable weights, eliminating manual per-dataset tuning. Comprehensive evaluation in 16 medical imaging datasets that span 8 modalities demonstrates state-of-the-art performance: 96.12\% Dice on polyp segmentation, 83.77\% on surgical instruments (+17.85\% over the prior art) and 80.90\% on brain tumors, with consistent 3-18\% improvements over specialized baselines while using 3.5--6$\times$ fewer parameters than transformer-based methods.</p></details> |  |

It extends Video Crowd Counting (VCC) beyond the per-frame pedestrian count. In contrast to VCC that learns to count pedestrians across frames, VIC must identify co-existent pedestrians between frames, which turns out to be a correspondence problem. Existing VIC approaches, however, can underperform in congested scenes such as metro commuting. To address this, we build WuhanMetroCrowd, one of the first VIC datasets that characterize crowded, dynamic pedestrian flows. It features sparse-to-dense density levels, short-to-long video clips, slow-to-fast flow variations, front-to-back appearance changes, and light-to-heavy occlusions. To better adapt VIC approaches to crowds, we rethink the nature of VIC and recognize two informative priors: i) the social grouping prior that indicates pedestrians tend to gather in groups and ii) the spatial-temporal displacement prior that informs an individual cannot teleport physically. The former inspires us to relax the standard one-to-one (O2O) matching used by VIC to one-to-many (O2M) matching, implemented by an implicit context generator and a O2M matcher; the latter facilitates the design of a displacement prior injector, which strengthens not only O2M matching but also feature extraction and model training. These designs jointly form a novel and strong VIC baseline OMAN++. Extensive experiments show that OMAN++ not only outperforms state-of-the-art VIC baselines on the standard SenseCrowd, CroHD, and MovingDroneCrowd benchmarks, but also indicates a clear advantage in crowded scenes, with a 38.12% error reduction on our WuhanMetroCrowd dataset.

However, even with the powerful pretrained vision language models (VLMs), recent approaches are still not qualified to accurately understand the complex 3D scenes and dynamically reason about the instruction-indicated locations for interaction. To this end, we propose RoboRefer, a 3D-aware VLM that can first achieve precise spatial understanding by integrating a disentangled but dedicated depth encoder via supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Moreover, RoboRefer advances generalized multi-step spatial reasoning via reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), with metric-sensitive process reward functions tailored for spatial referring tasks. To support SFT and RFT training, we introduce RefSpatial, a large-scale dataset of 20M QA pairs (2x prior), covering 31 spatial relations (vs. 15 prior) and supporting complex reasoning processes (up to 5 steps). In addition, we introduce RefSpatial-Bench, a challenging benchmark filling the gap in evaluating spatial referring with multi-step reasoning. Experiments show that SFT-trained RoboRefer achieves state-of-the-art spatial understanding, with an average success rate of 89.6%. RFT-trained RoboRefer further outperforms all other baselines by a large margin, even surpassing Gemini-2.5-Pro by 17.4% in average accuracy on RefSpatial-Bench. Notably, RoboRefer can be integrated with various control policies to execute long-horizon, dynamic tasks across diverse robots (e,g., UR5, G1 humanoid) in cluttered real-world scenes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025.

Recently, we have witnessed the rise of variational autoencoder-based latent factor models, which learn latent factors self-adaptively. While these models focus on modeling overall market conditions, they often fail to effectively capture the temporal patterns of individual stocks. Additionally, representing multiple factors as single values simplifies the model but limits its ability to capture complex relationships and dependencies. As a result, the learned factors are of low quality and lack diversity, reducing their effectiveness and robustness across different trading periods. To address these issues, we propose a Spatio-Temporal factOR Model based on dual vector quantized variational autoencoders, named STORM, which extracts features of stocks from temporal and spatial perspectives, then fuses and aligns these features at the fine-grained and semantic level, and represents the factors as multi-dimensional embeddings. The discrete codebooks cluster similar factor embeddings, ensuring orthogonality and diversity, which helps distinguish between different factors and enables factor selection in financial trading. To show the performance of the proposed factor model, we apply it to two downstream experiments: portfolio management on two stock datasets and individual trading tasks on six specific stocks. The extensive experiments demonstrate STORM's flexibility in adapting to downstream tasks and superior performance over baseline models.</p></details> |  |
| **[TrackNetV5: Residual-Driven Spatio-Temporal Refinement and Motion Direction Decoupling for Fast Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02789v4)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The TrackNet series has established a strong baseline for fast-moving small object tracking in sports. However, existing iterations face significant limitations: V1-V3 struggle with occlusions due to a reliance on purely visual cues, while TrackNetV4, despite introducing motion inputs, suffers from directional ambiguity as its absolute difference method discards motion polarity. To overcome these bottlenecks, we propose TrackNetV5, a robust architecture integrating two novel mechanisms. First, to recover lost directional priors, we introduce the Motion Direction Decoupling (MDD) module. Unlike V4, MDD decomposes temporal dynamics into signed polarity fields, explicitly encoding both movement occurrence and trajectory direction. Second, we propose the Residual-Driven Spatio-Temporal Refinement (R-STR) head. Operating on a coarse-to-fine paradigm, this Transformer-based module leverages factorized spatio-temporal contexts to estimate a corrective residual, effectively recovering occluded targets. Extensive experiments on the TrackNetV2 dataset demonstrate that TrackNetV5 achieves a new state-of-the-art F1-score of 0.9859 and an accuracy of 0.9733, significantly outperforming previous versions. Notably, this performance leap is achieved with a marginal 3.7% increase in FLOPs compared to V4, maintaining real-time inference capabilities while delivering superior tracking precision.</p></details> |  |
| **[U-MASK: User-adaptive Spatio-Temporal Masking for Personalized Mobile AI Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06867v1)** | 2026-01-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Personalized mobile artificial intelligence applications are widely deployed, yet they are expected to infer user behavior from sparse and irregular histories under a continuously evolving spatio-temporal context. This setting induces a fundamental tension among three requirements, i.e., immediacy to adapt to recent behavior, stability to resist transient noise, and generalization to support long-horizon prediction and cold-start users. Most existing approaches satisfy at most two of these requirements, resulting in an inherent impossibility triangle in data-scarce, non-stationary personalization. To address this challenge, we model mobile behavior as a partially observed spatio-temporal tensor and unify short-term adaptation, long-horizon forecasting, and cold-start recommendation as a conditional completion problem, where a user- and task-specific mask specifies which coordinates are treated as evidence. We propose U-MASK, a user-adaptive spatio-temporal masking method that allocates evidence budgets based on user reliability and task sensitivity. To enable mask generation under sparse observations, U-MASK learns a compact, task-agnostic user representation from app and location histories via U-SCOPE, which serves as the sole semantic conditioning signal. A shared diffusion transformer then performs mask-guided generative completion while preserving observed evidence, so personalization and task differentiation are governed entirely by the mask and the user representation. Experiments on real-world mobile datasets demonstrate consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods across short-term prediction, long-horizon forecasting, and cold-start settings, with the largest gains under severe data sparsity. The code and dataset will be available at https://github.com/NICE-HKU/U-MASK.</p></details> | 18 pages, 9 figures |
| **[LaST$_{0}$: Latent Spatio-Temporal Chain-of-Thought for Robotic Vision-Language-Action Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05248v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently demonstrated strong generalization capabilities in robotic manipulation. Some existing VLA approaches attempt to improve action accuracy by explicitly generating linguistic reasoning traces or future visual observations before action execution. However, explicit reasoning typically incurs non-negligible inference latency, which constrains the temporal resolution required for robotic manipulation. Moreover, such reasoning is confined to the linguistic space, imposing a representational bottleneck that struggles to faithfully capture ineffable physical attributes. To mitigate these limitations, we propose LaST$_0$, a framework that enables efficient reasoning before acting through a Latent Spatio-Temporal Chain-of-Thought (CoT), capturing fine-grained physical and robotic dynamics that are often difficult to verbalize. Specifically, we introduce a token-efficient latent CoT space that models future visual dynamics, 3D structural information, and robot proprioceptive states, and further extends these representations across time to enable temporally consistent implicit reasoning trajectories. Furthermore, LaST$_0$ adopts a dual-system architecture implemented via a Mixture-of-Transformers design, where a reasoning expert conducts low-frequency latent inference and an acting expert generates high-frequency actions conditioned on robotics-oriented latent representations. To facilitate coordination, LaST$_0$ is trained with heterogeneous operation frequencies, enabling adaptive switching between reasoning and action inference rates during deployment. Across ten simulated and six real-world manipulation tasks, LaST$_0$ improves mean success rates by 8% and 13% over prior VLA methods, respectively, while achieving substantially faster inference.

| **[SparseLaneSTP: Leveraging Spatio-Temporal Priors with Sparse Transformers for 3D Lane Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04968v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D lane detection has emerged as a critical challenge in autonomous driving, encompassing identification and localization of lane markings and the 3D road surface. Conventional 3D methods detect lanes from dense birds-eye-viewed (BEV) features, though erroneous transformations often result in a poor feature representation misaligned with the true 3D road surface. While recent sparse lane detectors have surpassed dense BEV approaches, they completely disregard valuable lane-specific priors. Furthermore, existing methods fail to utilize historic lane observations, which yield the potential to resolve ambiguities in situations of poor visibility. To address these challenges, we present SparseLaneSTP, a novel method that integrates both geometric properties of the lane structure and temporal information into a sparse lane transformer. It introduces a new lane-specific spatio-temporal attention mechanism, a continuous lane representation tailored for sparse architectures as well as temporal regularization. Identifying weaknesses of existing 3D lane datasets, we also introduce a precise and consistent 3D lane dataset using a simple yet effective auto-labeling strategy. Our experimental section proves the benefits of our contributions and demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across all detection and error metrics on existing 3D lane detection benchmarks as well as on our novel dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) 2025</p></details> |
| **[ASTGI: Adaptive Spatio-Temporal Graph Interactions for Irregular Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23313v2)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Irregular multivariate time series (IMTS) are prevalent in critical domains like healthcare and finance, where accurate forecasting is vital for proactive decision-making. However, the asynchronous sampling and irregular intervals inherent to IMTS pose two core challenges for existing methods: (1) how to accurately represent the raw information of irregular time series without introducing data distortion, and (2) how to effectively capture the complex dynamic dependencies between observation points. To address these challenges, we propose the Adaptive Spatio-Temporal Graph Interaction (ASTGI) framework. Specifically, the framework first employs a Spatio-Temporal Point Representation module to encode each discrete observation as a point within a learnable spatio-temporal embedding space. Second, a Neighborhood-Adaptive Graph Construction module adaptively builds a causal graph for each point in the embedding space via nearest neighbor search. Subsequently, a Spatio-Temporal Dynamic Propagation module iteratively updates information on these adaptive causal graphs by generating messages and computing interaction weights based on the relative spatio-temporal positions between points. Finally, a Query Point-based Prediction module generates the final forecast by aggregating neighborhood information for a new query point and performing regression. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that ASTGI outperforms various state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[GEnSHIN: Graphical Enhanced Spatio-temporal Hierarchical Inference Network for Traffic Flow Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04550v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the acceleration of urbanization, intelligent transportation systems have an increasing demand for accurate traffic flow prediction. This paper proposes a novel Graph Enhanced Spatio-temporal Hierarchical Inference Network (GEnSHIN) to handle the complex spatio-temporal dependencies in traffic flow prediction. The model integrates three innovative designs: 1) An attention-enhanced Graph Convolutional Recurrent Unit (GCRU), which strengthens the modeling capability for long-term temporal dependencies by introducing Transformer modules; 2) An asymmetric dual-embedding graph generation mechanism, which leverages the real road network and data-driven latent asymmetric topology to generate graph structures that better fit the characteristics of actual traffic flow; 3) A dynamic memory bank module, which utilizes learnable traffic pattern prototypes to provide personalized traffic pattern representations for each sensor node, and introduces a lightweight graph updater during the decoding phase to adapt to dynamic changes in road network states. Extensive experiments on the public dataset METR-LA show that GEnSHIN achieves or surpasses the performance of comparative models across multiple metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). Notably, the model demonstrates excellent prediction stability during peak morning and evening traffic hours. Ablation experiments further validate the effectiveness of each core module and its contribution to the final performance.</p></details> |  |

This capability is vital for high-stakes decision-making in systems such as traffic networks, power grids, and disease propagation. However, the field remains underdeveloped because most existing works prioritize predictive accuracy over reasoning. To address the gap, we introduce ST-Bench, a benchmark consisting of four core tasks, including etiological reasoning, entity identification, correlation reasoning, and in-context forecasting, developed via a network SDE-based multi-agent data synthesis pipeline. We then propose STReasoner, which empowers LLM to integrate time series, graph structure, and text for explicit reasoning. To promote spatially grounded logic, we introduce S-GRPO, a reinforcement learning algorithm that rewards performance gains specifically attributable to spatial information. Experiments show that STReasoner achieves average accuracy gains between 17% and 135% at only 0.004X the cost of proprietary models and generalizes robustly to real-world data.</p></details> | <details><summary>prepr...</summary><p>preprint, we release our code publicly at https://github.com/LingFengGold/STReasoner</p></details> |
| **[Learning and Optimizing the Efficacy of Spatio-Temporal Task Allocation under Temporal and Resource Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02505v1)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Complex multi-robot missions often require heterogeneous teams to jointly optimize task allocation, scheduling, and path planning to improve team performance under strict constraints. We formalize these complexities into a new class of problems, dubbed Spatio-Temporal Efficacy-optimized Allocation for Multi-robot systems (STEAM). STEAM builds upon trait-based frameworks that model robots using their capabilities (e.g., payload and speed), but goes beyond the typical binary success-failure model by explicitly modeling the efficacy of allocations as trait-efficacy maps. These maps encode how the aggregated capabilities assigned to a task determine performance. Further, STEAM accommodates spatio-temporal constraints, including a user-specified time budget (i.e., maximum makespan). To solve STEAM problems, we contribute a novel algorithm named Efficacy-optimized Incremental Task Allocation Graph Search (E-ITAGS) that simultaneously optimizes task performance and respects time budgets by interleaving task allocation, scheduling, and path planning. Motivated by the fact that trait-efficacy maps are difficult, if not impossible, to specify, E-ITAGS efficiently learns them using a realizability-aware active learning module. Our approach is realizability-aware since it explicitly accounts for the fact that not all combinations of traits are realizable by the robots available during learning. Further, we derive experimentally-validated bounds on E-ITAGS' suboptimality with respect to efficacy. Detailed numerical simulations and experiments using an emergency response domain demonstrate that E-ITAGS generates allocations of higher efficacy compared to baselines, while respecting resource and spatio-temporal constraints. We also show that our active learning approach is sample efficient and establishes a principled tradeoff between data and computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>The j...</summary><p>The journal extension version of our conference paper: arXiv:2404.07902, which has been accepted by ISRR 2024</p></details> |
| **[A Spatio-Temporal Deep Learning Approach For High-Resolution Gridded Monsoon Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02445v1)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) is a critical climate phenomenon, fundamentally impacting the agriculture, economy, and water security of over a billion people. Traditional long-range forecasting, whether statistical or dynamical, has predominantly focused on predicting a single, spatially-averaged seasonal value, lacking the spatial detail essential for regional-level resource management. To address this gap, we introduce a novel deep learning framework that reframes gridded monsoon prediction as a spatio-temporal computer vision task. We treat multi-variable, pre-monsoon atmospheric and oceanic fields as a sequence of multi-channel images, effectively creating a video-like input tensor. Using 85 years of ERA5 reanalysis data for predictors and IMD rainfall data for targets, we employ a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based architecture to learn the complex mapping from the five-month pre-monsoon period (January-May) to a high-resolution gridded rainfall pattern for the subsequent monsoon season. Our framework successfully produces distinct forecasts for each of the four monsoon months (June-September) as well as the total seasonal average, demonstrating its utility for both intra-seasonal and seasonal outlooks.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, 2 Tables, to be submitted to "IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing"</p></details> |
| **[Spatio-temporal modeling and forecasting with Fourier neural operators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01813v1)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal process models are often used for modeling dynamic physical and biological phenomena that evolve across space and time. These phenomena may exhibit environmental heterogeneity and complex interactions that are difficult to capture using traditional statistical process models such as Gaussian processes. This work proposes the use of Fourier neural operators (FNOs) for constructing statistical dynamical spatio-temporal models for forecasting. An FNO is a flexible mapping of functions that approximates the solution operator of possibly unknown linear or non-linear partial differential equations (PDEs) in a computationally efficient manner. It does so using samples of inputs and their respective outputs, and hence explicit knowledge of the underlying PDE is not required. Through simulations from a nonlinear PDE with known solution, we compare FNO forecasts to those from state-of-the-art statistical spatio-temporal-forecasting methods. Further, using sea surface temperature data over the Atlantic Ocean and precipitation data across Europe, we demonstrate the ability of FNO-based dynamic spatio-temporal (DST) statistical modeling to capture complex real-world spatio-temporal dependencies. Using collections of testing instances, we show that the FNO-DST forecasts are accurate with valid uncertainty quantification.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Graph Deep Learning with Stochastic Differential Equations for Uncovering Alzheimer's Disease Progression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21735v3)** | 2026-01-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying objective neuroimaging biomarkers to forecast Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression is crucial for timely intervention. However, this task remains challenging due to the complex dysfunctions in the spatio-temporal characteristics of underlying brain networks, which are often overlooked by existing methods. To address these limitations, we develop an interpretable spatio-temporal graph neural network framework to predict future AD progression, leveraging dual Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) to model the irregularly-sampled longitudinal functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. We validate our approach on two independent cohorts, including the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS-3) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Our framework effectively learns sparse regional and connective importance probabilities, enabling the identification of key brain circuit abnormalities associated with disease progression. Notably, we detect the parahippocampal cortex, prefrontal cortex, and parietal lobule as salient regions, with significant disruptions in the ventral attention, dorsal attention, and default mode networks. These abnormalities correlate strongly with longitudinal AD-related clinical symptoms. Moreover, our interpretability strategy reveals both established and novel neural systems-level and sex-specific biomarkers, offering new insights into the neurobiological mechanisms underlying AD progression. Our findings highlight the potential of spatio-temporal graph-based learning for early, individualized prediction of AD progression, even in the context of irregularly-sampled longitudinal imaging data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Echo State Networks for Spatio-Temporal Area-Level Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10641v2)** | 2026-01-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal area-level datasets play a critical role in official statistics, providing valuable insights for policy-making and regional planning. Accurate modeling and forecasting of these datasets can be extremely useful for policymakers to develop informed strategies for future planning. Echo State Networks (ESNs) are efficient methods for capturing nonlinear temporal dynamics and generating forecasts. However, ESNs lack a direct mechanism to account for the neighborhood structure inherent in area-level data. Ignoring these spatial relationships can significantly compromise the accuracy and utility of forecasts. In this paper, we incorporate approximate graph spectral filters at the input stage of the ESN, thereby improving forecast accuracy while preserving the model's computational efficiency during training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using Eurostat's tourism occupancy dataset and show how it can support more informed decision-making in policy and planning contexts.</p></details> | 23 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Damba-ST: Domain-Adaptive Mamba for Efficient Urban Spatio-Temporal Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18939v3)** | 2026-01-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training urban spatio-temporal foundation models that generalize well across diverse regions and cities is critical for deploying urban services in unseen or data-scarce regions. Recent studies have typically focused on fusing cross-domain spatio-temporal data to train unified Transformer-based models. However, these models suffer from quadratic computational complexity and high memory overhead, limiting their scalability and practical deployment. Inspired by the efficiency of Mamba, a state space model with linear time complexity, we explore its potential for efficient urban spatio-temporal prediction. However, directly applying Mamba as a spatio-temporal backbone leads to negative transfer and severe performance degradation. This is primarily due to spatio-temporal heterogeneity and the recursive mechanism of Mamba's hidden state updates, which limit cross-domain generalization. To overcome these challenges, we propose Damba-ST, a novel domain-adaptive Mamba-based model for efficient urban spatio-temporal prediction. Damba-ST retains Mamba's linear complexity advantage while significantly enhancing its adaptability to heterogeneous domains. Specifically, we introduce two core innovations: (1) a domain-adaptive state space model that partitions the latent representation space into a shared subspace for learning cross-domain commonalities and independent, domain-specific subspaces for capturing intra-domain discriminative features; (2) three distinct Domain Adapters, which serve as domain-aware proxies to bridge disparate domain distributions and facilitate the alignment of cross-domain commonalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate the generalization and efficiency of Damba-ST. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on prediction tasks and demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization, enabling seamless deployment in new urban environments without extensive retraining or fine-tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICDE 2026</p></details> |

Rather than relying on inefficient standard im2col-like implementations (e.g., spatial convolutions, depthwise convolutions and feature-shifting mechanisms) or hardware-specific CUDA kernels (e.g., deformable and neighborhood attention), which often suffer from limited portability across non-CUDA devices, we reorganize the local sampling process through a direction-based sampling perspective. Specifically, we implement a non-parametric sampling mechanism that enables dynamically varying sampling regions. This approach provides the flexibility to adapt to diverse spatial structures without the computational costs of parametric layers and the need for model retraining. To further enhance feature coherence across frames, we design a supervised spatio-temporal contrastive learning scheme that enforces consistency in feature representations. In addition, we introduce a publicly available benchmark dataset for multi-object segmentation in X-ray angiography videos (MOSXAV), featuring detailed, manually labeled segmentation ground truth. Extensive experiments on the CADICA, XACV, and MOSXAV datasets show that our proposed FSVOS method outperforms current state-of-the-art video segmentation methods in terms of segmentation accuracy and generalization capability (i.e., seen and unseen categories). This work offers enhanced flexibility and potential for a wide range of clinical applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[IMBWatch -- a Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network approach to detect Illicit Massage Business](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00075v1)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Illicit Massage Businesses (IMBs) are a covert and persistent form of organized exploitation that operate under the facade of legitimate wellness services while facilitating human trafficking, sexual exploitation, and coerced labor. Detecting IMBs is difficult due to encoded digital advertisements, frequent changes in personnel and locations, and the reuse of shared infrastructure such as phone numbers and addresses. Traditional approaches, including community tips and regulatory inspections, are largely reactive and ineffective at revealing the broader operational networks traffickers rely on. To address these challenges, we introduce IMBWatch, a spatio-temporal graph neural network (ST-GNN) framework for large-scale IMB detection. IMBWatch constructs dynamic graphs from open-source intelligence, including scraped online advertisements, business license records, and crowdsourced reviews. Nodes represent heterogeneous entities such as businesses, aliases, phone numbers, and locations, while edges capture spatio-temporal and relational patterns, including co-location, repeated phone usage, and synchronized advertising. The framework combines graph convolutional operations with temporal attention mechanisms to model the evolution of IMB networks over time and space, capturing patterns such as intercity worker movement, burner phone rotation, and coordinated advertising surges. Experiments on real-world datasets from multiple U.S. cities show that IMBWatch outperforms baseline models, achieving higher accuracy and F1 scores. Beyond performance gains, IMBWatch offers improved interpretability, providing actionable insights to support proactive and targeted interventions. The framework is scalable, adaptable to other illicit domains, and released with anonymized data and open-source code to support reproducible research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to AAAI AISI 2026</p></details> |

The advection model with a single constant velocity is interpretable but physically limited by its perfect correlation over time. This work aims to bridge the gap between this simple framework and its physically realistic extensions. Our guiding principle is to introduce a spatial correlation structure that vanishes over time. To achieve this, we present two distinct approaches. The first constructs complex velocity structures, either through superpositions of advection components or by allowing the velocity to vary locally. The second is a spectral technique that replaces the singular spectrum of rigid advection with a more flexible form, introducing temporal decorrelation controlled by parameters. We accompany these models with efficient simulation algorithms and demonstrate their success in replicating complex dynamics, such as tropical cyclones and the solutions of partial differential equations. Finally, we illustrate the practical utility of the proposed framework by comparing its simulations to real-world precipitation data from Hurricane Florence.</p></details> |  |

Although advanced Spatio-temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) and pre-trained models have achieved significant progress in traffic prediction, two key challenges remain: (i) limited contextual capacity when modeling complex spatio-temporal dependencies, and (ii) low predictability at fine-grained spatio-temporal points due to heterogeneous patterns. Inspired by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), we propose RAST, a universal framework that integrates retrieval-augmented mechanisms with spatio-temporal modeling to address these challenges. Our framework consists of three key designs: 1) Decoupled Encoder and Query Generator to capture decoupled spatial and temporal features and construct a fusion query via residual fusion; 2) Spatio-temporal Retrieval Store and Retrievers to maintain and retrieve vectorized fine-grained patterns; and 3) Universal Backbone Predictor that flexibly accommodates pre-trained STGNNs or simple MLP predictors. Extensive experiments on six real-world traffic networks, including large-scale datasets, demonstrate that RAST achieves superior performance while maintaining computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026 (AI for Social Impact)</p></details> |

Integrating data from satellite products and ground monitors are increasingly used to produce exposure surfaces. However, spatio-temporal misalignment often induced from missing data introduces substantial uncertainty and reduces predictive accuracy. We propose a Bayesian weighted predictor regression framework that models spatio-temporal relationships when predictors are observed on irregular supports or have substantial missing data, and are not concurrent with the outcome. The key feature of our model is a spatio-temporal kernel that aggregates the predictor over local space-time neighborhoods, built directly into the likelihood, eliminating any separate gap-filling or forced data alignment stage. We introduce a numerical approximation using a Voronoi-based spatial quadrature combined with irregular temporal increments for estimation under data missingness and misalignment. We showed that misspecification of the spatial and temporal lags induced bias in the mean and parameter estimates, indicating the need for principled parameter selection. Simulation studies confirmed these findings, where careful tuning was critical to control bias and achieve accurate prediction, while the proposed quadrature performed well under severe missingness. As an illustrative application, we estimated fine particulate matter (PM$_{2.5}$) in northern California using satellite-derived aerosol optical depth (AOD) and wildfire smoke plume indicators. Relative to a traditional collocated linear model, our approach improved out-of-sample predictive performance, reduced uncertainty, and yielded robust temporal predictions and spatial surface estimation. Our framework is extensible to additional spatio-temporally varying covariates and other kernel families.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 6 figures, Updated results section</p></details> |
| **[Rethinking the Spatio-Temporal Alignment of End-to-End 3D Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23635v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal alignment is crucial for temporal modeling of end-to-end (E2E) perception in autonomous driving (AD), providing valuable structural and textural prior information. Existing methods typically rely on the attention mechanism to align objects across frames, simplifying the motion model with a unified explicit physical model (constant velocity, etc.). These approaches prefer semantic features for implicit alignment, challenging the importance of explicit motion modeling in the traditional perception paradigm. However, variations in motion states and object features across categories and frames render this alignment suboptimal. To address this, we propose HAT, a spatio-temporal alignment module that allows each object to adaptively decode the optimal alignment proposal from multiple hypotheses without direct supervision. Specifically, HAT first utilizes multiple explicit motion models to generate spatial anchors and motion-aware feature proposals for historical instances. It then performs multi-hypothesis decoding by incorporating semantic and motion cues embedded in cached object queries, ultimately providing the optimal alignment proposal for the target frame. On nuScenes, HAT consistently improves 3D temporal detectors and trackers across diverse baselines. It achieves state-of-the-art tracking results with 46.0% AMOTA on the test set when paired with the DETR3D detector. In an object-centric E2E AD method, HAT enhances perception accuracy (+1.3% mAP, +3.1% AMOTA) and reduces the collision rate by 32%. When semantics are corrupted (nuScenes-C), the enhancement of motion modeling by HAT enables more robust perception and planning in the E2E AD.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[Long-Term Spatio-Temporal Forecasting of Monthly Rainfall in West Bengal Using Ensemble Learning Approaches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13927v2)** | 2025-12-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rainfall forecasting plays a critical role in climate adaptation, agriculture, and water resource management. This study develops long-term forecasts of monthly rainfall across 19 districts of West Bengal using a century-scale dataset spanning 1900-2019. Daily rainfall records are aggregated into monthly series, resulting in 120 years of observations for each district. The forecasting task involves predicting the next 108 months (9 years, 2011-2019) while accounting for temporal dependencies and spatial interactions among districts. To address the nonlinear and complex structure of rainfall dynamics, we propose a hierarchical modeling framework that combines regression-based forecasting of yearly features with multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) for monthly prediction. Yearly features, such as annual totals, quarterly proportions, variability measures, skewness, and extremes, are first forecasted using regression models that incorporate both own lags and neighboring-district lags. These forecasts are then integrated as auxiliary inputs into an MLP model, which captures nonlinear temporal patterns and spatial dependencies in the monthly series. The results demonstrate that the hierarchical regression-MLP architecture provides robust long-term spatio-temporal forecasts, offering valuable insights for agriculture, irrigation planning, and water conservation strategies.</p></details> | 25 pages, 22 figures |

Hence, they are critical components of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous vehicles. While many existing systems depend on multiple sensors such as LiDAR, radar, and GPS, relying solely on dash-cam videos presents a more challenging, yet more cost-effective and easily deployable solution. In this work, we incorporate improved spatio-temporal features and aggregate them through a recurrent network to enhance state-of-the-art graph neural networks for predicting accidents from dash-cam videos. Experiments using three publicly available datasets (DAD, DoTA and DADA) show that our proposed STAGNet model achieves higher average precision and mean time-to-accident scores than previous methods, both when cross-validated on a given dataset and when trained and tested on different datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE Access</p></details> |
| **[AnchorGK: Anchor-based Incremental and Stratified Graph Learning Framework for Inductive Spatio-Temporal Kriging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21569v1)** | 2025-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal kriging is a fundamental problem in sensor networks, driven by the sparsity of deployed sensors and the resulting missing observations. Although recent approaches model spatial and temporal correlations, they often under-exploit two practical characteristics of real deployments: the sparse spatial distribution of locations and the heterogeneous availability of auxiliary features across locations. To address these challenges, we propose AnchorGK, an Anchor-based Incremental and Stratified Graph Learning framework for inductive spatio-temporal kriging. AnchorGK introduces anchor locations to stratify the data in a principled manner. Anchors are constructed according to feature availability, and strata are then formed around these anchors. This stratification serves two complementary roles. First, it explicitly represents and continuously updates correlations between unobserved regions and surrounding observed locations within a graph learning framework. Second, it enables the systematic use of all available features across strata via an incremental representation mechanism, mitigating feature incompleteness without discarding informative signals. Building on the stratified structure, we design a dual-view graph learning layer that jointly aggregates feature-relevant and location-relevant information, learning stratum-specific representations that support accurate inference under inductive settings. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that AnchorGK consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines for spatio-temporal kriging.</p></details> |  |

We introduce DynAttn, an interpretable dynamic-attention forecasting framework for high-dimensional spatio-temporal count processes. DynAttn combines rolling-window estimation, shared elastic-net feature gating, a compact weight-tied self-attention encoder, and a zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) likelihood. This architecture produces calibrated multi-horizon forecasts of expected casualties and exceedance probabilities, while retaining transparent diagnostics through feature gates, ablation analysis, and elasticity measures. We evaluate DynAttn using global country-level and high-resolution PRIO-grid-level conflict data from the VIEWS forecasting system, benchmarking it against established statistical and machine-learning approaches, including DynENet, LSTM, Prophet, PatchTST, and the official VIEWS baseline. Across forecast horizons from one to twelve months, DynAttn consistently achieves substantially higher predictive accuracy, with particularly large gains in sparse grid-level settings where competing models often become unstable or degrade sharply. Beyond predictive performance, DynAttn enables structured interpretation of regional conflict dynamics. In our application, cross-regional analyses show that short-run conflict persistence and spatial diffusion form the core predictive backbone, while climate stress acts either as a conditional amplifier or a primary driver depending on the conflict theater.</p></details> |  |

Despite the advances in this field, the complex and stochastic nature of this task still poses challenges to existing approaches. Specifically, deterministic models tend to produce blurry predictions while generative models often struggle with poor accuracy. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective model architecture termed STLDM, a diffusion-based model that learns the latent representation from end to end alongside both the Variational Autoencoder and the conditioning network. STLDM decomposes this task into two stages: a deterministic forecasting stage handled by the conditioning network, and an enhancement stage performed by the latent diffusion model. Experimental results on multiple radar datasets demonstrate that STLDM achieves superior performance compared to the state of the art, while also improving inference efficiency.

We explore exocentric video with ambient sensors as a non-intrusive, scalable alternative. While prior egocentric-wearable works predominantly adopt Global Alignment by encoding entire sequences into unified representations, this approach fails in exocentric-ambient settings due to two problems: (P1) inability to capture local details such as subtle motions, and (P2) over-reliance on modality-invariant temporal patterns, causing misalignment between actions sharing similar temporal patterns with different spatio-semantic contexts. To resolve these problems, we propose DETACH, a decomposed spatio-temporal framework. This explicit decomposition preserves local details, while our novel sensor-spatial features discovered via online clustering provide semantic grounding for context-aware alignment. To align the decomposed features, our two-stage approach establishes spatial correspondence through mutual supervision, then performs temporal alignment via a spatial-temporal weighted contrastive loss that adaptively handles easy negatives, hard negatives, and false negatives. Comprehensive experiments with downstream tasks on Opportunity++ and HWU-USP datasets demonstrate substantial improvements over adapted egocentric-wearable baselines.</p></details> |  |

Although many existing methods utilize multi-head attention mechanisms and message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) to capture both spatial and temporal relations, these approaches encode temporal and spatial relations independently, and reflect the graph's topological characteristics in a limited manner. In this work, we introduce the Cycle to Mixer (Cy2Mixer), a novel spatio-temporal GNN based on topological non-trivial invariants of spatio-temporal graphs with gated multi-layer perceptrons (gMLP). The Cy2Mixer is composed of three blocks based on MLPs: A temporal block for capturing temporal properties, a message-passing block for encapsulating spatial information, and a cycle message-passing block for enriching topological information through cyclic subgraphs. We bolster the effectiveness of Cy2Mixer with mathematical evidence emphasizing that our cycle message-passing block is capable of offering differentiated information to the deep learning model compared to the message-passing block. Furthermore, empirical evaluations substantiate the efficacy of the Cy2Mixer, demonstrating state-of-the-art performances across various spatio-temporal benchmark datasets.

In contrast, many real-world systems including maritime traffic lack such fixed anchors, making the construction of spatio-temporal graphs a fundamental challenge. Anomaly detection in these non-grid environments is particularly difficult due to the absence of canonical reference points, the sparsity and irregularity of trajectories, and the fact that anomalies may manifest at multiple granularities. In this work, we introduce a novel benchmark dataset for anomaly detection in the maritime domain, extending the Open Maritime Traffic Analysis Dataset (OMTAD) into a benchmark tailored for graph-based anomaly detection. Our dataset enables systematic evaluation across three different granularities: node-level, edge-level, and graph-level anomalies. We plan to employ two specialized LLM-based agents: \emph{Trajectory Synthesizer} and \emph{Anomaly Injector} to construct richer interaction contexts and generate semantically meaningful anomalies. We expect this benchmark to promote reproducibility and to foster methodological advances in anomaly detection for non-grid spatio-temporal systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025 Workshop in AI for Science: The Reach and Limits of AI for Scientific Discovery</p></details> |

However, current thermal infrared satellite sensors cannot simultaneously achieve high spatial and temporal resolution. Spatio-temporal fusion (STF) techniques address this limitation by combining complementary satellite data, one with high spatial but low temporal resolution, and another with high temporal but low spatial resolution. Existing STF techniques, from classical models to modern deep learning (DL) architectures, were primarily developed for surface reflectance (SR). Their application to thermal data remains limited and often overlooks LST-specific spatial and temporal variability. This study provides a focused review of DL-based STF methods for LST. We present a formal mathematical definition of the thermal fusion task, propose a refined taxonomy of relevant DL methods, and analyze the modifications required when adapting SR-oriented models to LST. To support reproducibility and benchmarking, we introduce a new dataset comprising 51 Terra MODIS-Landsat LST pairs from 2013 to 2024, and evaluate representative models to explore their behavior on thermal data. The analysis highlights performance gaps, architecture sensitivities, and open research challenges. The dataset and accompanying resources are publicly available at https://github.com/Sofianebouaziz1/STF-LST.</p></details> |  |
| **[DK-STN: A Domain Knowledge Embedded Spatio-Temporal Network Model for MJO Forecast](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19506v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding and predicting the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) is fundamental for precipitation forecasting and disaster prevention. To date, long-term and accurate MJO prediction has remained a challenge for researchers. Conventional MJO prediction methods using Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) are resource-intensive, time-consuming, and highly unstable (most NWP methods are sensitive to seasons, with better MJO forecast results in winter). While existing Artificial Neural Network (ANN) methods save resources and speed forecasting, their accuracy never reaches the 28 days predicted by the state-of-the-art NWP method, i.e., the operational forecasts from ECMWF, since neural networks cannot handle climate data effectively. In this paper, we present a Domain Knowledge Embedded Spatio-Temporal Network (DK-STN), a stable neural network model for accurate and efficient MJO forecasting. It combines the benefits of NWP and ANN methods and successfully improves the forecast accuracy of ANN methods while maintaining a high level of efficiency and stability. We begin with a spatial-temporal network (STN) and embed domain knowledge in it using two key methods: (i) applying a domain knowledge enhancement method and (ii) integrating a domain knowledge processing method into network training. We evaluated DK-STN with the 5th generation of ECMWF reanalysis (ERA5) data and compared it with ECMWF. Given 7 days of climate data as input, DK-STN can generate reliable forecasts for the following 28 days in 1-2 seconds, with an error of only 2-3 days in different seasons. DK-STN significantly exceeds ECMWF in that its forecast accuracy is equivalent to ECMWF's, while its efficiency and stability are significantly superior.</p></details> | 18 pages, 10 figures |

Automatic and precise detection of behaviorally relevant neuron activity from the recordings is critical to study the mapping of brain activity in organisms. However a perpetual bottleneck to this problem is the manual segmentation which is time and labor intensive and lacks generalizability. To this end, we present a Bayesian Deep Learning Framework to detect neuronal activities in 4D spatio-temporal data obtained by light sheet microscopy. Our approach accounts for the use of temporal information by calculating pixel wise correlation maps and combines it with spatial information given by the mean summary image. The Bayesian framework not only produces probability segmentation maps but also models the uncertainty pertaining to active neuron detection. To evaluate the accuracy of our framework we implemented the test of reproducibility to assert the generalization of the network to detect neuron activity. The network achieved a mean Dice Score of 0.81 relative to the synthetic Ground Truth obtained by Otsu's method and a mean Dice Score of 0.79 between the first and second run for test of reproducibility. Our method successfully deployed can be used for rapid detection of active neuronal activities for behavioural studies.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods often overlook the multi-granularity nature of actions. To address this limitation, we introduce the Context-Aware Network (CAN). CAN consists of two core modules: the Multi-scale Temporal Cue Module (MTCM) and the Group Spatial Cue Module (GSCM). MTCM effectively extracts temporal cues at multiple scales, capturing both fast-changing motion details and overall action flow. GSCM, on the other hand, extracts spatial cues at different scales by grouping feature maps and applying specialized extraction methods to each group. Experiments conducted on five benchmark datasets (Something-Something V1 and V2, Diving48, Kinetics-400, and UCF101) demonstrate the effectiveness of CAN. Our approach achieves competitive performance, outperforming most mainstream methods, with accuracies of 50.4% on Something-Something V1, 63.9% on Something-Something V2, 88.4% on Diving48, 74.9% on Kinetics-400, and 86.9% on UCF101. These results highlight the importance of capturing multi-scale spatio-temporal cues for robust action recognition.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 4 figures.

A critical component of disease behavior is the velocity with which disease spreads, defined as the rate of change between time and space. In this paper, we propose a spatio-temporal modeling approach to determine the velocities of infectious disease spread. Our approach assumes that the locations and times of people infected can be considered as a spatio-temporal point pattern that arises as a realization of a spatio-temporal log-Gaussian Cox process. The intensity of this process is estimated using fast Bayesian inference by employing the integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) and the Stochastic Partial Differential Equations (SPDE) approaches. The velocity is then calculated using finite differences that approximate the derivatives of the intensity function. Finally, the directions and magnitudes of the velocities can be mapped at specific times to examine better the spread of the disease throughout the region. We demonstrate our method by analyzing COVID-19 spread in Cali, Colombia, during the 2020-2021 pandemic.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 46 figures, Journal American Statistican, submitted on 3rd of September</p></details> |
| **[A Distributed Hierarchical Spatio-Temporal Edge-Enhanced Graph Neural Network for City-Scale Dynamic Logistics Routing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18441v1)** | 2025-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>City-scale logistics routing has become increasingly challenging as metropolitan road networks grow to tens of millions of edges and traffic conditions evolve rapidly under high-volume mobility demands. Conventional centralized routing algorithms and monolithic graph neural network (GNN) models suffer from limited scalability, high latency, and poor real-time adaptability, which restricts their effectiveness in large urban logistics systems. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Distributed Hierarchical Spatio-Temporal Edge-Enhanced Graph Neural Network (HSTE-GNN) for dynamic routing over ultra-large road networks. The framework partitions the city-scale graph into regional subgraphs processed in parallel across distributed computing nodes, enabling efficient learning of localized traffic dynamics. Within each region, an edge-enhanced spatio-temporal module jointly models node states, dynamic edge attributes, and short-term temporal dependencies. A hierarchical coordination layer further aggregates cross-region representations through an asynchronous parameter-server mechanism, ensuring global routing coherence under high-frequency traffic updates. This distributed hierarchical design balances local responsiveness with global consistency, significantly improving scalability and inference efficiency. Experiments on real-world large-scale traffic datasets from Beijing and New York demonstrate that HSTE-GNN outperforms strong spatio-temporal baselines such as ST-GRAPH, achieving 34.9% lower routing delay, 14.7% lower MAPE, and 11.8% lower RMSE, while improving global route consistency by 7.3%. These results confirm that the proposed framework provides a scalable, adaptive, and efficient solution for next-generation intelligent transportation systems and large-scale logistics platforms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatially-informed transformers: Injecting geostatistical covariance biases into self-attention for spatio-temporal forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17696v1)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The modeling of high-dimensional spatio-temporal processes presents a fundamental dichotomy between the probabilistic rigor of classical geostatistics and the flexible, high-capacity representations of deep learning. While Gaussian processes offer theoretical consistency and exact uncertainty quantification, their prohibitive computational scaling renders them impractical for massive sensor networks. Conversely, modern transformer architectures excel at sequence modeling but inherently lack a geometric inductive bias, treating spatial sensors as permutation-invariant tokens without a native understanding of distance. In this work, we propose a spatially-informed transformer, a hybrid architecture that injects a geostatistical inductive bias directly into the self-attention mechanism via a learnable covariance kernel. By formally decomposing the attention structure into a stationary physical prior and a non-stationary data-driven residual, we impose a soft topological constraint that favors spatially proximal interactions while retaining the capacity to model complex dynamics. We demonstrate the phenomenon of ``Deep Variography'', where the network successfully recovers the true spatial decay parameters of the underlying process end-to-end via backpropagation. Extensive experiments on synthetic Gaussian random fields and real-world traffic benchmarks confirm that our method outperforms state-of-the-art graph neural networks. Furthermore, rigorous statistical validation confirms that the proposed method delivers not only superior predictive accuracy but also well-calibrated probabilistic forecasts, effectively bridging the gap between physics-aware modeling and data-driven learning.</p></details> |  |

However, since models must capture both spatial and temporal relationships, performance is limited by the feature representations within a frame but also between multiple frames. We propose the Spatio-Temporal Gaze Network (ST-Gaze), a model that combines a CNN backbone with dedicated channel attention and self-attention modules to fuse eye and face features optimally. The fused features are then treated as a spatial sequence, allowing for the capture of an intra-frame context, which is then propagated through time to model inter-frame dynamics. We evaluated our method on the EVE dataset and show that ST-Gaze achieves state-of-the-art performance both with and without person-specific adaptation. Additionally, our ablation study provides further insights into the model performance, showing that preserving and modelling intra-frame spatial context with our spatio-temporal recurrence is fundamentally superior to premature spatial pooling. As such, our results pave the way towards more robust video-based gaze estimation using commonly available cameras.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 5 figures, the code repository is available at https://gitlab.kuleuven.be/u0172623/ST-Gaze</p></details> |
| **[Foundation for unbiased cross-validation of spatio-temporal models for species distribution modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03480v2)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating the predictive performance of species distribution models (SDMs) under realistic deployment scenarios requires careful handling of spatial and temporal dependencies in the data. Cross-validation (CV) is the standard approach for model evaluation, but its design strongly influences the validity of performance estimates. When SDMs are intended for spatial or temporal transfer, random CV can lead to overoptimistic results due to spatial autocorrelation (SAC) among neighboring observations. We benchmark four machine learning algorithms (GBM, XGBoost, LightGBM, Random Forest) on two real-world presence-absence datasets, a temperate plant and an anadromous fish, using multiple CV designs: random, spatial, spatio-temporal, environmental, and forward-chaining. Two training data usage strategies (LAST FOLD and RETRAIN) are evaluated, with hyperparameter tuning performed within each CV scheme. Model performance is assessed on independent out-of-time test sets using AUC, MAE, and correlation metrics. Random CV overestimates AUC by up to 0.16 and produces MAE values up to 80 percent higher than spatially blocked alternatives. Blocking at the empirical SAC range substantially reduces this bias. Training strategy affects evaluation outcomes: LAST FOLD yields smaller validation-test discrepancies under strong SAC, while RETRAIN achieves higher test AUC when SAC is weaker. Boosted ensemble models consistently perform best under spatially structured CV designs. We recommend a robust SDM workflow based on SAC-aware blocking, blocked hyperparameter tuning, and external temporal validation to improve reliability under spatial and temporal shifts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted manuscript.

| **[Pattern recognition in complex systems via vector-field representations of spatio-temporal data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16763v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A complex system comprises multiple interacting entities whose interdependencies form a unified whole, exhibiting emergent behaviours not present in individual components. Examples include the human brain, living cells, soft matter, Earth's climate, ecosystems, and the economy. These systems exhibit high-dimensional, non-linear dynamics, making their modelling, classification, and prediction particularly challenging. Advances in information technology have enabled data-driven approaches to studying such systems. However, the sheer volume and complexity of spatio-temporal data often hinder traditional methods like dimensionality reduction, phase-space reconstruction, and attractor characterisation. This paper introduces a geometric framework for analysing spatio-temporal data from complex systems, grounded in the theory of vector fields over discrete measure spaces. We propose a two-parameter family of metrics suitable for data analysis and machine learning applications. The framework supports time-dependent images, image gradients, and real- or vector-valued functions defined on graphs and simplicial complexes. We validate our approach using data from numerical simulations of biological and physical systems on flat and curved domains. Our results show that the proposed metrics, combined with multidimensional scaling, effectively address key analytical challenges. They enable dimensionality reduction, mode decomposition, phase-space reconstruction, and attractor characterisation. Our findings offer a robust pathway for understanding complex dynamical systems, especially in contexts where traditional modelling is impractical but abundant experimental data are available.</p></details> | 24 pages, 10 figures |
| **[A Survey on Spatio-Temporal Knowledge Graph Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16487v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many complex real-world systems exhibit inherently intertwined temporal and spatial characteristics. Spatio-temporal knowledge graphs (STKGs) have therefore emerged as a powerful representation paradigm, as they integrate entities, relationships, time and space within a unified graph structure. They are increasingly applied across diverse domains, including environmental systems and urban, transportation, social and human mobility networks. However, modeling STKGs remains challenging: their foundations span classical graph theory as well as temporal and spatial graph models, which have evolved independently across different research communities and follow heterogeneous modeling assumptions and terminologies. As a result, existing approaches often lack conceptual alignment, generalizability and reusability. This survey provides a systematic review of spatio-temporal knowledge graph models, tracing their origins in static, temporal and spatial graph modeling. We analyze existing approaches along key modeling dimensions, including edge semantics, temporal and spatial annotation strategies, temporal and spatial semantics and relate these choices to their respective application domains. Our analysis reveals that unified modeling frameworks are largely absent and that most current models are tailored to specific use cases rather than designed for reuse or long-term knowledge preservation. Based on these findings, we derive modeling guidelines and identify open challenges to guide future research.</p></details> |  |

While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) provide open-world semantic priors, they lack grounding in 3D geometry and temporal dynamics. Conversely, geometric perception captures structure and motion but remains semantically sparse. We propose SNOW (Scene Understanding with Open-World Knowledge), a training-free and backbone-agnostic framework for unified 4D scene understanding that integrates VLM-derived semantics with point cloud geometry and temporal consistency. SNOW processes synchronized RGB images and 3D point clouds, using HDBSCAN clustering to generate object-level proposals that guide SAM2-based segmentation. Each segmented region is encoded through our proposed Spatio-Temporal Tokenized Patch Encoding (STEP), producing multimodal tokens that capture localized semantic, geometric, and temporal attributes. These tokens are incrementally integrated into a 4D Scene Graph (4DSG), which serves as 4D prior for downstream reasoning. A lightweight SLAM backend anchors all STEP tokens spatially in the environment, providing the global reference alignment, and ensuring unambiguous spatial grounding across time. The resulting 4DSG forms a queryable, unified world model through which VLMs can directly interpret spatial scene structure and temporal dynamics. Experiments on a diverse set of benchmarks demonstrate that SNOW enables precise 4D scene understanding and spatially grounded inference, thereby setting new state-of-the-art performance in several settings, highlighting the importance of structured 4D priors for embodied reasoning and autonomous robotics.</p></details> |  |

This allows for modeling non-linearities and interactions among predictor variables in a flexible data-driven manner and for accounting for spatio-temporal variation that is not explained by observable predictor variables. We also show how estimation and prediction can be done in a computationally efficient manner. In an application to a large U.S. mortgage credit risk data set, we find that both predictive default probabilities for individual loans and predictive loan portfolio loss distributions obtained with our novel approach are more accurate compared to conventional independent linear hazard models and also linear spatio-temporal models. Using interpretability tools for machine learning models, we find that the likely reasons for this outperformance are strong interaction and non-linear effects in the predictor variables and the presence of spatio-temporal frailty effects.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by this capability, we introduce R4, a training-free framework for retrieval-augmented reasoning in 4D spatio-temporal space that equips vision-language models (VLMs) with structured, lifelong memory. R4 continuously constructs a 4D knowledge database by anchoring object-level semantic descriptions in metric space and time, yielding a persistent world model that can be shared across agents. At inference, natural language queries are decomposed into semantic, spatial, and temporal keys to retrieve relevant observations, which are integrated into the VLM's reasoning. Unlike classical retrieval-augmented generation methods, retrieval in R4 operates directly in 4D space, enabling episodic and collaborative reasoning without training. Experiments on embodied question answering and navigation benchmarks demonstrate that R4 substantially improves retrieval and reasoning over spatio-temporal information compared to baselines, advancing a new paradigm for embodied 4D reasoning in dynamic environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[OccSTeP: Benchmarking 4D Occupancy Spatio-Temporal Persistence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15621v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous driving requires a persistent understanding of 3D scenes that is robust to temporal disturbances and accounts for potential future actions. We introduce a new concept of 4D Occupancy Spatio-Temporal Persistence (OccSTeP), which aims to address two tasks: (1) reactive forecasting: ''what will happen next'' and (2) proactive forecasting: "what would happen given a specific future action". For the first time, we create a new OccSTeP benchmark with challenging scenarios (e.g., erroneous semantic labels and dropped frames). To address this task, we propose OccSTeP-WM, a tokenizer-free world model that maintains a dense voxel-based scene state and incrementally fuses spatio-temporal context over time. OccSTeP-WM leverages a linear-complexity attention backbone and a recurrent state-space module to capture long-range spatial dependencies while continually updating the scene memory with ego-motion compensation. This design enables online inference and robust performance even when historical sensor input is missing or noisy. Extensive experiments prove the effectiveness of the OccSTeP concept and our OccSTeP-WM, yielding an average semantic mIoU of 23.70% (+6.56% gain) and occupancy IoU of 35.89% (+9.26% gain). The data and code will be open source at https://github.com/FaterYU/OccSTeP.</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Rigid-Deformation Decomposition AI Framework for 3D Spatio-Temporal Prediction of Vehicle Collision Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19712v2)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study presents a rigid-deformation decomposition framework for vehicle collision dynamics that mitigates the spectral bias of implicit neural representations, that is, coordinate-based neural networks that directly map spatio-temporal coordinates to physical fields. We introduce a hierarchical architecture that decouples global rigid-body motion from local deformation using two scale-specific networks, denoted as RigidNet and DeformationNet. To enforce kinematic separation between the two components, we adopt a frozen-anchor training strategy combined with a quaternion-incremental scheme. This strategy alleviates the kinematic instability observed in joint training and yields a 29.8% reduction in rigid-body motion error compared with conventional direct prediction schemes. The stable rigid-body anchor improves the resolution of high-frequency structural buckling, which leads to a 17.2% reduction in the total interpolation error. Loss landscape analysis indicates that the decomposition smooths the optimization surface, which enhances robustness to distribution shifts in angular extrapolation and yields a 46.6% reduction in error. To assess physical validity beyond numerical accuracy, we benchmark the decomposed components against an oracle model that represents an upper bound on performance. The proposed framework recovers 92% of the directional correlation between rigid and deformation components and 96% of the spatial deformation localization accuracy relative to the oracle, while tracking the temporal energy dynamics with an 8 ms delay. These results demonstrate that rigid-deformation decomposition enables accurate and physically interpretable predictions for nonlinear collision dynamics.</p></details> | 38 pages, 24 figures |
| **[Question Answering Over Spatio-Temporal Knowledge Graph](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11542v2)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal knowledge graphs (STKGs) enhance traditional KGs by integrating temporal and spatial annotations, enabling precise reasoning over questions with spatio-temporal dependencies. Despite their potential, research on spatio-temporal knowledge graph question answering (STKGQA) remains limited. This is primarily due to the lack of datasets that simultaneously contain spatio-temporal information, as well as methods capable of handling implicit spatio-temporal reasoning. To bridge this gap, we introduce the spatio-temporal question answering dataset (STQAD), the first comprehensive benchmark comprising 10,000 natural language questions that require both temporal and spatial reasoning. STQAD is constructed with real-world facts containing spatio-temporal information, ensuring that the dataset reflects practical scenarios. Furthermore, our experiments reveal that existing KGQA methods underperform on STQAD, primarily due to their inability to model spatio-temporal interactions. To address this, we propose the spatio-temporal complex question answering (STCQA) method, which jointly embeds temporal and spatial features into KG representations and dynamically filters answers through constraint-aware reasoning. STCQA achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing baselines. Our work not only provides a valuable resource for future research but also advances the field by offering a robust baseline for answering complex spatio-temporal questions.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 10 figures.

| **[NL2SpaTiaL: Generating Geometric Spatio-Temporal Logic Specifications from Natural Language for Manipulation Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13670v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-Temporal Logic (SpaTiaL) offers a principled formalism for expressing geometric spatial requirements-an essential component of robotic manipulation, where object locations, neighborhood relations, pose constraints, and interactions directly determine task success. Yet prior works have largely relied on standard temporal logic (TL), which models only robot trajectories and overlooks object-level interactions. Existing datasets built from randomly generated TL formulas paired with natural-language descriptions therefore cover temporal operators but fail to represent the layered spatial relations that manipulation tasks depend on. To address this gap, we introduce a dataset generation framework that synthesizes SpaTiaL specifications and converts them into natural-language descriptions through a deterministic, semantics-preserving back-translation procedure. This pipeline produces the NL2SpaTiaL dataset, aligning natural language with multi-level spatial relations and temporal objectives to reflect the compositional structure of manipulation tasks. Building on this foundation, we propose a translation-verification framework equipped with a language-based semantic checker that ensures the generated SpaTiaL formulas faithfully encode the semantics specified by the input description. Experiments across a suite of manipulation tasks show that SpaTiaL-based representations yield more interpretable, verifiable, and compositional grounding for instruction following.

| **[STARCaster: Spatio-Temporal AutoRegressive Video Diffusion for Identity- and View-Aware Talking Portraits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13247v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents STARCaster, an identity-aware spatio-temporal video diffusion model that addresses both speech-driven portrait animation and free-viewpoint talking portrait synthesis, given an identity embedding or reference image, within a unified framework. Existing 2D speech-to-video diffusion models depend heavily on reference guidance, leading to limited motion diversity. At the same time, 3D-aware animation typically relies on inversion through pre-trained tri-plane generators, which often leads to imperfect reconstructions and identity drift. We rethink reference- and geometry-based paradigms in two ways. First, we deviate from strict reference conditioning at pre-training by introducing softer identity constraints. Second, we address 3D awareness implicitly within the 2D video domain by leveraging the inherent multi-view nature of video data. STARCaster adopts a compositional approach progressing from ID-aware motion modeling, to audio-visual synchronization via lip reading-based supervision, and finally to novel view animation through temporal-to-spatial adaptation. To overcome the scarcity of 4D audio-visual data, we propose a decoupled learning approach in which view consistency and temporal coherence are trained independently. A self-forcing training scheme enables the model to learn from longer temporal contexts than those generated at inference, mitigating the overly static animations common in existing autoregressive approaches. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that STARCaster generalizes effectively across tasks and identities, consistently surpassing prior approaches in different benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://foivospar.github.io/STARCaster/</p></details> |

While forecasting models generally disregard unmonitored roads by design, spatial imputation methods explicitly address network-wide estimation; yet this approach relies on volume data at inference time, limiting its applicability in sensor-scarce cities. Unlike traffic volume data, probe vehicle speeds and static road attributes are more broadly accessible and support full coverage of road segments in most urban networks. In this work, we present the Hybrid Directed-Attention Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network (HDA-STGNN), an inductive deep learning framework designed to tackle the network-wide volume estimation problem. Our approach leverages speed profiles, static road attributes, and road network topology to predict daily traffic volume profiles across all road segments in the network. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we perform extensive ablation studies that demonstrate the model's capacity to capture complex spatio-temporal dependencies and highlight the value of topological information for accurate network-wide traffic volume estimation without relying on volume data at inference time.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Spatio-Temporal Hybrid Quantum-Classical Graph Convolutional Neural Network Approach for Urban Taxi Destination Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13745v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a Hybrid Spatio-Temporal Quantum Graph Convolutional Network (H-STQGCN) algorithm by combining the strengths of quantum computing and classical deep learning to predict the taxi destination within urban road networks. Our algorithm consists of two branches: spatial processing and time evolution. Regarding the spatial processing, the classical module encodes the local topological features of the road network based on the GCN method, and the quantum module is designed to map graph features onto parameterized quantum circuits through a differentiable pooling layer. The time evolution is solved by integrating multi-source contextual information and capturing dynamic trip dependencies on the classical TCN theory. Finally, our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the current methods in terms of prediction accuracy and stability, validating the unique advantages of the quantum-enhanced mechanism in capturing high-dimensional spatial dependencies.</p></details> |  |
| **[L-STEC: Learned Video Compression with Long-term Spatio-Temporal Enhanced Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12790v1)** | 2025-12-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Video Compression has emerged in recent years, with condition-based frameworks outperforming traditional codecs. However, most existing methods rely solely on the previous frame's features to predict temporal context, leading to two critical issues. First, the short reference window misses long-term dependencies and fine texture details. Second, propagating only feature-level information accumulates errors over frames, causing prediction inaccuracies and loss of subtle textures. To address these, we propose the Long-term Spatio-Temporal Enhanced Context (L-STEC) method. We first extend the reference chain with LSTM to capture long-term dependencies. We then incorporate warped spatial context from the pixel domain, fusing spatio-temporal information through a multi-receptive field network to better preserve reference details. Experimental results show that L-STEC significantly improves compression by enriching contextual information, achieving 37.01% bitrate savings in PSNR and 31.65% in MS-SSIM compared to DCVC-TCM, outperforming both VTM-17.0 and DCVC-FM and establishing new state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Data Compression Conference (DCC) 2026 as an oral paper</p></details> |

Adaptive delayed matching creates a trade-off between matching and pickup delays by deciding whether to assign drivers immediately or batch requests. Since outcomes accumulate over long horizons with stochastic dynamics, reinforcement learning (RL) is a suitable framework. However, existing approaches often oversimplify traffic dynamics or use shallow encoders that miss complex spatiotemporal patterns. We introduce the Regime-Aware Spatio-Temporal Mixture-of-Experts (RAST-MoE), which formalizes adaptive delayed matching as a regime-aware MDP equipped with a self-attention MoE encoder. Unlike monolithic networks, our experts specialize automatically, improving representation capacity while maintaining computational efficiency. A physics-informed congestion surrogate preserves realistic density-speed feedback, enabling millions of efficient rollouts, while an adaptive reward scheme guards against pathological strategies. With only 12M parameters, our framework outperforms strong baselines. On real-world Uber trajectory data (San Francisco), it improves total reward by over 13%, reducing average matching and pickup delays by 10% and 15% respectively. It demonstrates robustness across unseen demand regimes and stable training. These findings highlight the potential of MoE-enhanced RL for large-scale decision-making with complex spatiotemporal dynamics.</p></details> |  |
| **[WGAST: Weakly-Supervised Generative Network for Daily 10 m Land Surface Temperature Estimation via Spatio-Temporal Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06485v2)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urbanization, climate change, and agricultural stress are increasing the demand for precise and timely environmental monitoring. Land Surface Temperature (LST) is a key variable in this context and is retrieved from remote sensing satellites. However, these systems face a trade-off between spatial and temporal resolution. While spatio-temporal fusion methods offer promising solutions, few have addressed the estimation of daily LST at 10 m resolution. In this study, we present WGAST, a weakly-supervised generative network for daily 10 m LST estimation via spatio-temporal fusion of Terra MODIS, Landsat 8, and Sentinel-2. WGAST is the first end-to-end deep learning framework designed for this task. It adopts a conditional generative adversarial architecture, with a generator composed of four stages: feature extraction, fusion, LST reconstruction, and noise suppression. The first stage employs a set of encoders to extract multi-level latent representations from the inputs, which are then fused in the second stage using cosine similarity, normalization, and temporal attention mechanisms. The third stage decodes the fused features into high-resolution LST, followed by a Gaussian filter to suppress high-frequency noise. Training follows a weakly supervised strategy based on physical averaging principles and reinforced by a PatchGAN discriminator. Experiments demonstrate that WGAST outperforms existing methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Compared to the best-performing baseline, on average, WGAST reduces RMSE by 17.05% and improves SSIM by 4.22%. Furthermore, WGAST effectively captures fine-scale thermal patterns, as validated against near-surface air temperature measurements from 33 near-ground sensors.

In this article, we introduce the R software package deepspat, which allows for modeling, fitting and prediction with nonstationary spatial and spatio-temporal models applied to Gaussian and extremes data. The nonstationary models in our package are constructed using a deep multi-layered deformation of the original spatial or spatio-temporal domain, and are straightforward to implement. Model parameters are estimated using gradient-based optimization of customized loss functions with tensorflow, which implements automatic differentiation. The functionalities of the package are illustrated through simulation studies and an application to Nepal temperature data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Know-Show: Benchmarking Video-Language Models on Spatio-Temporal Grounded Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05513v2)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Video-Language Models (Video-LMs) have achieved impressive progress in multimodal understanding, yet their reasoning remains weakly grounded in space and time. We present Know-Show, a new benchmark designed to evaluate spatio-temporal grounded reasoning, the ability of a model to reason about actions and their semantics while simultaneously grounding its inferences in visual and temporal evidence. Know-Show unifies reasoning and localization within a single evaluation framework consisting of five complementary scenarios across spatial (person, object, person-object, and hand-object) and temporal dimensions. Built from Charades, Action Genome, and Ego4D with 2.5K human-authored questions, the benchmark exposes significant gaps between current Video-LMs and human reasoning. To bridge this gap, we propose GRAM, a training-free plug-in that augments Video-LMs with fine-grained grounding through attention-based video token selection and explicit timestamp encoding. Extensive experiments across open and closed Video-LMs (Qwen, VideoLLaVA, GPT-4o, and Gemini, etc.) reveal that existing models struggle to "show what they know" and vice versa, especially in fine-grained hand-object interactions. Know-Show establishes a unified standard for assessing grounded reasoning in video-language understanding and provides insights toward developing interpretable and reliable multimodal reasoning systems. We will release the dataset and the code at https://github.com/LUNAProject22/Know-Show.</p></details> |  |

Despite recent advancements in DETR-style single-stage ST-SGG models, they still suffer from several key limitations. First, while these models rely on attention-based learnable queries as a core component, these learnable queries are semantically uninformed and instance-agnostically initialized. Second, these models rely exclusively on unimodal visual features for predicate classification. To address these challenges, we propose VOST-SGG, a VLM-aided one-stage ST-SGG framework that integrates the common sense reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) into the ST-SGG pipeline. First, we introduce the dual-source query initialization strategy that disentangles what to attend to from where to attend, enabling semantically grounded what-where reasoning. Furthermore, we propose a multi-modal feature bank that fuses visual, textual, and spatial cues derived from VLMs for improved predicate classification. Extensive experiments on the Action Genome dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness of integrating VLM-aided semantic priors and multi-modal features for ST-SGG. We will release the code at https://github.com/LUNAProject22/VOST.</p></details> |  |
| **[1 + 1 > 2: Detector-Empowered Video Large Language Model for Spatio-Temporal Grounding and Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06673v1)** | 2025-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal grounding and reasoning aims to locate the temporal segment and spatial region of an event in a video given a user query, while also reasoning about semantics such as causality, temporal order, and action relationships. To achieve this, current MLLMs primarily treats bounding boxes as text tokens and generates them autoregressively. However, such autoregressive spatial decoding leads to very-long output sequences, causing spatial errors to accumulated over time and the localization results to progressively drift across a video. To address this, we present a Detector-Empowered Video LLM, short for DEViL, which couples a Video LLM with an open-vocabulary detector (OVD). Specifically, the MLLM and detector are connected via a reference-semantic token (RST) that distills the user query into a rich semantic representation. Unlike tokens that merely serve as spatial prompts or segmentor switches, the RST functions as both a control signal and a replacement for the OVD's text embedding, enabling end-to-end learning of both referential understanding and spatial localization. Furthermore, we propose a tube-mined temporal regularization (TTReg) within OVD, which drives the OVD to generate temporally-consistent queries for target objects, thereby ensuring effective temporal association. Experiments demonstrate that DEViL achieves strong performance across various fine-grained video understanding tasks, particularly STVG and GroundedVQA. Code will be released on https://github.com/gaostar123/DeViL.</p></details> |  |

Although deep learning has advanced automated LVEF estimation, many existing approaches are computationally demanding and underutilize the joint structure of spatial and temporal information in echocardiography videos, limiting their suitability for real-time clinical deployment. We propose Echo-E$^3$Net, an efficient endocardial spatio-temporal network specifically designed for LVEF estimation from echocardiography videos. Echo-E$^3$Net comprises two complementary modules: (1) a dual-phase Endocardial Border Detector (E$^2$CBD), which uses phase-specific cross-attention to predict ED/ES endocardial landmarks (EBs) and learn phase-aware landmark embeddings (LEs), and (2) an Endocardial Feature Aggregator (E$^2$FA), which fuses these embeddings with global statistical descriptors (mean, maximum, variance) of deep feature maps to refine EF regression. A multi-component loss function, inspired by Simpson's biplane method, jointly supervises EF, volumes, and landmark geometry, thereby aligning optimization with the clinical definition of LVEF and promoting robust spatio-temporal representation learning. Evaluated on the EchoNet-Dynamic dataset, Echo-E$^3$Net achieves an RMSE of 5.20 and an $R^2$ score of 0.82, while using only 1.54M parameters and 8.05 GFLOPs. The model operates without external pre-training, heavy data augmentation, or test-time ensembling, making it highly suitable for real-time point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) applications.

To jointly model these species, we develop a multi-species Log-Gaussian Cox Process (LGCP) in which species specific intensity surfaces are linked through a shared latent spatial Gaussian field. This structure allows the model to capture broad spatial patterns common to both species while still accommodating species level responses to environmental covariates and seasonal variation. The latent field is represented using the Stochastic Partial Differential Equation (SPDE) approach with an anisotropic Matern covariance, implemented on an ocean constrained triangulated mesh so that spatial dependence aligns with marine geography. Whale group size is incorporated through a marked point process extension with species specific negative binomial marks, allowing occurrence and group sizes to be jointly analyzed within a unified framework. Inference is carried out using the Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA), enabling efficient model fitting over a decade of survey effort. The results highlight persistent multi-species hotspots and distinct environmental associations for each species, demonstrating the value of shared field LGCPs for joint species distribution modeling in data sparse and heterogeneous survey settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modeling Spatio-temporal Extremes via Conditional Variational Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06348v1)** | 2025-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extreme weather events are widely studied in fields such as agriculture, ecology, and meteorology. The spatio-temporal co-occurrence of extreme events can strengthen or weaken under changing climate conditions. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to model spatio-temporal extremes by integrating climate indices via a conditional variational autoencoder (cXVAE). A convolutional neural network (CNN) is embedded in the decoder to convolve climatological indices with the spatial dependence within the latent space, thereby allowing the decoder to be dependent on the climate variables. There are three main contributions here. First, we demonstrate through extensive simulations that the proposed conditional XVAE accurately emulates spatial fields and recovers spatially and temporally varying extremal dependence with very low computational cost post training. Second, we provide a simple, scalable approach to detecting condition-driven shifts and whether the dependence structure is invariant to the conditioning variable. Third, when dependence is found to be condition-sensitive, the conditional XVAE supports counterfactual experiments allowing intervention on the climate covariate and propagating the associated change through the learned decoder to quantify differences in joint tail risk, co-occurrence ranges, and return metrics. To demonstrate the practical utility and performance of the model in real-world scenarios, we apply our method to analyze the monthly maximum Fire Weather Index (FWI) over eastern Australia from 2014 to 2024 conditioned on the El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) index.</p></details> |  |
| **[SOAP: Enhancing Spatio-Temporal Relation and Motion Information Capturing for Few-Shot Action Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16344v5)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High frame-rate (HFR) videos of action recognition improve fine-grained expression while reducing the spatio-temporal relation and motion information density. Thus, large amounts of video samples are continuously required for traditional data-driven training. However, samples are not always sufficient in real-world scenarios, promoting few-shot action recognition (FSAR) research. We observe that most recent FSAR works build spatio-temporal relation of video samples via temporal alignment after spatial feature extraction, cutting apart spatial and temporal features within samples. They also capture motion information via narrow perspectives between adjacent frames without considering density, leading to insufficient motion information capturing. Therefore, we propose a novel plug-and-play architecture for FSAR called Spatio-tempOral frAme tuPle enhancer (SOAP) in this paper. The model we designed with such architecture refers to SOAP-Net. Temporal connections between different feature channels and spatio-temporal relation of features are considered instead of simple feature extraction. Comprehensive motion information is also captured, using frame tuples with multiple frames containing more motion information than adjacent frames. Combining frame tuples of diverse frame counts further provides a broader perspective. SOAP-Net achieves new state-of-the-art performance across well-known benchmarks such as SthSthV2, Kinetics, UCF101, and HMDB51. Extensive empirical evaluations underscore the competitiveness, pluggability, generalization, and robustness of SOAP.

Deploying portable sensors on mobile platforms such as cars and buses offers a low-cost, easy-to-maintain, and wide-coverage data collection solution. However, due to the random and uncontrollable movement patterns of these non-dedicated mobile platforms, the resulting sensor data are often incomplete and temporally inconsistent. By exploring potential training patterns in the reverse process of diffusion models, we propose Spatio-Temporal Physics-Informed Diffusion Models (STeP-Diff). STeP-Diff leverages DeepONet to model the spatial sequence of measurements along with a PDE-informed diffusion model to forecast the spatio-temporal field from incomplete and time-varying data. Through a PDE-constrained regularization framework, the denoising process asymptotically converges to the convection-diffusion dynamics, ensuring that predictions are both grounded in real-world measurements and aligned with the fundamental physics governing pollution dispersion. To assess the performance of the system, we deployed 59 self-designed portable sensing devices in two cities, operating for 14 days to collect air pollution data. Compared to the second-best performing algorithm, our model achieved improvements of up to 89.12% in MAE, 82.30% in RMSE, and 25.00% in MAPE, with extensive evaluations demonstrating that STeP-Diff effectively captures the spatio-temporal dependencies in air pollution fields.</p></details> |  |

We propose a decay-adjusted spatio-temporal (DAST) model that explicitly accounts for the time-varying impact of MDA on NTD prevalence, providing a flexible and interpretable framework for estimating intervention effects from sparse survey data. Using case studies on soil-transmitted helminths and lymphatic filariasis, we show that DAST offers a practical alternative to standard geostatistical models when the objective includes quantifying MDA impact and supporting short-term programmatic forecasting. We also discuss extensions and identifiability challenges, advocating for data-driven parsimony over complexity in settings where the available data are too sparse to support the estimation of highly parameterised models.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[ToG-Bench: Task-Oriented Spatio-Temporal Grounding in Egocentric Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03666v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A core capability towards general embodied intelligence lies in localizing task-relevant objects from an egocentric perspective, formulated as Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding (STVG). Despite recent progress, existing STVG studies remain largely confined to object-centric and descriptive instructions, neglecting the task-oriented reasoning that is crucial for embodied agents to accomplish goal-directed interactions. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{ToG-Bench}, the first task-oriented spatio-temporal video grounding benchmark for egocentric videos. ToG-Bench is characterized by three key features: (1) \textbf{Task-oriented Grounding}, which requires identifying and localizing objects based on intended tasks rather than straightforward descriptions; (2) \textbf{Explicit-Implicit Dual Grounding}, where target objects can be either explicitly mentioned or implicitly inferred by contextual reasoning; (3) \textbf{One-to-Many Grounding}, where a single instruction may correspond to multiple objects involved in task execution. Built upon videos sourced from ScanNet, ToG-Bench comprises 100 annotated clips with 2,704 task-oriented grounding instructions, constructed via a semi-automated pipeline that combines foundation model annotation and human refinement. In addition, we introduce a set of task-level evaluation metrics tailored for multi-object and explicit-implicit object grounding, and systematically benchmark seven state-of-the-art MLLMs. Extensive experiments reveal the intrinsic challenges of task-oriented STVG and substantial performance gaps across explicit-implicit and multi-object grounding, highlighting the difficulty of bridging perception and interaction in embodied scenarios.

| **[GeoMAE: Masking Representation Learning for Spatio-Temporal Graph Forecasting with Missing Values](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14083v2)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ubiquity of missing data in urban intelligence systems, attributable to adverse environmental conditions and equipment failures, poses a significant challenge to the efficacy of downstream applications, notably in the realms of traffic forecasting and energy consumption prediction. Therefore, it is imperative to develop a robust spatio-temporal learning methodology capable of extracting meaningful insights from incomplete datasets. Despite the existence of methodologies for spatio-temporal graph forecasting in the presence of missing values, unresolved issues persist. Primarily, the majority of extant research is predicated on time-series analysis, thereby neglecting the dynamic spatial correlations inherent in sensor networks. Additionally, the complexity of missing data patterns compounds the intricacy of the problem. Furthermore, the variability in maintenance conditions results in a significant fluctuation in the ratio and pattern of missing values, thereby challenging the generalizability of predictive models. In response to these challenges, this study introduces GeoMAE, a self-supervised spatio-temporal representation learning model. The model is comprised of three principal components: an input preprocessing module, an attention-based spatio-temporal forecasting network (STAFN), and an auxiliary learning task, which draws inspiration from Masking AutoEncoders to enhance the robustness of spatio-temporal representation learning. Empirical evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that GeoMAE significantly outperforms existing benchmarks, achieving up to 13.20\% relative improvement over the best baseline models.</p></details> | 34 pages |

Conservation professionals urgently need timely, high-resolution predictions of biodiversity risks, especially in ecologically diverse regions like Africa. We propose EcoCast, a spatio-temporal model designed for continual biodiversity and climate risk forecasting. Utilizing multisource satellite imagery, climate data, and citizen science occurrence records, EcoCast predicts near-term (monthly to seasonal) shifts in species distributions through sequence-based transformers that model spatio-temporal environmental dependencies. The architecture is designed with support for continual learning to enable future operational deployment with new data streams. Our pilot study in Africa shows promising improvements in forecasting distributions of selected bird species compared to a Random Forest baseline, highlighting EcoCast's potential to inform targeted conservation policies. By demonstrating an end-to-end pipeline from multi-modal data ingestion to operational forecasting, EcoCast bridges the gap between cutting-edge machine learning and biodiversity management, ultimately guiding data-driven strategies for climate resilience and ecosystem conservation throughout Africa.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 3 figures, 1 table.

| **[Beyond Scaffold: A Unified Spatio-Temporal Gradient Tracking Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01732v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In distributed and federated learning algorithms, communication overhead is often reduced by performing multiple local updates between communication rounds. However, due to data heterogeneity across nodes and the local gradient noise within each node, this strategy can lead to the drift of local models away from the global optimum. To address this issue, we revisit the well-known federated learning method Scaffold (Karimireddy et al., 2020) under a gradient tracking perspective, and propose a unified spatio-temporal gradient tracking algorithm, termed ST-GT, for distributed stochastic optimization over time-varying graphs. ST-GT tracks the global gradient across neighboring nodes to mitigate data heterogeneity, while maintaining a running average of local gradients to substantially suppress noise, with slightly more storage overhead. Without assuming bounded data heterogeneity, we prove that ST-GT attains a linear convergence rate for strongly convex problems and a sublinear rate for nonconvex cases. Notably, ST-GT achieves the first linear speed-up in communication complexity with respect to the number of local updates per round $τ$ for the strongly-convex setting. Compared to traditional gradient tracking methods, ST-GT reduces the topology-dependent noise term from $σ^2$ to $σ^2/τ$, where $σ^2$ denotes the noise level, thereby improving communication efficiency.</p></details> | 13 pages |

Accurate predictive models require high-resolution spatio-temporal data to capture complex dynamics of environmental and human factors. To address the scarcity of fine-grained wildfire datasets in Spain, we introduce IberFire: a spatio-temporal dataset with 1 km x 1 km x 1-day resolution, covering mainland Spain and the Balearic Islands from December 2007 to December 2024. IberFire integrates 120 features across eight categories: auxiliary data, fire history, geography, topography, meteorology, vegetation indices, human activity and land cover. All features and processing rely on open-access data and tools, with a publicly available codebase ensuring transparency and applicability. IberFire offers enhanced spatial granularity and feature diversity compared to existing European datasets, and provides a reproducible framework. It supports advanced wildfire risk modelling via Machine Learning and Deep Learning, facilitates climate trend analysis, and informs fire prevention and land management strategies. The dataset is freely available on Zenodo to promote open research and collaboration.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Dynamical Model Representation of Convolution-Generated Spatio-Temporal Gaussian Processes and Its Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01279v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Convolution-generated space-time models yield an important class of non-separable stationary Gaussian Processes (GP) through a sequence of convolution operations, in both space and time, on spatially correlated Brownian motion with a Gaussian convolution kernel. Because of its solid connection to stochastic partial differential equations, such a modeling approach offers strong physical interpretations when it is applied to scientific and engineering processes. In this paper, we obtain a new dynamical model representation for convolution-generated spatio-temporal GP. In particular, an infinite-dimensional linear state-space representation is firstly obtained where the state transition is governed by a stochastic differential equation (SDE) whose solution has the same space-time covariance as the original convolution-generated process. Then, using the Galerkin's method, a finite-dimension approximation to the infinite-dimensional SDE is obtained, yielding a dynamical model with finite states that facilitates the computation and parameter estimation. The space-time covariance of the approximated dynamical model is obtained, and the error between the approximate and exact covariance matrices is quantified. We investigate the performance of the proposed model through a simulation-based study, and apply the approach to a real case study utilizing the remote-sensing aerosol data during the recent 2025 Los Angeles wildfire. The modeling capability of the proposed approach has been well demonstrated, and the proposed approach is found particularly effective in monitoring the first-order time derivative of the underlying space-time process, making it a good candidate for process modeling, monitoring and anomaly detection problems. Computer code and data have been made publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating Spatio-Temporal Forecasting Trade-offs Between Graph Neural Networks and Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05179v2)** | 2025-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern IoT deployments for environmental sensing produce high volume spatiotemporal data to support downstream tasks such as forecasting, typically powered by machine learning models. While existing filtering and strategic deployment techniques optimize collected data volume at the edge, they overlook how variations in sampling frequencies and spatial coverage affect downstream model performance. In many forecasting models, incorporating data from additional sensors denoise predictions by providing broader spatial contexts. This interplay between sampling frequency, spatial coverage and different forecasting model architectures remain underexplored. This work presents a systematic study of forecasting models - classical models (VAR), neural networks (GRU, Transformer), spatio-temporal graph neural networks (STGNNs), and time series foundation models (TSFMs: Chronos Moirai, TimesFM) under varying spatial sensor nodes density and sampling intervals using real-world temperature data in a wireless sensor network. Our results show that STGNNs are effective when sensor deployments are sparse and sampling rate is moderate, leveraging spatial correlations via encoded graph structure to compensate for limited coverage. In contrast, TSFMs perform competitively at high frequencies but degrade when spatial coverage from neighboring sensors is reduced. Crucially, the multivariate TSFM Moirai outperforms all models by natively learning cross-sensor dependencies. These findings offer actionable insights for building efficient forecasting pipelines in spatio-temporal systems. All code for model configurations, training, dataset, and logs are open-sourced for reproducibility: https://github.com/UIUC-MONET-Projects/Benchmarking-Spatiotemporal-Forecast-Models</p></details> |  |
| **[STC-ViT: Spatio Temporal Continuous Vision Transformer for Medium-range Global Weather Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17966v4)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Operational Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) system relies on computationally expensive physics-based models. Recently, transformer models have shown remarkable potential in weather forecasting achieving state-of-the-art results. However, traditional transformers discretize spatio-temporal dimensions, limiting their ability to model continuous dynamical weather processes. Moreover, their reliance on increased depth to capture complex dependencies results in higher computational cost and parameter redundancy. We address these issues with STC-ViT, a Spatio-Temporal Continuous Vision Transformer for weather forecasting. STC-ViT integrates a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) for global spatial operators with a transformer parameterised Neural ODE for continuous-time dynamics, yielding a space-time continuous model for weather forecasting. Our proposed method achieves competitive forecasting performance even with a shallow, single-layer transformer encoder mitigating the reliance on deeper networks. STC-ViT generates complete forecast trajectories with an inference speed of only 0.125 seconds and achieves strong medium-range forecasting skill on 1.5-degree WeatherBench 2 as compared to state-of-the-art data-driven and NWP models trained on higher-resolution data, with substantially lower data and compute costs. We also provide detailed empirical analysis on model's performance with respect to denser time grids, higher-accuracy ODE solvers, and deeper transformer stacks.</p></details> |  |

We formalize audio 4D intelligence that is defined as reasoning over sound dynamics in time and 3D space, and introduce STAR-Bench to measure it. STAR-Bench combines a Foundational Acoustic Perception setting (six attributes under absolute and relative regimes) with a Holistic Spatio-Temporal Reasoning setting that includes segment reordering for continuous and discrete processes and spatial tasks spanning static localization, multi-source relations, and dynamic trajectories. Our data curation pipeline uses two methods to ensure high-quality samples. For foundational tasks, we use procedurally synthesized and physics-simulated audio. For holistic data, we follow a four-stage process that includes human annotation and final selection based on human performance. Unlike prior benchmarks where caption-only answering reduces accuracy slightly, STAR-Bench induces far larger drops (-31.5\% temporal, -35.2\% spatial), evidencing its focus on linguistically hard-to-describe cues. Evaluating 19 models reveals substantial gaps compared with humans and a capability hierarchy: closed-source models are bottlenecked by fine-grained perception, while open-source models lag across perception, knowledge, and reasoning. Our STAR-Bench provides critical insights and a clear path forward for developing future models with a more robust understanding of the physical world.</p></details> | <details><summary>Homep...</summary><p>Homepage: https://internlm.github.io/StarBench/</p></details> |
| **[Mapping Urban Air Quality from Mobile Sensors Using Spatio-Temporal Geostatistics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22544v1)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the advancement of technology and the arrival of miniaturized environmental sensors that offer greater performance, the idea of building mobile network sensing for air quality has quickly emerged to increase our knowledge of air pollution in urban environments. However, with these new techniques, the difficulty of building mathematical models capable of aggregating all these data sources in order to provide precise mapping of air quality arises. In this context, we explore the spatio-temporal geostatistics methods as a solution for such a problem and evaluate three different methods: Simple Kriging (SK) in residuals, Ordinary Kriging (OK), and Kriging with External Drift (KED). On average, geostatistical models showed 26.57% improvement in the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) compared to the standard Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) technique in interpolating scenarios (27.94% for KED, 26.05% for OK, and 25.71% for SK). The results showed less significant scores in extrapolating scenarios (a 12.22% decrease in the RMSE for geostatisical models compared to IDW). We conclude that univariable geostatistics is suitable for interpolating this type of data but is less appropriate for an extrapolation of non-sampled places since it does not create any information.</p></details> |  |

A three-level hierarchical model is proposed to simultaneously accounts for the physical process of interest and measurement errors inherent in low-cost sensors. Several innovative configurations of Vecchia's approximation are investigated, including variations in ordering strategies, distance definitions, and sensor-specific conditioning. These configurations are evaluated for approximating the likelihood of a spatio-temporal Gaussian process, using simulated data based on real mobile sensor trajectories across Nantes, France. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of the min-max distance algorithm for ordering, reaffirming existing literature. Additionally, we demonstrate the utility of a random ordering approach that doesn't require prior definition of a spatio-temporal distance. These two ordering configurations achieved, on average, 102\% better results in log Kullback-Leibler divergence compared with four other ordering schemes studied. Results are supplemented with Asymptotic Relative Efficiency analysis, offering practical recommendations for optimizing parameter estimation. The proposed model and preferred Vecchia configuration are applied to real-world air quality data collected using mobile and fixed low-cost sensors. This application underscores the model's practical value for pollution mapping and prediction in environmental monitoring. This study advances the use of Vecchia's approximation for addressing computational challenges of Gaussian models in large-scale spatio-temporal datasets from environmental monitoring with low-cost sensor networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Hierarchical Causal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20558v2)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The abundance of fine-grained spatio-temporal data, such as traffic sensor networks, offers vast opportunities for scientific discovery. However, inferring causal relationships from such observational data remains challenging, particularly due to unobserved confounders that are specific to units (e.g., geographical locations) yet influence outcomes over time. Most existing methods for spatio-temporal causal inference assume that all confounders are observed, an assumption that is often violated in practice. In this paper, we introduce Spatio-Temporal Hierarchical Causal Models (ST-HCMs), a novel graphical framework that extends hierarchical causal modeling to the spatio-temporal domain. At the core of our approach is the Spatio-Temporal Collapse Theorem, which shows that a complex ST-HCM converges to a simpler flat causal model as the amount of subunit data increases. This theoretical result enables a general procedure for causal identification, allowing ST-HCMs to recover causal effects even in the presence of unobserved, time-invariant unit-level confounders, a scenario where standard non-hierarchical models fail. We validate the effectiveness of our framework on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating its potential for robust causal inference in complex dynamic systems.</p></details> |  |

However, current research focuses on simple video scenarios, failing to reflect the complex and diverse nature of real-world audio-visual events in videos. To bridge this gap, we firstly introduce R-AVST, a dataset for audio-visual reasoning featuring fine-grained spatio-temporal annotations. In constructing this, we design a pipeline consisting of LLM-based key object extraction, automatic spatial annotation and manual quality inspection, resulting in over 5K untrimmed videos with 27K objects across 100 types of audio-visual events. Building on this dataset, we define three core tasks for spatio-temporal reasoning in audio-visual scenes and generate more than 8K high-quality, evenly distributed question-answer pairs to effectively benchmark model performance. To further enhance reasoning, we propose AVST-Zero, a reinforcement learning-based model that avoids intermediate supervision, directly optimizing behavior via carefully designed multi-dimensional rewards. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our R-AVST in advancing audio-visual spatio-temporal reasoning, upon which AVST-Zero demonstrates competitive performance compared to existing models. To the best of our knowledge, R-AVST is the first dataset designed for real-world audio-visual spatio-temporal reasoning, and AVST-Zero offers a novel perspective for tackling future challenges in this domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026.

However, the complexity of data collection, classification, validation and processing result in cancer incidence figures often lagging two to three years behind the calendar year. In response, national or regional population-based cancer registries (PBCRs) are increasingly interested in methods for forecasting cancer incidence. However, in many countries there is an additional difficulty in projecting cancer incidence as regional registries are usually not established in the same year and therefore cancer incidence data series between different regions of a country are not harmonised over time. This study addresses the challenge of forecasting cancer incidence with incomplete data at both regional and national levels. To achieve this, we propose the use of multivariate spatio-temporal shared component models that jointly model mortality data and available cancer incidence data. We evaluate the performance of these multivariate models using lung cancer incidence data and the corresponding number of deaths reported in England for the period 2001-2019. Model performance was assessed using different predictive measures to select the best model.</p></details> | 37 pages |

Despite their strong language understanding, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) underperform on STVG due to misaligned training objectives and weak fine-grained region-word alignment in standard visual encoders. To address this, we propose STVG-o1, the first framework that enables off-the-shelf MLLMs to achieve state-of-the-art STVG performance without any architectural modifications. Our method introduces a bounding-box chain-of-thought mechanism that explicitly reasons about spatio-temporal locations in an intermediate step before producing the final prediction. We further design a multi-dimensional reinforcement reward function consisting of format, consistency, temporal, spatial, and think rewards, which provides geometry-aware supervision through reinforcement fine-tuning. Evaluated on HCSTVG-v1/v2 and VidSTG, STVG-o1 sets new state-of-the-art results on HCSTVG, outperforming the best task-specific method by 7.3\% m\_tIoU on HCSTVG-v1, matching specialized models on VidSTG, and surpassing all existing MLLM-based approaches by large margins. It also demonstrates strong open-vocabulary generalization across datasets, establishing MLLMs as viable and powerful backbones for precise spatio-temporal grounding. Our code and models will be released.</p></details> |  |

Two main frameworks naturally arise to perform the integration of these multiple sources: sequential Bayesian inference and integrated models. The first one consists of updating posterior information in a sequential data analysis procedure, without the need to reanalyze previous data when new data become available. The second one consists of bringing together diverse sources of information in a joint inferential analysis through hierarchical Bayesian models. Within the context of the first framework, we propose a recursive inference method grounded in the methodological principles of INLA, designed to handle spatial and spatio-temporal problems, although its applicability is not limited to these cases, as the procedure is general in nature. Within the integrated models framework, we also present a comprehensive approach to address change of support issues that arise when combining heterogeneous information sources, developing a typology that classifies such changes as spatial, temporal, spatio-temporal, or categorical. Both frameworks can be combined, as there is neither a theoretical nor a practical incompatibility preventing their joint use. Finally, detailed examples are provided to illustrate clear and replicable procedures for combining heterogeneous data sources with change of support and recursive inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages and 8 figures</p></details> |
| **[TaCo: Capturing Spatio-Temporal Semantic Consistency in Remote Sensing Change Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20306v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote sensing change detection (RSCD) aims to identify surface changes across bi-temporal satellite images. Most previous methods rely solely on mask supervision, which effectively guides spatial localization but provides limited constraints on the temporal semantic transitions. Consequently, they often produce spatially coherent predictions while still suffering from unresolved semantic inconsistencies. To address this limitation, we propose TaCo, a spatio-temporal semantic consistent network, which enriches the existing mask-supervised framework with a spatio-temporal semantic joint constraint. TaCo conceptualizes change as a semantic transition between bi-temporal states, in which one temporal feature representation can be derived from the other via dedicated transition features. To realize this, we introduce a Text-guided Transition Generator that integrates textual semantics with bi-temporal visual features to construct the cross-temporal transition features. In addition, we propose a spatio-temporal semantic joint constraint consisting of bi-temporal reconstruct constraints and a transition constraint: the former enforces alignment between reconstructed and original features, while the latter enhances discrimination for changes. This design can yield substantial performance gains without introducing any additional computational overhead during inference. Extensive experiments on six public datasets, spanning both binary and semantic change detection tasks, demonstrate that TaCo consistently achieves SOTA performance.</p></details> |  |

This tutorial addresses this gap by offering a comprehensive overview of recent advances in TFMs, including a taxonomy of existing methodologies and a critical analysis of their strengths and limitations.

| **[STAlloc: Enhancing Memory Efficiency in Large-Scale Model Training with Spatio-Temporal Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16274v2)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid scaling of large language models (LLMs) has significantly increased GPU memory pressure, which is further aggravated by training optimization techniques such as virtual pipeline and recomputation that disrupt tensor lifespans and introduce considerable memory fragmentation. Such fragmentation stems from the use of online GPU memory allocators in popular deep learning frameworks like PyTorch, which disregard tensor lifespans. As a result, this inefficiency can waste as much as 43% of memory and trigger out-of-memory errors, undermining the effectiveness of optimization methods. To address this, we introduce STAlloc, a GPU memory allocator for deep learning frameworks that reduces fragmentation by exploiting the spatial and temporal regularity in memory allocation behaviors of training workloads. STAlloc introduces a novel paradigm that combines offline planning with online allocation. The offline planning leverages spatio-temporal regularities to generate a near-optimal allocation plan, while the online allocation handles complex and dynamic models such as Mixture-of-Experts (MoE). Built as a pluggable PyTorch memory allocator, STAlloc reduces fragmentation ratio on average by 85.1% (up to 100%) across both dense and MoE models, with negligible overhead. This enables more efficient, high-throughput training configurations and improves throughput performance by up to 32.5%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Spatio-Temporal Attention Network with Adaptive Risk-Aware Decision for Forward Collision Warning in Complex Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19952v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forward Collision Warning systems are crucial for vehicle safety and autonomous driving, yet current methods often fail to balance precise multi-agent interaction modeling with real-time decision adaptability, evidenced by the high computational cost for edge deployment and the unreliability stemming from simplified interaction models.To overcome these dual challenges-computational complexity and modeling insufficiency-along with the high false alarm rates of traditional static-threshold warnings, this paper introduces an integrated FCW framework that pairs a Hierarchical Spatio-Temporal Attention Network with a Dynamic Risk Threshold Adjustment algorithm. HSTAN employs a decoupled architecture (Graph Attention Network for spatial, cascaded GRU with self-attention for temporal) to achieve superior performance and efficiency, requiring only 12.3 ms inference time (73% faster than Transformer methods) and reducing the Average Displacement Error (ADE) to 0.73m (42.2% better than Social_LSTM) on the NGSIM dataset. Furthermore, Conformalized Quantile Regression enhances reliability by generating prediction intervals (91.3% coverage at 90% confidence), which the DTRA module then converts into timely warnings via a physics-informed risk potential function and an adaptive threshold mechanism inspired by statistical process control.Tested across multi-scenario datasets, the complete system demonstrates high efficacy, achieving an F1 score of 0.912, a low false alarm rate of 8.2%, and an ample warning lead time of 2.8 seconds, validating the framework's superior performance and practical deployment feasibility in complex environments.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by event-based vision, we propose an event-guided, training-free framework for efficient spatio-temporal understanding, named EventSTU. In the temporal domain, we design a coarse-to-fine keyframe sampling algorithm that exploits the change-triggered property of event cameras to eliminate redundant frames. In the spatial domain, we design an adaptive token pruning algorithm that leverages the visual saliency of events as a zero-cost prior to guide spatial reduction. From a holistic spatio-temporal perspective, we further integrate question relevance from keyframe sampling to adaptively allocate token pruning budgets. To facilitate evaluation, we construct EventBench, the first event-inclusive, human-annotated multimodal benchmark that covers diverse real-world scenarios. Beyond physical event cameras, EventSTU also supports general video understanding using simulated events. Comprehensive experiments show that EventSTU achieves 3.01x FLOPs reduction and 3.10x prefilling speedup over the strongest baseline while still improving performance.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |

Vision-based fall prediction systems offer a non-invasive solution to anticipate falls seconds before impact, but their development is hindered by the scarcity of available fall data. Contributing to these efforts, this study proposes the Biomechanical Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (BioST-GCN), a dual-stream model that combines both pose and biomechanical information using a cross-attention fusion mechanism. Our model outperforms the vanilla ST-GCN baseline by 5.32% and 2.91% F1-score on the simulated MCF-UA stunt-actor and MUVIM datasets, respectively. The spatio-temporal attention mechanisms in the ST-GCN stream also provide interpretability by identifying critical joints and temporal phases. However, a critical simulation-reality gap persists. While our model achieves an 89.0% F1-score with full supervision on simulated data, zero-shot generalization to unseen subjects drops to 35.9%. This performance decline is likely due to biases in simulated data, such as 'intent-to-fall' cues. For older adults, particularly those with diabetes or frailty, this gap is exacerbated by their unique kinematic profiles. To address this, we propose personalization strategies and advocate for privacy-preserving data pipelines to enable real-world validation. Our findings underscore the urgent need to bridge the gap between simulated and real-world data to develop effective fall prediction systems for vulnerable elderly populations.</p></details> |  |
| **[SpotFormer: Multi-Scale Spatio-Temporal Transformer for Facial Expression Spotting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20799v2)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Facial expression spotting, identifying periods where facial expressions occur in a video, is a significant yet challenging task in facial expression analysis. The issues of irrelevant facial movements and the challenge of detecting subtle motions in micro-expressions remain unresolved, hindering accurate expression spotting. In this paper, we propose an efficient framework for facial expression spotting. First, we propose a Sliding Window-based multi-temporal-resolution Optical flow (SW-MRO) feature, which calculates multi-temporal-resolution optical flow of the input image sequence within compact sliding windows. The window length is tailored to perceive complete micro-expressions and distinguish between general macro- and micro-expressions. SW-MRO can effectively reveal subtle motions while avoiding the optical flow being dominated by head movements. Second, we propose SpotFormer, a multi-scale spatio-temporal Transformer that simultaneously encodes spatio-temporal relationships of the SW-MRO features for accurate frame-level probability estimation. In SpotFormer, we use the proposed Facial Local Graph Pooling (FLGP) operation and convolutional layers to extract multi-scale spatio-temporal features. We show the validity of the architecture of SpotFormer by comparing it with several model variants. Third, we introduce supervised contrastive learning into SpotFormer to enhance the discriminability between different types of expressions. Extensive experiments on SAMM-LV, CAS(ME)^2, and CAS(ME)^3 show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art models, particularly in micro-expression spotting.</p></details> |  |

Despite recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models, a significant gap remains between current models and real-world demands involving diverse objects and complex queries. We attribute this to limited benchmark scope, causing models to exhibit category bias, oversimplified reasoning, and poor linguistic robustness. To address these limitations, we introduce OmniGround, a comprehensive benchmark with 3,475 videos spanning 81 categories and complex real-world queries. We propose the Forward-Backward-Refinement annotation pipeline that combines multi-directional tracking with intelligent error correction for high-quality labels. We further introduce DeepSTG, a systematic evaluation framework quantifying dataset quality across four complementary dimensions beyond superficial statistics. Evaluations reveal performance average drop of 10.4% on complex real-world scenes, particularly with small/occluded objects and intricate spatial relations. Motivated by these, we propose PG-TAF, a training-free two-stage framework decomposing STVG into high-level temporal grounding and fine-grained spatio-temporal propagation. Experiments demonstrate PG-TAF achieves 25.6% and 35.6% improvements in m\_tIoU and m\_vIoU on OmniGround with consistent gains across four benchmarks.</p></details> | 20 pages |
| **[A Spatio-temporal CP decomposition analysis of New England region in the US](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10322v3)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio temporal data consist of measurement for one or more raster fields such as weather, traffic volume, crime rate, or disease incidents. Advances in modern technology have increased the number of available information for this type of data hence the rise of multidimensional data. In this paper we take advantage of the multidimensional structure of the data but also its temporal and spatial structure. In fact, we will be using the NCAR Climate Data Gateway website which provides data discovery and access services for global and regional climate model data. The daily values of total precipitation (prec), maximum (tmax), and minimum (tmin) temperature are combined to create a multidimensional data called tensor (a multidimensional array). In this paper, we propose a spatio temporal principal component analysis to initialize CP decomposition component. We take full advantage of the spatial and temporal structure of the data in the initialization step for cp component analysis. The performance of our method is tested via comparison with most popular initialization method. We also run a clustering analysis to further show the performance of our analysis.</p></details> | 14 pages, 3 figures |

| **[Broadcast in Almost Mixing Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02165v3)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the problem of broadcasting multiple messages in the CONGEST model. In this problem, a dedicated source node $s$ possesses a set $M$ of messages with every message of size $O(\log n)$ where $n$ is the total number of nodes. The objective is to ensure that every node in the network learns all messages in $M$. The execution of an algorithm progresses in rounds, and we focus on optimizing the round complexity of broadcasting multiple messages. Our primary contribution is a randomized algorithm for networks with expander topology, which are widely used in practice for building scalable and robust distributed systems. The algorithm succeeds with high probability and achieves a round complexity that is optimal up to a factor of the network's mixing time and polylogarithmic terms. It leverages a multi-COBRA primitive, which uses multiple branching random walks running in parallel. To the best of our knowledge, this approach has not been applied in distributed algorithms before. A crucial aspect of our method is the use of these branching random walks to construct an optimal (up to a polylogarithmic factor) tree packing of a random graph, which is then used for efficient broadcasting. This result is of independent interest. We also prove the problem to be NP-hard in a centralized setting and provide insights into why straightforward lower bounds for general graphs, namely graph diameter and $\frac{|M|}{\textit{minCut}}$, cannot be tight.</p></details> |  |
| **[Collaborative Multi-Agent Test-Time Reinforcement Learning for Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09667v1)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent systems have evolved into practical LLM-driven collaborators for many applications, gaining robustness from diversity and cross-checking. However, multi-agent RL (MARL) training is resource-intensive and unstable: co-adapting teammates induce non-stationarity, and rewards are often sparse and high-variance. Therefore, we introduce \textbf{Multi-Agent Test-Time Reinforcement Learning (MATTRL)}, a framework that injects structured textual experience into multi-agent deliberation at inference time. MATTRL forms a multi-expert team of specialists for multi-turn discussions, retrieves and integrates test-time experiences, and reaches consensus for final decision-making. We also study credit assignment for constructing a turn-level experience pool, then reinjecting it into the dialogue. Across challenging benchmarks in medicine, math, and education, MATTRL improves accuracy by an average of 3.67\% over a multi-agent baseline, and by 8.67\% over comparable single-agent baselines. Ablation studies examine different credit-assignment schemes and provide a detailed comparison of how they affect training outcomes. MATTRL offers a stable, effective and efficient path to distribution-shift-robust multi-agent reasoning without tuning.</p></details> | Work in Progress |

Fifty-seven adults explored three five-minute VR environments (tranquil garden, neutral room, threatening sewer) while eye tracking recorded pupil diameter. Baseline stress was assessed before VR exposure. After each environment, participants estimated elapsed time and rated mood, calmness, and arousal. Repeated-measures ANCOVA (baseline stress as covariate) and linear mixed-effects models converged on a valence gradient: garden intervals were overestimated, sewer intervals underestimated, and neutral estimates were intermediate. Pupil diameter showed the complementary pattern (sewer > garden > neutral) and covaried with the magnitude of temporal distortion. Baseline stress did not predict time estimates and did not moderate valence effects. Results indicate that affectively distinct VR contexts reliably shift perceived time and elicit convergent physiological and self-report responses. These findings inform emotion-aware design of immersive experiences and digital-wellbeing safeguards that support safe, sustained immersion.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 Pa...</summary><p>23 Pages, 10 Figures, 2 Tables</p></details> |

This paper presents a novel method for semantically enhancing 3D point cloud maps with thermal information. By first performing pixel-level fusion of visible and infrared images, the system projects real-time LiDAR point clouds onto this fused image stream. It then segments heat source features in the thermal channel to instantly identify high temperature targets and applies this temperature information as a semantic layer on the final 3D map. This approach generates maps that not only have accurate geometry but also possess a critical semantic understanding of the environment, making it highly valuable for specific applications like rapid disaster assessment and industrial preventive maintenance.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages,7 figures.

| **[Permutation Matching Under Parikh Budgets: Linear-Time Detection, Packing, and Disjoint Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09577v1)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study permutation (jumbled/Abelian) pattern matching over a general alphabet $Σ$. Given a pattern P of length m and a text T of length n, the classical task is to decide whether T contains a length-m substring whose Parikh vector equals that of P . While this existence problem admits a linear-time sliding-window solution, many practical applications require optimization and packing variants beyond mere detection. We present a unified sliding-window framework based on maintaining the Parikh-vector difference between P and the current window of T , enabling permutation matching in O(n + σ) time and O(σ) space, where σ = |Σ|. Building on this foundation, we introduce a combinatorial-optimization variant that we call Maximum Feasible Substring under Pattern Supply (MFSP): find the longest substring S of T whose symbol counts are component-wise bounded by those of P . We show that MFSP can also be solved in O(n + σ) time via a two-pointer feasibility maintenance algorithm, providing an exact packing interpretation of P as a resource budget. Finally, we address non-overlapping occurrence selection by modeling each permutation match as an equal-length interval and proving that a greedy earliest-finishing strategy yields a maximum-cardinality set of disjoint matches, computable in linear time once all matches are enumerated. Our results provide concise, provably correct algorithms with tight bounds, and connect frequency-based string matching to packing-style optimization primitives.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages (Excluding reference)</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Large Language Models for Time-Series Forecasting via Vector-Injected In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07903v2)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The World Wide Web needs reliable predictive capabilities to respond to changes in user behavior and usage patterns. Time series forecasting (TSF) is a key means to achieve this goal. In recent years, the large language models (LLMs) for TSF (LLM4TSF) have achieved good performance. However, there is a significant difference between pretraining corpora and time series data, making it hard to guarantee forecasting quality when directly applying LLMs to TSF; fine-tuning LLMs can mitigate this issue, but often incurs substantial computational overhead. Thus, LLM4TSF faces a dual challenge of prediction performance and compute overhead. To address this, we aim to explore a method for improving the forecasting performance of LLM4TSF while freezing all LLM parameters to reduce computational overhead. Inspired by in-context learning (ICL), we propose LVICL. LVICL uses our vector-injected ICL to inject example information into a frozen LLM, eliciting its in-context learning ability and thereby enhancing its performance on the example-related task (i.e., TSF). Specifically, we first use the LLM together with a learnable context vector adapter to extract a context vector from multiple examples adaptively. This vector contains compressed, example-related information. Subsequently, during the forward pass, we inject this vector into every layer of the LLM to improve forecasting performance. Compared with conventional ICL that adds examples into the prompt, our vector-injected ICL does not increase prompt length; moreover, adaptively deriving a context vector from examples suppresses components harmful to forecasting, thereby improving model performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |

Efficient solutions for counting long aggregated visits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09489v1)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the Counting Long Aggregated Visits problem, which is defined as follows. We are given $n$ users and $m$ regions, where each user spends some time visiting some regions. For a parameter $k$ and a query consisting of a subset of $r$ regions, the task is to count the number of distinct users whose aggregate time spent visiting the query regions is at least $k$. This problem is motivated by queries arising in the analysis of large-scale mobility datasets. We present several exact and approximate data structures for supporting counting long aggregated visits, as well as conditional and unconditional lower bounds. First, we describe an exact data structure that exhibits a space-time tradeoff, as well as efficient approximate solutions based on sampling and sketching techniques. We then study the problem in geometric settings where regions are points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and queries are hyperrectangles, and derive exact data structures that achieve improved performance in these structured spaces.</p></details> |  |
| **[Horizon Activation Mapping for Neural Networks in Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02094v2)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural networks for time series forecasting have relied on error metrics and architecture-specific interpretability approaches for model selection that don't apply across models of different families. To interpret forecasting models agnostic to the types of layers across state-of-the-art model families, we introduce Horizon Activation Mapping (HAM), a visual interpretability technique inspired by grad-CAM that uses gradient norm averages to study the horizon's subseries where grad-CAM studies attention maps over image data. We introduce causal and anti-causal modes to calculate gradient update norm averages across subseries at every timestep and lines of proportionality signifying uniform distributions of the norm averages. Optimization landscape studies with respect to changes in batch sizes, early stopping, train-val-test splits, architectural choices, univariate forecasting and dropouts are studied with respect to performances and subseries in HAM. Interestingly, batch size based differences in activities seem to indicate potential for existence of an exponential approximation across them per epoch relative to each other. Multivariate forecasting models including MLP-based CycleNet, N-Linear, N-HITS, self attention-based FEDformer, Pyraformer, SSM-based SpaceTime and diffusion-based Multi-Resolution DDPM over different horizon sizes trained over the ETTm2 dataset are used for HAM plots in this study. NHITS' neural approximation theorem and SpaceTime's exponential autoregressive activities have been attributed to trends in HAM plots over their training, validation and test sets. In general, HAM can be used for granular model selection, validation set choices and comparisons across different neural network model families.</p></details> |  |
| **[Variable Basis Mapping for Real-Time Volumetric Visualization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09417v1)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time visualization of large-scale volumetric data remains challenging, as direct volume rendering and voxel-based methods suffer from prohibitively high computational cost. We propose Variable Basis Mapping (VBM), a framework that transforms volumetric fields into 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representations through wavelet-domain analysis. First, we precompute a compact Wavelet-to-Gaussian Transition Bank that provides optimal Gaussian surrogates for canonical wavelet atoms across multiple scales. Second, we perform analytical Gaussian construction that maps discrete wavelet coefficients directly to 3DGS parameters using a closed-form, mathematically principled rule. Finally, a lightweight image-space fine-tuning stage further refines the representation to improve rendering fidelity. Experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate that VBM significantly accelerates convergence and enhances rendering quality, enabling real-time volumetric visualization.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages.

| **[White noise testing for functional time series via functional quantile autocorrelation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09371v1)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel class of nonlinear tests for serial dependence in functional time series, grounded in the functional quantile autocorrelation framework. Unlike traditional approaches based on the classical autocovariance kernel, the functional quantile autocorrelation framework leverages quantile-based excursion sets to robustly capture temporal dependence within infinite-dimensional functional data, accommodating potential outliers and complex nonlinear dependencies. We propose omnibus test statistics and study their asymptotic properties under both known and estimated quantile curves, establishing their asymptotic distribution and consistency under mild assumptions. In particular, no moment conditions are required for the validity of the tests. Extensive simulations and an application to high-frequency financial functional time series demonstrate the methodology's effectiveness, reliably detecting complex serial dependence with superior power relative to several existing tests. This work expands the toolkit for functional time series, providing a robust framework for inference in settings where traditional methods may fail.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Importance Sampling for Estimating Occupation Time for SDE Solutions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13950v2)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study considers the estimation of the complementary cumulative distribution function of the occupation time (i.e., the time spent below a threshold) for a process governed by a stochastic differential equation. The focus is on the right tail, where the underlying event becomes rare, and using variance reduction techniques is essential to obtain computationally efficient estimates. Building on recent developments that relate importance sampling (IS) to stochastic optimal control, this work develops an optimal single level IS (SLIS) estimator based on the solution of an auxiliary Hamilton Jacobi Bellman (HJB) partial differential equation (PDE). The cost of solving the HJB-PDE is incorporated into the total computational work, and an optimized trade off between preprocessing and sampling is proposed to minimize the overall cost. The SLIS approach is extended to the multilevel setting to enhance efficiency, yielding a multilevel IS (MLIS) estimator. A necessary and sufficient condition under which the MLIS method outperforms the SLIS method is established, and a common likelihood MLIS formulation is introduced that satisfies this condition under appropriate regularity assumptions. The classical multilevel Monte Carlo complexity theory can be extended to accommodate settings where the single-level variance varies with the discretization level. As a special case, the variance-decay behavior observed in the IS framework stems from the zero variance property of the optimal control. Notably, the total work complexity of MLIS can be better than an order of two. Numerical experiments in the context of fade duration estimation demonstrate the benefits of the proposed approach and validate these theoretical results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Test-Time Scaling of Multi-Step Reasoning by Probing Internal States of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06209v3)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs can solve complex tasks by generating long, multi-step reasoning chains. Test-time scaling (TTS) can further improve LLM performance by sampling multiple variants of intermediate reasoning steps, verifying their correctness, and strategically choosing the best steps for continuation. However, existing verification approaches, such as Process Reward Models (PRMs), are computationally expensive, limited to specific domains, and require large-scale human or model-generated annotations. We propose a lightweight alternative for step-level reasoning verification based on probing the internal states of LLMs. We train a transformer-based probe that uses the internal states of the frozen LLM to estimate the credibility of its reasoning steps during generation. Annotation can be generated either by another larger LLM (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) or in a self-supervised manner by the original model itself. The probes are both effective and lightweight, containing fewer than 10M parameters. Across multiple domains, including mathematics, planning, and general knowledge question answering, our probes match or even exceed the performance of PRMs that are up to 810x larger. Our findings suggest that the internal states of LLMs encode their confidence in reasoning processes and can serve as reliable signals for reasoning step verification, offering a promising direction towards scalable and generalizable TTS and introspective LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint under review</p></details> |

CallShield introduces a real-time neural watermarking technique that enables per-bit embedding and recovery within 40-millisecond frames of live 8 kHz speech. This capability allows CallShield to transform the real-time audio channel into a noisy serial communication medium. To ensure reliable data transmission, CallShield implements a low-bitrate data link protocol that provides basic frame synchronization along with error detection, correction, and recovery. For caller authentication, CallShield adopts a secure and lightweight symmetric-key protocol that relies on pairwise shared secrets among trusted contacts. The system completes the full authentication process in an average of 63 seconds, including up to three retransmission attempts, making it suitable for real-time deployment. Extensive experiments under realistic telephony conditions demonstrate that CallShield achieves an overall authentication success rates exceeding 99.2% on clean audio and over 95% under common distortions, aided by selective retransmission of failed messages. Additionally, CallShield maintains high audio quality, achieving PESQ scores above 4.2 and STOI scores above 0.94 on clean speech, and exhibits robustness across a wide range of channel distortions, validating its practical viability for secure, real-time caller authentication.</p></details> |  |
| **[ThinkBrake: A Simple Test-Time Decoding Control for Efficient Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00546v4)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) allocate substantial inference-time compute to Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, improving performance on mathematics, scientific QA, and tool usage. However, this introduces overthinking: LRMs often reach a correct intermediate solution, continue reasoning, and overwrite it with an incorrect answer. We first demonstrate that oracle stopping--where we inject </think> at every sentence boundary and select the best stopping point in hindsight--improves average accuracy by 8% while reducing thinking tokens by 72%, exposing substantial overthinking. Motivated by this finding, we propose ThinkBrake, which monitors the log-probability margin between the top continuation token and </think> at sentence boundaries, stopping reasoning when this margin narrows. ThinkBrake requires no training and achieves favorable accuracy-efficiency trade-offs across math, scientific QA, and tool usage benchmarks, reducing thinking token usage by up to 30%. Furthermore, we provide theoretical analysis showing that ThinkBrake is equivalent to test-time realignment with a reward bonus for the </think> token.</p></details> |  |
| **[XLinear: A Lightweight and Accurate MLP-Based Model for Long-Term Time Series Forecasting with Exogenous Inputs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09237v1)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the prevalent assumption of uniform variable importance in long-term time series forecasting models, real world applications often exhibit asymmetric causal relationships and varying data acquisition costs. Specifically, cost-effective exogenous data (e.g., local weather) can unilaterally influence dynamics of endogenous variables, such as lake surface temperature. Exploiting these links enables more effective forecasts when exogenous inputs are readily available. Transformer-based models capture long-range dependencies but incur high computation and suffer from permutation invariance. Patch-based variants improve efficiency yet can miss local temporal patterns. To efficiently exploit informative signals across both the temporal dimension and relevant exogenous variables, this study proposes XLinear, a lightweight time series forecasting model built upon MultiLayer Perceptrons (MLPs). XLinear uses a global token derived from an endogenous variable as a pivotal hub for interacting with exogenous variables, and employs MLPs with sigmoid activation to extract both temporal patterns and variate-wise dependencies. Its prediction head then integrates these signals to forecast the endogenous series. We evaluate XLinear on seven standard benchmarks and five real-world datasets with exogenous inputs. Compared with state-of-the-art models, XLinear delivers superior accuracy and efficiency for both multivariate forecasts and univariate forecasts influenced by exogenous inputs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |

Autoregressive methods address this problem by applying block-wise autoregressive diffusion methods. However, these methods suffer from the problem of error accumulation and quality degradation. To address this, we propose JoyAvatar-Flash, an audio-driven autoregressive model capable of real-time inference and infinite-length video generation with the following contributions: (1) Progressive Step Bootstrapping (PSB), which allocates more denoising steps to initial frames to stabilize generation and reduce error accumulation; (2) Motion Condition Injection (MCI), enhancing temporal coherence by injecting noise-corrupted previous frames as motion condition; and (3) Unbounded RoPE via Cache-Resetting (URCR), enabling infinite-length generation through dynamic positional encoding. Our 1.3B-parameter causal model achieves 16 FPS on a single GPU and achieves competitive results in visual quality, temporal consistency, and lip synchronization.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Hawkes Processes to Attention: Time-Modulated Mechanisms for Event Sequences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09220v1)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Marked Temporal Point Processes (MTPPs) arise naturally in medical, social, commercial, and financial domains. However, existing Transformer-based methods mostly inject temporal information only via positional encodings, relying on shared or parametric decay structures, which limits their ability to capture heterogeneous and type-specific temporal effects. Inspired by this observation, we derive a novel attention operator called Hawkes Attention from the multivariate Hawkes process theory for MTPP, using learnable per-type neural kernels to modulate query, key and value projections, thereby replacing the corresponding parts in the traditional attention. Benefited from the design, Hawkes Attention unifies event timing and content interaction, learning both the time-relevant behavior and type-specific excitation patterns from the data. The experimental results show that our method achieves better performance compared to the baselines. In addition to the general MTPP, our attention mechanism can also be easily applied to specific temporal structures, such as time series forecasting.</p></details> |  |

| **[Soft Contrastive Learning for Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16424v4)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive learning has shown to be effective to learn representations from time series in a self-supervised way. However, contrasting similar time series instances or values from adjacent timestamps within a time series leads to ignore their inherent correlations, which results in deteriorating the quality of learned representations. To address this issue, we propose SoftCLT, a simple yet effective soft contrastive learning strategy for time series. This is achieved by introducing instance-wise and temporal contrastive loss with soft assignments ranging from zero to one. Specifically, we define soft assignments for 1) instance-wise contrastive loss by the distance between time series on the data space, and 2) temporal contrastive loss by the difference of timestamps. SoftCLT is a plug-and-play method for time series contrastive learning that improves the quality of learned representations without bells and whistles. In experiments, we demonstrate that SoftCLT consistently improves the performance in various downstream tasks including classification, semi-supervised learning, transfer learning, and anomaly detection, showing state-of-the-art performance.

However, this method has two problems: (i) inefficiency due to IP-weights cumulating all time points and (ii) bias and inefficiency due to the MSM misspecification. To address these problems, we propose (i) new IP-weights for estimating parameters of the MSM that depends on partial treatment history and (ii) closed testing procedures for selecting partial treatment history (how far back in time the MSM depends on past treatments). We derive the theoretical properties of our proposed methods under known IP-weights and discuss their extension to estimated IP-weights. Although some of our theoretical results are derived under additional assumptions beyond standard identifiability assumptions, some of which can be checked empirically from the data. In simulation studies, our proposed methods outperformed existing methods both in terms of performance in estimating time-varying treatment effects and in selecting partial treatment history. Our proposed methods have also been applied to real data of hemodialysis patients with reasonable results.</p></details> |  |
| **[SAM-Aug: Leveraging SAM Priors for Few-Shot Parcel Segmentation in Satellite Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09110v1)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-shot semantic segmentation of time-series remote sensing images remains a critical challenge, particularly in regions where labeled data is scarce or costly to obtain. While state-of-the-art models perform well under full supervision, their performance degrades significantly under limited labeling, limiting their real-world applicability. In this work, we propose SAM-Aug, a new annotation-efficient framework that leverages the geometry-aware segmentation capability of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to improve few-shot land cover mapping. Our approach constructs cloud-free composite images from temporal sequences and applies SAM in a fully unsupervised manner to generate geometry-aware mask priors. These priors are then integrated into training through a proposed loss function called RegionSmoothLoss, which enforces prediction consistency within each SAM-derived region across temporal frames, effectively regularizing the model to respect semantically coherent structures. Extensive experiments on the PASTIS-R benchmark under a 5 percent labeled setting demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of SAM-Aug. Averaged over three random seeds (42, 2025, 4090), our method achieves a mean test mIoU of 36.21 percent, outperforming the state-of-the-art baseline by +2.33 percentage points, a relative improvement of 6.89 percent. Notably, on the most favorable split (seed=42), SAM-Aug reaches a test mIoU of 40.28 percent, representing an 11.2 percent relative gain with no additional labeled data. The consistent improvement across all seeds confirms the generalization power of leveraging foundation model priors under annotation scarcity. Our results highlight that vision models like SAM can serve as useful regularizers in few-shot remote sensing learning, offering a scalable and plug-and-play solution for land cover monitoring without requiring manual annotations or model fine-tuning.</p></details> | 13 pages, 6 figures |

However, the combination of lengthy reasoning traces with multiple sampling introduces substantial computation and high end-to-end latency. Prior work on accelerating this process has relied on similarity-based or confidence-based pruning, but these signals do not reliably indicate trace quality. To address these limitations, we propose STEP: Step-level Trace Evaluation and Pruning, a novel pruning framework that evaluates reasoning steps using hidden states and dynamically prunes unpromising traces during generation. We train a lightweight step scorer to estimate trace quality, and design a GPU memory-aware pruning strategy that triggers pruning as the GPU memory is saturated by KV cache to reduce end-to-end latency. Experiments across challenging reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that STEP reduces end-to-end inference latency by 45%-70% on average compared to self-consistency while also improving reasoning accuracy.

| **[Meta-learning to Address Data Shift in Time Series Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09018v1)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Across engineering and scientific domains, traditional deep learning (TDL) models perform well when training and test data share the same distribution. However, the dynamic nature of real-world data, broadly termed \textit{data shift}, renders TDL models prone to rapid performance degradation, requiring costly relabeling and inefficient retraining. Meta-learning, which enables models to adapt quickly to new data with few examples, offers a promising alternative for mitigating these challenges. Here, we systematically compare TDL with fine-tuning and optimization-based meta-learning algorithms to assess their ability to address data shift in time-series classification. We introduce a controlled, task-oriented seismic benchmark (SeisTask) and show that meta-learning typically achieves faster and more stable adaptation with reduced overfitting in data-scarce regimes and smaller model architectures. As data availability and model capacity increase, its advantages diminish, with TDL with fine-tuning performing comparably. Finally, we examine how task diversity influences meta-learning and find that alignment between training and test distributions, rather than diversity alone, drives performance gains. Overall, this work provides a systematic evaluation of when and why meta-learning outperforms TDL under data shift and contributes SeisTask as a benchmark for advancing adaptive learning research in time-series domains.</p></details> |  |

Likelihood-based estimators typically lead to non-convex and possibly multimodal optimization landscapes, and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods may mix exponentially slowly. We propose a class of computationally tractable estimators--plug-in and PDE-penalized M-estimators--for inverse problems defined through operator equations of the form $L_f u = g$, where $f$ is the unknown parameter and $u$ is the observed solution. The key idea is to replace the exact PDE constraint by a weakly enforced relaxation, yielding conditionally convex and, in many PDE examples, nested quadratic optimization problems that avoid evaluating the forward map $G(f)$ and do not require PDE solvers. For prototypical non-linear inverse problems arising from elliptic PDEs, including the Darcy flow model $L_f u = \nabla\!\cdot(f\nabla u)$ and a steady-state Schrödinger model, we prove that these estimators attain the best currently known statistical convergence rates while being globally computable in polynomial time. In the Darcy model, we obtain an explicit sub-quadratic $o(N^2)$ arithmetic runtime bound for estimating $f$ from $N$ noisy samples. Our analysis is based on new generalized stability estimates, extending classical stability beyond the range of the forward operator, combined with tools from nonparametric M-estimation. We also derive adaptive rates for the Darcy problem, providing a blueprint for designing provably polynomial-time statistical algorithms for a broad class of non-linear inverse problems. Our estimators also provide principled warm-start initializations for polynomial-time Bayesian computation.</p></details> | 46 pages, 2 figures |

Modern space weather monitoring generates massive volumes of high-frequency, multivariate time series (MVTS) data from sources such as the Geostationary perational Environmental Satellites (GOES). Machine learning (ML) models trained on this data show strong predictive power, but most existing methods overlook domain-specific feasibility constraints. Counterfactual explanations have emerged as a key tool for improving model interpretability, yet existing approaches rarely enforce physical plausibility. This work introduces a Physics-Guided Counterfactual Explanation framework, a novel method for generating counterfactual explanations in time series classification tasks that remain consistent with underlying physical principles. Applied to solar energetic particles (SEP) forecasting, this framework achieves over 80% reduction in Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance increasing the proximity, produces counterfactual explanations with higher sparsity, and reduces runtime by nearly 50% compared to state-of-the-art baselines such as DiCE. Beyond numerical improvements, this framework ensures that generated counterfactual explanations are physically plausible and actionable in scientific domains. In summary, the framework generates counterfactual explanations that are both valid and physically consistent, while laying the foundation for scalable counterfactual generation in big data environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a pre-print of an accepted paper at IEEE BigData 2025, SS 11:Towards an Understanding of Artificial Intelligence: Bridging Theory, Explainability, and Practical Applications</p></details> |

Such behavior is modeled by the Time-Varying Holding Cost (TVHC) problem, where each job's instantaneous holding cost increases with its current age (a job's age is the time since it arrived). The goal of the TVHC problem is to find a scheduling policy that minimizes the time-average total holding cost across all jobs. However, no optimality results are known for the TVHC problem outside of the asymptotic regime. In this paper, we study a simple yet still challenging special case: A two-class M/M/1 queue in which class 1 jobs incur a non-decreasing, time-varying holding cost and class 2 jobs incur a constant holding cost. Our main contribution is deriving the first optimal (non-decreasing) index policy for this special case of the TVHC problem. Our optimal policy, called LookAhead, stems from the following idea: Rather than considering each job's current holding cost when making scheduling decisions, we should look at their cost some $X$ time into the future, where this $X$ is intuitively called the ``lookahead amount." This paper derives that optimal lookahead amount.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in Queueing Systems</p></details> |

Yet these systems are typically designed as static, hand-tuned menus of selection criteria grounded in prior knowledge and simulation. In this work, we further explore the concept of a self-driving trigger, an autonomous data-filtering framework that reallocates resources and adjusts thresholds dynamically in real-time to optimize signal efficiency, rate stability, and computational cost as instrumentation and environmental conditions evolve. We introduce a benchmark ecosystem to emulate realistic collider scenarios and demonstrate real-time optimization of a menu including canonical energy sum triggers as well as modern anomaly-detection algorithms that target non-standard event topologies using machine learning. Using simulated data streams and publicly available collision data from the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment, we demonstrate the capability to dynamically and automatically optimize trigger performance under specific cost objectives without manual retuning. Our adaptive strategy shifts trigger design from static menus with heuristic tuning to intelligent, automated, data-driven control, unlocking greater flexibility and discovery potential in future high-energy physics analyses.</p></details> |  |
| **[Asymptotic Universal Alignment: A New Alignment Framework via Test-Time Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08777v1)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning large language models (LLMs) to serve users with heterogeneous and potentially conflicting preferences is a central challenge for personalized and trustworthy AI. We formalize an ideal notion of universal alignment through test-time scaling: for each prompt, the model produces $k\ge 1$ candidate responses and a user selects their preferred one. We introduce $(k,f(k))$-robust alignment, which requires the $k$-output model to have win rate $f(k)$ against any other single-output model, and asymptotic universal alignment (U-alignment), which requires $f(k)\to 1$ as $k\to\infty$. Our main result characterizes the optimal convergence rate: there exists a family of single-output policies whose $k$-sample product policies achieve U-alignment at rate $f(k)=\frac{k}{k+1}$, and no method can achieve a faster rate in general. We show that popular post-training methods, including Nash learning from human feedback (NLHF), can fundamentally underutilize the benefits of test-time scaling. Even though NLHF is optimal for $k=1$, sampling from the resulting (often deterministic) policy cannot guarantee win rates above $\tfrac{1}{2}$ except for an arbitrarily small slack. This stems from a lack of output diversity: existing alignment methods can collapse to a single majority-preferred response, making additional samples redundant. In contrast, our approach preserves output diversity and achieves the optimal test-time scaling rate. In particular, we propose a family of symmetric multi-player alignment games and prove that any symmetric Nash equilibrium policy of the $(k+1)$-player alignment game achieves the optimal $(k,\frac{k}{k+1})$-robust alignment. Finally, we provide theoretical convergence guarantees for self-play learning dynamics in these games and extend the framework to opponents that also generate multiple responses.</p></details> |  |

We relate a Hebbian spike-timing-dependent plasticity rule to noisy gradient descent with respect to a non-convex loss function on the probability simplex. Despite the constant injection of noise and the non-convexity of the underlying optimization problem, one can rigorously prove that the considered Hebbian learning dynamic identifies the presynaptic neuron with the highest activity and that the convergence is exponentially fast in the number of iterations. This is non-standard and surprising as typically noisy gradient descent with fixed noise level only converges to a stationary regime where the noise causes the dynamic to fluctuate around a minimiser.</p></details> |  |

We study reconstruction-based anomaly detection for ensemble data from parameterized Kármán vortex street simulations using convolutional autoencoders. We compare a 2D autoencoder operating on individual frames with a 3D autoencoder that processes short temporal stacks. The 2D model identifies localized spatial irregularities in single time steps, while the 3D model exploits spatio-temporal context to detect anomalous motion patterns and reduces redundant detections across time. We further evaluate volumetric time-dependent data and find that reconstruction errors are strongly influenced by the spatial distribution of mass, with highly concentrated regions yielding larger errors than dispersed configurations. Our results highlight the importance of temporal context for robust anomaly detection in dynamic simulations.</p></details> |  |

While existing methods excel in modeling dominant regular patterns, their performance degrades significantly during extreme events, constituting the primary source of forecasting errors in real-world applications. Although some approaches incorporate auxiliary signals to improve performance, they still fail to capture extreme events' complex temporal dynamics. To address these limitations, we propose M$^2$FMoE, an extreme-adaptive forecasting model that learns both regular and extreme patterns through multi-resolution and multi-view frequency modeling. It comprises three modules: (1) a multi-view frequency mixture-of-experts module assigns experts to distinct spectral bands in Fourier and Wavelet domains, with cross-view shared band splitter aligning frequency partitions and enabling inter-expert collaboration to capture both dominant and rare fluctuations; (2) a multi-resolution adaptive fusion module that hierarchically aggregates frequency features from coarse to fine resolutions, enhancing sensitivity to both short-term variations and sudden changes; (3) a temporal gating integration module that dynamically balances long-term trends and short-term frequency-aware features, improving adaptability to both regular and extreme temporal patterns. Experiments on real-world hydrological datasets with extreme patterns demonstrate that M$^2$FMoE outperforms state-of-the-art baselines without requiring extreme-event labels.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |

Yet, this dimension has been largely underexplored in the VLM test-time prompt-tuning (TPT) literature, which has predominantly focused on improving their discriminative performance. Recent state-of-the-art advocates for enforcing full orthogonality over pairs of text prompt embeddings to enhance separability, and therefore calibration. Nevertheless, as we theoretically show in this work, the inherent gradients from fully orthogonal constraints will strongly push semantically related classes away, ultimately making the model overconfident. Based on our findings, we propose Semantic Orthogonal Calibration (SoC), a Huber-based regularizer that enforces smooth prototype separation while preserving semantic proximity, thereby improving calibration compared to prior orthogonality-based approaches. Across a comprehensive empirical validation, we demonstrate that SoC consistently improves calibration performance, while also maintaining competitive discriminative capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[WaveFormer: Frequency-Time Decoupled Vision Modeling with Wave Equation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08602v1)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision modeling has advanced rapidly with Transformers, whose attention mechanisms capture visual dependencies but lack a principled account of how semantic information propagates spatially. We revisit this problem from a wave-based perspective: feature maps are treated as spatial signals whose evolution over an internal propagation time (aligned with network depth) is governed by an underdamped wave equation. In this formulation, spatial frequency-from low-frequency global layout to high-frequency edges and textures-is modeled explicitly, and its interaction with propagation time is controlled rather than implicitly fixed. We derive a closed-form, frequency-time decoupled solution and implement it as the Wave Propagation Operator (WPO), a lightweight module that models global interactions in O(N log N) time-far lower than attention. Building on WPO, we propose a family of WaveFormer models as drop-in replacements for standard ViTs and CNNs, achieving competitive accuracy across image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation, while delivering up to 1.6x higher throughput and 30% fewer FLOPs than attention-based alternatives. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that wave propagation introduces a complementary modeling bias to heat-based methods, effectively capturing both global coherence and high-frequency details essential for rich visual semantics.

Here, we expand on the previous analysis to disentangle this cosmological signal from the influence of the properties of the source population, specifically the quasar bolometric luminosity and the rest-frame emission wavelength at which the variability was observed. Furthermore, we consider the potential influence of the evolution of the quasar population over cosmic time. We find that a significant intrinsic scatter of 0.288 +- 0.021 dex in the variability timescales, which was not considered in the previous analysis, is favoured by the data. This slightly increases the uncertainty in the results. However, the expected cosmological dependence of the variability timescales is confirmed to be robust to changes in the underlying assumptions. We find that the variability timescales increase smoothly with both wavelength and bolometric luminosity, and that black hole mass has no effect on the variability timescale once rest wavelength and bolometric luminosity are accounted for. Moreover, if the standard cosmological model is correct, governed by relativistic expansion, we also find very little cosmological evolution in the intrinsic variability timescales of distant quasars.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures.

Traditional turn-based chat systems driven by LLMs prevent users from verbally interacting with the system while it is generating responses. To overcome these limitations, we adapt existing LLMs to \textit{duplex models} so that these LLMs can listen for users while generating output and dynamically adjust themselves to provide users with instant feedback. % such as in response to interruptions. Specifically, we divide the queries and responses of conversations into several time slices and then adopt a time-division-multiplexing (TDM) encoding-decoding strategy to pseudo-simultaneously process these slices. Furthermore, to make LLMs proficient enough to handle real-time conversations, we build a fine-tuning dataset consisting of alternating time slices of queries and responses as well as covering typical feedback types in instantaneous interactions. Our experiments show that although the queries and responses of conversations are segmented into incomplete slices for processing, LLMs can preserve their original performance on standard benchmarks with a few fine-tuning steps on our dataset. Automatic and human evaluation indicate that duplex models make user-AI interactions more natural and human-like, and greatly improve user satisfaction compared to vanilla LLMs. Our duplex model and dataset will be released.</p></details> |  |

Existing retraining-based approaches are costly and poorly scalable, while decoding-time methods often rely on external models or heuristics, limiting flexibility and robustness. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-Personality Generation (MPG) framework under the decoding-time combination paradigm. It flexibly controls multi-personality without relying on scarce multi-dimensional models or extra training, leveraging implicit density ratios in single-dimensional models as a "free lunch" to reformulate the task as sampling from a target strategy aggregating these ratios. To implement MPG efficiently, we design Speculative Chunk-level based Rejection sampling (SCR), which generates responses in chunks and parallelly validates them via estimated thresholds within a sliding window. This significantly reduces computational overhead while maintaining high-quality generation. Experiments on MBTI personality and Role-Playing demonstrate the effectiveness of MPG, showing improvements up to 16%-18%.

With the rapid growth of vector data, efficient indexing for real-time vector search has become rudimentary. Existing CPU-based solutions support updates but suffer from low throughput, while GPU-accelerated systems deliver high performance but face challenges with dynamic updates and limited GPU memory, resulting in a critical performance gap for continuous, large-scale vector search requiring both accuracy and speed. In this paper, we present SVFusion, a GPU-CPU-disk collaborative framework for real-time vector search that bridges sophisticated GPU computation with online updates.

However, this explicit reasoning exposes a new attack surface for inference-time backdoors, which inject malicious reasoning paths without altering model parameters. Because these attacks generate linguistically coherent paths, they effectively evade conventional detection. To address this, we propose STAR (State-Transition Amplification Ratio), a framework that detects backdoors by analyzing output probability shifts. STAR exploits the statistical discrepancy where a malicious input-induced path exhibits high posterior probability despite a low prior probability in the model's general knowledge. We quantify this state-transition amplification and employ the CUSUM algorithm to detect persistent anomalies. Experiments across diverse models (8B-70B) and five benchmark datasets demonstrate that STAR exhibits robust generalization capabilities, consistently achieving near-perfect performance (AUROC $\approx$ 1.0) with approximately $42\times$ greater efficiency than existing baselines. Furthermore, the framework proves robust against adaptive attacks attempting to bypass detection.</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures |

We analysed TFN in post-kidney transplant (KTx) care, with a retrospective cohort of 3382 patients, on three key outcomes: graft loss, graft rejection, and mortality. Compared to state-of-the-art model in post KTx care, TFN achieved higher performance for graft loss (AUC 0.96 vs. 0.94) and graft rejection (AUC 0.84 vs. 0.74).

TFN outperformed unimodal baselines (approx 10% AUC improvement over time series only baseline, approx 5% AUC improvement over time series with static patient data). Integrating clinical text improved performance across all tasks. Disentanglement metrics confirmed robust and interpretable latent factors in the embedding space, and SHAP-based attributions confirmed alignment with clinical reasoning. TFN has potential application in clinical tasks beyond KTx, where heterogeneous data sources, irregular longitudinal data, and rich narrative documentation are available.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 9 figures, 3 tables.

Traditional manual methods are inefficient, labor-intensive, and prone to human error, often leading to suboptimal aquatic conditions. This paper presents an IoT-based smart aquarium system that addresses these limitations by integrating an ESP32 microcontroller with multiple sensors (pH, TDS, temperature, turbidity) and actuators (servo feeder, water pump) for comprehensive real-time water quality monitoring and automated control. The system architecture incorporates edge processing capabilities, cloud connectivity via Blynk IoT platform, and an intelligent alert mechanism with configurable cooldown periods to prevent notification fatigue. Experimental evaluation in a 10-liter aquarium environment demonstrated the system's effectiveness, achieving 96\% average sensor accuracy and 1.2-second response time for anomaly detection. The automated feeding and water circulation modules maintained 97\% operational reliability throughout extended testing, significantly reducing manual intervention while ensuring stable aquatic conditions. This research demonstrates that cost-effective IoT solutions can revolutionize aquarium maintenance, making aquatic ecosystem management more accessible, reliable, and efficient for both residential and commercial applications.</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, jointly achieving high fidelity, streaming capability, real-time responsiveness, and scalability remains a fundamental challenge. In this paper, we propose MOGO (Motion Generation with One-pass), a novel autoregressive framework tailored for efficient and real-time 3D motion generation. MOGO comprises two key components: (1) MoSA-VQ, a motion scale-adaptive residual vector quantization module that hierarchically discretizes motion sequences with learnable scaling to produce compact yet expressive representations; and (2) RQHC-Transformer, a residual quantized hierarchical causal transformer that generates multi-layer motion tokens in a single forward pass, significantly reducing inference latency. To enhance semantic fidelity, we further introduce a text condition alignment mechanism that improves motion decoding under textual control. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets including HumanML3D, KIT-ML, and CMP demonstrate that MOGO achieves competitive or superior generation quality compared to state-of-the-art transformer-based methods, while offering substantial improvements in real-time performance, streaming generation, and generalization under zero-shot settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, conference</p></details> |

We propose a neuromorphic regularization scheme inspired by the synaptic homeostasis hypothesis: periodic offline phases during which external inputs are suppressed, synaptic weights undergo stochastic decay toward a homeostatic baseline, and spontaneous activity enables memory consolidation. We demonstrate that this sleep-wake cycle prevents weight saturation while preserving learned structure. Empirically, we find that low to intermediate sleep durations (10-20\% of training) improve stability on MNIST-like benchmarks in our STDP-SNN model, without any data-specific hyperparameter tuning. In contrast, the same sleep intervention yields no measurable benefit for the surrogate-gradient spiking neural network (SG-SNN). Taken together, these results suggest that periodic, sleep-based renormalization may represent a fundamental mechanism for stabilizing local Hebbian learning in neuromorphic systems, while also indicating that special care is required when integrating such protocols with existing gradient-based optimization methods.</p></details> |  |

By performing frame-wise fusion without accumulation, SPARK produces stable point clouds in dynamic scenes while scaling linearly with the number of cameras.

Accurate Time of Birth (ToB) documentation is essential for optimizing neonatal care, as timely interventions are vital for proper resuscitation. However, current clinical methods for recording ToB often rely on manual processes, which can be prone to inaccuracies. In this study, we present a novel two-stream fusion system that combines the power of image and video analysis to accurately detect the ToB from thermal recordings in the delivery room and operating theater. By integrating static and dynamic streams, our approach captures richer birth-related spatiotemporal features, leading to more robust and precise ToB estimation. We demonstrate that this synergy between data modalities enhances performance over single-stream approaches. Our system achieves 95.7% precision and 84.8% recall in detecting birth within short video clips. Additionally, with the help of a score aggregation module, it successfully identifies ToB in 100% of test cases, with a median absolute error of 2 seconds and an absolute mean deviation of 4.5 seconds compared to manual annotations.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted at IEEE 25th International Conference on Digital Signal Processing</p></details> |
| **[A Hybrid Framework Combining Autoregression and Common Factors for Matrix Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05340v3)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Matrix-valued time series are ubiquitous in modern economics and finance, yet modeling them requires navigating a trade-off between flexibility and parsimony. We propose the Matrix Autoregressive model with Common Factors (MARCF), a unified framework for high-dimensional matrix time series that bridges the structural gap between the Matrix Autoregression (MAR) and Matrix Factor Model (MFM). While MAR typically assumes distinct predictor and response subspaces and MFM enforces identical ones, MARCF explicitly characterizes the intersection of these subspaces. By decomposing the coefficient matrices into common, predictor-specific, and response-specific components, the framework accommodates distinct input and output structures while exploiting their overlap for dimension reduction. We develop a regularized gradient descent estimator that is scalable for high-dimensional data and can efficiently handle the non-convex parameter space. Theoretical analysis establishes local linear convergence of the algorithm and statistical consistency of the estimator under high-dimensional scaling. The estimation efficiency and interpretability of the proposed methods are demonstrated through simulations and an application to global macroeconomic forecasting.</p></details> |  |

Conventional RNN-based predictors adopt an encoder-only strategy with sliding historical windows as inputs to forecast future values. However, this approach treats all time steps and hidden states equally without considering their distinct contributions to forecasting, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Reinforced Recurrent Encoder with Prediction-oriented Proximal Policy Optimization, RRE-PPO4Pred, which significantly improves time series modeling capacity and forecasting accuracy of the RNN models. The core innovations of this method are: (1) A novel Reinforced Recurrent Encoder (RRE) framework that enhances RNNs by formulating their internal adaptation as a Markov Decision Process, creating a unified decision environment capable of learning input feature selection, hidden skip connection, and output target selection; (2) An improved Prediction-oriented Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm, termed PPO4Pred, which is equipped with a Transformer-based agent for temporal reasoning and develops a dynamic transition sampling strategy to enhance sampling efficiency; (3) A co-evolutionary optimization paradigm to facilitate the learning of the RNN predictor and the policy agent, providing adaptive and interactive time series modeling. Comprehensive evaluations on five real-world datasets indicate that our method consistently outperforms existing baselines, and attains accuracy better than state-of-the-art Transformer models, thus providing an advanced time series predictor in engineering informatics.</p></details> |  |

Web search consistently yields substantial gains and using code interpreter shows mixed effects, but all models perform much better when constraints are rewritten with explicit dates, revealing a gap in reliable tool use. Overall, Time Puzzles presents a simple, cost-effective diagnostic for tool-augmented iterative temporal reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Real-Time LiDAR Point Cloud Densification for Low-Latency Spatial Data Transmission](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01210v2)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To realize low-latency spatial transmission system for immersive telepresence, there are two major problems: capturing dynamic 3D scene densely and processing them in real time. LiDAR sensors capture 3D in real time, but produce sparce point clouds. Therefore, this paper presents a high-speed LiDAR point cloud densification method to generate dense 3D scene with minimal latency, addressing the need for on-the-fly depth completion while maintaining real-time performance. Our approach combines multiple LiDAR inputs with high-resolution color images and applies a joint bilateral filtering strategy implemented through a convolutional neural network architecture. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method produces dense depth maps at full HD resolution in real time (30 fps), which is over 15x faster than a recent training-based depth completion approach. The resulting dense point clouds exhibit accurate geometry without multiview inconsistencies or ghosting artifacts.</p></details> |  |

Though popular, they are primarily trained via supervised fine-tuning or training-time reinforcement learning, requiring explicit fine-tuning phases, human interventions, or controlled data collection. Consequently, existing methods remain unsuitable for challenging simulated- or physical-world deployments, where robots must respond autonomously and flexibly to evolving environments. To address this limitation, we introduce a Test-Time Reinforcement Learning for VLAs (TT-VLA), a framework that enables on-the-fly policy adaptation during inference. TT-VLA formulates a dense reward mechanism that leverages step-by-step task-progress signals to refine action policies during test time while preserving the SFT/RL-trained priors, making it an effective supplement to current VLA models. Empirical results show that our approach enhances overall adaptability, stability, and task success in dynamic, previously unseen scenarios under simulated and real-world settings. We believe TT-VLA offers a principled step toward self-improving, deployment-ready VLAs.</p></details> |  |

Prior approaches rely on costly test-time optimization of 4D representations or do not preserve scene geometry when trained in a feed-forward manner. Our approach is based on three key insights: (1) covisible pixels (that are visible in both the input and target views) can be rendered by first reconstructing the dynamic 3D scene and rendering the reconstruction from the novel-views and (2) hidden pixels in novel views can be "inpainted" with feed-forward 2D video diffusion models. Notably, our video inpainting diffusion model (CogNVS) can be self-supervised from 2D videos, allowing us to train it on a large corpus of in-the-wild videos. This in turn allows for (3) CogNVS to be applied zero-shot to novel test videos via test-time finetuning. We empirically verify that CogNVS outperforms almost all prior art for novel-view synthesis of dynamic scenes from monocular videos.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025.

| **[LoFT-LLM: Low-Frequency Time-Series Forecasting with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20002v3)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series forecasting in real-world applications such as finance and energy often faces challenges due to limited training data and complex, noisy temporal dynamics. Existing deep forecasting models typically supervise predictions using full-length temporal windows, which include substantial high-frequency noise and obscure long-term trends. Moreover, auxiliary variables containing rich domain-specific information are often underutilized, especially in few-shot settings. To address these challenges, we propose LoFT-LLM, a frequency-aware forecasting pipeline that integrates low-frequency learning with semantic calibration via a large language model (LLM). Firstly, a Patch Low-Frequency forecasting Module (PLFM) extracts stable low-frequency trends from localized spectral patches. Secondly, a residual learner then models high-frequency variations. Finally, a fine-tuned LLM refines the predictions by incorporating auxiliary context and domain knowledge through structured natural language prompts. Extensive experiments on financial and energy datasets demonstrate that LoFT-LLM significantly outperforms strong baselines under both full-data and few-shot regimes, delivering superior accuracy, robustness, and interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This submission is withdrawn due to internal review and compliance considerations</p></details> |
| **[Subspace Alignment for Vision-Language Model Test-time Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08139v1)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs), despite their extraordinary zero-shot capabilities, are vulnerable to distribution shifts. Test-time adaptation (TTA) emerges as a predominant strategy to adapt VLMs to unlabeled test data on the fly. However, existing TTA methods heavily rely on zero-shot predictions as pseudo-labels for self-training, which can be unreliable under distribution shifts and misguide adaptation due to two fundamental limitations. First (Modality Gap), distribution shifts induce gaps between visual and textual modalities, making cross-modal relations inaccurate. Second (Visual Nuisance), visual embeddings encode rich but task-irrelevant noise that often overwhelms task-specific semantics under distribution shifts. To address these limitations, we propose SubTTA, which aligns the semantic subspaces of both modalities to enhance zero-shot predictions to better guide the TTA process. To bridge the modality gap, SubTTA extracts the principal subspaces of both modalities and aligns the visual manifold to the textual semantic anchor by minimizing their chordal distance. To eliminate visual nuisance, SubTTA projects the aligned visual features onto the task-specific textual subspace, which filters out task-irrelevant noise by constraining visual embeddings within the valid semantic span, and standard TTA is further performed on the purified space to refine the decision boundaries. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks and VLM architectures demonstrate the effectiveness of SubTTA, yielding an average improvement of 2.24% over state-of-the-art TTA methods.</p></details> | 17 pages, 10 figures |
| **[tidychangepoint: A Unified Framework for Analyzing Changepoint Detection in Univariate Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14369v3)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present tidychangepoint, a new R package for changepoint detection analysis. Most R packages for segmenting univariate time series focus on providing one or two algorithms for changepoint detection that work with a small set of models and penalized objective functions, and all of them return a custom, nonstandard object type. This makes comparing results across various algorithms, models, and penalized objective functions unnecessarily difficult. tidychangepoint solves this problem by wrapping functions from a variety of existing packages and storing the results in a common S3 class called tidycpt. The package then provides functionality for easily extracting comparable numeric or graphical information from a tidycpt object, all in a tidyverse-compliant framework. tidychangepoint is versatile: it supports both deterministic algorithms like PELT (from changepoint), and also flexible, randomized, genetic algorithms (via GA) that -- via new functionality built into tidychangepoint -- can be used with any compliant model-fitting function and any penalized objective function. By bringing all of these disparate tools together in a cohesive fashion, tidychangepoint facilitates comparative analysis of changepoint detection algorithms and models.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents an xApp called xSlice for the Near-Real-Time (Near-RT) RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) of 5G O-RANs. xSlice is an online learning algorithm that adaptively adjusts MAC-layer resource allocation in response to dynamic network states, including time-varying wireless channel conditions, user mobility, traffic fluctuations, and changes in user demand. To address these network dynamics, we first formulate the Quality-of-Service (QoS) optimization problem as a regret minimization problem by quantifying the QoS demands of all traffic sessions through weighting their throughput, latency, and reliability. We then develop a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that utilizes an actor-critic model to combine the advantages of both value-based and policy-based updating methods. A graph convolutional network (GCN) is incorporated as a component of the DRL framework for graph embedding of RAN data, enabling xSlice to handle a dynamic number of traffic sessions. We have implemented xSlice on an O-RAN testbed with 10 smartphones and conducted extensive experiments to evaluate its performance in realistic scenarios. Experimental results show that xSlice can reduce performance regret by 67% compared to the state-of-the-art solutions.

Existing FCIL methods typically integrate old knowledge preservation into local client training. However, these methods cannot avoid spatial-temporal client drift caused by data heterogeneity and often incur significant computational and communication overhead, limiting practical deployment. To address these challenges simultaneously, we propose a novel approach, Spatial-Temporal Statistics Aggregation (STSA), which provides a unified framework to aggregate feature statistics both spatially (across clients) and temporally (across stages). The aggregated feature statistics are unaffected by data heterogeneity and can be used to update the classifier in closed form at each stage. Additionally, we introduce STSA-E, a communication-efficient variant with theoretical guarantees, achieving similar performance to STSA-E with much lower communication overhead. Extensive experiments on three widely used FCIL datasets, with varying degrees of data heterogeneity, show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art FCIL methods in terms of performance, flexibility, and both communication and computation efficiency.

However, real-world information needs often require reasoning about temporal evolution and synthesizing evidence across time periods. We introduce TEMPO, the first benchmark combining temporal reasoning with reasoning-intensive retrieval across 13 domains. TEMPO features: (1) 1,730 complex queries requiring deep temporal reasoning such as tracking changes, identifying trends, or comparing cross-period evidence; (2) step-wise retrieval planning with 3,976 decomposed steps and gold documents mapped to each step for multi-hop evaluation; and (3) novel temporal metrics including Temporal Coverage@k and Temporal Precision@k measuring whether results span required time periods. Evaluation of 12 retrieval systems reveals substantial challenges: the best model (DiVeR) achieves only 32.0 NDCG@10 and 71.4\% Temporal Coverage@10, demonstrating difficulty in retrieving temporally complete evidence. We believe TEMPO provides a challenging benchmark for improving temporal reasoning in retrieval and RAG systems. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/tempo-bench/Tempo.

| **[Structured yet Bounded Temporal Understanding in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16685v2)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) increasingly show strong performance on temporally grounded tasks, such as timeline construction, temporal question answering, and event ordering. However, it remains unclear how their behavior depends on the way time is anchored in language. In this work, we study LLMs' temporal understanding through temporal frames of reference (t-FoRs), contrasting deictic framing (past-present-future) and sequential framing (before-after). Using a large-scale dataset of real-world events from Wikidata and similarity judgement task, we examine how LLMs' outputs vary with temporal distance, interval relations, and event duration. Our results show that LLMs systematically adapt to both t-FoRs, but the resulting similarity patterns differ significantly. Under deictic t-FoR, the similarity judgement scores form graded and asymmetric structures centered on the present, with sharper decline for future events and higher variance in the past. Under sequential t-FoR, similarity becomes strongly negative once events are temporally separated. Temporal judgements are also shaped by interval algebra and duration, with instability concentrated in overlap- and containment-based relations, and duration influencing only past events under deictic t-FoR. Overall, these findings characterize how LLMs organize temporal representation under different reference structures and identify the factors that most strongly shape their temporal understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review.

Recently, we have witnessed the rise of variational autoencoder-based latent factor models, which learn latent factors self-adaptively. While these models focus on modeling overall market conditions, they often fail to effectively capture the temporal patterns of individual stocks. Additionally, representing multiple factors as single values simplifies the model but limits its ability to capture complex relationships and dependencies. As a result, the learned factors are of low quality and lack diversity, reducing their effectiveness and robustness across different trading periods. To address these issues, we propose a Spatio-Temporal factOR Model based on dual vector quantized variational autoencoders, named STORM, which extracts features of stocks from temporal and spatial perspectives, then fuses and aligns these features at the fine-grained and semantic level, and represents the factors as multi-dimensional embeddings. The discrete codebooks cluster similar factor embeddings, ensuring orthogonality and diversity, which helps distinguish between different factors and enables factor selection in financial trading. To show the performance of the proposed factor model, we apply it to two downstream experiments: portfolio management on two stock datasets and individual trading tasks on six specific stocks. The extensive experiments demonstrate STORM's flexibility in adapting to downstream tasks and superior performance over baseline models.</p></details> |  |

Recently, the evolving dynamics of knowledge have attracted a growing interest in Temporal Knowledge Graph Question Answering (TKGQA), an emerging task to answer temporal questions. However, this field grapples with ambiguities in defining temporal questions and lacks a systematic categorization of existing methods for TKGQA. In response, this paper provides a thorough survey from two perspectives: the taxonomy of temporal questions and the methodological categorization for TKGQA. Specifically, we first establish a detailed taxonomy of temporal questions engaged in prior studies. Subsequently, we provide a comprehensive review of TKGQA techniques of two categories: semantic parsing-based and TKG embedding-based. Building on this review, the paper outlines potential research directions aimed at advancing the field of TKGQA. This work aims to serve as a comprehensive reference for TKGQA and to stimulate further research.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures.

| **[Point Tracking as a Temporal Cue for Robust Myocardial Segmentation in Echocardiography Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09207v1)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Purpose: Myocardium segmentation in echocardiography videos is a challenging task due to low contrast, noise, and anatomical variability. Traditional deep learning models either process frames independently, ignoring temporal information, or rely on memory-based feature propagation, which accumulates error over time. Methods: We propose Point-Seg, a transformer-based segmentation framework that integrates point tracking as a temporal cue to ensure stable and consistent segmentation of myocardium across frames. Our method leverages a point-tracking module trained on a synthetic echocardiography dataset to track key anatomical landmarks across video sequences. These tracked trajectories provide an explicit motion-aware signal that guides segmentation, reducing drift and eliminating the need for memory-based feature accumulation. Additionally, we incorporate a temporal smoothing loss to further enhance temporal consistency across frames. Results: We evaluate our approach on both public and private echocardiography datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that Point-Seg has statistically similar accuracy in terms of Dice to state-of-the-art segmentation models in high quality echo data, while it achieves better segmentation accuracy in lower quality echo with improved temporal stability. Furthermore, Point-Seg has the key advantage of pixel-level myocardium motion information as opposed to other segmentation methods. Such information is essential in the computation of other downstream tasks such as myocardial strain measurement and regional wall motion abnormality detection. Conclusion: Point-Seg demonstrates that point tracking can serve as an effective temporal cue for consistent video segmentation, offering a reliable and generalizable approach for myocardium segmentation in echocardiography videos.

| **[Temporal Smoothness-Aware Rate-Distortion Optimized 4D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17336v3)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) effectively extends the high-speed rendering capabilities of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to represent volumetric videos. However, the large number of Gaussians, substantial temporal redundancies, and especially the absence of an entropy-aware compression framework result in large storage requirements. Consequently, this poses significant challenges for practical deployment, efficient edge-device processing, and data transmission. In this paper, we introduce a novel end-to-end RD-optimized compression framework tailored for 4DGS, aiming to enable flexible, high-fidelity rendering across varied computational platforms. Leveraging Fully Explicit Dynamic Gaussian Splatting (Ex4DGS), one of the state-of-the-art 4DGS methods, as our baseline, we start from the existing 3DGS compression methods for compatibility while effectively addressing additional challenges introduced by the temporal axis. In particular, instead of storing motion trajectories independently per point, we employ a wavelet transform to reflect the real-world smoothness prior, significantly enhancing storage efficiency. This approach yields significantly improved compression ratios and provides a user-controlled balance between compression efficiency and rendering quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving up to 91$\times$ compression compared to the original Ex4DGS model while maintaining high visual fidelity. These results highlight the applicability of our framework for real-time dynamic scene rendering in diverse scenarios, from resource-constrained edge devices to high-performance environments.

However, existing iterations face significant limitations: V1-V3 struggle with occlusions due to a reliance on purely visual cues, while TrackNetV4, despite introducing motion inputs, suffers from directional ambiguity as its absolute difference method discards motion polarity. To overcome these bottlenecks, we propose TrackNetV5, a robust architecture integrating two novel mechanisms. First, to recover lost directional priors, we introduce the Motion Direction Decoupling (MDD) module. Unlike V4, MDD decomposes temporal dynamics into signed polarity fields, explicitly encoding both movement occurrence and trajectory direction. Second, we propose the Residual-Driven Spatio-Temporal Refinement (R-STR) head. Operating on a coarse-to-fine paradigm, this Transformer-based module leverages factorized spatio-temporal contexts to estimate a corrective residual, effectively recovering occluded targets. Extensive experiments on the TrackNetV2 dataset demonstrate that TrackNetV5 achieves a new state-of-the-art F1-score of 0.9859 and an accuracy of 0.9733, significantly outperforming previous versions. Notably, this performance leap is achieved with a marginal 3.7% increase in FLOPs compared to V4, maintaining real-time inference capabilities while delivering superior tracking precision.</p></details> |  |

We analysed TFN in post-kidney transplant (KTx) care, with a retrospective cohort of 3382 patients, on three key outcomes: graft loss, graft rejection, and mortality. Compared to state-of-the-art model in post KTx care, TFN achieved higher performance for graft loss (AUC 0.96 vs. 0.94) and graft rejection (AUC 0.84 vs. 0.74). In mortality prediction, TFN yielded an AUC of 0.86. TFN outperformed unimodal baselines (approx 10% AUC improvement over time series only baseline, approx 5% AUC improvement over time series with static patient data). Integrating clinical text improved performance across all tasks. Disentanglement metrics confirmed robust and interpretable latent factors in the embedding space, and SHAP-based attributions confirmed alignment with clinical reasoning. TFN has potential application in clinical tasks beyond KTx, where heterogeneous data sources, irregular longitudinal data, and rich narrative documentation are available.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 9 figures, 3 tables.

Diagnostic complexity arises from visual symptom overlap with conditions like age-related macular degeneration and hypertensive retinopathy, exacerbated by high misdiagnosis rates in underserved regions. This study introduces TIMM-ProRS, a novel deep learning framework integrating Vision Transformer (ViT), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Graph Neural Network (GNN) with multi-modal fusion. TIMM-ProRS uniquely leverages both retinal images and temporal biomarkers (HbA1c, retinal thickness) to capture multi-modal and temporal dynamics. Evaluated comprehensively across diverse datasets including APTOS 2019 (trained), Messidor-2, RFMiD, EyePACS, and Messidor-1 (validated), the model achieves 97.8\% accuracy and an F1-score of 0.96, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance and outperforming existing methods like RSG-Net and DeepDR.

These approaches suffer from coordination overhead that scales poorly with agent count and task complexity. We propose a fundamentally different paradigm inspired by natural coordination mechanisms: agents operate locally on a shared artifact, guided only by pressure gradients derived from measurable quality signals, with temporal decay preventing premature convergence. We formalize this as optimization over a pressure landscape and prove convergence guarantees under mild conditions. Empirically, on Latin Square constraint satisfaction across 1,078 trials, pressure-field coordination matches hierarchical control (38.2% vs 38.8% aggregate solve rate, p=0.94, indicating statistical equivalence). Both significantly outperform sequential (23.3%), random (11.7%), and conversation-based multi-agent dialogue (8.6%, p<0.00001). Temporal decay is essential: disabling it increases final pressure 49-fold (d=4.15). On easy problems, pressure-field achieves 87% solve rate. The approach maintains consistent performance from 2 to 32 agents. Our key finding: implicit coordination through shared pressure gradients achieves parity with explicit hierarchical control while dramatically outperforming explicit dialogue-based coordination. This suggests that constraint-driven emergence offers a simpler, equally effective foundation for multi-agent AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 9 tables.

| **[STO-RL: Offline RL under Sparse Rewards via LLM-Guided Subgoal Temporal Order](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08107v1)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline reinforcement learning (RL) enables policy learning from pre-collected datasets, avoiding costly and risky online interactions, but it often struggles with long-horizon tasks involving sparse rewards. Existing goal-conditioned and hierarchical offline RL methods decompose such tasks and generate intermediate rewards to mitigate limitations of traditional offline RL, but usually overlook temporal dependencies among subgoals and rely on imprecise reward shaping, leading to suboptimal policies. To address these issues, we propose STO-RL (Offline RL using LLM-Guided Subgoal Temporal Order), an offline RL framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate temporally ordered subgoal sequences and corresponding state-to-subgoal-stage mappings. Using this temporal structure, STO-RL applies potential-based reward shaping to transform sparse terminal rewards into dense, temporally consistent signals, promoting subgoal progress while avoiding suboptimal solutions. The resulting augmented dataset with shaped rewards enables efficient offline training of high-performing policies. Evaluations on four discrete and continuous sparse-reward benchmarks demonstrate that STO-RL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art offline goal-conditioned and hierarchical RL baselines, achieving faster convergence, higher success rates, and shorter trajectories. Ablation studies further confirm STO-RL's robustness to imperfect or noisy LLM-generated subgoal sequences, demonstrating that LLM-guided subgoal temporal structures combined with theoretically grounded reward shaping provide a practical and scalable solution for long-horizon offline RL.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (AAMAS 2026)</p></details> |
| **[Temporal-Aligned Meta-Learning for Risk Management: A Stacking Approach for Multi-Source Credit Scoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07588v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a meta-learning framework for credit risk assessment of Italian Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) that explicitly addresses the temporal misalignment of credit scoring models. The approach aligns financial statement reference dates with evaluation dates, mitigating bias arising from publication delays and asynchronous data sources. It is based on a two-step temporal decomposition that at first estimates annual probabilities of default (PDs) anchored to balance-sheet reference dates (December 31st) through a static model. Then it models the monthly evolution of PDs using higher-frequency behavioral data. Finally, we employ stacking-based architecture to aggregate multiple scoring systems, each capturing complementary aspects of default risk, into a unified predictive model. In this way, first level model outputs are treated as learned representations that encode non-linear relationships in financial and behavioral indicators, allowing integration of new expert-based features without retraining base models. This design provides a coherent and interpretable solution to challenges typical of low-default environments, including heterogeneous default definitions and reporting delays. Empirical validation shows that the framework effectively captures credit risk evolution over time, improving temporal consistency and predictive stability relative to standard ensemble methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[TFEC: Multivariate Time-Series Clustering via Temporal-Frequency Enhanced Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07550v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate Time-Series (MTS) clustering is crucial for signal processing and data analysis. Although deep learning approaches, particularly those leveraging Contrastive Learning (CL), are prominent for MTS representation, existing CL-based models face two key limitations: 1) neglecting clustering information during positive/negative sample pair construction, and 2) introducing unreasonable inductive biases, e.g., destroying time dependence and periodicity through augmentation strategies, compromising representation quality. This paper, therefore, proposes a Temporal-Frequency Enhanced Contrastive (TFEC) learning framework. To preserve temporal structure while generating low-distortion representations, a temporal-frequency Co-EnHancement (CoEH) mechanism is introduced. Accordingly, a synergistic dual-path representation and cluster distribution learning framework is designed to jointly optimize cluster structure and representation fidelity. Experiments on six real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate TFEC's superiority, achieving 4.48% average NMI gains over SOTA methods, with ablation studies validating the design. The code of the paper is available at: https://github.com/yueliangy/TFEC.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICASSP 2026</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Dialogue Time: Temporal Semantic Memory for Personalized LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07468v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Memory enables Large Language Model (LLM) agents to perceive, store, and use information from past dialogues, which is essential for personalization. However, existing methods fail to properly model the temporal dimension of memory in two aspects: 1) Temporal inaccuracy: memories are organized by dialogue time rather than their actual occurrence time; 2) Temporal fragmentation: existing methods focus on point-wise memory, losing durative information that captures persistent states and evolving patterns. To address these limitations, we propose Temporal Semantic Memory (TSM), a memory framework that models semantic time for point-wise memory and supports the construction and utilization of durative memory. During memory construction, it first builds a semantic timeline rather than a dialogue one. Then, it consolidates temporally continuous and semantically related information into a durative memory. During memory utilization, it incorporates the query's temporal intent on the semantic timeline, enabling the retrieval of temporally appropriate durative memories and providing time-valid, duration-consistent context to support response generation. Experiments on LongMemEval and LoCoMo show that TSM consistently outperforms existing methods and achieves up to 12.2% absolute improvement in accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Convolutional Forward Model for Passive Acoustic Mapping and Temporal Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07356v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Passive acoustic mapping (PAM) is a key imaging technique for characterizing cavitation activity in therapeutic ultrasound applications. Recent model-based beamforming algorithms offer high reconstruction quality and strong physical interpretability. However, their computational burden and limited temporal resolution restrict their use in applications with time-evolving cavitation. To address these challenges, we introduce a PAM beamforming framework based on a novel convolutional formulation in the time domain, which enables efficient computation. In this framework, PAM is formulated as an inverse problem in which the forward operator maps spatiotemporal cavitation activity to recorded radio-frequency signals accounting for time-of-flight delays defined by the acquisition geometry. We then formulate a regularized inversion algorithm that incorporates prior knowledge on cavitation activity. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms classical beamforming methods, providing higher temporal resolution than frequency-domain techniques while substantially reducing computational burden compared with iterative time-domain formulations.</p></details> |  |
| **[BEAT-Net: Injecting Biomimetic Spatio-Temporal Priors for Interpretable ECG Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07316v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although deep learning has advanced automated electrocardiogram (ECG) diagnosis, prevalent supervised methods typically treat recordings as undifferentiated one-dimensional (1D) signals or two-dimensional (2D) images. This formulation compels models to learn physiological structures implicitly, resulting in data inefficiency and opacity that diverge from medical reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose BEAT-Net, a Biomimetic ECG Analysis with Tokenization framework that reformulates the problem as a language modeling task. Utilizing a QRS tokenization strategy to transform continuous signals into biologically aligned heartbeat sequences, the architecture explicitly decomposes cardiac physiology through specialized encoders that extract local beat morphology while normalizing spatial lead perspectives and modeling temporal rhythm dependencies. Evaluations across three large-scale benchmarks demonstrate that BEAT-Net matches the diagnostic accuracy of dominant convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures while substantially improving robustness. The framework exhibits exceptional data efficiency, recovering fully supervised performance using only 30 to 35 percent of annotated data. Moreover, learned attention mechanisms provide inherent interpretability by spontaneously reproducing clinical heuristics, such as Lead II prioritization for rhythm analysis, without explicit supervision. These findings indicate that integrating biological priors offers a computationally efficient and interpretable alternative to data-intensive large-scale pre-training.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures and 2 tables</p></details> |

To facilitate the development of fine-grained spatial and temporal localization capabilities, we curate LoomData-8.7k, a human-centric video dataset with temporally grounded and spatially localized captions. With this, VideoLoom achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance across a variety of spatial and temporal benchmarks (e.g., 63.1 J&F on ReVOS for referring video object segmentation, and 48.3 R1@0.7 on Charades-STA for temporal grounding). In addition, we introduce LoomBench, a novel benchmark consisting of temporal, spatial, and compositional video-question pairs, enabling a comprehensive evaluation of Video LLMs from diverse aspects. Collectively, these contributions offer a universal and effective suite for joint spatial-temporal video understanding, setting a new standard in multimodal intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[SIGNL: A Label-Efficient Audio Deepfake Detection System via Spectral-Temporal Graph Non-Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04942v2)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Audio deepfake detection is increasingly important as synthetic speech becomes more realistic and accessible. Recent methods, including those using graph neural networks (GNNs) to model frequency and temporal dependencies, show strong potential but need large amounts of labeled data, which limits their practical use. Label-efficient alternatives like graph-based non-contrastive learning offer a potential solution, as they can learn useful representations from unlabeled data without using negative samples. However, current graph non-contrastive approaches are built for single-view graph representations and cannot be directly used for audio, which has unique spectral and temporal structures. Bridging this gap requires dual-view graph modeling suited to audio signals. In this work, we introduce SIGNL (Spectral-temporal vIsion Graph Non-contrastive Learning), a label-efficient expert system for detecting audio deepfakes. SIGNL operates on the visual representation of audio, such as spectrograms or other time-frequency encodings, transforming them into spectral and temporal graphs for structured feature extraction. It then employs graph convolutional encoders to learn complementary frequency-time features, effectively capturing the unique characteristics of audio. These encoders are pre-trained using a non-contrastive self-supervised learning strategy on augmented graph pairs, enabling effective representation learning without labeled data. The resulting encoders are then fine-tuned on minimal labelled data for downstream deepfake detection. SIGNL achieves strong performance on multiple audio deepfake detection benchmarks, including 7.88% EER on ASVspoof 2021 DF and 3.95% EER on ASVspoof 5 using only 5% labeled data. It also generalizes well to unseen conditions, reaching 10.16% EER on the In-The-Wild dataset when trained on CFAD.</p></details> |  |
| **[TagSpeech: End-to-End Multi-Speaker ASR and Diarization with Fine-Grained Temporal Grounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06896v1)** | 2026-01-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present TagSpeech, a unified LLM-based framework that utilizes Temporal Anchor Grounding for joint multi-speaker ASR and diarization. The framework is built on two key designs: (1) decoupled semantic and speaker streams fine-tuned via Serialized Output Training (SOT) to learn turn-taking dynamics; and (2) an interleaved time anchor mechanism that not only supports fine-grained timestamp prediction but also acts as a synchronization signal between semantic understanding and speaker tracking. Compared to previous works that primarily focus on speaker-attributed ASR or implicit diarization, TagSpeech addresses the challenge of fine-grained speaker-content alignment and explicitly models "who spoke what and when" in an end-to-end manner. Experiments on AMI and AliMeeting benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves consistent improvements in Diarization Error Rate (DER) over strong end-to-end baselines, including Qwen-Omni and Gemini, particularly in handling complex speech overlaps. Moreover, TagSpeech employs a parameter-efficient training paradigm in which the LLM backbone is frozen and only lightweight projectors are trained, resulting in strong performance with low computational cost.</p></details> |  |
| **[U-MASK: User-adaptive Spatio-Temporal Masking for Personalized Mobile AI Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06867v1)** | 2026-01-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Personalized mobile artificial intelligence applications are widely deployed, yet they are expected to infer user behavior from sparse and irregular histories under a continuously evolving spatio-temporal context. This setting induces a fundamental tension among three requirements, i.e., immediacy to adapt to recent behavior, stability to resist transient noise, and generalization to support long-horizon prediction and cold-start users. Most existing approaches satisfy at most two of these requirements, resulting in an inherent impossibility triangle in data-scarce, non-stationary personalization. To address this challenge, we model mobile behavior as a partially observed spatio-temporal tensor and unify short-term adaptation, long-horizon forecasting, and cold-start recommendation as a conditional completion problem, where a user- and task-specific mask specifies which coordinates are treated as evidence. We propose U-MASK, a user-adaptive spatio-temporal masking method that allocates evidence budgets based on user reliability and task sensitivity. To enable mask generation under sparse observations, U-MASK learns a compact, task-agnostic user representation from app and location histories via U-SCOPE, which serves as the sole semantic conditioning signal. A shared diffusion transformer then performs mask-guided generative completion while preserving observed evidence, so personalization and task differentiation are governed entirely by the mask and the user representation. Experiments on real-world mobile datasets demonstrate consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods across short-term prediction, long-horizon forecasting, and cold-start settings, with the largest gains under severe data sparsity. The code and dataset will be available at https://github.com/NICE-HKU/U-MASK.</p></details> | 18 pages, 9 figures |
| **[TLRN: Temporal Latent Residual Networks For Large Deformation Image Registration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11219v3)** | 2026-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel approach, termed {\em Temporal Latent Residual Network (TLRN)}, to predict a sequence of deformation fields in time-series image registration. The challenge of registering time-series images often lies in the occurrence of large motions, especially when images differ significantly from a reference (e.g., the start of a cardiac cycle compared to the peak stretching phase). To achieve accurate and robust registration results, we leverage the nature of motion continuity and exploit the temporal smoothness in consecutive image frames. Our proposed TLRN highlights a temporal residual network with residual blocks carefully designed in latent deformation spaces, which are parameterized by time-sequential initial velocity fields. We treat a sequence of residual blocks over time as a dynamic training system, where each block is designed to learn the residual function between desired deformation features and current input accumulated from previous time frames. We validate the effectivenss of TLRN on both synthetic data and real-world cine cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) image videos. Our experimental results shows that TLRN is able to achieve substantially improved registration accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art.

To avoid placing distributional assumptions on the data, in recent years the conformal prediction method has been a popular approach for predictive inference, since it provides distribution-free coverage for any iid or exchangeable data distribution. However, in the time series setting, the strong empirical performance of conformal prediction methods is not well understood, since even short-range temporal dependence is a strong violation of the exchangeability assumption. Using predictors with "memory" -- i.e., predictors that utilize past observations, such as autoregressive models -- further exacerbates this problem. In this work, we examine the theoretical properties of split conformal prediction in the time series setting, including the case where predictors may have memory. Our results bound the loss of coverage of these methods in terms of a new "switch coefficient", measuring the extent to which temporal dependence within the time series creates violations of exchangeability. Our characterization of the coverage probability is sharp over the class of stationary, $β$-mixing processes. Along the way, we introduce tools that may prove useful in analyzing other predictive inference methods for dependent data.</p></details> | <details><summary>v2 ha...</summary><p>v2 has minor changes to the presentation</p></details> |

Leveraging multiple interrelated time series, CIF prediction is typically formulated as a multivariate time series forecasting problem. Despite advances in deep learning-based methods, it remains challenging to capture the fine-grained local-temporal dependencies, dynamic higher-order cross-variable dependencies, and complex multi-frequency patterns for CIF forecasting. To address these issues, we propose a novel model that integrates two parallel modules: 1) one enhances the extraction of local-temporal dependencies under multi-frequency by applying multiple wavelet-based convolutional kernels to overlapping patches of varying lengths; 2) the other captures dynamic cross-variable dependencies under multi-frequency to model how inter-variable relationships evolve across the time-frequency domain. Evaluations on four representative electricity markets from Australia, featuring varying levels of renewable penetration, demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art models. An ablation study further validates the complementary benefits of the two proposed modules. Designed with built-in interpretability, the proposed model also enables better understanding of its predictive behavior, as shown in a case study where it adaptively shifts attention to relevant variables and time intervals during a disruptive event.</p></details> | <details><summary>2026 ...</summary><p>2026 40th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence</p></details> |

Recent studies have shown that directly trained SNNs suffer from severe temporal gradient vanishing and overfitting issues, which fundamentally constrain their performance and generalizability. This paper unveils a temporal regularization training (TRT) memthod, designed to unleash the generalization and performance potential of SNNs through a time-decaying regularization mechanism that prioritizes early timesteps with stronger constraints. We perform theoretical analysis to reveal TRT's ability on mitigating the temporal gradient vanishment. To validate the effectiveness of TRT, we conduct experiments on both static image datasets and dynamic neuromorphic datasets, perform analysis of their results, demonstrating that TRT can effectively mitigate overfitting and help SNNs converge into flatter local minima with better generalizability. Furthermore, we establish a theoretical interpretation of TRT's temporal regularization mechanism by analyzing the temporal information dynamics inside SNNs. We track the Fisher information of SNNs during training process, showing that Fisher information progressively concentrates in early timesteps. The time-decaying regularization mechanism implemented in TRT effectively guides the network to learn robust features in early timesteps with rich information, thereby leading to significant improvements in model generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Elsevier.

| **[Your LLM Agents are Temporally Blind: The Misalignment Between Tool Use Decisions and Human Time Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23853v2)** | 2026-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly used to interact with and execute tasks in dynamic environments. However, a critical yet overlooked limitation of these agents is that they, by default, assume a stationary context, failing to account for the real-world time elapsed between messages. We refer to this as "temporal blindness". This limitation hinders decisions about when to invoke tools, leading agents to either over-rely on stale context and skip needed tool calls, or under-rely on it and redundantly repeat tool calls. To study this challenge, we constructed TicToc, a diverse dataset of multi-turn user-agent message trajectories across 76 scenarios, spanning dynamic environments with high, medium, and low time sensitivity. We collected human preferences between "calling a tool" and "directly answering" on each sample, and evaluated how well LLM tool-calling decisions align with human preferences under varying amounts of elapsed time. Our analysis reveals that existing models display poor alignment with human temporal perception, with no model achieving a normalized alignment rate better than 65% when given time stamp information. We also show that naive, prompt-based alignment techniques have limited effectiveness for most models, but specific post-training alignment can be a viable way to align multi-turn LLM tool use with human temporal perception. Our data and findings provide a first step toward understanding and mitigating temporal blindness, offering insights to foster the development of more time-aware and human-aligned agents.</p></details> |  |

We introduce LookAroundNet, a transformer-based seizure detector that uses a wider temporal window of EEG data to model seizure activity. The seizure detector incorporates EEG signals before and after the segment of interest, reflecting how clinicians use surrounding context when interpreting EEG recordings. We evaluate the proposed method on multiple EEG datasets spanning diverse clinical environments, patient populations, and recording modalities, including routine clinical EEG and long-term ambulatory recordings, in order to study performance across varying data distributions. The evaluation includes publicly available datasets as well as a large proprietary collection of home EEG recordings, providing complementary views of controlled clinical data and unconstrained home-monitoring conditions. Our results show that LookAroundNet achieves strong performance across datasets, generalizes well to previously unseen recording conditions, and operates with computational costs compatible with real-world clinical deployment. The results indicate that extended temporal context, increased training data diversity, and model ensembling are key factors for improving performance. This work contributes to moving automatic seizure detection models toward clinically viable solutions.</p></details> |  |

SPAN features ten cross-calendar temporal reasoning directions, two reasoning types, and two question formats across six calendars. To enable time-variant and contamination-free evaluation, we propose a template-driven protocol for dynamic instance generation that enables assessment on a user-specified Gregorian date. We conduct extensive experiments on both open- and closed-source state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs over a range of dates spanning 100 years from 1960 to 2060. Our evaluations show that these LLMs achieve an average accuracy of only 34.5%, with none exceeding 80%, indicating that this task remains challenging. Through in-depth analysis of reasoning types, question formats, and temporal reasoning directions, we identify two key obstacles for LLMs: Future-Date Degradation and Calendar Asymmetry Bias. To strengthen LLMs' cross-calendar temporal reasoning capability, we further develop an LLM-powered Time Agent that leverages tool-augmented code generation. Empirical results show that Time Agent achieves an average accuracy of 95.31%, outperforming several competitive baselines, highlighting the potential of tool-augmented code generation to advance cross-calendar temporal reasoning. We hope this work will inspire further efforts toward more temporally and culturally adaptive LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the AAAI 2026 conference.

Although several deep temporal clustering algorithms have demonstrated a strong advantage over traditional methods in terms of model learning and clustering results, the accuracy of the few algorithms are not satisfactory. None of the existing algorithms can continuously learn new tasks and deal with the dynamic data effectively and efficiently in the sequential tasks learning. To bridge the gap and tackle these issues, this paper proposes a novel algorithm \textbf{L}ifelong \textbf{D}eep \textbf{T}emporal \textbf{C}lustering (\textbf{LDTC}), which effectively integrates dimensionality reduction and temporal clustering into an end-to-end deep unsupervised learning framework. Using a specifically designed autoencoder and jointly optimizing for both the latent representation and clustering objective, the LDTC can achieve high-quality clustering results. Moreover, unlike any previous work, the LDTC is uniquely equipped with the fully dynamic model expansion and rehearsal-based techniques to effectively learn new tasks and to tackle the dynamic data in the sequential tasks learning without the catastrophic forgetting or degradation of the model accuracy. Experiments on seven real-world multivariate time series datasets show that the LDTC is a promising method for dealing with temporal clustering issues effectively and efficiently.</p></details> |  |
| **[DynaGen: Unifying Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning with Dynamic Subgraphs and Generative Regularization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12669v2)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning (TKGR) aims to complete missing factual elements along the timeline. Depending on the temporal position of the query, the task is categorized into interpolation and extrapolation. Existing interpolation methods typically embed temporal information into individual facts to complete missing historical knowledge, while extrapolation techniques often leverage sequence models over graph snapshots to identify recurring patterns for future event prediction. These methods face two critical challenges: limited contextual modeling in interpolation and cognitive generalization bias in extrapolation. To address these, we propose a unified method for TKGR, dubbed DynaGen. For interpolation, DynaGen dynamically constructs entity-centric subgraphs and processes them with a synergistic dual-branch GNN encoder to capture evolving structural context. For extrapolation, it applies a conditional diffusion process, which forces the model to learn underlying evolutionary principles rather than just superficial patterns, enhancing its ability to predict unseen future events. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets show DynaGen achieves state-of-the-art performance. On average, compared to the second-best models, DynaGen improves the Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) score by 2.61 points for interpolation and 1.45 points for extrapolation.</p></details> |  |

TMRL leverages the nested structure of Matryoshka embeddings to introduce a temporal subspace, enhancing temporal encoding while preserving general semantic representations. Experiments show that TMRL efficiently adapts diverse text embedding models, achieving competitive temporal retrieval and temporal RAG performance compared to prior Matryoshka-based non-temporal methods and prior temporal methods, while enabling flexible accuracy-efficiency trade-offs.</p></details> | 18 pages |
| **[Toward an Integrated Cross-Urban Accident Prevention System: A Multi-Task Spatial-Temporal Learning Framework for Urban Safety Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05521v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of a cross-city accident prevention system is particularly challenging due to the heterogeneity, inconsistent reporting, and inherently clustered, sparse, cyclical, and noisy nature of urban accident data. These intrinsic data properties, combined with fragmented governance and incompatible reporting standards, have long hindered the creation of an integrated, cross-city accident prevention framework. To address this gap, we propose the Mamba Local-ttention Spatial-Temporal Network MLA-STNet, a unified system that formulates accident risk prediction as a multi-task learning problem across multiple cities. MLA-STNet integrates two complementary modules: (i)the Spatio-Temporal Geographical Mamba-Attention (STG-MA), which suppresses unstable spatio-temporal fluctuations and strengthens long-range temporal dependencies; and (ii) the Spatio-Temporal Semantic Mamba-Attention (STS-MA), which mitigates cross-city heterogeneity through a shared-parameter design that jointly trains all cities while preserving individual semantic representation spaces. We validate the proposed framework through 75 experiments under two forecasting scenarios, full-day and high-frequency accident periods, using real-world datasets from New York City and Chicago. Compared with the state-of-the-art baselines, MLA-STNet achieves up to 6% lower RMSE, 8% higher Recall, and 5% higher MAP, while maintaining less than 1% performance variation under 50% input noise. These results demonstrate that MLA-STNet effectively unifies heterogeneous urban datasets within a scalable, robust, and interpretable Cross-City Accident Prevention System, paving the way for coordinated and data-driven urban safety management.</p></details> | 38pages, 18figures |
| **[Causality-Aware Temporal Projection for Video Understanding in Video-LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01804v2)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have shown strong multimodal reasoning capabilities, yet remain challenged by video understanding tasks that require consistent temporal ordering and causal coherence. Many parameter-efficient Video-LLMs rely on unconstrained bidirectional projectors to model inter-frame interactions, which can blur temporal ordering by allowing later frames to influence earlier representations, without explicit architectural mechanisms to respect the directional nature of video reasoning. To address this limitation, we propose V-CORE, a parameter-efficient framework that introduces explicit temporal ordering constraints for video understanding. V-CORE consists of two key components: (1) Learnable Spatial Aggregation (LSA), which adaptively selects salient spatial tokens to reduce redundancy, and (2) a Causality-Aware Temporal Projector (CATP), which enforces structured unidirectional information flow via block-causal attention and a terminal dynamic summary token acting as a causal sink. This design preserves intra-frame spatial interactions while ensuring that temporal information is aggregated in a strictly ordered manner. With 4-bit QLoRA and a frozen LLM backbone, V-CORE can be trained efficiently on a single consumer GPU. Experiments show that V-CORE achieves strong performance on the challenging NExT-QA benchmark, reaching 61.2% accuracy, and remains competitive across MSVD-QA, MSRVTT-QA, and TGIF-QA, with gains concentrated in temporal and causal reasoning subcategories (+3.5% and +5.2% respectively), directly validating the importance of explicit temporal ordering constraints.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Probing Deep into Temporal Profile Makes the Infrared Small Target Detector Much Better](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12766v3)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Infrared small target (IRST) detection is challenging in simultaneously achieving precise, robust, and efficient performance due to extremely dim targets and strong interference. Current learning-based methods attempt to leverage ``more" information from both the spatial and the short-term temporal domains, but suffer from unreliable performance under complex conditions while incurring computational redundancy. In this paper, we explore the ``more essential" information from a more crucial domain for the detection. Through theoretical analysis, we reveal that the global temporal saliency and correlation information in the temporal profile demonstrate significant superiority in distinguishing target signals from other signals. To investigate whether such superiority is preferentially leveraged by well-trained networks, we built the first prediction attribution tool in this field and verified the importance of the temporal profile information. Inspired by the above conclusions, we remodel the IRST detection task as a one-dimensional signal anomaly detection task, and propose an efficient deep temporal probe network (DeepPro) that only performs calculations in the time dimension for IRST detection. We conducted extensive experiments to fully validate the effectiveness of our method. The experimental results are exciting, as our DeepPro outperforms existing state-of-the-art IRST detection methods on widely-used benchmarks with extremely high efficiency, and achieves a significant improvement on dim targets and in complex scenarios. We provide a new modeling domain, a new insight, a new method, and a new performance, which can promote the development of IRST detection.

Some existing VLA approaches attempt to improve action accuracy by explicitly generating linguistic reasoning traces or future visual observations before action execution. However, explicit reasoning typically incurs non-negligible inference latency, which constrains the temporal resolution required for robotic manipulation. Moreover, such reasoning is confined to the linguistic space, imposing a representational bottleneck that struggles to faithfully capture ineffable physical attributes. To mitigate these limitations, we propose LaST$_0$, a framework that enables efficient reasoning before acting through a Latent Spatio-Temporal Chain-of-Thought (CoT), capturing fine-grained physical and robotic dynamics that are often difficult to verbalize. Specifically, we introduce a token-efficient latent CoT space that models future visual dynamics, 3D structural information, and robot proprioceptive states, and further extends these representations across time to enable temporally consistent implicit reasoning trajectories. Furthermore, LaST$_0$ adopts a dual-system architecture implemented via a Mixture-of-Transformers design, where a reasoning expert conducts low-frequency latent inference and an acting expert generates high-frequency actions conditioned on robotics-oriented latent representations. To facilitate coordination, LaST$_0$ is trained with heterogeneous operation frequencies, enabling adaptive switching between reasoning and action inference rates during deployment. Across ten simulated and six real-world manipulation tasks, LaST$_0$ improves mean success rates by 8% and 13% over prior VLA methods, respectively, while achieving substantially faster inference.

This approach, termed Stochastic Latent Differential Inference (SLDI), embeds an Itô SDE in the latent space of a variational autoencoder, allowing for flexible, continuous-time modeling of uncertainty while preserving a principled mathematical foundation. The drift and diffusion terms of the SDE are parameterized by neural networks, enabling data-driven inference and generalizing classical time series models to handle irregular sampling and complex dynamic structure. A central theoretical contribution is the co-parameterization of the adjoint state with a dedicated neural network, forming a coupled forward-backward system that captures not only latent evolution but also gradient dynamics. I introduce a pathwise-regularized adjoint loss and analyze variance-reduced gradient flows through the lens of stochastic calculus, offering new tools for improving training stability in deep latent SDEs. My paper unifies and extends variational inference, continuous-time generative modeling, and control-theoretic optimization, providing a rigorous foundation for future developments in stochastic probabilistic machine learning.</p></details> | 20 pages, 6330 words |

However, existing models predominantly focus on short-horizon predictions and suffer from notorious computational costs and memory consumption when scaling to long-horizon predictions and large graphs. Targeting the above challenges, we present FaST, an effective and efficient framework based on heterogeneity-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoEs) for long-horizon and large-scale STG forecasting, which unlocks one-week-ahead (672 steps at a 15-minute granularity) prediction with thousands of nodes. FaST is underpinned by two key innovations. First, an adaptive graph agent attention mechanism is proposed to alleviate the computational burden inherent in conventional graph convolution and self-attention modules when applied to large-scale graphs. Second, we propose a new parallel MoE module that replaces traditional feed-forward networks with Gated Linear Units (GLUs), enabling an efficient and scalable parallel structure. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that FaST not only delivers superior long-horizon predictive accuracy but also achieves remarkable computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Conventional 3D methods detect lanes from dense birds-eye-viewed (BEV) features, though erroneous transformations often result in a poor feature representation misaligned with the true 3D road surface. While recent sparse lane detectors have surpassed dense BEV approaches, they completely disregard valuable lane-specific priors. Furthermore, existing methods fail to utilize historic lane observations, which yield the potential to resolve ambiguities in situations of poor visibility. To address these challenges, we present SparseLaneSTP, a novel method that integrates both geometric properties of the lane structure and temporal information into a sparse lane transformer. It introduces a new lane-specific spatio-temporal attention mechanism, a continuous lane representation tailored for sparse architectures as well as temporal regularization. Identifying weaknesses of existing 3D lane datasets, we also introduce a precise and consistent 3D lane dataset using a simple yet effective auto-labeling strategy. Our experimental section proves the benefits of our contributions and demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across all detection and error metrics on existing 3D lane detection benchmarks as well as on our novel dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) 2025</p></details> |

Existing approaches have achieved notable advancements in SITS segmentation with predetermined sequence lengths. However, we found that these approaches overlooked the generalization capability of models across scenarios with varying temporal length, leading to markedly poor segmentation results in such cases. To address this issue, we propose TEA, a TEmporal Adaptive SITS semantic segmentation method to enhance the model's resilience under varying sequence lengths. We introduce a teacher model that encapsulates the global sequence knowledge to guide a student model with adaptive temporal input lengths. Specifically, teacher shapes the student's feature space via intermediate embedding, prototypes and soft label perspectives to realize knowledge transfer, while dynamically aggregating student model to mitigate knowledge forgetting. Finally, we introduce full-sequence reconstruction as an auxiliary task to further enhance the quality of representations across inputs of varying temporal lengths. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method brings remarkable improvements across inputs of different temporal lengths on common benchmarks.

While useful for arithmetic, programming, and problem solving, this design is costly, blurs claim level auditability, and cannot re-trigger explicit reasoning once the model begins presenting. Dialogue models are also largely blind to temporal structure, treating replies after seconds and replies after weeks as equivalent unless time is stated in text. We introduce TIME, the Temporally Intelligent Meta-reasoning Engine, a behavioral alignment framework that treats explicit reasoning as a context sensitive resource driven by discourse and temporal cues. TIME augments dialogue with optional ISO 8601 <time> tags, tick turns that represent silent gaps, and short <think> blocks that can appear anywhere in a reply. A four-phase curriculum including a small, maximally diverse full-batch alignment step trains Qwen3 dense models to invoke brief, in-place reasoning bursts and keep user facing text compact. We evaluate with TIMEBench, a temporally grounded dialogue benchmark probing chronology, commonsense under gaps and offsets, anomaly detection, and continuity. Across 4B to 32B scales, TIME improves TIMEBench scores over base Qwen3 in both thinking and no-thinking modes while reducing reasoning tokens by about an order of magnitude.

So, we need to quickly find a new safe plan. Replanning only the delayed agent often does not result in an efficient plan, and sometimes cannot even yield a feasible plan. On the other hand, replanning other agents may lead to a cascade of changes and delays. We show how to efficiently replan by tracking and using the temporal flexibility of other agents while avoiding cascading delays. This flexibility is the maximum delay an agent can take without changing the order of or further delaying more agents. Our algorithm, FlexSIPP, precomputes all possible plans for the delayed agent, also returning the changes for the other agents, for any single-agent delay within the given scenario. We demonstrate our method in a real-world case study of replanning trains in the densely-used Dutch railway network. Our experiments show that FlexSIPP provides effective solutions, relevant to real-world adjustments, and within a reasonable timeframe.</p></details> |  |

Existing mitigation strategies, such as textual filtering or random video perturbations, often fail to address the root cause: over-reliance on language priors rather than fine-grained visual dynamics. We propose a scalable framework for counterfactual video generation that synthesizes videos differing only in actions or temporal structure while preserving scene context. Our pipeline combines multimodal LLMs for action proposal and editing guidance with diffusion-based image and video models to generate semantic hard negatives at scale. Using this framework, we build CounterVid, a synthetic dataset of ~26k preference pairs targeting action recognition and temporal reasoning. We further introduce MixDPO, a unified Direct Preference Optimization approach that jointly leverages textual and visual preferences. Fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL with MixDPO yields consistent improvements, notably in temporal ordering, and transfers effectively to standard video hallucination benchmarks. Code and models will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |

It serves as a cornerstone for achieving high-level autonomous driving. However, current approaches remain inadequate for accurately modeling the complex spatiotemporal interdependencies and the unpredictable variability of human driving behavior. To address these challenges, we propose CaTFormer, a causal Temporal Transformer that explicitly models causal interactions between driver behavior and environmental context for robust intention prediction. Specifically, CaTFormer introduces a novel Reciprocal Delayed Fusion (RDF) mechanism for precise temporal alignment of interior and exterior feature streams, a Counterfactual Residual Encoding (CRE) module that systematically eliminates spurious correlations to reveal authentic causal dependencies, and an innovative Feature Synthesis Network (FSN) that adaptively synthesizes these purified representations into coherent temporal representations. Experimental results demonstrate that CaTFormer attains state-of-the-art performance on the Brain4Cars dataset. It effectively captures complex causal temporal dependencies and enhances both the accuracy and transparency of driving intention prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2026</p></details> |

However, the asynchronous sampling and irregular intervals inherent to IMTS pose two core challenges for existing methods: (1) how to accurately represent the raw information of irregular time series without introducing data distortion, and (2) how to effectively capture the complex dynamic dependencies between observation points. To address these challenges, we propose the Adaptive Spatio-Temporal Graph Interaction (ASTGI) framework. Specifically, the framework first employs a Spatio-Temporal Point Representation module to encode each discrete observation as a point within a learnable spatio-temporal embedding space. Second, a Neighborhood-Adaptive Graph Construction module adaptively builds a causal graph for each point in the embedding space via nearest neighbor search. Subsequently, a Spatio-Temporal Dynamic Propagation module iteratively updates information on these adaptive causal graphs by generating messages and computing interaction weights based on the relative spatio-temporal positions between points. Finally, a Query Point-based Prediction module generates the final forecast by aggregating neighborhood information for a new query point and performing regression. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that ASTGI outperforms various state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging Temporal and Textual Modalities: A Multimodal Framework for Automated Cloud Failure Root Cause Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04709v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Root cause analysis in modern cloud infrastructure demands sophisticated understanding of heterogeneous data sources, particularly time-series performance metrics that involve core failure signatures. While large language models demonstrate remarkable capabilities in textual reasoning, their discrete token-based architecture creates fundamental incompatibilities with continuous numerical sequences exhibiting temporal dependencies. Current methodologies inadequately address this modality mismatch, constraining the potential of language model-driven automation in incident management workflows. This paper presents a multimodal diagnostic framework that harmonizes time-series representations with pretrained language model embedding spaces. Our approach contributes three technical advances: (1) a semantic compression technique that distills temporal segments into single-token abstractions while preserving pattern semantics, (2) an alignment encoder utilizing gated cross-attention to project time-series features into language model latent space, and (3) a retrieval-augmented diagnostic pipeline that synthesizes aligned embeddings with historical incident knowledge for expert-level failure attribution. Comprehensive evaluation across six cloud system benchmarks demonstrates that our framework achieves leading performance, reaching 48.75% diagnostic accuracy with notable improvements on scenarios involving compound failure modes. The results validate embedding-space alignment as an effective strategy for enabling language models to reason over multimodal telemetry data in production incident response contexts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial-Temporal Feedback Diffusion Guidance for Controlled Traffic Imputation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04572v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imputing missing values in spatial-temporal traffic data is essential for intelligent transportation systems. Among advanced imputation methods, score-based diffusion models have demonstrated competitive performance. These models generate data by reversing a noising process, using observed values as conditional guidance. However, existing diffusion models typically apply a uniform guidance scale across both spatial and temporal dimensions, which is inadequate for nodes with high missing data rates. Sparse observations provide insufficient conditional guidance, causing the generative process to drift toward the learned prior distribution rather than closely following the conditional observations, resulting in suboptimal imputation performance. To address this, we propose FENCE, a spatial-temporal feedback diffusion guidance method designed to adaptively control guidance scales during imputation. First, FENCE introduces a dynamic feedback mechanism that adjusts the guidance scale based on the posterior likelihood approximations. The guidance scale is increased when generated values diverge from observations and reduced when alignment improves, preventing overcorrection. Second, because alignment to observations varies across nodes and denoising steps, a global guidance scale for all nodes is suboptimal. FENCE computes guidance scales at the cluster level by grouping nodes based on their attention scores, leveraging spatial-temporal correlations to provide more accurate guidance. Experimental results on real-world traffic datasets show that FENCE significantly enhances imputation accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[GEnSHIN: Graphical Enhanced Spatio-temporal Hierarchical Inference Network for Traffic Flow Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04550v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the acceleration of urbanization, intelligent transportation systems have an increasing demand for accurate traffic flow prediction. This paper proposes a novel Graph Enhanced Spatio-temporal Hierarchical Inference Network (GEnSHIN) to handle the complex spatio-temporal dependencies in traffic flow prediction. The model integrates three innovative designs: 1) An attention-enhanced Graph Convolutional Recurrent Unit (GCRU), which strengthens the modeling capability for long-term temporal dependencies by introducing Transformer modules; 2) An asymmetric dual-embedding graph generation mechanism, which leverages the real road network and data-driven latent asymmetric topology to generate graph structures that better fit the characteristics of actual traffic flow; 3) A dynamic memory bank module, which utilizes learnable traffic pattern prototypes to provide personalized traffic pattern representations for each sensor node, and introduces a lightweight graph updater during the decoding phase to adapt to dynamic changes in road network states. Extensive experiments on the public dataset METR-LA show that GEnSHIN achieves or surpasses the performance of comparative models across multiple metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). Notably, the model demonstrates excellent prediction stability during peak morning and evening traffic hours. Ablation experiments further validate the effectiveness of each core module and its contribution to the final performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[FluencyVE: Marrying Temporal-Aware Mamba with Bypass Attention for Video Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21015v2)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale text-to-image diffusion models have achieved unprecedented success in image generation and editing. However, extending this success to video editing remains challenging. Recent video editing efforts have adapted pretrained text-to-image models by adding temporal attention mechanisms to handle video tasks. Unfortunately, these methods continue to suffer from temporal inconsistency issues and high computational overheads. In this study, we propose FluencyVE, which is a simple yet effective one-shot video editing approach. FluencyVE integrates the linear time-series module, Mamba, into a video editing model based on pretrained Stable Diffusion models, replacing the temporal attention layer. This enables global frame-level attention while reducing the computational costs. In addition, we employ low-rank approximation matrices to replace the query and key weight matrices in the causal attention, and use a weighted averaging technique during training to update the attention scores. This approach significantly preserves the generative power of the text-to-image model while effectively reducing the computational burden. Experiments and analyses demonstrate promising results in editing various attributes, subjects, and locations in real-world videos.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Multimedia (TMM)</p></details> |
| **[ToTMNet: FFT-Accelerated Toeplitz Temporal Mixing Network for Lightweight Remote Photoplethysmography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04159v1)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) estimates a blood volume pulse (BVP) waveform from facial videos captured by commodity cameras. Although recent deep models improve robustness compared to classical signal-processing approaches, many methods increase computational cost and parameter count, and attention-based temporal modeling introduces quadratic scaling with respect to the temporal length. This paper proposes ToTMNet, a lightweight rPPG architecture that replaces temporal attention with an FFT-accelerated Toeplitz temporal mixing layer. The Toeplitz operator provides full-sequence temporal receptive field using a linear number of parameters in the clip length and can be applied in near-linear time using circulant embedding and FFT-based convolution. ToTMNet integrates the global Toeplitz temporal operator into a compact gated temporal mixer that combines a local depthwise temporal convolution branch with gated global Toeplitz mixing, enabling efficient long-range temporal filtering while only having 63k parameters. Experiments on two datasets, UBFC-rPPG (real videos) and SCAMPS (synthetic videos), show that ToTMNet achieves strong heart-rate estimation accuracy with a compact design. On UBFC-rPPG intra-dataset evaluation, ToTMNet reaches 1.055 bpm MAE with Pearson correlation 0.996. In a synthetic-to-real setting (SCAMPS to UBFC-rPPG), ToTMNet reaches 1.582 bpm MAE with Pearson correlation 0.994. Ablation results confirm that the gating mechanism is important for effectively using global Toeplitz mixing, especially under domain shift. The main limitation of this preprint study is the use of only two datasets; nevertheless, the results indicate that Toeplitz-structured temporal mixing is a practical and efficient alternative to attention for rPPG.</p></details> |  |

This study proposes an explainable deep learning framework that integrates continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data with laboratory profiles to learn multimodal temporal embeddings of individual metabolic status. Temporal dependencies across modalities are modeled using a transformer encoder, while latent metabolic phenotypes are identified via Gaussian mixture modeling. Model interpretability is achieved through transformer attention visualization and SHAP-based feature attribution. Five latent metabolic phenotypes, ranging from metabolic stability to elevated cardiometabolic risk, were identified among 577 individuals with T1D. These phenotypes exhibit distinct biochemical profiles, including differences in glycemic control, lipid metabolism, renal markers, and thyrotropin (TSH) levels. Attention analysis highlights glucose variability as a dominant temporal factor, while SHAP analysis identifies HbA1c, triglycerides, cholesterol, creatinine, and TSH as key contributors to phenotype differentiation. Phenotype membership shows statistically significant, albeit modest, associations with hypertension, myocardial infarction, and heart failure. Overall, this explainable multimodal temporal embedding framework reveals physiologically coherent metabolic subgroups in T1D and supports risk stratification beyond single biomarkers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Machine Learning Model Integration with Open World Temporal Logic for Process Automation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17776v3)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Machine Learning (ML) have produced models that extract structured information from complex data. However, a significant challenge lies in translating these perceptual or extractive outputs into actionable and explainable decisions within complex operational workflows. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel approach that integrates the outputs of various machine learning models directly with the PyReason framework, an open-world temporal logic programming reasoning engine. PyReason's foundation in generalized annotated logic allows for the incorporation of real-valued outputs (e.g., probabilities, confidence scores) from a diverse set of ML models, treating them as truth intervals within its logical framework. Crucially, PyReason provides mechanisms, implemented in Python, to continuously poll ML model outputs, convert them into logical facts, and dynamically recompute the minimal model to enable decision-making in real-time. Furthermore, its native support for temporal reasoning, knowledge graph integration, and fully explainable interface traces enables an analysis of time-sensitive process data and existing organizational knowledge. By combining the strengths of perception and extraction from ML models with the logical deduction and transparency of PyReason, we aim to create a powerful system for automating complex processes. This integration is well suited for use cases in numerous domains, including manufacturing, healthcare, and business operations.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings ICLP 2025, arXiv:2601.00047</p></details> |
| **[Predictable Gradient Manifolds in Deep Learning: Temporal Path-Length and Intrinsic Rank as a Complexity Regime](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04270v1)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning optimization exhibits structure that is not captured by worst-case gradient bounds. Empirically, gradients along training trajectories are often temporally predictable and evolve within a low-dimensional subspace. In this work we formalize this observation through a measurable framework for predictable gradient manifolds. We introduce two computable quantities: a prediction-based path length that measures how well gradients can be forecast from past information, and a predictable rank that quantifies the intrinsic temporal dimension of gradient increments. We show how classical online and nonconvex optimization guarantees can be restated so that convergence and regret depend explicitly on these quantities, rather than on worst-case variation. Across convolutional networks, vision transformers, language models, and synthetic control tasks, we find that gradient trajectories are locally predictable and exhibit strong low-rank structure over time. These properties are stable across architectures and optimizers, and can be diagnosed directly from logged gradients using lightweight random projections. Our results provide a unifying lens for understanding optimization dynamics in modern deep learning, reframing standard training as operating in a low-complexity temporal regime. This perspective suggests new directions for adaptive optimizers, rank-aware tracking, and prediction-based algorithm design grounded in measurable properties of real training runs.</p></details> | 12 Pages.

Our approach includes a visual encoder for mapping a long-term video into features which are time-aware and contain both local and global cues. It first divides an input video into short-term clips, which are jointly encoded with timestamps and fused across overlapping temporal windows into time-sensitive local features. Next, the local features are passed through a bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) module for global feature aggregation. Moreover, to facilitate the evaluation of TemporalVLM, we present a large-scale long video dataset of industry assembly processes, namely IndustryASM, consisting of videos recorded on factory floors with actions and timestamps annotated by industrial engineers for time and motion studies and temporal action segmentation evaluation. Finally, extensive experiments show that TemporalVLM outperforms previous methods across temporal reasoning and fine-grained understanding tasks, i.e., dense video captioning, temporal video grounding, video highlight detection, and temporal action segmentation. To our best knowledge, our work is the first to incorporate LSTMs into video LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Reason: Temporal Saliency Distillation for Interpretable Knowledge Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04263v1)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge distillation has proven effective for model compression by transferring knowledge from a larger network called the teacher to a smaller network called the student. Current knowledge distillation in time series is predominantly based on logit and feature aligning techniques originally developed for computer vision tasks. These methods do not explicitly account for temporal data and fall short in two key aspects. First, the mechanisms by which the transferred knowledge helps the student model learning process remain unclear due to uninterpretability of logits and features. Second, these methods transfer only limited knowledge, primarily replicating the teacher predictive accuracy. As a result, student models often produce predictive distributions that differ significantly from those of their teachers, hindering their safe substitution for teacher models. In this work, we propose transferring interpretable knowledge by extending conventional logit transfer to convey not just the right prediction but also the right reasoning of the teacher. Specifically, we induce other useful knowledge from the teacher logits termed temporal saliency which captures the importance of each input timestep to the teacher prediction. By training the student with Temporal Saliency Distillation we encourage it to make predictions based on the same input features as the teacher. Temporal Saliency Distillation requires no additional parameters or architecture specific assumptions. We demonstrate that Temporal Saliency Distillation effectively improves the performance of baseline methods while also achieving desirable properties beyond predictive accuracy. We hope our work establishes a new paradigm for interpretable knowledge distillation in time series analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings of the 27th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI 2025), IOS Press</p></details> |

However, existing methods often suffer from temporal inconsistencies, manifesting as flickering effects that degrade temporal coherence and adversely affect downstream decision-making. While recent approaches incorporate historical information to alleviate this issue, they often incur high computational costs and may introduce misaligned or redundant features that interfere with object detection. We propose OccLinker, a novel plugin framework that can be easily integrated into existing VONs to improve performance. Our method efficiently consolidates historical static and motion cues, learns sparse latent correlations with current features through a dual cross-attention mechanism, and generates correction occupancy components to refine the base network predictions. In addition, we introduce a new temporal consistency metric to quantitatively measure flickering effects. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance with minimal computational overhead while effectively reducing flickering artifacts.</p></details> |  |

This capability is vital for high-stakes decision-making in systems such as traffic networks, power grids, and disease propagation. However, the field remains underdeveloped because most existing works prioritize predictive accuracy over reasoning. To address the gap, we introduce ST-Bench, a benchmark consisting of four core tasks, including etiological reasoning, entity identification, correlation reasoning, and in-context forecasting, developed via a network SDE-based multi-agent data synthesis pipeline. We then propose STReasoner, which empowers LLM to integrate time series, graph structure, and text for explicit reasoning. To promote spatially grounded logic, we introduce S-GRPO, a reinforcement learning algorithm that rewards performance gains specifically attributable to spatial information. Experiments show that STReasoner achieves average accuracy gains between 17% and 135% at only 0.004X the cost of proprietary models and generalizes robustly to real-world data.</p></details> | <details><summary>prepr...</summary><p>preprint, we release our code publicly at https://github.com/LingFengGold/STReasoner</p></details> |

However, the nonlinear programs approximating the OCPs are inherently nonconvex due to the coupling between the dynamics and the event timing, and therefore, they are challenging to solve. Most approaches address this challenge by predefining waypoint times or just using nonconvex trajectory optimization, which simplifies the problem but often yields suboptimal solutions. To significantly improve the numerical properties, we propose a formulation with a time-scaling direct multiple shooting scheme that partitions the prediction horizon into segments aligned with characteristic time constraints. Moreover, we develop a fast semidefinite-programming-based convex relaxation that exploits the sparsity pattern of the lifted formulation. Comprehensive simulation studies demonstrate the solution optimality and computational efficiency. Furthermore, real-world experiments on a quadrotor waypoint flight task with constrained open time windows validate the practical applicability of the approach in complex environments.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |

By representing the entire conversation as a temporal graph, we present a novel graph-based method for detecting dialogue-level hallucinations. Our framework models each dialogue as a node, encoding it using a sentence transformer. We explore two different ways of connectivity: i) shared-entity edges, which connect turns that refer to the same entities; ii) temporal edges, which connect contiguous turns in the conversation. Message-passing is used to update the node embeddings, allowing flow of information between related nodes. The context-aware node embeddings are then combined using attention pooling into a single vector, which is then passed on to a classifier to determine the presence and type of hallucinations. We demonstrate that our method offers slightly improved performance over existing methods. Further, we show the attention mechanism can be used to justify the decision making process.

We model the marginal distributions of extreme winter minima using a generalised Pareto distribution (GPD), capturing temporal and spatial non-stationarities in the parameters of the GPD. We investigate two independent temporal non-stationarities in extreme winter minima. We model the long-term trend in magnitude of extreme winter minima as well as short-term, large fluctuations in magnitude caused by anomalous behaviour of the jet stream. We measure magnitudes of spatial events with a carefully chosen risk function and fit an r-Pareto process to extreme events exceeding a high-risk threshold. Our analysis is based on synoptic data observations courtesy of Met Éireann and the Met Office. We show that the frequency of extreme cold winter events is decreasing over the study period. The magnitude of extreme winter events is also decreasing, indicating that winters are warming, and apparently warming at a faster rate than extreme summer temperatures. We also show that extremely cold winter temperatures are warming at a faster rate than non-extreme winter temperatures. We find that a climate model output previously shown to be informative as a covariate for modelling extremely warm summer temperatures is less effective as a covariate for extremely cold winter temperatures. However, we show that the climate model is useful for informing a non-extreme temperature model.</p></details> |  |

Recent state-of-the-art methods leverage large language models (LLMs) to provide detailed moment descriptions for video data. However, existing VideoLLMs remain challenging in identifying precise event boundaries in untrimmed videos, causing the generated captions to be not properly grounded. In this paper, we propose TA-Prompting, which enhances VideoLLMs via Temporal Anchors that learn to precisely localize events and prompt the VideoLLMs to perform temporal-aware video event understanding. During inference, in order to properly determine the output caption sequence from an arbitrary number of events presented within a video, we introduce an event coherent sampling strategy to select event captions with sufficient coherence across temporal events and cross-modal similarity with the given video. Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, we show that our TA-Prompting is favorable against state-of-the-art VideoLLMs, yielding superior performance on dense video captioning and temporal understanding tasks including moment retrieval and temporalQA.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages for main paper (exclude citation pages), 6 pages for appendix, totally 10 figures 7 tables and 2 algorithms.

| **[TiMem: Temporal-Hierarchical Memory Consolidation for Long-Horizon Conversational Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02845v1)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-horizon conversational agents have to manage ever-growing interaction histories that quickly exceed the finite context windows of large language models (LLMs). Existing memory frameworks provide limited support for temporally structured information across hierarchical levels, often leading to fragmented memories and unstable long-horizon personalization. We present TiMem, a temporal--hierarchical memory framework that organizes conversations through a Temporal Memory Tree (TMT), enabling systematic memory consolidation from raw conversational observations to progressively abstracted persona representations. TiMem is characterized by three core properties: (1) temporal--hierarchical organization through TMT; (2) semantic-guided consolidation that enables memory integration across hierarchical levels without fine-tuning; and (3) complexity-aware memory recall that balances precision and efficiency across queries of varying complexity. Under a consistent evaluation setup, TiMem achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on both benchmarks, reaching 75.30% on LoCoMo and 76.88% on LongMemEval-S. It outperforms all evaluated baselines while reducing the recalled memory length by 52.20% on LoCoMo. Manifold analysis indicates clear persona separation on LoCoMo and reduced dispersion on LongMemEval-S. Overall, TiMem treats temporal continuity as a first-class organizing principle for long-horizon memory in conversational agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Immediate Activation: Temporally Decoupled Backdoor Attacks on Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04247v1)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing backdoor attacks on multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting enforce strict temporal and dimensional coupling between triggers and target patterns, requiring synchronous activation at fixed positions across variables. However, realistic scenarios often demand delayed and variable-specific activation. We identify this critical unmet need and propose TDBA, a temporally decoupled backdoor attack framework for MTS forecasting. By injecting triggers that encode the expected location of the target pattern, TDBA enables the activation of the target pattern at any positions within the forecasted data, with the activation position flexibly varying across different variable dimensions. TDBA introduces two core modules: (1) a position-guided trigger generation mechanism that leverages smoothed Gaussian priors to generate triggers that are position-related to the predefined target pattern; and (2) a position-aware optimization module that assigns soft weights based on trigger completeness, pattern coverage, and temporal offset, facilitating targeted and stealthy attack optimization. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that TDBA consistently outperforms existing baselines in effectiveness while maintaining good stealthiness. Ablation studies confirm the controllability and robustness of its design.</p></details> |  |
| **[StableDPT: Temporal Stable Monocular Video Depth Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02793v1)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Applying single image Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) models to video sequences introduces significant temporal instability and flickering artifacts. We propose a novel approach that adapts any state-of-the-art image-based (depth) estimation model for video processing by integrating a new temporal module - trainable on a single GPU in a few days. Our architecture StableDPT builds upon an off-the-shelf Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder and enhances the Dense Prediction Transformer (DPT) head. The core of our contribution lies in the temporal layers within the head, which use an efficient cross-attention mechanism to integrate information from keyframes sampled across the entire video sequence. This allows the model to capture global context and inter-frame relationships leading to more accurate and temporally stable depth predictions. Furthermore, we propose a novel inference strategy for processing videos of arbitrary length avoiding the scale misalignment and redundant computations associated with overlapping windows used in other methods. Evaluations on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate improved temporal consistency, competitive state-of-the-art performance and on top 2x faster processing in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |

This task is shaped by two challenges: Relevance, ensuring alignment with the query's explicit temporal requirements, and Recency, selecting the freshest document among multiple versions. Existing methods often address the two challenges in isolation, relying on brittle heuristics that fail in scenarios where temporal requirements and staleness resistance are intertwined. To address this gap, we introduce Re2Bench, a benchmark specifically designed to disentangle and evaluate Relevance, Recency, and their hybrid combination. Building on this foundation, we propose Re3, a unified and lightweight framework that dynamically balances semantic and temporal information through a query-aware gating mechanism. On Re2Bench, Re3 achieves state-of-the-art results, leading in R@1 across all three subsets. Ablation studies with backbone sensitivity tests confirm robustness, showing strong generalization across diverse encoders and real-world settings. This work provides both a generalizable solution and a principled evaluation suite, advancing the development of temporally aware retrieval systems.

While the cortex exhibits hierarchical Temporal Receptive Windows (TRWs), local circuits often display heterogeneous time constants. To reconcile this, we trained biologically constrained deep networks, based on scale-invariant hippocampal time cells, on a language classification task mimicking the hierarchical structure of language (e.g., 'letters' forming 'words'). First, using a feedforward model (SITHCon), we found that a hierarchy of TRWs emerged naturally across layers, despite the network having an identical spectrum of time constants within layers. We then distilled these inductive priors into a biologically plausible recurrent architecture, SITH-RNN. Training a sequence of architectures ranging from generic RNNs to this restricted subset showed that the scale-invariant SITH-RNN learned faster with orders-of-magnitude fewer parameters, and generalized zero-shot to out-of-distribution timescales. These results suggest the brain employs scale-invariant, sequential priors - coding "what" happened "when" - making recurrent networks with such priors particularly well-suited to describe human cognition.</p></details> |  |

Existing dynamic-depth and layer-skipping methods reduce this cost, but often rely on auxiliary routing mechanisms or incur accuracy degradation when bypassed layers are left uncompensated. We present \textbf{LoRA-Drop}, a plug-and-play inference framework that accelerates decoding by applying a \emph{temporal compute schedule} to a fixed subset of intermediate layers: on most decoding steps, selected layers reuse the previous-token hidden state and apply a low-rank LoRA correction, while periodic \emph{refresh} steps execute the full model to prevent drift. LoRA-Drop requires no routing network, is compatible with standard KV caching, and can reduce KV-cache footprint by skipping KV updates in droppable layers during LoRA steps and refreshing periodically. Across \textbf{LLaMA2-7B}, \textbf{LLaMA3-8B}, \textbf{Qwen2.5-7B}, and \textbf{Qwen2.5-14B}, LoRA-Drop achieves up to \textbf{2.6$\times$ faster decoding} and \textbf{45--55\% KV-cache reduction} while staying within \textbf{0.5 percentage points (pp)} of baseline accuracy. Evaluations on reasoning (GSM8K, MATH, BBH), code generation (HumanEval, MBPP), and long-context/multilingual benchmarks (LongBench, XNLI, XCOPA) identify a consistent \emph{safe zone} of scheduling configurations that preserves quality while delivering substantial efficiency gains, providing a simple path toward adaptive-capacity inference in LLMs. Codes are available at https://github.com/hosseinbv/LoRA-Drop.git.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning and Optimizing the Efficacy of Spatio-Temporal Task Allocation under Temporal and Resource Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02505v1)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Complex multi-robot missions often require heterogeneous teams to jointly optimize task allocation, scheduling, and path planning to improve team performance under strict constraints. We formalize these complexities into a new class of problems, dubbed Spatio-Temporal Efficacy-optimized Allocation for Multi-robot systems (STEAM). STEAM builds upon trait-based frameworks that model robots using their capabilities (e.g., payload and speed), but goes beyond the typical binary success-failure model by explicitly modeling the efficacy of allocations as trait-efficacy maps. These maps encode how the aggregated capabilities assigned to a task determine performance. Further, STEAM accommodates spatio-temporal constraints, including a user-specified time budget (i.e., maximum makespan). To solve STEAM problems, we contribute a novel algorithm named Efficacy-optimized Incremental Task Allocation Graph Search (E-ITAGS) that simultaneously optimizes task performance and respects time budgets by interleaving task allocation, scheduling, and path planning. Motivated by the fact that trait-efficacy maps are difficult, if not impossible, to specify, E-ITAGS efficiently learns them using a realizability-aware active learning module. Our approach is realizability-aware since it explicitly accounts for the fact that not all combinations of traits are realizable by the robots available during learning. Further, we derive experimentally-validated bounds on E-ITAGS' suboptimality with respect to efficacy. Detailed numerical simulations and experiments using an emergency response domain demonstrate that E-ITAGS generates allocations of higher efficacy compared to baselines, while respecting resource and spatio-temporal constraints. We also show that our active learning approach is sample efficient and establishes a principled tradeoff between data and computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>The j...</summary><p>The journal extension version of our conference paper: arXiv:2404.07902, which has been accepted by ISRR 2024</p></details> |

Alpha decay represents a significant challenge, with traditional models such as DeepLOB losing predictive power as the time horizon (k) increases. In this paper, using data from the FI-2010 dataset, we introduce Temporal Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (T-KAN) to replace the fixed, linear weights of standard LSTMs with learnable B-spline activation functions. This allows the model to learn the 'shape' of market signals as opposed to just their magnitude. This resulted in a 19.1% relative improvement in the F1-score at the k = 100 horizon. The efficacy of T-KAN networks cannot be understated, producing a 132.48% return compared to the -82.76% DeepLOB drawdown under 1.0 bps transaction costs. In addition to this, the T-KAN model proves quite interpretable, with the 'dead-zones' being clearly visible in the splines. The T-KAN architecture is also uniquely optimized for low-latency FPGA implementation via High level Synthesis (HLS).

However, despite their high performance, these approaches frequently involve complex training pipelines and a substantial computational burden, limiting the scalability and compatibility of these methods. In this paper, we propose a PrevMatch framework that effectively mitigates the aforementioned limitations by maximizing the utilization of the temporal knowledge obtained during the training process. The PrevMatch framework relies on two core strategies: (1) we reconsider the use of temporal knowledge and thus directly utilize previous models obtained during training to generate additional pseudo-label guidance, referred to as previous guidance. (2) we design a highly randomized ensemble strategy to maximize the effectiveness of the previous guidance. PrevMatch, a simple yet effective plug-in method, can be seamlessly integrated into existing semi-supervised learning frameworks with minimal computational overhead. Experimental results on three benchmark semantic segmentation datasets show that incorporating PrevMatch into existing methods significantly improves their performance. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that PrevMatch facilitates stable optimization during training, resulting in improved generalization performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in WACV 2026.

However, existing patch-based methods typically adopt fixed-length segmentation, overlooking the heterogeneity of local temporal dynamics and the decoding heterogeneity of forecasting. Such designs lose details in information-dense regions, introduce redundancy in stable segments, and fail to capture the distinct complexities of short-term and long-term horizons. We propose TimeMosaic, a forecasting framework that aims to address temporal heterogeneity. TimeMosaic employs adaptive patch embedding to dynamically adjust granularity according to local information density, balancing motif reuse with structural clarity while preserving temporal continuity. In addition, it introduces segment-wise decoding that treats each prediction horizon as a related subtask and adapts to horizon-specific difficulty and information requirements, rather than applying a single uniform decoder. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that TimeMosaic delivers consistent improvements over existing methods, and our model trained on the large-scale corpus with 321 billion observations achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art TSFMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by AAAI</p></details> |
| **[A Spatio-Temporal Deep Learning Approach For High-Resolution Gridded Monsoon Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02445v1)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) is a critical climate phenomenon, fundamentally impacting the agriculture, economy, and water security of over a billion people. Traditional long-range forecasting, whether statistical or dynamical, has predominantly focused on predicting a single, spatially-averaged seasonal value, lacking the spatial detail essential for regional-level resource management. To address this gap, we introduce a novel deep learning framework that reframes gridded monsoon prediction as a spatio-temporal computer vision task. We treat multi-variable, pre-monsoon atmospheric and oceanic fields as a sequence of multi-channel images, effectively creating a video-like input tensor. Using 85 years of ERA5 reanalysis data for predictors and IMD rainfall data for targets, we employ a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based architecture to learn the complex mapping from the five-month pre-monsoon period (January-May) to a high-resolution gridded rainfall pattern for the subsequent monsoon season. Our framework successfully produces distinct forecasts for each of the four monsoon months (June-September) as well as the total seasonal average, demonstrating its utility for both intra-seasonal and seasonal outlooks.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, 2 Tables, to be submitted to "IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing"</p></details> |
| **[Remote Sensing Change Detection via Weak Temporal Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02126v1)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic change detection in remote sensing aims to identify land cover changes between bi-temporal image pairs. Progress in this area has been limited by the scarcity of annotated datasets, as pixel-level annotation is costly and time-consuming. To address this, recent methods leverage synthetic data or generate artificial change pairs, but out-of-domain generalization remains limited. In this work, we introduce a weak temporal supervision strategy that leverages additional temporal observations of existing single-temporal datasets, without requiring any new annotations. Specifically, we extend single-date remote sensing datasets with new observations acquired at different times and train a change detection model by assuming that real bi-temporal pairs mostly contain no change, while pairing images from different locations to generate change examples. To handle the inherent noise in these weak labels, we employ an object-aware change map generation and an iterative refinement process. We validate our approach on extended versions of the FLAIR and IAILD aerial datasets, achieving strong zero-shot and low-data regime performance across different benchmarks. Lastly, we showcase results over large areas in France, highlighting the scalability potential of our method.</p></details> |  |
| **[TD3Net: A temporal densely connected multi-dilated convolutional network for lipreading](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16073v4)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The word-level lipreading approach typically employs a two-stage framework with separate frontend and backend architectures to model dynamic lip movements. Each component has been extensively studied, and in the backend architecture, temporal convolutional networks (TCNs) have been widely adopted in state-of-the-art methods. Recently, dense skip connections have been introduced in TCNs to mitigate the limited density of the receptive field, thereby improving the modeling of complex temporal representations. However, their performance remains constrained owing to potential information loss regarding the continuous nature of lip movements, caused by blind spots in the receptive field. To address this limitation, we propose TD3Net, a temporal densely connected multi-dilated convolutional network that combines dense skip connections and multi-dilated temporal convolutions as the backend architecture. TD3Net covers a wide and dense receptive field without blind spots by applying different dilation factors to skip-connected features. Experimental results on a word-level lipreading task using two large publicly available datasets, Lip Reading in the Wild (LRW) and LRW-1000, indicate that the proposed method achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods. It achieved higher accuracy with fewer parameters and lower floating-point operations compared to existing TCN-based backend architectures. Moreover, visualization results suggest that our approach effectively utilizes diverse temporal features while preserving temporal continuity, presenting notable advantages in lipreading systems.

To study the TR ability in LLMs, prior works provide different ways for evaluating various aspects of TR ability. In this work, we propose an alternative perspective for evaluating TR ability by leveraging Linear Temporal Logic (LTL), and develop a pipeline to automatically synthesize challenges for assessing the TR ability of LLMs. Based on this pipeline, we construct a dataset, namely LTLBench, consisting of $2000$ TR challenges, and benchmark 12 LLMs across 5 different methods. Furthermore, we conduct additional experiments to investigate the impact of increasing the number of formula operators and events on both LLM performance and the complexity of TR problems. We also perform qualitative analyses of their reasoning processes and the effects of varying the number of events and formula operators, which reveal 3 main issues in their temporal reasoning processes and the unexpected performance changes observed as problem complexity increases. We expect this work to provide valuable insights into the TR ability of LLMs.</p></details> |  |

We reconstruct the irregular flow field point set into sequential format compatible with FNO input requirements, and then embed temporal bundling technique within a recurrent neural network (RNN) for multi-step prediction. We further employ a composite loss function to balance errors across different physical quantities. Experiments are conducted on three different types of irregular flow fields, including orthogonal and non-orthogonal grid configurations. Then we comprehensively analyze the physical component loss curves, flow field visualizations, and physical profiles. Results demonstrate that our approach significantly surpasses traditional numerical methods in computational efficiency while achieving high accuracy, with maximum relative $L_2$ errors of (0.78, 0.57, 0.35)% for ($p$, $T$, $\mathbf{u}$) respectively. This verifies that the method can efficiently and accurately simulate the temporal evolution of high-speed compressible flows in irregular domains.</p></details> | 18 pages, 15 figures |
| **[Spatio-temporal modeling and forecasting with Fourier neural operators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01813v1)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal process models are often used for modeling dynamic physical and biological phenomena that evolve across space and time. These phenomena may exhibit environmental heterogeneity and complex interactions that are difficult to capture using traditional statistical process models such as Gaussian processes. This work proposes the use of Fourier neural operators (FNOs) for constructing statistical dynamical spatio-temporal models for forecasting. An FNO is a flexible mapping of functions that approximates the solution operator of possibly unknown linear or non-linear partial differential equations (PDEs) in a computationally efficient manner. It does so using samples of inputs and their respective outputs, and hence explicit knowledge of the underlying PDE is not required. Through simulations from a nonlinear PDE with known solution, we compare FNO forecasts to those from state-of-the-art statistical spatio-temporal-forecasting methods. Further, using sea surface temperature data over the Atlantic Ocean and precipitation data across Europe, we demonstrate the ability of FNO-based dynamic spatio-temporal (DST) statistical modeling to capture complex real-world spatio-temporal dependencies. Using collections of testing instances, we show that the FNO-DST forecasts are accurate with valid uncertainty quantification.</p></details> |  |
| **[DDNet: A Dual-Stream Graph Learning and Disentanglement Framework for Temporal Forgery Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01784v1)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid evolution of AIGC technology enables misleading viewers by tampering mere small segments within a video, rendering video-level detection inaccurate and unpersuasive. Consequently, temporal forgery localization (TFL), which aims to precisely pinpoint tampered segments, becomes critical. However, existing methods are often constrained by \emph{local view}, failing to capture global anomalies. To address this, we propose a \underline{d}ual-stream graph learning and \underline{d}isentanglement framework for temporal forgery localization (DDNet). By coordinating a \emph{Temporal Distance Stream} for local artifacts and a \emph{Semantic Content Stream} for long-range connections, DDNet prevents global cues from being drowned out by local smoothness. Furthermore, we introduce Trace Disentanglement and Adaptation (TDA) to isolate generic forgery fingerprints, alongside Cross-Level Feature Embedding (CLFE) to construct a robust feature foundation via deep fusion of hierarchical features. Experiments on ForgeryNet and TVIL benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by approximately 9\% in AP@0.95, with significant improvements in cross-domain robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Drift in Privacy Recall: Users Misremember From Verbatim Loss to Gist-Based Overexposure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16962v3)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With social media content traversing the different platforms, occasionally resurfacing after periods of time, users are increasingly prone to unintended disclosure resulting from a misremembered acceptance of privacy. Context collapse and interface cues are two factors considered by prior researchers, yet we know less about how time-lapse basically alters recall of past audiences destined for exposure. Likewise, the design space for mitigating this temporal exposure risk remains underexplored. Our work theorizes temporal drift in privacy recall as verbatim memory of prior settings blowing apart and eventually settling with gist-based heuristics, which more often than not select an audience larger than the original one. Grounded in memory research, contextual integrity, and usable privacy, we examine why such a drift occurs, why it tends to bias toward broader sharing, and how it compounds upon repeat exposure. Following that, we suggest provenance-forward interface schemes and a risk-based evaluation framework that mutates recall into recognition. The merit of our work lies in establishing a temporal awareness of privacy design as an essential safety rail against inadvertent overexposure.</p></details> |  |

This study presents a systematic audit of three state of the art models (GPT-5.1, Gemini 3 Pro, and Claude 4.5 Opus) using HausaSafety, a novel adversarial dataset grounded in West African threat scenarios (e.g., Yahoo-Yahoo fraud, Dane gun manufacturing). Employing a 2 x 4 factorial design across 1,440 evaluations, we tested the non-linear interaction between language (English vs. Hausa) and temporal framing. Our results challenge the narrative of the multilingual safety gap. Instead of a simple degradation in low-resource settings, we identified a complex interference mechanism in which safety is determined by the intersection of variables. Although the models exhibited a reverse linguistic vulnerability with Claude 4.5 Opus proving significantly safer in Hausa (45.0%) than in English (36.7%) due to uncertainty-driven refusal, they suffered catastrophic failures in temporal reasoning. We report a profound Temporal Asymmetry, where past-tense framing bypassed defenses (15.6% safe) while future-tense scenarios triggered hyper-conservative refusals (57.2% safe). The magnitude of this volatility is illustrated by a 9.2x disparity between the safest and most vulnerable configurations, proving that safety is not a fixed property but a context-dependent state. We conclude that current models rely on superficial heuristics rather than robust semantic understanding, creating Safety Pockets that leave Global South users exposed to localized harms. We propose Invariant Alignment as a necessary paradigm shift to ensure safety stability across linguistic and temporal shifts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Language Model Distillation: A Temporal Difference Imitation Learning Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20335v4)** | 2026-01-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models have led to significant progress across many NLP tasks, although their massive sizes often incur substantial computational costs. Distillation has become a common practice to compress these large and highly capable models into smaller, more efficient ones. Many existing language model distillation methods can be viewed as behavior cloning from the perspective of imitation learning or inverse reinforcement learning. This viewpoint has inspired subsequent studies that leverage (inverse) reinforcement learning techniques, including variations of behavior cloning and temporal difference learning methods. Rather than proposing yet another specific temporal difference method, we introduce a general framework for temporal difference-based distillation by exploiting the distributional sparsity of the teacher model. Specifically, it is often observed that language models assign most probability mass to a small subset of tokens. Motivated by this observation, we design a temporal difference learning framework that operates on a reduced action space (a subset of vocabulary), and demonstrate how practical algorithms can be derived and the resulting performance improvements.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 2026; Code available at: https://github.com/TobyLeelsz/Bellman-Distillation</p></details> |

However, this task remains challenging due to the complex dysfunctions in the spatio-temporal characteristics of underlying brain networks, which are often overlooked by existing methods. To address these limitations, we develop an interpretable spatio-temporal graph neural network framework to predict future AD progression, leveraging dual Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) to model the irregularly-sampled longitudinal functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. We validate our approach on two independent cohorts, including the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS-3) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Our framework effectively learns sparse regional and connective importance probabilities, enabling the identification of key brain circuit abnormalities associated with disease progression. Notably, we detect the parahippocampal cortex, prefrontal cortex, and parietal lobule as salient regions, with significant disruptions in the ventral attention, dorsal attention, and default mode networks. These abnormalities correlate strongly with longitudinal AD-related clinical symptoms. Moreover, our interpretability strategy reveals both established and novel neural systems-level and sex-specific biomarkers, offering new insights into the neurobiological mechanisms underlying AD progression. Our findings highlight the potential of spatio-temporal graph-based learning for early, individualized prediction of AD progression, even in the context of irregularly-sampled longitudinal imaging data.</p></details> |  |

Conditioning on a single image completely ignores the temporal signature, which leads to pose-locked motions, unnatural warping, and "average" faces when viewpoints and expressions change. To this end, we introduce an identity-conditioned variant of a diffusion-transformer video generator which uses a short reference video rather than a single portrait. Our key idea is to incorporate the dynamics in the reference. A short clip reveals subject-specific patterns, e.g., how smiles form, across poses and lighting. From this clip, a Sinkhorn-routed encoder learns compact identity tokens that capture characteristic dynamics while remaining pretrained backbone-compatible. Despite adding only lightweight conditioning, the approach consistently improves identity retention under large pose changes and expressive facial behavior, while maintaining prompt faithfulness and visual realism across diverse subjects and prompts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Echo State Networks for Spatio-Temporal Area-Level Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10641v2)** | 2026-01-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal area-level datasets play a critical role in official statistics, providing valuable insights for policy-making and regional planning. Accurate modeling and forecasting of these datasets can be extremely useful for policymakers to develop informed strategies for future planning. Echo State Networks (ESNs) are efficient methods for capturing nonlinear temporal dynamics and generating forecasts. However, ESNs lack a direct mechanism to account for the neighborhood structure inherent in area-level data. Ignoring these spatial relationships can significantly compromise the accuracy and utility of forecasts. In this paper, we incorporate approximate graph spectral filters at the input stage of the ESN, thereby improving forecast accuracy while preserving the model's computational efficiency during training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using Eurostat's tourism occupancy dataset and show how it can support more informed decision-making in policy and planning contexts.</p></details> | 23 pages, 4 figures |

With consideration of this, a number of recent neural network models leverage inductive biases from classical mechanics to encourage model interpretability and ensure forecasted states are physical. However, in general, these models are designed to capture the dynamics of a single system with fixed physical parameters, from state-space measurements of a known configuration space. In this paper we introduce Symplectic Phase Space GAN (SPS-GAN) which can capture the dynamics of multiple systems, and generalize to unseen physical parameters from. Moreover, SPS-GAN does not require prior knowledge of the system configuration space. In fact, SPS-GAN can discover the configuration space structure of the system from arbitrary measurement types (e.g., state-space measurements, video frames). To achieve physically plausible generation, we introduce a novel architecture which embeds a Hamiltonian neural network recurrent module in a conditional GAN backbone. To discover the structure of the configuration space, we optimize the conditional time-series GAN objective with an additional physically motivated term to encourages a sparse representation of the configuration space. We demonstrate the utility of SPS-GAN for trajectory prediction, video generation and symmetry discovery. Our approach captures multiple systems and achieves performance on par with supervised models designed for single systems.</p></details> |  |

Existing trajectory planners exhibit systematic failures in these scenarios due to data imbalance. This results in insufficient modelling of vehicle dynamics, road geometry, and environmental constraints in high-risk situations, leading to suboptimal or unsafe trajectory prediction when vehicles operate near their physical limits. In this paper, we introduce ReflexDiffusion, a novel inference-stage framework that enhances diffusion-based trajectory planners through reflective adjustment. Our method introduces a gradient-based adjustment mechanism during the iterative denoising process: after each standard trajectory update, we compute the gradient between the conditional and unconditional noise predictions to explicitly amplify critical conditioning signals, including road curvature and lateral vehicle dynamics. This amplification enforces strict adherence to physical constraints, particularly improving stability during high-lateral-acceleration maneuvers where precise vehicle-road interaction is paramount. Evaluated on the nuPlan Test14-hard benchmark, ReflexDiffusion achieves a 14.1% improvement in driving score for high-lateral-acceleration scenarios over the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. This demonstrates that inference-time trajectory optimization can effectively compensate for training data sparsity by dynamically reinforcing safety-critical constraints near handling limits. The framework's architecture-agnostic design enables direct deployment to existing diffusion-based planners, offering a practical solution for improving autonomous vehicle safety in challenging driving conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |

Existing Large Language Models (LLMs) unlearning approaches that typically focus on modifying only final answers are insufficient for LRMs, as they fail to remove sensitive content from intermediate steps, leading to persistent privacy leakage and degraded security. To address these challenges, we propose Sensitive Trajectory Regulation (STaR), a parameter-free, inference-time unlearning framework that achieves robust privacy protection throughout the reasoning process. Specifically, we first identify sensitive content via semantic-aware detection. Then, we inject global safety constraints through secure prompt prefix. Next, we perform trajectory-aware suppression to dynamically block sensitive content across the entire reasoning chain. Finally, we apply token-level adaptive filtering to prevent both exact and paraphrased sensitive tokens during generation. Furthermore, to overcome the inadequacies of existing evaluation protocols, we introduce two metrics: Multi-Decoding Consistency Assessment (MCS), which measures the consistency of unlearning across diverse decoding strategies, and Multi-Granularity Membership Inference Attack (MIA) Evaluation, which quantifies privacy protection at both answer and reasoning-chain levels. Experiments on the R-TOFU benchmark demonstrate that STaR achieves comprehensive and stable unlearning with minimal utility loss, setting a new standard for privacy-preserving reasoning in LRMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Online Trajectory Optimization for Arbitrary-Shaped Mobile Robots via Polynomial Separating Hypersurfaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09231v1)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An emerging class of trajectory optimization methods enforces collision avoidance by jointly optimizing the robot's configuration and a separating hyperplane. However, as linear separators only apply to convex sets, these methods require convex approximations of both the robot and obstacles, which becomes an overly conservative assumption in cluttered and narrow environments. In this work, we unequivocally remove this limitation by introducing nonlinear separating hypersurfaces parameterized by polynomial functions. We first generalize the classical separating hyperplane theorem and prove that any two disjoint bounded closed sets in Euclidean space can be separated by a polynomial hypersurface, serving as the theoretical foundation for nonlinear separation of arbitrary geometries. Building on this result, we formulate a nonlinear programming (NLP) problem that jointly optimizes the robot's trajectory and the coefficients of the separating polynomials, enabling geometry-aware collision avoidance without conservative convex simplifications. The optimization remains efficiently solvable using standard NLP solvers. Simulation and real-world experiments with nonconvex robots demonstrate that our method achieves smooth, collision-free, and agile maneuvers in environments where convex-approximation baselines fail.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiffMM: Efficient Method for Accurate Noisy and Sparse Trajectory Map Matching via One Step Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08482v1)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Map matching for sparse trajectories is a fundamental problem for many trajectory-based applications, e.g., traffic scheduling and traffic flow analysis. Existing methods for map matching are generally based on Hidden Markov Model (HMM) or encoder-decoder framework. However, these methods continue to face significant challenges when handling noisy or sparsely sampled GPS trajectories. To address these limitations, we propose DiffMM, an encoder-diffusion-based map matching framework that produces effective yet efficient matching results through a one-step diffusion process. We first introduce a road segment-aware trajectory encoder that jointly embeds the input trajectory and its surrounding candidate road segments into a shared latent space through an attention mechanism. Next, we propose a one step diffusion method to realize map matching through a shortcut model by leveraging the joint embedding of the trajectory and candidate road segments as conditioning context. We conduct extensive experiments on large-scale trajectory datasets, demonstrating that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art map matching methods in terms of both accuracy and efficiency, particularly for sparse trajectories and complex road network topologies.</p></details> | AAAI-26 |
| **[CASHEW: Stabilizing Multimodal Reasoning via Iterative Trajectory Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08010v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models achieve strong performance across a wide range of multimodal understanding and reasoning tasks, yet their multi-step reasoning remains unstable. Repeated sampling over the same input often produces divergent reasoning trajectories and inconsistent final predictions. To address this, we introduce two complementary approaches inspired by test-time scaling: (1) CASHEW, an inference-time framework that stabilizes reasoning by iteratively aggregating multiple candidate trajectories into higher-quality reasoning traces, with explicit visual verification filtering hallucinated steps and grounding reasoning in visual evidence, and (2) CASHEW-RL, a learned variant that internalizes this aggregation behavior within a single model. CASHEW-RL is trained using Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO) with a composite reward that encourages correct answers grounded in minimal yet sufficient visual evidence, while adaptively allocating reasoning effort based on task difficulty. This training objective enables robust self-aggregation at inference. Extensive experiments on 13 image understanding, video understanding, and video reasoning benchmarks show significant performance improvements, including gains of up to +23.6 percentage points on ScienceQA and +8.1 percentage points on EgoSchema.</p></details> |  |
| **[d3LLM: Ultra-Fast Diffusion LLM using Pseudo-Trajectory Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07568v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) offer capabilities beyond those of autoregressive (AR) LLMs, such as parallel decoding and random-order generation. However, realizing these benefits in practice is non-trivial, as dLLMs inherently face an accuracy-parallelism trade-off. Despite increasing interest, existing methods typically focus on only one-side of the coin, targeting either efficiency or performance. To address this limitation, we propose d3LLM (Pseudo-Distilled Diffusion Large Language Model), striking a balance between accuracy and parallelism: (i) during training, we introduce pseudo-trajectory distillation to teach the model which tokens can be decoded confidently at early steps, thereby improving parallelism; (ii) during inference, we employ entropy-based multi-block decoding with a KV-cache refresh mechanism to achieve high parallelism while maintaining accuracy. To better evaluate dLLMs, we also introduce AUP (Accuracy Under Parallelism), a new metric that jointly measures accuracy and parallelism. Experiments demonstrate that our d3LLM achieves up to 10$\times$ speedup over vanilla LLaDA/Dream and 5$\times$ speedup over AR models without much accuracy drop. Our code is available at https://github.com/hao-ai-lab/d3LLM.</p></details> |  |
| **[BiTrajDiff: Bidirectional Trajectory Generation with Diffusion Models for Offline Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05762v4)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) have proven that effective policy learning can benefit from imposing conservative constraints on pre-collected datasets. However, such static datasets often exhibit distribution bias, resulting in limited generalizability. To address this limitation, a straightforward solution is data augmentation (DA), which leverages generative models to enrich data distribution. Despite the promising results, current DA techniques focus solely on reconstructing future trajectories from given states, while ignoring the exploration of history transitions that reach them. This single-direction paradigm inevitably hinders the discovery of diverse behavior patterns, especially those leading to critical states that may have yielded high-reward outcomes. In this work, we introduce Bidirectional Trajectory Diffusion (BiTrajDiff), a novel DA framework for offline RL that models both future and history trajectories from any intermediate states. Specifically, we decompose the trajectory generation task into two independent yet complementary diffusion processes: one generating forward trajectories to predict future dynamics, and the other generating backward trajectories to trace essential history transitions.BiTrajDiff can efficiently leverage critical states as anchors to expand into potentially valuable yet underexplored regions of the state space, thereby facilitating dataset diversity. Extensive experiments on the D4RL benchmark suite demonstrate that BiTrajDiff achieves superior performance compared to other advanced DA methods across various offline RL backbones.</p></details> |  |
| **[PsyCLIENT: Client Simulation via Conversational Trajectory Modeling for Trainee Practice and Model Evaluation in Mental Health Counseling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07312v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-based client simulation has emerged as a promising tool for training novice counselors and evaluating automated counseling systems. However, existing client simulation approaches face three key challenges: (1) limited diversity and realism in client profiles, (2) the lack of a principled framework for modeling realistic client behaviors, and (3) a scarcity in Chinese-language settings. To address these limitations, we propose PsyCLIENT, a novel simulation framework grounded in conversational trajectory modeling. By conditioning LLM generation on predefined real-world trajectories that incorporate explicit behavior labels and content constraints, our approach ensures diverse and realistic interactions. We further introduce PsyCLIENT-CP, the first open-source Chinese client profile dataset, covering 60 distinct counseling topics. Comprehensive evaluations involving licensed professional counselors demonstrate that PsyCLIENT significantly outperforms baselines in terms of authenticity and training effectiveness. Notably, the simulated clients are nearly indistinguishable from human clients, achieving an about 95\% expert confusion rate in discrimination tasks. These findings indicate that conversational trajectory modeling effectively bridges the gap between theoretical client profiles and dynamic, realistic simulations, offering a robust solution for mental health education and research. Code and data will be released to facilitate future research in mental health counseling.</p></details> |  |
| **[VISTA: Knowledge-Driven Interpretable Vessel Trajectory Imputation via Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06940v1)** | 2026-01-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Automatic Identification System provides critical information for maritime navigation and safety, yet its trajectories are often incomplete due to signal loss or deliberate tampering. Existing imputation methods emphasize trajectory recovery, paying limited attention to interpretability and failing to provide underlying knowledge that benefits downstream tasks such as anomaly detection and route planning. We propose knowledge-driven interpretable vessel trajectory imputation (VISTA), the first trajectory imputation framework that offers interpretability while simultaneously providing underlying knowledge to support downstream analysis. Specifically, we first define underlying knowledge as a combination of Structured Data-derived Knowledge (SDK) distilled from AIS data and Implicit LLM Knowledge acquired from large-scale Internet corpora. Second, to manage and leverage the SDK effectively at scale, we develop a data-knowledge-data loop that employs a Structured Data-derived Knowledge Graph for SDK extraction and knowledge-driven trajectory imputation. Third, to efficiently process large-scale AIS data, we introduce a workflow management layer that coordinates the end-to-end pipeline, enabling parallel knowledge extraction and trajectory imputation with anomaly handling and redundancy elimination. Experiments on two large AIS datasets show that VISTA is capable of state-of-the-art imputation accuracy and computational efficiency, improving over state-of-the-art baselines by 5%-94% and reducing time cost by 51%-93%, while producing interpretable knowledge cues that benefit downstream tasks. The source code and implementation details of VISTA are publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 13 figures, 3 algorithms, 5 tables.

| **[Mobility Trajectories from Network-Driven Markov Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06020v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a generative model of human mobility in which trajectories arise as realizations of a prescribed, time-dependent Markov dynamics defined on a spatial interaction network. The model constructs a hierarchical routing structure with hubs, corridors, feeder paths, and metro links, and specifies transition matrices using gravity-type distance decay combined with externally imposed temporal schedules and directional biases. Population mass evolves as indistinguishable, memoryless movers performing a single transition per time step. When aggregated, the resulting trajectories reproduce structured origin-destination flows that reflect network geometry, temporal modulation, and connectivity constraints. By applying the Perron-Frobenius theorem to the daily evolution operator, we identify a unique periodic invariant population distribution that serves as a natural non-transient reference state. We verify consistency between trajectory-level realizations and multi-step Markov dynamics, showing that discrepancies are entirely attributable to finite-population sampling. The framework provides a network-centric, privacy-preserving approach to generating mobility trajectories and studying time-elapsed flow structure without invoking individual-level behavioral assumptions.</p></details> | 22 pages, 6 figures |

This pattern is also often observed within-seasons, as an athlete aims for their performance to peak at key events such as the Olympic Games or World Championships. A Bayesian hierarchical model is developed to analyse the evolution of athletic sporting performance throughout an athlete's career and separate these effects whilst allowing for confounding factors such as environmental conditions. Our model works in continuous time and estimates both $g(t)$, the average performance level of the population at age $t$, and $f_i(t)$, the difference of the $i$-th athlete from this average. We further decompose $f_i(t)$ into a season-to-season trajectory and a within-season trajectory, which is modelled by a restricted Bernstein polynomial. The model is fitted using an adaptive Metropolis-within-Gibbs algorithm with a carefully chosen blocking scheme. The model allows us to understand seasonal patterns in athlete performance, how these differ between athletes, and provides individual fitted and trend performance trajectories. The properties of the model are illustrated using a simulation study and an application to 100 metres and 200 metres freestyle swimming for both female and male athletes.</p></details> |  |

Yet existing self-evolving frameworks mainly reward final outcomes, leaving intermediate reasoning weakly constrained despite its importance for visually grounded decision making. We propose iReasoner, a self-evolving framework that improves an LMM's implicit reasoning by explicitly eliciting chain-of-thought (CoT) and rewarding its internal agreement. In a Proposer--Solver loop over unlabeled images, iReasoner augments outcome-level intrinsic rewards with a trajectory-aware signal defined over intermediate reasoning steps, providing learning signals that distinguish reasoning paths leading to the same answer without ground-truth labels or external judges. Starting from Qwen2.5-VL-7B, iReasoner yields up to $+2.1$ points across diverse multimodal reasoning benchmarks under fully unsupervised post-training. We hope this work serves as a starting point for reasoning-aware self-improvement in LMMs in purely unsupervised settings.</p></details> |  |

However, we find that directly applying these techniques to image-to-video (I2V) models often fails to yield consistent reward improvements. To address this limitation, we present TAGRPO, a robust post-training framework for I2V models inspired by contrastive learning. Our approach is grounded in the observation that rollout videos generated from identical initial noise provide superior guidance for optimization. Leveraging this insight, we propose a novel GRPO loss applied to intermediate latents, encouraging direct alignment with high-reward trajectories while maximizing distance from low-reward counterparts. Furthermore, we introduce a memory bank for rollout videos to enhance diversity and reduce computational overhead. Despite its simplicity, TAGRPO achieves significant improvements over DanceGRPO in I2V generation.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures |

Here we analyzed 97,564 longitudinal PASC assessments from 13,511 participants with linked vaccination histories to disentangle passive temporal progression from vaccine-associated change. Using a clinically validated threshold (PASC $\geq 12$), trajectories separated into three phenotypes: Protected (persistently sub-threshold), Refractory (persistently symptomatic), and Responders (transitioning from symptomatic to recovered). Across the full cohort, symptom severity increased modestly with elapsed time ($r=0.0521$, $P=1.26\times10^{-59}$), whereas cumulative vaccination showed an inverse association with severity ($r=-0.0434$, $P=5.95\times10^{-42}$). In summary, baseline Long COVID severity appears clinically deterministic. In the absence of intervention, symptoms typically persist without spontaneous resolution. Recovery is primarily associated with repeated immunization.</p></details> |  |
| **[TAPM-Net: Trajectory-Aware Perturbation Modeling for Infrared Small Target Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05446v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Infrared small target detection (ISTD) remains a long-standing challenge due to weak signal contrast, limited spatial extent, and cluttered backgrounds. Despite performance improvements from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs), current models lack a mechanism to trace how small targets trigger directional, layer-wise perturbations in the feature space, which is an essential cue for distinguishing signal from structured noise in infrared scenes. To address this limitation, we propose the Trajectory-Aware Mamba Propagation Network (TAPM-Net), which explicitly models the spatial diffusion behavior of target-induced feature disturbances. TAPM-Net is built upon two novel components: a Perturbation-guided Path Module (PGM) and a Trajectory-Aware State Block (TASB). The PGM constructs perturbation energy fields from multi-level features and extracts gradient-following feature trajectories that reflect the directionality of local responses. The resulting feature trajectories are fed into the TASB, a Mamba-based state-space unit that models dynamic propagation along each trajectory while incorporating velocity-constrained diffusion and semantically aligned feature fusion from word-level and sentence-level embeddings. Unlike existing attention-based methods, TAPM-Net enables anisotropic, context-sensitive state transitions along spatial trajectories while maintaining global coherence at low computational cost. Experiments on NUAA-SIRST and IRSTD-1K demonstrate that TAPM-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance in ISTD.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in BMVC 2025 see: https://bmva-archive.org.uk/bmvc/2025/assets/papers/Paper_709/paper.pdf.

We aim to endow computational systems with a similar ability to predict plausible future object motions directly from passive visual observation. We introduce ObjectForesight, a 3D object-centric dynamics model that predicts future 6-DoF poses and trajectories of rigid objects from short egocentric video sequences. Unlike conventional world or dynamics models that operate in pixel or latent space, ObjectForesight represents the world explicitly in 3D at the object level, enabling geometrically grounded and temporally coherent predictions that capture object affordances and trajectories. To train such a model at scale, we leverage recent advances in segmentation, mesh reconstruction, and 3D pose estimation to curate a dataset of 2 million plus short clips with pseudo-ground-truth 3D object trajectories. Through extensive experiments, we show that ObjectForesight achieves significant gains in accuracy, geometric consistency, and generalization to unseen objects and scenes, establishing a scalable framework for learning physically grounded, object-centric dynamics models directly from observation. objectforesight.github.io</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

Remote assistance concepts, where operators provide discrete inputs to aid specific automation modules like planning, is gaining interest due to its reduced workload on the human remote operator and improved safety. However, these concepts are challenging to implement and maintain due to their deep integration and interaction with the automated driving system. In this paper, we propose a solution to facilitate the implementation of remote assistance concepts that intervene on planning level and extend the operational design domain of the vehicle at runtime. Using arbitration graphs, a modular decision-making framework, we integrate remote assistance into an existing automated driving system without modifying the original software components. Our simulative implementation demonstrates this approach in two use cases, allowing operators to adjust planner constraints and enable trajectory generation beyond nominal operational design domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 8 figures, presented at IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium 2025, video demonstration available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVSO-YOeGMk</p></details> |

This study extends the scope to online refinement of the entire capacity fade trajectory (CFT) through EntroLnn, a framework based on entropy-guided transformable liquid neural networks (LNNs). EntroLnn treats CFT refinement as an integrated process rather than two independent tasks for pointwise SoH and EoL. We introduce entropy-based features derived from online temperature fields, applied for the first time in battery analytics, and combine them with customized LNNs that model temporal battery dynamics effectively. The framework enhances both static and dynamic adaptability of LNNs and achieves robust and generalizable CFT refinement across different batteries and operating conditions. The approach provides a high fidelity battery health model with lightweight computation, achieving mean absolute errors of only 0.004577 for CFT and 18 cycles for EoL prediction. This work establishes a foundation for entropy-informed learning in battery analytics and enables self-adaptive, lightweight, and interpretable battery health prediction in practical battery management systems.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

In this study, we provide a multilinguistic, large-scale assessment of this similarity by systematically comparing 16 publicly available pretrained LLMs with human brain responses during natural language processing tasks in both English and Chinese. Specifically, we use ridge regression to assess the representational similarity between LLM embeddings and electroencephalography (EEG) signals, and analyze the similarity between the "neural trajectory" and the "LLM latent trajectory." This method captures key dynamic patterns, such as magnitude, angle, uncertainty, and confidence. Our findings highlight both similarities and crucial differences in processing strategies: (1) We show that middle-to-high layers of LLMs are central to semantic integration and correspond to the N400 component observed in EEG; (2) The brain exhibits continuous and iterative processing during reading, whereas LLMs often show discrete, stage-end bursts of activity, which suggests a stark contrast in their real-time semantic processing dynamics. This study could offer new insights into LLMs and neural processing, and also establish a critical framework for future investigations into the alignment between artificial intelligence and biological intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Table Pruning in TableQA: From Sequential Revisions to Gold Trajectory-Supervised Parallel Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03851v1)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Table Question Answering (TableQA) benefits significantly from table pruning, which extracts compact sub-tables by eliminating redundant cells to streamline downstream reasoning. However, existing pruning methods typically rely on sequential revisions driven by unreliable critique signals, often failing to detect the loss of answer-critical data. To address this limitation, we propose TabTrim, a novel table pruning framework which transforms table pruning from sequential revisions to gold trajectory-supervised parallel search. TabTrim derives a gold pruning trajectory using the intermediate sub-tables in the execution process of gold SQL queries, and trains a pruner and a verifier to make the step-wise pruning result align with the gold pruning trajectory. During inference, TabTrim performs parallel search to explore multiple candidate pruning trajectories and identify the optimal sub-table. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TabTrim achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse tabular reasoning tasks: TabTrim-8B reaches 73.5% average accuracy, outperforming the strongest baseline by 3.2%, including 79.4% on WikiTQ and 61.2% on TableBench.</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures |

Starting with a small number of embodiment-flexible human demonstrations collected in a virtual reality simulation environment, the pipeline refines these demonstrations using optimization-based kinematic retargeting and trajectory optimization to adapt them across various robot embodiments and physical parameters. This process yields a diverse, physically consistent dataset that enables cross-embodiment data transfer, and offers the potential to reuse legacy datasets collected under different hardware configurations or physical parameters. We validate the pipeline's effectiveness by training diffusion policies from the generated datasets for challenging contact-rich manipulation tasks across multiple robot embodiments, including a floating Allegro hand and bimanual robot arms. The trained policies are deployed zero-shot on hardware for bimanual iiwa arms, achieving high success rates with minimal human input.

While text-based affect inference has become increasingly feasible, prior approaches often treat sentiment as a deterministic point estimate for individual speakers, failing to capture the inherent subjectivity, latent ambiguity, and sequential coupling found in mutual exchanges. We introduce LLM-MC-Affect, a probabilistic framework that characterizes emotion not as a static label, but as a continuous latent probability distribution defined over an affective space. By leveraging stochastic LLM decoding and Monte Carlo estimation, the methodology approximates these distributions to derive high-fidelity sentiment trajectories that explicitly quantify both central affective tendencies and perceptual ambiguity. These trajectories enable a structured analysis of interpersonal coupling through sequential cross-correlation and slope-based indicators, identifying leading or lagging influences between interlocutors. To validate the interpretive capacity of this approach, we utilize teacher-student instructional dialogues as a representative case study, where our quantitative indicators successfully distill high-level interaction insights such as effective scaffolding. This work establishes a scalable and deployable pathway for understanding interpersonal dynamics, offering a generalizable solution that extends beyond education to broader social and behavioral research.</p></details> |  |

A popular means of representing the trajectory in continuous time is via a Gaussian process (GP) prior, with the prior's mean and covariance functions generated by a linear time-varying (LTV) stochastic differential equation (SDE) driven by white noise. When the state comprises elements of Lie groups, previous works have resorted to a patchwork of local GPs each with a linear time-invariant SDE kernel, which while effective in practice, lacks theoretical elegance. Here we revisit the full LTV GP approach to continuous-time trajectory estimation, deriving a global GP prior on Lie groups via the Magnus expansion, which offers a more elegant and general solution. We provide a numerical comparison between the two approaches and discuss their relative merits.</p></details> | 21 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Dual-quaternion learning control for autonomous vehicle trajectory tracking with safety guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03097v1)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a learning-based trajectory tracking controller for autonomous robotic platforms whose motion can be described kinematically on $\mathrm{SE}(3)$. The controller is formulated in the dual quaternion framework and operates at the velocity level, assuming direct command of angular and linear velocities, as is standard in many aerial vehicles and omnidirectional mobile robots. Gaussian Process (GP) regression is integrated into a geometric feedback law to learn and compensate online for unknown, state-dependent disturbances and modeling imperfections affecting both attitude and position, while preserving the algebraic structure and coupling properties inherent to rigid-body motion. The proposed approach does not rely on explicit parametric models of the unknown effects, making it well-suited for robotic systems subject to sensor-induced disturbances, unmodeled actuation couplings, and environmental uncertainties. A Lyapunov-based analysis establishes probabilistic ultimate boundedness of the pose tracking error under bounded GP uncertainty, providing formal stability guarantees for the learning-based controller. Simulation results demonstrate accurate and smooth trajectory tracking in the presence of realistic, localized disturbances, including correlated rotational and translational effects arising from magnetometer perturbations. These results illustrate the potential of combining geometric modeling and probabilistic learning to achieve robust, data-efficient pose control for autonomous robotic systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fast Surrogate Models for Adaptive Aircraft Trajectory Prediction in En route Airspace](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03075v1)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction (TP) is crucial for ensuring safety and efficiency in modern air traffic management systems. It is, for example, a core component of conflict detection and resolution tools, arrival sequencing algorithms, capacity planning, as well as several future concepts. However, TP accuracy within operational systems is hampered by a range of epistemic uncertainties such as the mass and performance settings of aircraft and the effect of meteorological conditions on aircraft performance. It can also require considerable computational resources. This paper proposes a method for adaptive TP that has two components: first, a fast surrogate TP model based on linear state space models (LSSM)s with an execution time that was 6.7 times lower on average than an implementation of the Base of Aircraft Data (BADA) in Python. It is demonstrated that such models can effectively emulate the BADA aircraft performance model, which is based on the numerical solution of a partial differential equation (PDE), and that the LSSMs can be fitted to trajectories in a dataset of historic flight data. Secondly, the paper proposes an algorithm to assimilate radar observations using particle filtering to adaptively refine TP accuracy. Comparison with baselines using BADA and Kalman filtering demonstrate that the proposed framework improves system identification and state estimation for both climb and descent phases, with 46.3% and 64.7% better estimates for time to top of climb and bottom of descent compared to the best performing benchmark model. In particular, the particle filtering approach provides the flexibility to capture non-linear performance effects including the CAS-Mach transition.</p></details> |  |
| **[Chain-of-Action: Trajectory Autoregressive Modeling for Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09990v2)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Chain-of-Action (CoA), a novel visuo-motor policy paradigm built upon Trajectory Autoregressive Modeling. Unlike conventional approaches that predict next step action(s) forward, CoA generates an entire trajectory by explicit backward reasoning with task-specific goals through an action-level Chain-of-Thought (CoT) process. This process is unified within a single autoregressive structure: (1) the first token corresponds to a stable keyframe action that encodes the task-specific goals; and (2) subsequent action tokens are generated autoregressively, conditioned on the initial keyframe and previously predicted actions. This backward action reasoning enforces a global-to-local structure, allowing each local action to be tightly constrained by the final goal. To further realize the action reasoning structure, CoA incorporates four complementary designs: continuous action token representation; dynamic stopping for variable-length trajectory generation; reverse temporal ensemble; and multi-token prediction to balance action chunk modeling with global structure. As a result, CoA gives strong spatial generalization capabilities while preserving the flexibility and simplicity of a visuo-motor policy. Empirically, we observe CoA achieves the state-of-the-art performance across 60 RLBench tasks and 8 real-world manipulation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Swept Volume-Based Trajectory Generation for Arbitrary-Shaped Ground Robot Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07554v2)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Navigating an arbitrary-shaped ground robot safely in cluttered environments remains a challenging problem. The existing trajectory planners that account for the robot's physical geometry severely suffer from the intractable runtime. To achieve both computational efficiency and Continuous Collision Avoidance (CCA) of arbitrary-shaped ground robot planning, we proposed a novel coarse-to-fine navigation framework that significantly accelerates planning. In the first stage, a sampling-based method selectively generates distinct topological paths that guarantee a minimum inflated margin. In the second stage, a geometry-aware front-end strategy is designed to discretize these topologies into full-state robot motion sequences while concurrently partitioning the paths into SE(2) sub-problems and simpler R2 sub-problems for back-end optimization. In the final stage, an SVSDF-based optimizer generates trajectories tailored to these sub-problems and seamlessly splices them into a continuous final motion plan. Extensive benchmark comparisons show that the proposed method is one to several orders of magnitude faster than the cutting-edge methods in runtime while maintaining a high planning success rate and ensuring CCA.</p></details> |  |
| **[Q-Regularized Generative Auto-Bidding: From Suboptimal Trajectories to Optimal Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02754v1)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of e-commerce, auto-bidding has become a key asset in optimizing advertising performance under diverse advertiser environments. The current approaches focus on reinforcement learning (RL) and generative models. These efforts imitate offline historical behaviors by utilizing a complex structure with expensive hyperparameter tuning. The suboptimal trajectories further exacerbate the difficulty of policy learning. To address these challenges, we proposes QGA, a novel Q-value regularized Generative Auto-bidding method. In QGA, we propose to plug a Q-value regularization with double Q-learning strategy into the Decision Transformer backbone. This design enables joint optimization of policy imitation and action-value maximization, allowing the learned bidding policy to both leverage experience from the dataset and alleviate the adverse impact of the suboptimal trajectories. Furthermore, to safely explore the policy space beyond the data distribution, we propose a Q-value guided dual-exploration mechanism, in which the DT model is conditioned on multiple return-to-go targets and locally perturbed actions. This entire exploration process is dynamically guided by the aforementioned Q-value module, which provides principled evaluation for each candidate action. Experiments on public benchmarks and simulation environments demonstrate that QGA consistently achieves superior or highly competitive results compared to existing alternatives. Notably, in large-scale real-world A/B testing, QGA achieves a 3.27% increase in Ad GMV and a 2.49% improvement in Ad ROI.</p></details> | <details><summary>11pag...</summary><p>11pages, 5figures, In Proceedings of the 32nd ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining</p></details> |
| **[Optimizing Control-Friendly Trajectories with Self-Supervised Residual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02738v1)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world physics can only be analytically modeled with a certain level of precision for modern intricate robotic systems. As a result, tracking aggressive trajectories accurately could be challenging due to the existence of residual physics during controller synthesis. This paper presents a self-supervised residual learning and trajectory optimization framework to address the aforementioned challenges. At first, unknown dynamic effects on the closed-loop model are learned and treated as residuals of the nominal dynamics, jointly forming a hybrid model. We show that learning with analytic gradients can be achieved using only trajectory-level data while enjoying accurate long-horizon prediction with an arbitrary integration step size. Subsequently, a trajectory optimizer is developed to compute the optimal reference trajectory with the residual physics along it minimized. It ends up with trajectories that are friendly to the following control level. The agile flight of quadrotors illustrates that by utilizing the hybrid dynamics, the proposed optimizer outputs aggressive motions that can be precisely tracked.</p></details> | 10 pages, 9 figures |

It is well known that the effectiveness of such methods depends crucially on the relative correlations and computational costs of the available computational models. However, the question of how to automatically tune low-fidelity models to maximize performance remains an open area of research. This work investigates automated model tuning, which optimizes model hyperparameters to minimize estimator variance within a target computational budget. Focusing on multifidelity trajectory simulation estimators, the cost-versus-precision tradeoff enabled by this approach is demonstrated in a practical, online setting where upfront tuning costs cannot be amortized. Using a real-world entry, descent, and landing example, it is shown that automated model tuning largely outperforms hand-tuned models even when the overall computational budget is relatively low. Furthermore, for scenarios where the computational budget is large, model tuning solutions can approach the best-case multifidelity estimator performance where optimal model hyperparameters are known a priori. Recommendations for applying model tuning in practice are provided and avenues for enabling adoption of such approaches for budget-constrained problems are highlighted.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages with 15 figures in main text</p></details> |

A recurring practical issue is that standard mini-batch training can be unstable when trajectory lengths are highly heterogeneous, which in turn degrades \emph{distribution matching} for trajectory-derived statistics. We propose \textbf{length-aware sampling (LAS)}, a simple batching strategy that groups trajectories by length and samples batches from a single length bucket, reducing within-batch length heterogeneity (and making updates more consistent) without changing the model class. We integrate LAS into a conditional trajectory GAN with auxiliary time-alignment losses and provide (i) a distribution-level guarantee for derived variables under mild boundedness assumptions, and (ii) an IPM/Wasserstein mechanism explaining why LAS improves distribution matching by removing length-only shortcut critics and targeting within-bucket discrepancies. Empirically, LAS consistently improves matching of derived-variable distributions on a multi-mall dataset of shopper trajectories and on diverse public sequence datasets (GPS, education, e-commerce, and movies), outperforming random sampling across dataset-specific metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Classification Network Guided Trajectory Planning for Four-Wheel Independent Steering Autonomous Parking Considering Obstacle Attributes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18836v2)** | 2026-01-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Four-wheel Independent Steering (4WIS) vehicles have attracted increasing attention for their superior maneuverability. Human drivers typically choose to cross or drive over the low-profile obstacles (e.g., plastic bags) to efficiently navigate through narrow spaces, while existing planners neglect obstacle attributes, leading to suboptimal efficiency or planning failures. To address this issue, we propose a novel multimodal trajectory planning framework that employs a neural network for scene perception, combines 4WIS hybrid A* search to generate a warm start, and utilizes an optimal control problem (OCP) for trajectory optimization. Specifically, a multimodal perception network fusing visual information and vehicle states is employed to capture semantic and contextual scene understanding, enabling the planner to adapt the strategy according to scene complexity (hard or easy task). For hard tasks, guided points are introduced to decompose complex tasks into local subtasks, improving the search efficiency. The multiple steering modes of 4WIS vehicles, Ackermann, diagonal, and zero-turn, are also incorporated as kinematically feasible motion primitives. Moreover, a hierarchical obstacle handling strategy, which categorizes obstacles as "non-traversable", "crossable", and "drive-over", is incorporated into the node expansion process, explicitly linking obstacle attributes to planning actions to enable efficient decisions. Furthermore, to address dynamic obstacles with motion uncertainty, we introduce a probabilistic risk field model, constructing risk-aware driving corridors that serve as linear collision constraints in OCP. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed framework's effectiveness in generating safe, efficient, and smooth trajectories for 4WIS vehicles, especially in constrained environments.</p></details> |  |

This significantly hinders the usefulness of such agents in environments where interaction is costly (for example, when they interact with humans or reset physical systems). While a number of existing LM agent architectures incorporate various mechanisms for experience storage and reflection, they make limited use of LMs' abilities to directly generate or reason about full counterfactual trajectories. We introduce ECHO (Experience Consolidation via Hindsight Optimization), a prompting framework that adapts hindsight experience replay from reinforcement learning for language model agents. ECHO generates optimized trajectories for alternative goals that could have been achieved during failed attempts, effectively creating synthetic positive examples from unsuccessful interactions. Our approach consists of two components: a hindsight rule that uses the language model itself to identify relevant subgoals and generate optimized trajectories, and an update rule that maintains compressed trajectory representations in memory. We evaluate ECHO on stateful versions of XMiniGrid, a text-based navigation and planning benchmark, and PeopleJoinQA, a collaborative information-gathering enterprise simulation. Across both domains, ECHO outperforms vanilla language agent baselines by up to 80%; in XMiniGrid, it also outperforms a number of sophisticated agent architectures including Reflexion and AWM, demonstrating faster adaptation to novel environments through more effective utilization of past experiences.</p></details> |  |

Existing anomaly detection methods are ill-suited for this challenge: mean-pooling embeddings dilutes anomalous steps, while contrastive-only approaches ignore sequential structure. Standard unsupervised methods on pre-trained embeddings achieve F1-scores no higher than 0.69. We introduce Trajectory Guard, a Siamese Recurrent Autoencoder with a hybrid loss function that jointly learns task-trajectory alignment via contrastive learning and sequential validity via reconstruction. This dual objective enables unified detection of both "wrong plan for this task" and "malformed plan structure." On benchmarks spanning synthetic perturbations and real-world failures from security audits (RAS-Eval) and multi-agent systems (Who\&When), we achieve F1-scores of 0.88-0.94 on balanced sets and recall of 0.86-0.92 on imbalanced external benchmarks. At 32 ms inference latency, our approach runs 17-27$\times$ faster than LLM Judge baselines, enabling real-time safety verification in production deployments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI Trustagent 2026</p></details> |

Many existing distribution-matching approaches struggle in this regime because they impose strict support constraints and rely on brittle one-step models, making it hard to extract useful signal from imperfect data. To tackle this challenge, we propose TGE, a trajectory-level generative embedding for offline LfO that constructs a dense, smooth surrogate reward by estimating expert state density in the latent space of a temporal diffusion model trained on offline trajectory data. By leveraging the smooth geometry of the learned diffusion embedding, TGE captures long-horizon temporal dynamics and effectively bridges the gap between disjoint supports, ensuring a robust learning signal even when offline data is distributionally distinct from the expert. Empirically, the proposed approach consistently matches or outperforms prior offline LfO methods across a range of D4RL locomotion and manipulation benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 6 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

In this study, we propose a model-free clustering framework that groups baskets based on transition probabilities derived from the trajectories of treatment response, rather than relying solely on a single efficacy endpoint such as the objective response rate. The number of clusters is not predetermined but is automatically determined in a data-driven manner based on the similarity structure among baskets. After clustering, baskets within the same cluster are analyzed using a hierarchical Bayesian model. This framework aims to improve the estimation precision of efficacy endpoints and enhance statistical power while maintaining the type~I error rate at the nominal level. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated through simulation studies. The results demonstrated that the proposed method can accurately identify cluster structures in heterogeneous settings and, even under such conditions, maintain the type~I error rate at the nominal level while improving statistical power.</p></details> |  |

Traditional modular pipelines separate perception, prediction, and planning, while recent end-to-end (E2E) systems learn them jointly. Vision-language models (VLMs) further enrich this paradigm by introducing cross-modal priors and commonsense reasoning, yet current VLM-based planners face three key challenges: (i) a mismatch between discrete text reasoning and continuous control, (ii) high latency from autoregressive chain-of-thought decoding, and (iii) inefficient or non-causal planners that limit real-time deployment. We propose ColaVLA, a unified vision-language-action framework that transfers reasoning from text to a unified latent space and couples it with a hierarchical, parallel trajectory decoder. The Cognitive Latent Reasoner compresses scene understanding into compact, decision-oriented meta-action embeddings through ego-adaptive selection and only two VLM forward passes. The Hierarchical Parallel Planner then generates multi-scale, causality-consistent trajectories in a single forward pass. Together, these components preserve the generalization and interpretability of VLMs while enabling efficient, accurate and safe trajectory generation. Experiments on the nuScenes benchmark show that ColaVLA achieves state-of-the-art performance in both open-loop and closed-loop settings with favorable efficiency and robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 4 figures.

In this paper, we enhance high-frequency features of GEO targets while suppressing background noise at the single-frame level through wavelet transform. Building on this, we propose a multi-frame temporal trajectory completion scheme centered on the Hungarian algorithm for globally optimal cross-frame matching. To effectively mitigate missing and false detections, a series of key steps including temporal matching and interpolation completion, temporal-consistency-based noise filtering, and progressive trajectory refinement are designed in the post-processing pipeline. Experimental results on the public SpotGEO dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving an F_1 score of 90.14%.</p></details> |  |

In the one-shot setting, the agent generates a policy after observing a single expert demonstration without additional fine-tuning. Existing approaches typically train and evaluate on the same set of tasks, varying only object configurations, and struggle to generalize to unseen tasks with different semantic or structural requirements. While some recent methods attempt to address this, they exhibit low success rates on hard test tasks that, despite being visually similar to some training tasks, differ in context and require distinct responses. Additionally, most existing methods lack an explicit model of environment dynamics, limiting their ability to reason about future states. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework for one-shot visual imitation learning via world-model-guided trajectory generation. Given an expert demonstration video and the agent's initial observation, our method leverages a learned world model to predict a sequence of latent states and actions. This latent trajectory is then decoded into physical waypoints that guide the agent's execution. Our method is evaluated on two simulated benchmarks and three real-world robotic platforms, where it consistently outperforms prior approaches, with over 30% improvement in some cases. The code is available at https://github.com/raktimgg/osvi-wm.</p></details> |  |

However, conventional control algorithms for trajectory tracking often exhibit limited performance due to the underactuated, nonlinear, and highly coupled dynamics of quadrotor systems. To address these challenges, we propose HBO-PID, a novel control algorithm that integrates the Heteroscedastic Bayesian Optimization (HBO) framework with the classical PID controller to achieve accurate and robust trajectory tracking. By explicitly modeling input-dependent noise variance, the proposed method can better adapt to dynamic and complex environments, and therefore improve the accuracy and robustness of trajectory tracking. To accelerate the convergence of optimization, we adopt a two-stage optimization strategy that allow us to more efficiently find the optimal controller parameters. Through experiments in both simulation and real-world scenarios, we demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Compared to SOTA methods, it improves the position accuracy by 24.7% to 42.9%, and the angular accuracy by 40.9% to 78.4%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IROS 2025 (2025 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems)</p></details> |

Existing methods mainly rely on historical spatiotemporal trajectory data to train sequence models that directly forecast future locations. However, they often overlook the importance of the future spatiotemporal contexts, which are highly informative for the future locations. For example, knowing how much time and distance a user will travel could serve as a critical clue for predicting the user's next location. Against this background, we propose \textbf{STRelay}, a universal \textbf{\underline{S}}patio\textbf{\underline{T}}emporal \textbf{\underline{Relay}}ing framework explicitly modeling the future spatiotemporal context given a human trajectory, to boost the performance of different location prediction models. Specifically, STRelay models future spatiotemporal contexts in a relaying manner, which is subsequently integrated with the encoded historical representation from a base location prediction model, enabling multi-task learning by simultaneously predicting the next time interval, next moving distance interval, and finally the next location. We evaluate STRelay integrated with five state-of-the-art location prediction base models on four real-world trajectory datasets. Results demonstrate that STRelay consistently improves prediction performance across all cases by 2.49\%-11.30\%. Additionally, we find that the future spatiotemporal contexts are particularly helpful for entertainment-related locations and also for user groups who prefer traveling longer distances. The performance gain on such non-daily-routine activities, which often suffer from higher uncertainty, is indeed complementary to the base location prediction models that often excel at modeling regular daily routine patterns.</p></details> |  |

However, current iterative solving approaches which alternate between diffusion sampling and data consistency steps typically require hundreds or thousands of steps to achieve high quality reconstruction due to accumulated errors. We address this challenge with SURE Guided Posterior Sampling (SGPS), a method that corrects sampling trajectory deviations using Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimate (SURE) gradient updates and PCA based noise estimation. By mitigating noise induced errors during the critical early and middle sampling stages, SGPS enables more accurate posterior sampling and reduces error accumulation. This allows our method to maintain high reconstruction quality with fewer than 100 Neural Function Evaluations (NFEs).

While repair-based methods fail to restore complex artifacts and LiDAR-based approaches rely on sparse and incomplete cues, ReCamDriving leverages dense and scene-complete 3DGS renderings for explicit geometric guidance, achieving precise camera-controllable generation. To mitigate overfitting to restoration behaviors when conditioned on 3DGS renderings, ReCamDriving adopts a two-stage training paradigm: the first stage uses camera poses for coarse control, while the second stage incorporates 3DGS renderings for fine-grained viewpoint and geometric guidance. Furthermore, we present a 3DGS-based cross-trajectory data curation strategy to eliminate the train-test gap in camera transformation patterns, enabling scalable multi-trajectory supervision from monocular videos. Based on this strategy, we construct the ParaDrive dataset, containing over 110K parallel-trajectory video pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReCamDriving achieves state-of-the-art camera controllability and structural consistency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://recamdriving.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Accelerating Diffusion Planners in Offline RL via Reward-Aware Consistency Trajectory Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07822v2)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although diffusion models have achieved strong results in decision-making tasks, their slow inference speed remains a key limitation. While consistency models offer a potential solution, existing applications to decision-making either struggle with suboptimal demonstrations under behavior cloning or rely on complex concurrent training of multiple networks under the actor-critic framework. In this work, we propose a novel approach to consistency distillation for offline reinforcement learning that directly incorporates reward optimization into the distillation process. Our method achieves single-step sampling while generating higher-reward action trajectories through decoupled training and noise-free reward signals. Empirical evaluations on the Gym MuJoCo, FrankaKitchen, and long horizon planning benchmarks demonstrate that our approach can achieve a 9.7% improvement over previous state-of-the-art while offering up to 142x speedup over diffusion counterparts in inference time.</p></details> |  |

While experimental techniques like spatial transcriptomics now enable high-resolution mapping of tissue organization across space and time, current methods that model cellular evolution operate at the single-cell level, overlooking the coordinated development of cellular states in a tissue. We introduce NicheFlow, a flow-based generative model that infers the temporal trajectory of cellular microenvironments across sequential spatial slides. By representing local cell neighborhoods as point clouds, NicheFlow jointly models the evolution of cell states and spatial coordinates using optimal transport and Variational Flow Matching. Our approach successfully recovers both global spatial architecture and local microenvironment composition across diverse spatiotemporal datasets, from embryonic to brain development.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages, 15 figures, to appear in NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

However, efficiently modeling the dynamic interactions between numerous road users and infrastructures in complex scenes remains an open problem. Existing methods typically employ distance-based or fully connected dense graph structures to capture interaction information, which not only introduces a large number of redundant edges but also requires complex and heavily parameterized networks for encoding, thereby resulting in low training and inference efficiency, limiting scalability to large and complex traffic scenes. To overcome the limitations of existing methods, we propose SparScene, a sparse graph learning framework designed for efficient and scalable traffic scene representation. Instead of relying on distance thresholds, SparScene leverages the lane graph topology to construct structure-aware sparse connections between agents and lanes, enabling efficient yet informative scene graph representation. SparScene adopts a lightweight graph encoder that efficiently aggregates agent-map and agent-agent interactions, yielding compact scene representations with substantially improved efficiency and scalability. On the motion prediction benchmark of the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD), SparScene achieves competitive performance with remarkable efficiency. It generates trajectories for more than 200 agents in a scene within 5 ms and scales to more than 5,000 agents and 17,000 lanes with merely 54 ms of inference time with a GPU memory of 2.9 GB, highlighting its superior scalability for large-scale traffic scenes.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 7 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

In this paper, considering the time-varying task criticality characteristics of diverse WBAN users and the dual mobility between WBAN users and UAV, we investigate the dynamic task offloading and UAV flight trajectory optimization problem to minimize the weighted average task completion time of all the WBAN users, under the constraint of UAV energy consumption. To tackle the problem, an embodied AI-enhanced IoMT edge computing framework is established. Specifically, we propose a novel hierarchical multi-scale Transformer-based user trajectory prediction model based on the users' historical trajectory traces captured by the embodied AI agent (i.e., UAV). Afterwards, a prediction-enhanced deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm that integrates predicted users' mobility information is designed for intelligently optimizing UAV flight trajectory and task offloading decisions. Real-word movement traces and simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed methods in comparison with the existing benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Discrete sensing strategies, including sensor arrays and distributed sensors, are broadly involved in tactile sensors across versatile applications. However, it remains a challenge to achieve high spatial resolution with self-decoupled capacity and insensitivity to other off-axis stimuli for stretchable tactile sensors. Herein, we develop a stretchable tactile sensor based on the proposed continuous spectral-filtering principle, allowing superhigh resolution for applied stimuli. This proposed sensor enables a high-linear spatial response (0.996) even during stretching and bending, and high continuous spatial (7 μm) and force (5 mN) resolutions with design scalability and interaction robustness to survive piercing and cutting. We further demonstrate the sensors' performance by integrating them into a planar parallel mechanism for precise trajectory tracking (rotational resolution: 0.02°) in real time.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 2025 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)</p></details> |

Efficient Data Pruning for Large-scale Autonomous Driving Dataset via Trajectory Entropy Maximization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19270v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collecting large-scale naturalistic driving data is essential for training robust autonomous driving planners. However, real-world datasets often contain a substantial amount of repetitive and low-value samples, which lead to excessive storage costs and bring limited benefits to policy learning. To address this issue, we propose an information-theoretic data pruning method that effectively reduces the training data volume without compromising model performance. Our approach evaluates the trajectory distribution information entropy of driving data and iteratively selects high-value samples that preserve the statistical characteristics of the original dataset in a model-agnostic manner. From a theoretical perspective, we show that maximizing trajectory entropy effectively constrains the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the pruned subset and the original data distribution, thereby maintaining generalization ability. Comprehensive experiments on the NuPlan benchmark with a large-scale imitation learning framework demonstrate that the proposed method can reduce the dataset size by up to 40% while maintaining closed-loop performance. This work provides a lightweight and theoretically grounded approach for scalable data management and efficient policy learning in autonomous driving systems.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |

While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at video understanding tasks, their real-time mobile deployment is constrained by heavy computational costs and inefficient redundant frame processing. To address these issues, we propose the FC-MIR framework: leveraging keyframe sampling and adaptive concatenation, it cuts visual redundancy to boost inference efficiency, while integrating state-of-the-art closed-source MLLMs or fine-tuned models (e.g., Qwen3-VL) for trajectory summarization and intent prediction. We further expand task scope to explore generating post-prediction operations and search suggestions, and introduce a fine-grained metric to evaluate the practical utility of summaries, predictions, and suggestions. For rigorous assessment, we construct a UI trajectory dataset covering scenarios from UI-Agents (Agent-I) and real user interactions (Person-I). Experimental results show our compression method retains performance at 50%-60% compression rates; both closed-source and fine-tuned MLLMs demonstrate strong intent summarization, supporting potential lightweight on-device deployment. However, MLLMs still struggle with useful and "surprising" suggestions, leaving room for improvement. Finally, we deploy the framework in a real-world setting, integrating UI perception and UI-Agent proxies to lay a foundation for future progress in this field.</p></details> |  |
| **[CauTraj: A Causal-Knowledge-Guided Framework for Lane-Changing Trajectory Planning of Autonomous Vehicles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18703v1)** | 2025-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enhancing the performance of trajectory planners for lane - changing vehicles is one of the key challenges in autonomous driving within human - machine mixed traffic. Most existing studies have not incorporated human drivers' prior knowledge when designing trajectory planning models. To address this issue, this study proposes a novel trajectory planning framework that integrates causal prior knowledge into the control process. Both longitudinal and lateral microscopic behaviors of vehicles are modeled to quantify interaction risk, and a staged causal graph is constructed to capture causal dependencies in lane-changing scenarios. Causal effects between the lane-changing vehicle and surrounding vehicles are then estimated using causal inference, including average causal effects (ATE) and conditional average treatment effects (CATE). These causal priors are embedded into a model predictive control (MPC) framework to enhance trajectory planning. The proposed approach is validated on naturalistic vehicle trajectory datasets. Experimental results show that: (1) causal inference provides interpretable and stable quantification of vehicle interactions; (2) individual causal effects reveal driver heterogeneity; and (3) compared with the baseline MPC, the proposed method achieves a closer alignment with human driving behaviors, reducing maximum trajectory deviation from 1.2 m to 0.2 m, lateral velocity fluctuation by 60%, and yaw angle variability by 50%. These findings provide methodological support for human-like trajectory planning and practical value for improving safety, stability, and realism in autonomous vehicle testing and traffic simulation platforms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Planning for UAV-Based Smart Farming Using Imitation-Based Triple Deep Q-Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18604v1)** | 2025-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as a promising auxiliary platform for smart agriculture, capable of simultaneously performing weed detection, recognition, and data collection from wireless sensors. However, trajectory planning for UAV-based smart agriculture is challenging due to the high uncertainty of the environment, partial observations, and limited battery capacity of UAVs. To address these issues, we formulate the trajectory planning problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) and leverage multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to solve it. Furthermore, we propose a novel imitation-based triple deep Q-network (ITDQN) algorithm, which employs an elite imitation mechanism to reduce exploration costs and utilizes a mediator Q-network over a double deep Q-network (DDQN) to accelerate and stabilize training and improve performance. Experimental results in both simulated and real-world environments demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution. Moreover, our proposed ITDQN outperforms DDQN by 4.43\% in weed recognition rate and 6.94\% in data collection rate.</p></details> |  |

The algorithm utilizes the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier platform to process sequential video frames from a blind spot camera, employing self-adaptive Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE)-enhanced Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) feature extraction and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)-Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) matching. This allows for precise classification of the vehicle's motion state (static, vibration, moving). Key innovations include 1) multiframe trajectory displacement statistics (5-frame sliding window), 2) a dual-threshold state decision matrix, and 3) OBD-II driven dynamic Region of Interest (ROI) configuration. The system effectively suppresses environmental interference and false detection of dynamic objects, directly addressing the challenge of low-speed false activation in commercial vehicle safety systems. Evaluation in a real-world dataset (32,454 video segments from 1,852 vehicles) demonstrates an F1-score of 99.96% for static detection, 97.78% for moving state recognition, and a processing delay of 14.2 milliseconds (resolution 704x576). The deployment on-site shows an 89% reduction in false braking events, a 100% success rate in emergency braking, and a fault rate below 5%.</p></details> | 5 figures,16 pages |
| **[Trajectory-Aware Eligibility Traces for Off-Policy Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11321v3)** | 2025-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Off-policy learning from multistep returns is crucial for sample-efficient reinforcement learning, but counteracting off-policy bias without exacerbating variance is challenging. Classically, off-policy bias is corrected in a per-decision manner: past temporal-difference errors are re-weighted by the instantaneous Importance Sampling (IS) ratio after each action via eligibility traces. Many off-policy algorithms rely on this mechanism, along with differing protocols for cutting the IS ratios to combat the variance of the IS estimator. Unfortunately, once a trace has been fully cut, the effect cannot be reversed. This has led to the development of credit-assignment strategies that account for multiple past experiences at a time. These trajectory-aware methods have not been extensively analyzed, and their theoretical justification remains uncertain. In this paper, we propose a multistep operator that can express both per-decision and trajectory-aware methods. We prove convergence conditions for our operator in the tabular setting, establishing the first guarantees for several existing methods as well as many new ones. Finally, we introduce Recency-Bounded Importance Sampling (RBIS), which leverages trajectory awareness to perform robustly across $λ$-values in an off-policy control task.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2023. 18 pages, 4 figures, 1 table.

Despite their success, the provided tools and methodologies remain limited if high-dimensional dynamical systems subject to initial uncertainty and/or stochastic noise are encountered; in particular if rare events are of interest. We address this open challenge by borrowing ideas from Mori-Zwanzig formalism and Chorin's optimal prediction method. The novelty of our work lies on employing time-dependent optimal projection of the dynamic on a desired set of resolved variables. We show several theoretical and numerical properties of our model reduction approach. In particular, we show that the devised surrogate trajectories are consistent with the probability flow of the full-order system. Furthermore, we identify the measure underlying the projection through polynomial chaos expansion technique. This allows us to efficiently compute the projection even for trajectories that are initiated on low probability events. Moreover, we investigate the introduced model-reduction error of the surrogate trajectories on a standard setup, characterizing the convergence behaviour of the scheme. Several numerical results highlight the computational advantages of the proposed scheme in comparison to Monte-Carlo and optimal prediction method. Through this framework, we demonstrate that by tracking the measure along with the consistent projection of the dynamic we are able to access accurate estimates of different statistics including observables conditional on a given initial configuration.</p></details> |  |
| **[MoE Pathfinder: Trajectory-driven Expert Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18425v1)** | 2025-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures used in large language models (LLMs) achieve state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks yet face practical challenges such as deployment complexity and low activation efficiency. Expert pruning has thus emerged as a promising solution to reduce computational overhead and simplify the deployment of MoE models. However, existing expert pruning approaches conventionally rely on local importance metrics and often apply uniform layer-wise pruning, leveraging only partial evaluation signals and overlooking the heterogeneous contributions of experts across layers. To address these limitations, we propose an expert pruning approach based on the trajectory of activated experts across layers, which treats MoE as a weighted computation graph and casts expert selection as a global optimal path planning problem. Within this framework, we integrate complementary importance signals from reconstruction error, routing probabilities, and activation strength at the trajectory level, which naturally yields non-uniform expert retention across layers. Experiments show that our approach achieves superior pruning performance on nearly all tasks compared with most existing approaches.</p></details> | 12 pages, 3 figures |

However, ensuring good Quality of Services (QoS) while using as few UAVs as possible also requires optimal positioning and trajectory planning for UAVs and UGVs. This paper proposes a joint UAV-UGV-based positioning and trajectory planning framework for UAVs and UGVs deployment that guarantees optimal QoS for ground users. To model the UGVs' mobility, we introduce a road graph, which directs their movement along valid road segments and adheres to the road network constraints. To solve the sum rate optimization problem, we reformulate the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and propose a novel asynchronous Advantage Actor Critic (A3C) incorporated with meta-learning for rapid adaptation to new environments and dynamic conditions. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed Meta-A3C approach outperforms A3C and DDPG, delivering 13.1\% higher throughput and 49\% faster execution while meeting the QoS requirements.</p></details> |  |

End-to-end planners frequently falter under adverse weather, unpredictable human behavior, or complex road layouts, primarily because they lack strong generalization or few-shot capabilities beyond their training data. We propose LLaViDA, a Large Language Vision Driving Assistant that leverages a Vision-Language Model (VLM) for object motion prediction, semantic grounding, and chain-of-thought reasoning for trajectory planning in autonomous driving. A two-stage training pipeline--supervised fine-tuning followed by Trajectory Preference Optimization (TPO)--enhances scene understanding and trajectory planning by injecting regression-based supervision, produces a powerful "VLM Trajectory Planner for Autonomous Driving." On the NuScenes benchmark, LLaViDA surpasses state-of-the-art end-to-end and other recent VLM/LLM-based baselines in open-loop trajectory planning task, achieving an average L2 trajectory error of 0.31 m and a collision rate of 0.10% on the NuScenes test set.

Instead of learning a policy or explicit planner, PaD learns a goal-conditioned energy function over entire latent trajectories, assigning low energy to feasible, goal-consistent futures. Planning is realized as gradient-based refinement in this energy landscape, using identical computation during training and inference to reduce train-test mismatch common in decoupled modeling pipelines. PaD is trained via self-supervised hindsight goal relabeling, shaping the energy landscape around the planning dynamics. At inference, multiple trajectory candidates are refined under different temporal hypotheses, and low-energy plans balancing feasibility and efficiency are selected. We evaluate PaD on OGBench cube manipulation tasks. When trained on narrow expert demonstrations, PaD achieves state-of-the-art 95\% success, strongly outperforming prior methods that peak at 68\%. Remarkably, training on noisy, suboptimal data further improves success and plan efficiency, highlighting the benefits of verification-driven planning. Our results suggest learning to evaluate and refine trajectories provides a robust alternative to direct policy learning for offline, reward-free planning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Privacy-Preserving Synthetic Dataset of Individual Daily Trajectories for City-Scale Mobility Analytics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17239v1)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban mobility data are indispensable for urban planning, transportation demand forecasting, pandemic modeling, and many other applications; however, individual mobile phone-derived Global Positioning System traces cannot generally be shared with third parties owing to severe re-identification risks. Aggregated records, such as origin-destination (OD) matrices, offer partial insights but fail to capture the key behavioral properties of daily human movement, limiting realistic city-scale analyses. This study presents a privacy-preserving synthetic mobility dataset that reconstructs daily trajectories from aggregated inputs. The proposed method integrates OD flows with two complementary behavioral constraints: (1) dwell-travel time quantiles that are available only as coarse summary statistics and (2) the universal law for the daily distribution of the number of visited locations. Embedding these elements in a multi-objective optimization framework enables the reproduction of realistic distributions of human mobility while ensuring that no personal identifiers are required. The proposed framework is validated in two contrasting regions of Japan: (1) the 23 special wards of Tokyo, representing a dense metropolitan environment; and (2) Fukuoka Prefecture, where urban and suburban mobility patterns coexist. The resulting synthetic mobility data reproduce dwell-travel time and visit frequency distributions with high fidelity, while deviations in OD consistency remain within the natural range of daily fluctuations. The results of this study establish a practical synthesis pathway under real-world constraints, providing governments, urban planners, and industries with scalable access to high-resolution mobility data for reliable analytics without the need for sensitive personal records, and supporting practical deployments in policy and commercial domains.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |

While their capabilities are widely celebrated, a critical challenge remains unaddressed: ensuring responsible use by verifying whether an image originates from a model's training set, its novel generations or external sources. We introduce a framework that analyzes diffusion trajectories for this purpose. Specifically, we demonstrate that temporal dynamics across the entire trajectory allow for more robust classification and challenge the widely-adopted "Goldilocks zone" conjecture, which posits that membership inference is effective only within narrow denoising stages. More fundamentally, we expose critical flaws in current membership inference practices by showing that representative methods fail under distribution shifts or when model-generated data is present. For model attribution, we demonstrate a first white-box approach directly applicable to diffusion. Ultimately, we propose the unification of data provenance into a single, cohesive framework tailored to modern generative systems.</p></details> |  |

Existing real datasets fit real-world scenarios, capturing authentic road object behaviors, however, they typically lack precise ground-truth annotations. In contrast, synthetic datasets play a crucial role, allowing for the annotation of a large number of frames without additional costs or extra time. However, a general drawback of synthetic datasets is the lack of realistic vehicle motion, since trajectories are generated using AI models or rule-based systems. In this work, we introduce R3ST (Realistic 3D Synthetic Trajectories), a synthetic dataset that overcomes this limitation by generating a synthetic 3D environment and integrating real-world trajectories derived from SinD, a bird's-eye-view dataset recorded from drone footage. The proposed dataset closes the gap between synthetic data and realistic trajectories, advancing the research in trajectory forecasting of road vehicles, offering both accurate multimodal ground-truth annotations and authentic human-driven vehicle trajectories.</p></details> |  |

The environment of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) presents unique challenges when planning inspection operations that maximise visibility, information, and data quality. Specular reflection of sunlight from spacecraft bodies, self-shadowing, and dynamic lighting in LEO significantly impact the quality of data captured throughout an orbit. This is exacerbated by the relative motion between spacecraft, which introduces variable imaging distances and attitudes during inspection. Planning inspection trajectories with the aide of simulation is a common approach. However, the ability to design and optimise an inspection trajectory specifically to improve the resulting image quality in proximity operations remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present $\partial$LITE, an end-to-end differentiable simulation pipeline for on-orbit inspection operations. We leverage state-of-the-art differentiable rendering tools and a custom orbit propagator to enable end-to-end optimisation of orbital parameters based on visual sensor data. $\partial$LITE enables us to automatically design non-obvious trajectories, vastly improving the quality and usefulness of attained data. To our knowledge, our differentiable inspection-planning pipeline is the first of its kind and provides new insights into modern computational approaches to spacecraft mission planning.

However, existing learning-based methods exhibit three key limitations: (1) insufficient modeling of trajectory semantics and hierarchy, lacking both movement dynamics extraction and multi-scale structural representation; (2) high computational costs due to point-wise encoding; and (3) use of physically implausible augmentations that distort trajectory semantics. To address these issues, we propose MovSemCL, a movement-semantics contrastive learning framework for trajectory similarity computation. MovSemCL first transforms raw GPS trajectories into movement-semantics features and then segments them into patches. Next, MovSemCL employs intra- and inter-patch attentions to encode local as well as global trajectory patterns, enabling efficient hierarchical representation and reducing computational costs. Moreover, MovSemCL includes a curvature-guided augmentation strategy that preserves informative segments (e.g., turns and intersections) and masks redundant ones, generating physically plausible augmented views. Experiments on real-world datasets show that MovSemCL is capable of outperforming state-of-the-art methods, achieving mean ranks close to the ideal value of 1 at similarity search tasks and improvements by up to 20.3% at heuristic approximation, while reducing inference latency by up to 43.4%.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures; accepted by AAAI 2026 as an Oral paper</p></details> |

In this work, we investigate the trade-off through empirical studies, yielding two key observations. First, we discover the reward clustering phenomenon in which many trajectories collapse toward the group-mean reward, offering limited optimization value. Second, we design a heuristic strategy named Optimal Variance Filtering (OVF), and verify that a high-variance subset of trajectories, selected by OVF can outperform the larger, unfiltered group. However, this static, post-sampling OVF approach still necessitates critical computational overhead, as it performs unnecessary sampling for trajectories that are ultimately discarded. To resolve this, we propose Pro-GRPO (Proactive GRPO), a novel dynamic framework that integrates latent feature-based trajectory pruning into the sampling process. Through the early termination of reward-clustered trajectories, Pro-GRPO reduces computational overhead. Leveraging its efficiency, Pro-GRPO employs an "Expand-and-Prune" strategy. This strategy first expands the size of initial sampling group to maximize trajectory diversity, then it applies multi-step OVF to the latents, avoiding prohibitive computational costs. Extensive experiments on both diffusion-based and flow-based models demonstrate the generality and effectiveness of our Pro-GRPO framework.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |

In contrast to methods that rely on variational autoencoders (VAEs) to generate discrete occupancy tokens, which inherently limit representational capacity, our approach predicts multi-frame future occupancy in an end-to-end manner directly from raw image features. Inspired by the success of attention-based transformer architectures in foundational vision and language models such as GPT and VGGT, we employ a sparse occupancy representation that bypasses the intermediate bird's eye view (BEV) projection and its explicit geometric priors. This design allows the transformer to capture spatiotemporal dependencies more effectively. By avoiding both the finite-capacity constraint of discrete tokenization and the structural limitations of BEV representations, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes benchmark for 1-3 second occupancy forecasting, outperforming existing approaches by a significant margin. Furthermore, it demonstrates robust scene dynamics understanding, consistently delivering high accuracy under arbitrary future trajectory conditioning.</p></details> |  |

However, their vulnerability to adversarial perturbations poses significant risks, especially in Federated Learning (FL) settings where identical models are distributed across thousands of clients. While adversarial training is a strong defense, it is difficult to apply in FL due to strict client-data privacy constraints and the limited compute available on edge devices. In this work, we introduce TrajSyn, a privacy-preserving framework that enables effective server-side adversarial training by synthesizing a proxy dataset from the trajectories of client model updates, without accessing raw client data. We show that TrajSyn consistently improves adversarial robustness on image classification benchmarks with no extra compute burden on the client device.</p></details> |  |

With consideration of this, a number of recent neural network models leverage inductive biases from classical mechanics to encourage model interpretability and ensure forecasted states are physical. However, in general, these models are designed to capture the dynamics of a single system with fixed physical parameters, from state-space measurements of a known configuration space. In this paper we introduce Symplectic Phase Space GAN (SPS-GAN) which can capture the dynamics of multiple systems, and generalize to unseen physical parameters from. Moreover, SPS-GAN does not require prior knowledge of the system configuration space. In fact, SPS-GAN can discover the configuration space structure of the system from arbitrary measurement types (e.g., state-space measurements, video frames). To achieve physically plausible generation, we introduce a novel architecture which embeds a Hamiltonian neural network recurrent module in a conditional GAN backbone. To discover the structure of the configuration space, we optimize the conditional time-series GAN objective with an additional physically motivated term to encourages a sparse representation of the configuration space. We demonstrate the utility of SPS-GAN for trajectory prediction, video generation and symmetry discovery. Our approach captures multiple systems and achieves performance on par with supervised models designed for single systems.</p></details> |  |

Existing trajectory planners exhibit systematic failures in these scenarios due to data imbalance. This results in insufficient modelling of vehicle dynamics, road geometry, and environmental constraints in high-risk situations, leading to suboptimal or unsafe trajectory prediction when vehicles operate near their physical limits. In this paper, we introduce ReflexDiffusion, a novel inference-stage framework that enhances diffusion-based trajectory planners through reflective adjustment. Our method introduces a gradient-based adjustment mechanism during the iterative denoising process: after each standard trajectory update, we compute the gradient between the conditional and unconditional noise predictions to explicitly amplify critical conditioning signals, including road curvature and lateral vehicle dynamics. This amplification enforces strict adherence to physical constraints, particularly improving stability during high-lateral-acceleration maneuvers where precise vehicle-road interaction is paramount. Evaluated on the nuPlan Test14-hard benchmark, ReflexDiffusion achieves a 14.1% improvement in driving score for high-lateral-acceleration scenarios over the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. This demonstrates that inference-time trajectory optimization can effectively compensate for training data sparsity by dynamically reinforcing safety-critical constraints near handling limits. The framework's architecture-agnostic design enables direct deployment to existing diffusion-based planners, offering a practical solution for improving autonomous vehicle safety in challenging driving conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |

Existing Large Language Models (LLMs) unlearning approaches that typically focus on modifying only final answers are insufficient for LRMs, as they fail to remove sensitive content from intermediate steps, leading to persistent privacy leakage and degraded security. To address these challenges, we propose Sensitive Trajectory Regulation (STaR), a parameter-free, inference-time unlearning framework that achieves robust privacy protection throughout the reasoning process. Specifically, we first identify sensitive content via semantic-aware detection. Then, we inject global safety constraints through secure prompt prefix. Next, we perform trajectory-aware suppression to dynamically block sensitive content across the entire reasoning chain. Finally, we apply token-level adaptive filtering to prevent both exact and paraphrased sensitive tokens during generation. Furthermore, to overcome the inadequacies of existing evaluation protocols, we introduce two metrics: Multi-Decoding Consistency Assessment (MCS), which measures the consistency of unlearning across diverse decoding strategies, and Multi-Granularity Membership Inference Attack (MIA) Evaluation, which quantifies privacy protection at both answer and reasoning-chain levels. Experiments on the R-TOFU benchmark demonstrate that STaR achieves comprehensive and stable unlearning with minimal utility loss, setting a new standard for privacy-preserving reasoning in LRMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Online Trajectory Optimization for Arbitrary-Shaped Mobile Robots via Polynomial Separating Hypersurfaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09231v1)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An emerging class of trajectory optimization methods enforces collision avoidance by jointly optimizing the robot's configuration and a separating hyperplane. However, as linear separators only apply to convex sets, these methods require convex approximations of both the robot and obstacles, which becomes an overly conservative assumption in cluttered and narrow environments. In this work, we unequivocally remove this limitation by introducing nonlinear separating hypersurfaces parameterized by polynomial functions. We first generalize the classical separating hyperplane theorem and prove that any two disjoint bounded closed sets in Euclidean space can be separated by a polynomial hypersurface, serving as the theoretical foundation for nonlinear separation of arbitrary geometries. Building on this result, we formulate a nonlinear programming (NLP) problem that jointly optimizes the robot's trajectory and the coefficients of the separating polynomials, enabling geometry-aware collision avoidance without conservative convex simplifications. The optimization remains efficiently solvable using standard NLP solvers. Simulation and real-world experiments with nonconvex robots demonstrate that our method achieves smooth, collision-free, and agile maneuvers in environments where convex-approximation baselines fail.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiffMM: Efficient Method for Accurate Noisy and Sparse Trajectory Map Matching via One Step Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08482v1)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Map matching for sparse trajectories is a fundamental problem for many trajectory-based applications, e.g., traffic scheduling and traffic flow analysis. Existing methods for map matching are generally based on Hidden Markov Model (HMM) or encoder-decoder framework. However, these methods continue to face significant challenges when handling noisy or sparsely sampled GPS trajectories. To address these limitations, we propose DiffMM, an encoder-diffusion-based map matching framework that produces effective yet efficient matching results through a one-step diffusion process. We first introduce a road segment-aware trajectory encoder that jointly embeds the input trajectory and its surrounding candidate road segments into a shared latent space through an attention mechanism. Next, we propose a one step diffusion method to realize map matching through a shortcut model by leveraging the joint embedding of the trajectory and candidate road segments as conditioning context. We conduct extensive experiments on large-scale trajectory datasets, demonstrating that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art map matching methods in terms of both accuracy and efficiency, particularly for sparse trajectories and complex road network topologies.</p></details> | AAAI-26 |
| **[CASHEW: Stabilizing Multimodal Reasoning via Iterative Trajectory Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08010v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models achieve strong performance across a wide range of multimodal understanding and reasoning tasks, yet their multi-step reasoning remains unstable. Repeated sampling over the same input often produces divergent reasoning trajectories and inconsistent final predictions. To address this, we introduce two complementary approaches inspired by test-time scaling: (1) CASHEW, an inference-time framework that stabilizes reasoning by iteratively aggregating multiple candidate trajectories into higher-quality reasoning traces, with explicit visual verification filtering hallucinated steps and grounding reasoning in visual evidence, and (2) CASHEW-RL, a learned variant that internalizes this aggregation behavior within a single model. CASHEW-RL is trained using Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO) with a composite reward that encourages correct answers grounded in minimal yet sufficient visual evidence, while adaptively allocating reasoning effort based on task difficulty. This training objective enables robust self-aggregation at inference. Extensive experiments on 13 image understanding, video understanding, and video reasoning benchmarks show significant performance improvements, including gains of up to +23.6 percentage points on ScienceQA and +8.1 percentage points on EgoSchema.</p></details> |  |
| **[d3LLM: Ultra-Fast Diffusion LLM using Pseudo-Trajectory Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07568v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) offer capabilities beyond those of autoregressive (AR) LLMs, such as parallel decoding and random-order generation. However, realizing these benefits in practice is non-trivial, as dLLMs inherently face an accuracy-parallelism trade-off. Despite increasing interest, existing methods typically focus on only one-side of the coin, targeting either efficiency or performance. To address this limitation, we propose d3LLM (Pseudo-Distilled Diffusion Large Language Model), striking a balance between accuracy and parallelism: (i) during training, we introduce pseudo-trajectory distillation to teach the model which tokens can be decoded confidently at early steps, thereby improving parallelism; (ii) during inference, we employ entropy-based multi-block decoding with a KV-cache refresh mechanism to achieve high parallelism while maintaining accuracy. To better evaluate dLLMs, we also introduce AUP (Accuracy Under Parallelism), a new metric that jointly measures accuracy and parallelism. Experiments demonstrate that our d3LLM achieves up to 10$\times$ speedup over vanilla LLaDA/Dream and 5$\times$ speedup over AR models without much accuracy drop. Our code is available at https://github.com/hao-ai-lab/d3LLM.</p></details> |  |
| **[BiTrajDiff: Bidirectional Trajectory Generation with Diffusion Models for Offline Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05762v4)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) have proven that effective policy learning can benefit from imposing conservative constraints on pre-collected datasets. However, such static datasets often exhibit distribution bias, resulting in limited generalizability. To address this limitation, a straightforward solution is data augmentation (DA), which leverages generative models to enrich data distribution. Despite the promising results, current DA techniques focus solely on reconstructing future trajectories from given states, while ignoring the exploration of history transitions that reach them. This single-direction paradigm inevitably hinders the discovery of diverse behavior patterns, especially those leading to critical states that may have yielded high-reward outcomes. In this work, we introduce Bidirectional Trajectory Diffusion (BiTrajDiff), a novel DA framework for offline RL that models both future and history trajectories from any intermediate states. Specifically, we decompose the trajectory generation task into two independent yet complementary diffusion processes: one generating forward trajectories to predict future dynamics, and the other generating backward trajectories to trace essential history transitions.BiTrajDiff can efficiently leverage critical states as anchors to expand into potentially valuable yet underexplored regions of the state space, thereby facilitating dataset diversity. Extensive experiments on the D4RL benchmark suite demonstrate that BiTrajDiff achieves superior performance compared to other advanced DA methods across various offline RL backbones.</p></details> |  |
| **[PsyCLIENT: Client Simulation via Conversational Trajectory Modeling for Trainee Practice and Model Evaluation in Mental Health Counseling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07312v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-based client simulation has emerged as a promising tool for training novice counselors and evaluating automated counseling systems. However, existing client simulation approaches face three key challenges: (1) limited diversity and realism in client profiles, (2) the lack of a principled framework for modeling realistic client behaviors, and (3) a scarcity in Chinese-language settings. To address these limitations, we propose PsyCLIENT, a novel simulation framework grounded in conversational trajectory modeling. By conditioning LLM generation on predefined real-world trajectories that incorporate explicit behavior labels and content constraints, our approach ensures diverse and realistic interactions. We further introduce PsyCLIENT-CP, the first open-source Chinese client profile dataset, covering 60 distinct counseling topics. Comprehensive evaluations involving licensed professional counselors demonstrate that PsyCLIENT significantly outperforms baselines in terms of authenticity and training effectiveness. Notably, the simulated clients are nearly indistinguishable from human clients, achieving an about 95\% expert confusion rate in discrimination tasks. These findings indicate that conversational trajectory modeling effectively bridges the gap between theoretical client profiles and dynamic, realistic simulations, offering a robust solution for mental health education and research. Code and data will be released to facilitate future research in mental health counseling.</p></details> |  |
| **[VISTA: Knowledge-Driven Interpretable Vessel Trajectory Imputation via Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06940v1)** | 2026-01-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Automatic Identification System provides critical information for maritime navigation and safety, yet its trajectories are often incomplete due to signal loss or deliberate tampering. Existing imputation methods emphasize trajectory recovery, paying limited attention to interpretability and failing to provide underlying knowledge that benefits downstream tasks such as anomaly detection and route planning. We propose knowledge-driven interpretable vessel trajectory imputation (VISTA), the first trajectory imputation framework that offers interpretability while simultaneously providing underlying knowledge to support downstream analysis. Specifically, we first define underlying knowledge as a combination of Structured Data-derived Knowledge (SDK) distilled from AIS data and Implicit LLM Knowledge acquired from large-scale Internet corpora. Second, to manage and leverage the SDK effectively at scale, we develop a data-knowledge-data loop that employs a Structured Data-derived Knowledge Graph for SDK extraction and knowledge-driven trajectory imputation. Third, to efficiently process large-scale AIS data, we introduce a workflow management layer that coordinates the end-to-end pipeline, enabling parallel knowledge extraction and trajectory imputation with anomaly handling and redundancy elimination. Experiments on two large AIS datasets show that VISTA is capable of state-of-the-art imputation accuracy and computational efficiency, improving over state-of-the-art baselines by 5%-94% and reducing time cost by 51%-93%, while producing interpretable knowledge cues that benefit downstream tasks. The source code and implementation details of VISTA are publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 13 figures, 3 algorithms, 5 tables.

| **[Mobility Trajectories from Network-Driven Markov Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06020v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a generative model of human mobility in which trajectories arise as realizations of a prescribed, time-dependent Markov dynamics defined on a spatial interaction network. The model constructs a hierarchical routing structure with hubs, corridors, feeder paths, and metro links, and specifies transition matrices using gravity-type distance decay combined with externally imposed temporal schedules and directional biases. Population mass evolves as indistinguishable, memoryless movers performing a single transition per time step. When aggregated, the resulting trajectories reproduce structured origin-destination flows that reflect network geometry, temporal modulation, and connectivity constraints. By applying the Perron-Frobenius theorem to the daily evolution operator, we identify a unique periodic invariant population distribution that serves as a natural non-transient reference state. We verify consistency between trajectory-level realizations and multi-step Markov dynamics, showing that discrepancies are entirely attributable to finite-population sampling. The framework provides a network-centric, privacy-preserving approach to generating mobility trajectories and studying time-elapsed flow structure without invoking individual-level behavioral assumptions.</p></details> | 22 pages, 6 figures |

This pattern is also often observed within-seasons, as an athlete aims for their performance to peak at key events such as the Olympic Games or World Championships. A Bayesian hierarchical model is developed to analyse the evolution of athletic sporting performance throughout an athlete's career and separate these effects whilst allowing for confounding factors such as environmental conditions. Our model works in continuous time and estimates both $g(t)$, the average performance level of the population at age $t$, and $f_i(t)$, the difference of the $i$-th athlete from this average. We further decompose $f_i(t)$ into a season-to-season trajectory and a within-season trajectory, which is modelled by a restricted Bernstein polynomial. The model is fitted using an adaptive Metropolis-within-Gibbs algorithm with a carefully chosen blocking scheme. The model allows us to understand seasonal patterns in athlete performance, how these differ between athletes, and provides individual fitted and trend performance trajectories. The properties of the model are illustrated using a simulation study and an application to 100 metres and 200 metres freestyle swimming for both female and male athletes.</p></details> |  |
| **[iReasoner: Trajectory-Aware Intrinsic Reasoning Supervision for Self-Evolving Large Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05877v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work shows that large multimodal models (LMMs) can self-improve from unlabeled data via self-play and intrinsic feedback. Yet existing self-evolving frameworks mainly reward final outcomes, leaving intermediate reasoning weakly constrained despite its importance for visually grounded decision making. We propose iReasoner, a self-evolving framework that improves an LMM's implicit reasoning by explicitly eliciting chain-of-thought (CoT) and rewarding its internal agreement. In a Proposer--Solver loop over unlabeled images, iReasoner augments outcome-level intrinsic rewards with a trajectory-aware signal defined over intermediate reasoning steps, providing learning signals that distinguish reasoning paths leading to the same answer without ground-truth labels or external judges. Starting from Qwen2.5-VL-7B, iReasoner yields up to $+2.1$ points across diverse multimodal reasoning benchmarks under fully unsupervised post-training. We hope this work serves as a starting point for reasoning-aware self-improvement in LMMs in purely unsupervised settings.</p></details> |  |

However, we find that directly applying these techniques to image-to-video (I2V) models often fails to yield consistent reward improvements. To address this limitation, we present TAGRPO, a robust post-training framework for I2V models inspired by contrastive learning. Our approach is grounded in the observation that rollout videos generated from identical initial noise provide superior guidance for optimization. Leveraging this insight, we propose a novel GRPO loss applied to intermediate latents, encouraging direct alignment with high-reward trajectories while maximizing distance from low-reward counterparts. Furthermore, we introduce a memory bank for rollout videos to enhance diversity and reduce computational overhead. Despite its simplicity, TAGRPO achieves significant improvements over DanceGRPO in I2V generation.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures |

Here we analyzed 97,564 longitudinal PASC assessments from 13,511 participants with linked vaccination histories to disentangle passive temporal progression from vaccine-associated change. Using a clinically validated threshold (PASC $\geq 12$), trajectories separated into three phenotypes: Protected (persistently sub-threshold), Refractory (persistently symptomatic), and Responders (transitioning from symptomatic to recovered). Across the full cohort, symptom severity increased modestly with elapsed time ($r=0.0521$, $P=1.26\times10^{-59}$), whereas cumulative vaccination showed an inverse association with severity ($r=-0.0434$, $P=5.95\times10^{-42}$). In summary, baseline Long COVID severity appears clinically deterministic. In the absence of intervention, symptoms typically persist without spontaneous resolution. Recovery is primarily associated with repeated immunization.</p></details> |  |
| **[TAPM-Net: Trajectory-Aware Perturbation Modeling for Infrared Small Target Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05446v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Infrared small target detection (ISTD) remains a long-standing challenge due to weak signal contrast, limited spatial extent, and cluttered backgrounds. Despite performance improvements from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs), current models lack a mechanism to trace how small targets trigger directional, layer-wise perturbations in the feature space, which is an essential cue for distinguishing signal from structured noise in infrared scenes. To address this limitation, we propose the Trajectory-Aware Mamba Propagation Network (TAPM-Net), which explicitly models the spatial diffusion behavior of target-induced feature disturbances. TAPM-Net is built upon two novel components: a Perturbation-guided Path Module (PGM) and a Trajectory-Aware State Block (TASB). The PGM constructs perturbation energy fields from multi-level features and extracts gradient-following feature trajectories that reflect the directionality of local responses. The resulting feature trajectories are fed into the TASB, a Mamba-based state-space unit that models dynamic propagation along each trajectory while incorporating velocity-constrained diffusion and semantically aligned feature fusion from word-level and sentence-level embeddings. Unlike existing attention-based methods, TAPM-Net enables anisotropic, context-sensitive state transitions along spatial trajectories while maintaining global coherence at low computational cost. Experiments on NUAA-SIRST and IRSTD-1K demonstrate that TAPM-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance in ISTD.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in BMVC 2025 see: https://bmva-archive.org.uk/bmvc/2025/assets/papers/Paper_709/paper.pdf.

We aim to endow computational systems with a similar ability to predict plausible future object motions directly from passive visual observation. We introduce ObjectForesight, a 3D object-centric dynamics model that predicts future 6-DoF poses and trajectories of rigid objects from short egocentric video sequences. Unlike conventional world or dynamics models that operate in pixel or latent space, ObjectForesight represents the world explicitly in 3D at the object level, enabling geometrically grounded and temporally coherent predictions that capture object affordances and trajectories. To train such a model at scale, we leverage recent advances in segmentation, mesh reconstruction, and 3D pose estimation to curate a dataset of 2 million plus short clips with pseudo-ground-truth 3D object trajectories. Through extensive experiments, we show that ObjectForesight achieves significant gains in accuracy, geometric consistency, and generalization to unseen objects and scenes, establishing a scalable framework for learning physically grounded, object-centric dynamics models directly from observation. objectforesight.github.io</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

Remote assistance concepts, where operators provide discrete inputs to aid specific automation modules like planning, is gaining interest due to its reduced workload on the human remote operator and improved safety. However, these concepts are challenging to implement and maintain due to their deep integration and interaction with the automated driving system. In this paper, we propose a solution to facilitate the implementation of remote assistance concepts that intervene on planning level and extend the operational design domain of the vehicle at runtime. Using arbitration graphs, a modular decision-making framework, we integrate remote assistance into an existing automated driving system without modifying the original software components. Our simulative implementation demonstrates this approach in two use cases, allowing operators to adjust planner constraints and enable trajectory generation beyond nominal operational design domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 8 figures, presented at IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium 2025, video demonstration available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVSO-YOeGMk</p></details> |

This study extends the scope to online refinement of the entire capacity fade trajectory (CFT) through EntroLnn, a framework based on entropy-guided transformable liquid neural networks (LNNs). EntroLnn treats CFT refinement as an integrated process rather than two independent tasks for pointwise SoH and EoL. We introduce entropy-based features derived from online temperature fields, applied for the first time in battery analytics, and combine them with customized LNNs that model temporal battery dynamics effectively. The framework enhances both static and dynamic adaptability of LNNs and achieves robust and generalizable CFT refinement across different batteries and operating conditions. The approach provides a high fidelity battery health model with lightweight computation, achieving mean absolute errors of only 0.004577 for CFT and 18 cycles for EoL prediction. This work establishes a foundation for entropy-informed learning in battery analytics and enables self-adaptive, lightweight, and interpretable battery health prediction in practical battery management systems.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

In this study, we provide a multilinguistic, large-scale assessment of this similarity by systematically comparing 16 publicly available pretrained LLMs with human brain responses during natural language processing tasks in both English and Chinese. Specifically, we use ridge regression to assess the representational similarity between LLM embeddings and electroencephalography (EEG) signals, and analyze the similarity between the "neural trajectory" and the "LLM latent trajectory." This method captures key dynamic patterns, such as magnitude, angle, uncertainty, and confidence. Our findings highlight both similarities and crucial differences in processing strategies: (1) We show that middle-to-high layers of LLMs are central to semantic integration and correspond to the N400 component observed in EEG; (2) The brain exhibits continuous and iterative processing during reading, whereas LLMs often show discrete, stage-end bursts of activity, which suggests a stark contrast in their real-time semantic processing dynamics. This study could offer new insights into LLMs and neural processing, and also establish a critical framework for future investigations into the alignment between artificial intelligence and biological intelligence.</p></details> |  |

However, existing pruning methods typically rely on sequential revisions driven by unreliable critique signals, often failing to detect the loss of answer-critical data. To address this limitation, we propose TabTrim, a novel table pruning framework which transforms table pruning from sequential revisions to gold trajectory-supervised parallel search. TabTrim derives a gold pruning trajectory using the intermediate sub-tables in the execution process of gold SQL queries, and trains a pruner and a verifier to make the step-wise pruning result align with the gold pruning trajectory. During inference, TabTrim performs parallel search to explore multiple candidate pruning trajectories and identify the optimal sub-table. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TabTrim achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse tabular reasoning tasks: TabTrim-8B reaches 73.5% average accuracy, outperforming the strongest baseline by 3.2%, including 79.4% on WikiTQ and 61.2% on TableBench.</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures |

While text-based affect inference has become increasingly feasible, prior approaches often treat sentiment as a deterministic point estimate for individual speakers, failing to capture the inherent subjectivity, latent ambiguity, and sequential coupling found in mutual exchanges. We introduce LLM-MC-Affect, a probabilistic framework that characterizes emotion not as a static label, but as a continuous latent probability distribution defined over an affective space. By leveraging stochastic LLM decoding and Monte Carlo estimation, the methodology approximates these distributions to derive high-fidelity sentiment trajectories that explicitly quantify both central affective tendencies and perceptual ambiguity. These trajectories enable a structured analysis of interpersonal coupling through sequential cross-correlation and slope-based indicators, identifying leading or lagging influences between interlocutors. To validate the interpretive capacity of this approach, we utilize teacher-student instructional dialogues as a representative case study, where our quantitative indicators successfully distill high-level interaction insights such as effective scaffolding. This work establishes a scalable and deployable pathway for understanding interpersonal dynamics, offering a generalizable solution that extends beyond education to broader social and behavioral research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting Continuous-Time Trajectory Estimation via Gaussian Processes and the Magnus Expansion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03360v1)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continuous-time state estimation has been shown to be an effective means of (i) handling asynchronous and high-rate measurements, (ii) introducing smoothness to the estimate, (iii) post hoc querying the estimate at times other than those of the measurements, and (iv) addressing certain observability issues related to scanning-while-moving sensors. A popular means of representing the trajectory in continuous time is via a Gaussian process (GP) prior, with the prior's mean and covariance functions generated by a linear time-varying (LTV) stochastic differential equation (SDE) driven by white noise. When the state comprises elements of Lie groups, previous works have resorted to a patchwork of local GPs each with a linear time-invariant SDE kernel, which while effective in practice, lacks theoretical elegance. Here we revisit the full LTV GP approach to continuous-time trajectory estimation, deriving a global GP prior on Lie groups via the Magnus expansion, which offers a more elegant and general solution. We provide a numerical comparison between the two approaches and discuss their relative merits.</p></details> | 21 pages, 12 figures |

The controller is formulated in the dual quaternion framework and operates at the velocity level, assuming direct command of angular and linear velocities, as is standard in many aerial vehicles and omnidirectional mobile robots. Gaussian Process (GP) regression is integrated into a geometric feedback law to learn and compensate online for unknown, state-dependent disturbances and modeling imperfections affecting both attitude and position, while preserving the algebraic structure and coupling properties inherent to rigid-body motion. The proposed approach does not rely on explicit parametric models of the unknown effects, making it well-suited for robotic systems subject to sensor-induced disturbances, unmodeled actuation couplings, and environmental uncertainties. A Lyapunov-based analysis establishes probabilistic ultimate boundedness of the pose tracking error under bounded GP uncertainty, providing formal stability guarantees for the learning-based controller. Simulation results demonstrate accurate and smooth trajectory tracking in the presence of realistic, localized disturbances, including correlated rotational and translational effects arising from magnetometer perturbations. These results illustrate the potential of combining geometric modeling and probabilistic learning to achieve robust, data-efficient pose control for autonomous robotic systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fast Surrogate Models for Adaptive Aircraft Trajectory Prediction in En route Airspace](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03075v1)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction (TP) is crucial for ensuring safety and efficiency in modern air traffic management systems. It is, for example, a core component of conflict detection and resolution tools, arrival sequencing algorithms, capacity planning, as well as several future concepts. However, TP accuracy within operational systems is hampered by a range of epistemic uncertainties such as the mass and performance settings of aircraft and the effect of meteorological conditions on aircraft performance. It can also require considerable computational resources. This paper proposes a method for adaptive TP that has two components: first, a fast surrogate TP model based on linear state space models (LSSM)s with an execution time that was 6.7 times lower on average than an implementation of the Base of Aircraft Data (BADA) in Python. It is demonstrated that such models can effectively emulate the BADA aircraft performance model, which is based on the numerical solution of a partial differential equation (PDE), and that the LSSMs can be fitted to trajectories in a dataset of historic flight data. Secondly, the paper proposes an algorithm to assimilate radar observations using particle filtering to adaptively refine TP accuracy. Comparison with baselines using BADA and Kalman filtering demonstrate that the proposed framework improves system identification and state estimation for both climb and descent phases, with 46.3% and 64.7% better estimates for time to top of climb and bottom of descent compared to the best performing benchmark model. In particular, the particle filtering approach provides the flexibility to capture non-linear performance effects including the CAS-Mach transition.</p></details> |  |
| **[Chain-of-Action: Trajectory Autoregressive Modeling for Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09990v2)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Chain-of-Action (CoA), a novel visuo-motor policy paradigm built upon Trajectory Autoregressive Modeling. Unlike conventional approaches that predict next step action(s) forward, CoA generates an entire trajectory by explicit backward reasoning with task-specific goals through an action-level Chain-of-Thought (CoT) process. This process is unified within a single autoregressive structure: (1) the first token corresponds to a stable keyframe action that encodes the task-specific goals; and (2) subsequent action tokens are generated autoregressively, conditioned on the initial keyframe and previously predicted actions. This backward action reasoning enforces a global-to-local structure, allowing each local action to be tightly constrained by the final goal. To further realize the action reasoning structure, CoA incorporates four complementary designs: continuous action token representation; dynamic stopping for variable-length trajectory generation; reverse temporal ensemble; and multi-token prediction to balance action chunk modeling with global structure. As a result, CoA gives strong spatial generalization capabilities while preserving the flexibility and simplicity of a visuo-motor policy. Empirically, we observe CoA achieves the state-of-the-art performance across 60 RLBench tasks and 8 real-world manipulation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Swept Volume-Based Trajectory Generation for Arbitrary-Shaped Ground Robot Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07554v2)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Navigating an arbitrary-shaped ground robot safely in cluttered environments remains a challenging problem. The existing trajectory planners that account for the robot's physical geometry severely suffer from the intractable runtime. To achieve both computational efficiency and Continuous Collision Avoidance (CCA) of arbitrary-shaped ground robot planning, we proposed a novel coarse-to-fine navigation framework that significantly accelerates planning. In the first stage, a sampling-based method selectively generates distinct topological paths that guarantee a minimum inflated margin. In the second stage, a geometry-aware front-end strategy is designed to discretize these topologies into full-state robot motion sequences while concurrently partitioning the paths into SE(2) sub-problems and simpler R2 sub-problems for back-end optimization. In the final stage, an SVSDF-based optimizer generates trajectories tailored to these sub-problems and seamlessly splices them into a continuous final motion plan. Extensive benchmark comparisons show that the proposed method is one to several orders of magnitude faster than the cutting-edge methods in runtime while maintaining a high planning success rate and ensuring CCA.</p></details> |  |
| **[Q-Regularized Generative Auto-Bidding: From Suboptimal Trajectories to Optimal Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02754v1)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of e-commerce, auto-bidding has become a key asset in optimizing advertising performance under diverse advertiser environments. The current approaches focus on reinforcement learning (RL) and generative models. These efforts imitate offline historical behaviors by utilizing a complex structure with expensive hyperparameter tuning. The suboptimal trajectories further exacerbate the difficulty of policy learning. To address these challenges, we proposes QGA, a novel Q-value regularized Generative Auto-bidding method. In QGA, we propose to plug a Q-value regularization with double Q-learning strategy into the Decision Transformer backbone. This design enables joint optimization of policy imitation and action-value maximization, allowing the learned bidding policy to both leverage experience from the dataset and alleviate the adverse impact of the suboptimal trajectories. Furthermore, to safely explore the policy space beyond the data distribution, we propose a Q-value guided dual-exploration mechanism, in which the DT model is conditioned on multiple return-to-go targets and locally perturbed actions. This entire exploration process is dynamically guided by the aforementioned Q-value module, which provides principled evaluation for each candidate action. Experiments on public benchmarks and simulation environments demonstrate that QGA consistently achieves superior or highly competitive results compared to existing alternatives. Notably, in large-scale real-world A/B testing, QGA achieves a 3.27% increase in Ad GMV and a 2.49% improvement in Ad ROI.</p></details> | <details><summary>11pag...</summary><p>11pages, 5figures, In Proceedings of the 32nd ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining</p></details> |

As a result, tracking aggressive trajectories accurately could be challenging due to the existence of residual physics during controller synthesis. This paper presents a self-supervised residual learning and trajectory optimization framework to address the aforementioned challenges. At first, unknown dynamic effects on the closed-loop model are learned and treated as residuals of the nominal dynamics, jointly forming a hybrid model. We show that learning with analytic gradients can be achieved using only trajectory-level data while enjoying accurate long-horizon prediction with an arbitrary integration step size. Subsequently, a trajectory optimizer is developed to compute the optimal reference trajectory with the residual physics along it minimized. It ends up with trajectories that are friendly to the following control level. The agile flight of quadrotors illustrates that by utilizing the hybrid dynamics, the proposed optimizer outputs aggressive motions that can be precisely tracked.</p></details> | 10 pages, 9 figures |

It is well known that the effectiveness of such methods depends crucially on the relative correlations and computational costs of the available computational models. However, the question of how to automatically tune low-fidelity models to maximize performance remains an open area of research. This work investigates automated model tuning, which optimizes model hyperparameters to minimize estimator variance within a target computational budget. Focusing on multifidelity trajectory simulation estimators, the cost-versus-precision tradeoff enabled by this approach is demonstrated in a practical, online setting where upfront tuning costs cannot be amortized. Using a real-world entry, descent, and landing example, it is shown that automated model tuning largely outperforms hand-tuned models even when the overall computational budget is relatively low. Furthermore, for scenarios where the computational budget is large, model tuning solutions can approach the best-case multifidelity estimator performance where optimal model hyperparameters are known a priori. Recommendations for applying model tuning in practice are provided and avenues for enabling adoption of such approaches for budget-constrained problems are highlighted.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages with 15 figures in main text</p></details> |

A recurring practical issue is that standard mini-batch training can be unstable when trajectory lengths are highly heterogeneous, which in turn degrades \emph{distribution matching} for trajectory-derived statistics. We propose \textbf{length-aware sampling (LAS)}, a simple batching strategy that groups trajectories by length and samples batches from a single length bucket, reducing within-batch length heterogeneity (and making updates more consistent) without changing the model class. We integrate LAS into a conditional trajectory GAN with auxiliary time-alignment losses and provide (i) a distribution-level guarantee for derived variables under mild boundedness assumptions, and (ii) an IPM/Wasserstein mechanism explaining why LAS improves distribution matching by removing length-only shortcut critics and targeting within-bucket discrepancies. Empirically, LAS consistently improves matching of derived-variable distributions on a multi-mall dataset of shopper trajectories and on diverse public sequence datasets (GPS, education, e-commerce, and movies), outperforming random sampling across dataset-specific metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Classification Network Guided Trajectory Planning for Four-Wheel Independent Steering Autonomous Parking Considering Obstacle Attributes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18836v2)** | 2026-01-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Four-wheel Independent Steering (4WIS) vehicles have attracted increasing attention for their superior maneuverability. Human drivers typically choose to cross or drive over the low-profile obstacles (e.g., plastic bags) to efficiently navigate through narrow spaces, while existing planners neglect obstacle attributes, leading to suboptimal efficiency or planning failures. To address this issue, we propose a novel multimodal trajectory planning framework that employs a neural network for scene perception, combines 4WIS hybrid A* search to generate a warm start, and utilizes an optimal control problem (OCP) for trajectory optimization. Specifically, a multimodal perception network fusing visual information and vehicle states is employed to capture semantic and contextual scene understanding, enabling the planner to adapt the strategy according to scene complexity (hard or easy task). For hard tasks, guided points are introduced to decompose complex tasks into local subtasks, improving the search efficiency. The multiple steering modes of 4WIS vehicles, Ackermann, diagonal, and zero-turn, are also incorporated as kinematically feasible motion primitives. Moreover, a hierarchical obstacle handling strategy, which categorizes obstacles as "non-traversable", "crossable", and "drive-over", is incorporated into the node expansion process, explicitly linking obstacle attributes to planning actions to enable efficient decisions. Furthermore, to address dynamic obstacles with motion uncertainty, we introduce a probabilistic risk field model, constructing risk-aware driving corridors that serve as linear collision constraints in OCP. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed framework's effectiveness in generating safe, efficient, and smooth trajectories for 4WIS vehicles, especially in constrained environments.</p></details> |  |

This significantly hinders the usefulness of such agents in environments where interaction is costly (for example, when they interact with humans or reset physical systems). While a number of existing LM agent architectures incorporate various mechanisms for experience storage and reflection, they make limited use of LMs' abilities to directly generate or reason about full counterfactual trajectories. We introduce ECHO (Experience Consolidation via Hindsight Optimization), a prompting framework that adapts hindsight experience replay from reinforcement learning for language model agents. ECHO generates optimized trajectories for alternative goals that could have been achieved during failed attempts, effectively creating synthetic positive examples from unsuccessful interactions. Our approach consists of two components: a hindsight rule that uses the language model itself to identify relevant subgoals and generate optimized trajectories, and an update rule that maintains compressed trajectory representations in memory. We evaluate ECHO on stateful versions of XMiniGrid, a text-based navigation and planning benchmark, and PeopleJoinQA, a collaborative information-gathering enterprise simulation. Across both domains, ECHO outperforms vanilla language agent baselines by up to 80%; in XMiniGrid, it also outperforms a number of sophisticated agent architectures including Reflexion and AWM, demonstrating faster adaptation to novel environments through more effective utilization of past experiences.</p></details> |  |

Existing anomaly detection methods are ill-suited for this challenge: mean-pooling embeddings dilutes anomalous steps, while contrastive-only approaches ignore sequential structure. Standard unsupervised methods on pre-trained embeddings achieve F1-scores no higher than 0.69. We introduce Trajectory Guard, a Siamese Recurrent Autoencoder with a hybrid loss function that jointly learns task-trajectory alignment via contrastive learning and sequential validity via reconstruction. This dual objective enables unified detection of both "wrong plan for this task" and "malformed plan structure." On benchmarks spanning synthetic perturbations and real-world failures from security audits (RAS-Eval) and multi-agent systems (Who\&When), we achieve F1-scores of 0.88-0.94 on balanced sets and recall of 0.86-0.92 on imbalanced external benchmarks. At 32 ms inference latency, our approach runs 17-27$\times$ faster than LLM Judge baselines, enabling real-time safety verification in production deployments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI Trustagent 2026</p></details> |

Many existing distribution-matching approaches struggle in this regime because they impose strict support constraints and rely on brittle one-step models, making it hard to extract useful signal from imperfect data. To tackle this challenge, we propose TGE, a trajectory-level generative embedding for offline LfO that constructs a dense, smooth surrogate reward by estimating expert state density in the latent space of a temporal diffusion model trained on offline trajectory data. By leveraging the smooth geometry of the learned diffusion embedding, TGE captures long-horizon temporal dynamics and effectively bridges the gap between disjoint supports, ensuring a robust learning signal even when offline data is distributionally distinct from the expert. Empirically, the proposed approach consistently matches or outperforms prior offline LfO methods across a range of D4RL locomotion and manipulation benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 6 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

In this study, we propose a model-free clustering framework that groups baskets based on transition probabilities derived from the trajectories of treatment response, rather than relying solely on a single efficacy endpoint such as the objective response rate. The number of clusters is not predetermined but is automatically determined in a data-driven manner based on the similarity structure among baskets. After clustering, baskets within the same cluster are analyzed using a hierarchical Bayesian model. This framework aims to improve the estimation precision of efficacy endpoints and enhance statistical power while maintaining the type~I error rate at the nominal level. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated through simulation studies. The results demonstrated that the proposed method can accurately identify cluster structures in heterogeneous settings and, even under such conditions, maintain the type~I error rate at the nominal level while improving statistical power.</p></details> |  |

Traditional modular pipelines separate perception, prediction, and planning, while recent end-to-end (E2E) systems learn them jointly. Vision-language models (VLMs) further enrich this paradigm by introducing cross-modal priors and commonsense reasoning, yet current VLM-based planners face three key challenges: (i) a mismatch between discrete text reasoning and continuous control, (ii) high latency from autoregressive chain-of-thought decoding, and (iii) inefficient or non-causal planners that limit real-time deployment. We propose ColaVLA, a unified vision-language-action framework that transfers reasoning from text to a unified latent space and couples it with a hierarchical, parallel trajectory decoder. The Cognitive Latent Reasoner compresses scene understanding into compact, decision-oriented meta-action embeddings through ego-adaptive selection and only two VLM forward passes. The Hierarchical Parallel Planner then generates multi-scale, causality-consistent trajectories in a single forward pass. Together, these components preserve the generalization and interpretability of VLMs while enabling efficient, accurate and safe trajectory generation. Experiments on the nuScenes benchmark show that ColaVLA achieves state-of-the-art performance in both open-loop and closed-loop settings with favorable efficiency and robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 4 figures.

In this paper, we enhance high-frequency features of GEO targets while suppressing background noise at the single-frame level through wavelet transform. Building on this, we propose a multi-frame temporal trajectory completion scheme centered on the Hungarian algorithm for globally optimal cross-frame matching. To effectively mitigate missing and false detections, a series of key steps including temporal matching and interpolation completion, temporal-consistency-based noise filtering, and progressive trajectory refinement are designed in the post-processing pipeline. Experimental results on the public SpotGEO dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving an F_1 score of 90.14%.</p></details> |  |

In the one-shot setting, the agent generates a policy after observing a single expert demonstration without additional fine-tuning. Existing approaches typically train and evaluate on the same set of tasks, varying only object configurations, and struggle to generalize to unseen tasks with different semantic or structural requirements. While some recent methods attempt to address this, they exhibit low success rates on hard test tasks that, despite being visually similar to some training tasks, differ in context and require distinct responses. Additionally, most existing methods lack an explicit model of environment dynamics, limiting their ability to reason about future states. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework for one-shot visual imitation learning via world-model-guided trajectory generation. Given an expert demonstration video and the agent's initial observation, our method leverages a learned world model to predict a sequence of latent states and actions. This latent trajectory is then decoded into physical waypoints that guide the agent's execution. Our method is evaluated on two simulated benchmarks and three real-world robotic platforms, where it consistently outperforms prior approaches, with over 30% improvement in some cases.

However, conventional control algorithms for trajectory tracking often exhibit limited performance due to the underactuated, nonlinear, and highly coupled dynamics of quadrotor systems. To address these challenges, we propose HBO-PID, a novel control algorithm that integrates the Heteroscedastic Bayesian Optimization (HBO) framework with the classical PID controller to achieve accurate and robust trajectory tracking. By explicitly modeling input-dependent noise variance, the proposed method can better adapt to dynamic and complex environments, and therefore improve the accuracy and robustness of trajectory tracking. To accelerate the convergence of optimization, we adopt a two-stage optimization strategy that allow us to more efficiently find the optimal controller parameters. Through experiments in both simulation and real-world scenarios, we demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Compared to SOTA methods, it improves the position accuracy by 24.7% to 42.9%, and the angular accuracy by 40.9% to 78.4%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IROS 2025 (2025 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems)</p></details> |

Existing methods mainly rely on historical spatiotemporal trajectory data to train sequence models that directly forecast future locations. However, they often overlook the importance of the future spatiotemporal contexts, which are highly informative for the future locations. For example, knowing how much time and distance a user will travel could serve as a critical clue for predicting the user's next location. Against this background, we propose \textbf{STRelay}, a universal \textbf{\underline{S}}patio\textbf{\underline{T}}emporal \textbf{\underline{Relay}}ing framework explicitly modeling the future spatiotemporal context given a human trajectory, to boost the performance of different location prediction models. Specifically, STRelay models future spatiotemporal contexts in a relaying manner, which is subsequently integrated with the encoded historical representation from a base location prediction model, enabling multi-task learning by simultaneously predicting the next time interval, next moving distance interval, and finally the next location. We evaluate STRelay integrated with five state-of-the-art location prediction base models on four real-world trajectory datasets. Results demonstrate that STRelay consistently improves prediction performance across all cases by 2.49\%-11.30\%. Additionally, we find that the future spatiotemporal contexts are particularly helpful for entertainment-related locations and also for user groups who prefer traveling longer distances. The performance gain on such non-daily-routine activities, which often suffer from higher uncertainty, is indeed complementary to the base location prediction models that often excel at modeling regular daily routine patterns.</p></details> |  |

However, current iterative solving approaches which alternate between diffusion sampling and data consistency steps typically require hundreds or thousands of steps to achieve high quality reconstruction due to accumulated errors. We address this challenge with SURE Guided Posterior Sampling (SGPS), a method that corrects sampling trajectory deviations using Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimate (SURE) gradient updates and PCA based noise estimation. By mitigating noise induced errors during the critical early and middle sampling stages, SGPS enables more accurate posterior sampling and reduces error accumulation. This allows our method to maintain high reconstruction quality with fewer than 100 Neural Function Evaluations (NFEs). Our extensive evaluation across diverse inverse problems demonstrates that SGPS consistently outperforms existing methods at low NFE counts.</p></details> |  |

While repair-based methods fail to restore complex artifacts and LiDAR-based approaches rely on sparse and incomplete cues, ReCamDriving leverages dense and scene-complete 3DGS renderings for explicit geometric guidance, achieving precise camera-controllable generation. To mitigate overfitting to restoration behaviors when conditioned on 3DGS renderings, ReCamDriving adopts a two-stage training paradigm: the first stage uses camera poses for coarse control, while the second stage incorporates 3DGS renderings for fine-grained viewpoint and geometric guidance. Furthermore, we present a 3DGS-based cross-trajectory data curation strategy to eliminate the train-test gap in camera transformation patterns, enabling scalable multi-trajectory supervision from monocular videos. Based on this strategy, we construct the ParaDrive dataset, containing over 110K parallel-trajectory video pairs.

While consistency models offer a potential solution, existing applications to decision-making either struggle with suboptimal demonstrations under behavior cloning or rely on complex concurrent training of multiple networks under the actor-critic framework. In this work, we propose a novel approach to consistency distillation for offline reinforcement learning that directly incorporates reward optimization into the distillation process. Our method achieves single-step sampling while generating higher-reward action trajectories through decoupled training and noise-free reward signals. Empirical evaluations on the Gym MuJoCo, FrankaKitchen, and long horizon planning benchmarks demonstrate that our approach can achieve a 9.7% improvement over previous state-of-the-art while offering up to 142x speedup over diffusion counterparts in inference time.</p></details> |  |

While experimental techniques like spatial transcriptomics now enable high-resolution mapping of tissue organization across space and time, current methods that model cellular evolution operate at the single-cell level, overlooking the coordinated development of cellular states in a tissue. We introduce NicheFlow, a flow-based generative model that infers the temporal trajectory of cellular microenvironments across sequential spatial slides. By representing local cell neighborhoods as point clouds, NicheFlow jointly models the evolution of cell states and spatial coordinates using optimal transport and Variational Flow Matching.

| **[SparScene: Efficient Traffic Scene Representation via Sparse Graph Learning for Large-Scale Trajectory Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21133v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent trajectory generation is a core problem for autonomous driving and intelligent transportation systems. However, efficiently modeling the dynamic interactions between numerous road users and infrastructures in complex scenes remains an open problem. Existing methods typically employ distance-based or fully connected dense graph structures to capture interaction information, which not only introduces a large number of redundant edges but also requires complex and heavily parameterized networks for encoding, thereby resulting in low training and inference efficiency, limiting scalability to large and complex traffic scenes. To overcome the limitations of existing methods, we propose SparScene, a sparse graph learning framework designed for efficient and scalable traffic scene representation. Instead of relying on distance thresholds, SparScene leverages the lane graph topology to construct structure-aware sparse connections between agents and lanes, enabling efficient yet informative scene graph representation. SparScene adopts a lightweight graph encoder that efficiently aggregates agent-map and agent-agent interactions, yielding compact scene representations with substantially improved efficiency and scalability. On the motion prediction benchmark of the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD), SparScene achieves competitive performance with remarkable efficiency. It generates trajectories for more than 200 agents in a scene within 5 ms and scales to more than 5,000 agents and 17,000 lanes with merely 54 ms of inference time with a GPU memory of 2.9 GB, highlighting its superior scalability for large-scale traffic scenes.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 7 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

In this paper, considering the time-varying task criticality characteristics of diverse WBAN users and the dual mobility between WBAN users and UAV, we investigate the dynamic task offloading and UAV flight trajectory optimization problem to minimize the weighted average task completion time of all the WBAN users, under the constraint of UAV energy consumption. To tackle the problem, an embodied AI-enhanced IoMT edge computing framework is established. Specifically, we propose a novel hierarchical multi-scale Transformer-based user trajectory prediction model based on the users' historical trajectory traces captured by the embodied AI agent (i.e., UAV). Afterwards, a prediction-enhanced deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm that integrates predicted users' mobility information is designed for intelligently optimizing UAV flight trajectory and task offloading decisions. Real-word movement traces and simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed methods in comparison with the existing benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Discrete sensing strategies, including sensor arrays and distributed sensors, are broadly involved in tactile sensors across versatile applications. However, it remains a challenge to achieve high spatial resolution with self-decoupled capacity and insensitivity to other off-axis stimuli for stretchable tactile sensors. Herein, we develop a stretchable tactile sensor based on the proposed continuous spectral-filtering principle, allowing superhigh resolution for applied stimuli. This proposed sensor enables a high-linear spatial response (0.996) even during stretching and bending, and high continuous spatial (7 μm) and force (5 mN) resolutions with design scalability and interaction robustness to survive piercing and cutting. We further demonstrate the sensors' performance by integrating them into a planar parallel mechanism for precise trajectory tracking (rotational resolution: 0.02°) in real time.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 2025 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)</p></details> |

Efficient Data Pruning for Large-scale Autonomous Driving Dataset via Trajectory Entropy Maximization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19270v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collecting large-scale naturalistic driving data is essential for training robust autonomous driving planners. However, real-world datasets often contain a substantial amount of repetitive and low-value samples, which lead to excessive storage costs and bring limited benefits to policy learning. To address this issue, we propose an information-theoretic data pruning method that effectively reduces the training data volume without compromising model performance. Our approach evaluates the trajectory distribution information entropy of driving data and iteratively selects high-value samples that preserve the statistical characteristics of the original dataset in a model-agnostic manner. From a theoretical perspective, we show that maximizing trajectory entropy effectively constrains the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the pruned subset and the original data distribution, thereby maintaining generalization ability. Comprehensive experiments on the NuPlan benchmark with a large-scale imitation learning framework demonstrate that the proposed method can reduce the dataset size by up to 40% while maintaining closed-loop performance. This work provides a lightweight and theoretically grounded approach for scalable data management and efficient policy learning in autonomous driving systems.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |

While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at video understanding tasks, their real-time mobile deployment is constrained by heavy computational costs and inefficient redundant frame processing. To address these issues, we propose the FC-MIR framework: leveraging keyframe sampling and adaptive concatenation, it cuts visual redundancy to boost inference efficiency, while integrating state-of-the-art closed-source MLLMs or fine-tuned models (e.g., Qwen3-VL) for trajectory summarization and intent prediction. We further expand task scope to explore generating post-prediction operations and search suggestions, and introduce a fine-grained metric to evaluate the practical utility of summaries, predictions, and suggestions. For rigorous assessment, we construct a UI trajectory dataset covering scenarios from UI-Agents (Agent-I) and real user interactions (Person-I). Experimental results show our compression method retains performance at 50%-60% compression rates; both closed-source and fine-tuned MLLMs demonstrate strong intent summarization, supporting potential lightweight on-device deployment. However, MLLMs still struggle with useful and "surprising" suggestions, leaving room for improvement. Finally, we deploy the framework in a real-world setting, integrating UI perception and UI-Agent proxies to lay a foundation for future progress in this field.</p></details> |  |
| **[CauTraj: A Causal-Knowledge-Guided Framework for Lane-Changing Trajectory Planning of Autonomous Vehicles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18703v1)** | 2025-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enhancing the performance of trajectory planners for lane - changing vehicles is one of the key challenges in autonomous driving within human - machine mixed traffic. Most existing studies have not incorporated human drivers' prior knowledge when designing trajectory planning models. To address this issue, this study proposes a novel trajectory planning framework that integrates causal prior knowledge into the control process. Both longitudinal and lateral microscopic behaviors of vehicles are modeled to quantify interaction risk, and a staged causal graph is constructed to capture causal dependencies in lane-changing scenarios. Causal effects between the lane-changing vehicle and surrounding vehicles are then estimated using causal inference, including average causal effects (ATE) and conditional average treatment effects (CATE). These causal priors are embedded into a model predictive control (MPC) framework to enhance trajectory planning. The proposed approach is validated on naturalistic vehicle trajectory datasets. Experimental results show that: (1) causal inference provides interpretable and stable quantification of vehicle interactions; (2) individual causal effects reveal driver heterogeneity; and (3) compared with the baseline MPC, the proposed method achieves a closer alignment with human driving behaviors, reducing maximum trajectory deviation from 1.2 m to 0.2 m, lateral velocity fluctuation by 60%, and yaw angle variability by 50%. These findings provide methodological support for human-like trajectory planning and practical value for improving safety, stability, and realism in autonomous vehicle testing and traffic simulation platforms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Planning for UAV-Based Smart Farming Using Imitation-Based Triple Deep Q-Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18604v1)** | 2025-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as a promising auxiliary platform for smart agriculture, capable of simultaneously performing weed detection, recognition, and data collection from wireless sensors. However, trajectory planning for UAV-based smart agriculture is challenging due to the high uncertainty of the environment, partial observations, and limited battery capacity of UAVs. To address these issues, we formulate the trajectory planning problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) and leverage multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to solve it. Furthermore, we propose a novel imitation-based triple deep Q-network (ITDQN) algorithm, which employs an elite imitation mechanism to reduce exploration costs and utilizes a mediator Q-network over a double deep Q-network (DDQN) to accelerate and stabilize training and improve performance. Experimental results in both simulated and real-world environments demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution. Moreover, our proposed ITDQN outperforms DDQN by 4.43\% in weed recognition rate and 6.94\% in data collection rate.</p></details> |  |
| **[Commercial Vehicle Braking Optimization: A Robust SIFT-Trajectory Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18597v1)** | 2025-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A vision-based trajectory analysis solution is proposed to address the "zero-speed braking" issue caused by inaccurate Controller Area Network (CAN) signals in commercial vehicle Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB) systems during low-speed operation. The algorithm utilizes the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier platform to process sequential video frames from a blind spot camera, employing self-adaptive Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE)-enhanced Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) feature extraction and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)-Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) matching. This allows for precise classification of the vehicle's motion state (static, vibration, moving). Key innovations include 1) multiframe trajectory displacement statistics (5-frame sliding window), 2) a dual-threshold state decision matrix, and 3) OBD-II driven dynamic Region of Interest (ROI) configuration. The system effectively suppresses environmental interference and false detection of dynamic objects, directly addressing the challenge of low-speed false activation in commercial vehicle safety systems. Evaluation in a real-world dataset (32,454 video segments from 1,852 vehicles) demonstrates an F1-score of 99.96% for static detection, 97.78% for moving state recognition, and a processing delay of 14.2 milliseconds (resolution 704x576). The deployment on-site shows an 89% reduction in false braking events, a 100% success rate in emergency braking, and a fault rate below 5%.</p></details> | 5 figures,16 pages |
| **[Trajectory-Aware Eligibility Traces for Off-Policy Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11321v3)** | 2025-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Off-policy learning from multistep returns is crucial for sample-efficient reinforcement learning, but counteracting off-policy bias without exacerbating variance is challenging. Classically, off-policy bias is corrected in a per-decision manner: past temporal-difference errors are re-weighted by the instantaneous Importance Sampling (IS) ratio after each action via eligibility traces. Many off-policy algorithms rely on this mechanism, along with differing protocols for cutting the IS ratios to combat the variance of the IS estimator. Unfortunately, once a trace has been fully cut, the effect cannot be reversed. This has led to the development of credit-assignment strategies that account for multiple past experiences at a time. These trajectory-aware methods have not been extensively analyzed, and their theoretical justification remains uncertain. In this paper, we propose a multistep operator that can express both per-decision and trajectory-aware methods. We prove convergence conditions for our operator in the tabular setting, establishing the first guarantees for several existing methods as well as many new ones. Finally, we introduce Recency-Bounded Importance Sampling (RBIS), which leverages trajectory awareness to perform robustly across $λ$-values in an off-policy control task.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2023. 18 pages, 4 figures, 1 table.

Despite their success, the provided tools and methodologies remain limited if high-dimensional dynamical systems subject to initial uncertainty and/or stochastic noise are encountered; in particular if rare events are of interest. We address this open challenge by borrowing ideas from Mori-Zwanzig formalism and Chorin's optimal prediction method. The novelty of our work lies on employing time-dependent optimal projection of the dynamic on a desired set of resolved variables. We show several theoretical and numerical properties of our model reduction approach. In particular, we show that the devised surrogate trajectories are consistent with the probability flow of the full-order system. Furthermore, we identify the measure underlying the projection through polynomial chaos expansion technique. This allows us to efficiently compute the projection even for trajectories that are initiated on low probability events. Moreover, we investigate the introduced model-reduction error of the surrogate trajectories on a standard setup, characterizing the convergence behaviour of the scheme. Several numerical results highlight the computational advantages of the proposed scheme in comparison to Monte-Carlo and optimal prediction method. Through this framework, we demonstrate that by tracking the measure along with the consistent projection of the dynamic we are able to access accurate estimates of different statistics including observables conditional on a given initial configuration.</p></details> |  |
| **[MoE Pathfinder: Trajectory-driven Expert Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18425v1)** | 2025-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures used in large language models (LLMs) achieve state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks yet face practical challenges such as deployment complexity and low activation efficiency. Expert pruning has thus emerged as a promising solution to reduce computational overhead and simplify the deployment of MoE models. However, existing expert pruning approaches conventionally rely on local importance metrics and often apply uniform layer-wise pruning, leveraging only partial evaluation signals and overlooking the heterogeneous contributions of experts across layers. To address these limitations, we propose an expert pruning approach based on the trajectory of activated experts across layers, which treats MoE as a weighted computation graph and casts expert selection as a global optimal path planning problem. Within this framework, we integrate complementary importance signals from reconstruction error, routing probabilities, and activation strength at the trajectory level, which naturally yields non-uniform expert retention across layers. Experiments show that our approach achieves superior pruning performance on nearly all tasks compared with most existing approaches.</p></details> | 12 pages, 3 figures |

However, ensuring good Quality of Services (QoS) while using as few UAVs as possible also requires optimal positioning and trajectory planning for UAVs and UGVs. This paper proposes a joint UAV-UGV-based positioning and trajectory planning framework for UAVs and UGVs deployment that guarantees optimal QoS for ground users. To model the UGVs' mobility, we introduce a road graph, which directs their movement along valid road segments and adheres to the road network constraints. To solve the sum rate optimization problem, we reformulate the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and propose a novel asynchronous Advantage Actor Critic (A3C) incorporated with meta-learning for rapid adaptation to new environments and dynamic conditions. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed Meta-A3C approach outperforms A3C and DDPG, delivering 13.1\% higher throughput and 49\% faster execution while meeting the QoS requirements.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLaViDA: A Large Language Vision Driving Assistant for Explicit Reasoning and Enhanced Trajectory Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18211v1)** | 2025-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory planning is a fundamental yet challenging component of autonomous driving. End-to-end planners frequently falter under adverse weather, unpredictable human behavior, or complex road layouts, primarily because they lack strong generalization or few-shot capabilities beyond their training data. We propose LLaViDA, a Large Language Vision Driving Assistant that leverages a Vision-Language Model (VLM) for object motion prediction, semantic grounding, and chain-of-thought reasoning for trajectory planning in autonomous driving. A two-stage training pipeline--supervised fine-tuning followed by Trajectory Preference Optimization (TPO)--enhances scene understanding and trajectory planning by injecting regression-based supervision, produces a powerful "VLM Trajectory Planner for Autonomous Driving." On the NuScenes benchmark, LLaViDA surpasses state-of-the-art end-to-end and other recent VLM/LLM-based baselines in open-loop trajectory planning task, achieving an average L2 trajectory error of 0.31 m and a collision rate of 0.10% on the NuScenes test set.

| **[Planning as Descent: Goal-Conditioned Latent Trajectory Synthesis in Learned Energy Landscapes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17846v1)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Planning as Descent (PaD), a framework for offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning that grounds trajectory synthesis in verification. Instead of learning a policy or explicit planner, PaD learns a goal-conditioned energy function over entire latent trajectories, assigning low energy to feasible, goal-consistent futures. Planning is realized as gradient-based refinement in this energy landscape, using identical computation during training and inference to reduce train-test mismatch common in decoupled modeling pipelines. PaD is trained via self-supervised hindsight goal relabeling, shaping the energy landscape around the planning dynamics. At inference, multiple trajectory candidates are refined under different temporal hypotheses, and low-energy plans balancing feasibility and efficiency are selected. We evaluate PaD on OGBench cube manipulation tasks. When trained on narrow expert demonstrations, PaD achieves state-of-the-art 95\% success, strongly outperforming prior methods that peak at 68\%. Remarkably, training on noisy, suboptimal data further improves success and plan efficiency, highlighting the benefits of verification-driven planning. Our results suggest learning to evaluate and refine trajectories provides a robust alternative to direct policy learning for offline, reward-free planning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Privacy-Preserving Synthetic Dataset of Individual Daily Trajectories for City-Scale Mobility Analytics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17239v1)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban mobility data are indispensable for urban planning, transportation demand forecasting, pandemic modeling, and many other applications; however, individual mobile phone-derived Global Positioning System traces cannot generally be shared with third parties owing to severe re-identification risks. Aggregated records, such as origin-destination (OD) matrices, offer partial insights but fail to capture the key behavioral properties of daily human movement, limiting realistic city-scale analyses. This study presents a privacy-preserving synthetic mobility dataset that reconstructs daily trajectories from aggregated inputs. The proposed method integrates OD flows with two complementary behavioral constraints: (1) dwell-travel time quantiles that are available only as coarse summary statistics and (2) the universal law for the daily distribution of the number of visited locations. Embedding these elements in a multi-objective optimization framework enables the reproduction of realistic distributions of human mobility while ensuring that no personal identifiers are required. The proposed framework is validated in two contrasting regions of Japan: (1) the 23 special wards of Tokyo, representing a dense metropolitan environment; and (2) Fukuoka Prefecture, where urban and suburban mobility patterns coexist. The resulting synthetic mobility data reproduce dwell-travel time and visit frequency distributions with high fidelity, while deviations in OD consistency remain within the natural range of daily fluctuations. The results of this study establish a practical synthesis pathway under real-world constraints, providing governments, urban planners, and industries with scalable access to high-resolution mobility data for reliable analytics without the need for sensitive personal records, and supporting practical deployments in policy and commercial domains.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |

While their capabilities are widely celebrated, a critical challenge remains unaddressed: ensuring responsible use by verifying whether an image originates from a model's training set, its novel generations or external sources. We introduce a framework that analyzes diffusion trajectories for this purpose. Specifically, we demonstrate that temporal dynamics across the entire trajectory allow for more robust classification and challenge the widely-adopted "Goldilocks zone" conjecture, which posits that membership inference is effective only within narrow denoising stages. More fundamentally, we expose critical flaws in current membership inference practices by showing that representative methods fail under distribution shifts or when model-generated data is present. For model attribution, we demonstrate a first white-box approach directly applicable to diffusion. Ultimately, we propose the unification of data provenance into a single, cohesive framework tailored to modern generative systems.</p></details> |  |

Existing real datasets fit real-world scenarios, capturing authentic road object behaviors, however, they typically lack precise ground-truth annotations. In contrast, synthetic datasets play a crucial role, allowing for the annotation of a large number of frames without additional costs or extra time. However, a general drawback of synthetic datasets is the lack of realistic vehicle motion, since trajectories are generated using AI models or rule-based systems. In this work, we introduce R3ST (Realistic 3D Synthetic Trajectories), a synthetic dataset that overcomes this limitation by generating a synthetic 3D environment and integrating real-world trajectories derived from SinD, a bird's-eye-view dataset recorded from drone footage. The proposed dataset closes the gap between synthetic data and realistic trajectories, advancing the research in trajectory forecasting of road vehicles, offering both accurate multimodal ground-truth annotations and authentic human-driven vehicle trajectories.</p></details> |  |

The environment of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) presents unique challenges when planning inspection operations that maximise visibility, information, and data quality. Specular reflection of sunlight from spacecraft bodies, self-shadowing, and dynamic lighting in LEO significantly impact the quality of data captured throughout an orbit. This is exacerbated by the relative motion between spacecraft, which introduces variable imaging distances and attitudes during inspection. Planning inspection trajectories with the aide of simulation is a common approach. However, the ability to design and optimise an inspection trajectory specifically to improve the resulting image quality in proximity operations remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present $\partial$LITE, an end-to-end differentiable simulation pipeline for on-orbit inspection operations. We leverage state-of-the-art differentiable rendering tools and a custom orbit propagator to enable end-to-end optimisation of orbital parameters based on visual sensor data. $\partial$LITE enables us to automatically design non-obvious trajectories, vastly improving the quality and usefulness of attained data. To our knowledge, our differentiable inspection-planning pipeline is the first of its kind and provides new insights into modern computational approaches to spacecraft mission planning.

However, existing learning-based methods exhibit three key limitations: (1) insufficient modeling of trajectory semantics and hierarchy, lacking both movement dynamics extraction and multi-scale structural representation; (2) high computational costs due to point-wise encoding; and (3) use of physically implausible augmentations that distort trajectory semantics. To address these issues, we propose MovSemCL, a movement-semantics contrastive learning framework for trajectory similarity computation. MovSemCL first transforms raw GPS trajectories into movement-semantics features and then segments them into patches. Next, MovSemCL employs intra- and inter-patch attentions to encode local as well as global trajectory patterns, enabling efficient hierarchical representation and reducing computational costs. Moreover, MovSemCL includes a curvature-guided augmentation strategy that preserves informative segments (e.g., turns and intersections) and masks redundant ones, generating physically plausible augmented views. Experiments on real-world datasets show that MovSemCL is capable of outperforming state-of-the-art methods, achieving mean ranks close to the ideal value of 1 at similarity search tasks and improvements by up to 20.3% at heuristic approximation, while reducing inference latency by up to 43.4%.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures; accepted by AAAI 2026 as an Oral paper</p></details> |

In this work, we investigate the trade-off through empirical studies, yielding two key observations. First, we discover the reward clustering phenomenon in which many trajectories collapse toward the group-mean reward, offering limited optimization value. Second, we design a heuristic strategy named Optimal Variance Filtering (OVF), and verify that a high-variance subset of trajectories, selected by OVF can outperform the larger, unfiltered group. However, this static, post-sampling OVF approach still necessitates critical computational overhead, as it performs unnecessary sampling for trajectories that are ultimately discarded. To resolve this, we propose Pro-GRPO (Proactive GRPO), a novel dynamic framework that integrates latent feature-based trajectory pruning into the sampling process. Through the early termination of reward-clustered trajectories, Pro-GRPO reduces computational overhead. Leveraging its efficiency, Pro-GRPO employs an "Expand-and-Prune" strategy. This strategy first expands the size of initial sampling group to maximize trajectory diversity, then it applies multi-step OVF to the latents, avoiding prohibitive computational costs. Extensive experiments on both diffusion-based and flow-based models demonstrate the generality and effectiveness of our Pro-GRPO framework.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |

In contrast to methods that rely on variational autoencoders (VAEs) to generate discrete occupancy tokens, which inherently limit representational capacity, our approach predicts multi-frame future occupancy in an end-to-end manner directly from raw image features. Inspired by the success of attention-based transformer architectures in foundational vision and language models such as GPT and VGGT, we employ a sparse occupancy representation that bypasses the intermediate bird's eye view (BEV) projection and its explicit geometric priors. This design allows the transformer to capture spatiotemporal dependencies more effectively. By avoiding both the finite-capacity constraint of discrete tokenization and the structural limitations of BEV representations, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes benchmark for 1-3 second occupancy forecasting, outperforming existing approaches by a significant margin. Furthermore, it demonstrates robust scene dynamics understanding, consistently delivering high accuracy under arbitrary future trajectory conditioning.</p></details> |  |

However, their vulnerability to adversarial perturbations poses significant risks, especially in Federated Learning (FL) settings where identical models are distributed across thousands of clients. While adversarial training is a strong defense, it is difficult to apply in FL due to strict client-data privacy constraints and the limited compute available on edge devices. In this work, we introduce TrajSyn, a privacy-preserving framework that enables effective server-side adversarial training by synthesizing a proxy dataset from the trajectories of client model updates, without accessing raw client data. We show that TrajSyn consistently improves adversarial robustness on image classification benchmarks with no extra compute burden on the client device.</p></details> |  |

Given i.i.d. observations from a multivariate normal distribution, GLASSO estimates the precision matrix by maximizing the log-likelihood with an \ell_1-penalty on the off-diagonal entries. However, selecting an optimal regularization parameter λin this unsupervised setting remains a significant challenge. A well-known issue is that existing methods, such as out-of-sample likelihood maximization, select a single global λand do not account for heterogeneity in variable scaling or partial variances. Standardizing the data to unit variances, although a common workaround, has been shown to negatively affect graph recovery. Addressing the problem of nodewise adaptive tuning in graph estimation is crucial for applications like computational neuroscience, where brain networks are constructed from highly heterogeneous, region-specific fMRI data. In this work, we develop Locally Adaptive Regularization for Graph Estimation (LARGE), an approach to adaptively learn nodewise tuning parameters to improve graph estimation and selection. In each block coordinate descent step of GLASSO, we augment the nodewise Lasso regression to jointly estimate the regression coefficients and error variance, which in turn guides the adaptive learning of nodewise penalties. In simulations, LARGE consistently outperforms benchmark methods in graph recovery, demonstrates greater stability across replications, and achieves the best estimation accuracy in the most difficult simulation settings. We demonstrate the practical utility of our method by estimating brain functional connectivity from a real fMRI data set.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Training Large Neural Networks With Low-Dimensional Error Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20580v4)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training deep neural networks typically relies on backpropagating high dimensional error signals a computationally intensive process with little evidence supporting its implementation in the brain. However, since most tasks involve low-dimensional outputs, we propose that low-dimensional error signals may suffice for effective learning. To test this hypothesis, we introduce a novel local learning rule based on Feedback Alignment that leverages indirect, low-dimensional error feedback to train large networks. Our method decouples the backward pass from the forward pass, enabling precise control over error signal dimensionality while maintaining high-dimensional representations. We begin with a detailed theoretical derivation for linear networks, which forms the foundation of our learning framework, and extend our approach to nonlinear, convolutional, and transformer architectures. Remarkably, we demonstrate that even minimal error dimensionality on the order of the task dimensionality can achieve performance matching that of traditional backpropagation. Furthermore, our rule enables efficient training of convolutional networks, which have previously been resistant to Feedback Alignment methods, with minimal error. This breakthrough not only paves the way toward more biologically accurate models of learning but also challenges the conventional reliance on high-dimensional gradient signals in neural network training. Our findings suggest that low-dimensional error signals can be as effective as high-dimensional ones, prompting a reevaluation of gradient-based learning in high-dimensional systems. Ultimately, our work offers a fresh perspective on neural network optimization and contributes to understanding learning mechanisms in both artificial and biological systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM for Large-Scale Optimization Model Auto-Formulation: A Lightweight Few-Shot Learning Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09635v1)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale optimization is a key backbone of modern business decision-making. However, building these models is often labor-intensive and time-consuming. We address this by proposing LEAN-LLM-OPT, a LightwEight AgeNtic workflow construction framework for LLM-assisted large-scale OPTimization auto-formulation. LEAN-LLM-OPT takes as input a problem description together with associated datasets and orchestrates a team of LLM agents to produce an optimization formulation. Specifically, upon receiving a query, two upstream LLM agents dynamically construct a workflow that specifies, step-by-step, how optimization models for similar problems can be formulated. A downstream LLM agent then follows this workflow to generate the final output. Leveraging LLMs' text-processing capabilities and common modeling practices, the workflow decomposes the modeling task into a sequence of structured sub-tasks and offloads mechanical data-handling operations to auxiliary tools. This design alleviates the downstream agent's burden related to planning and data handling, allowing it to focus on the most challenging components that cannot be readily standardized. Extensive simulations show that LEAN-LLM-OPT, instantiated with GPT-4.1 and the open source gpt-oss-20B, achieves strong performance on large-scale optimization modeling tasks and is competitive with state-of-the-art approaches. In addition, in a Singapore Airlines choice-based revenue management use case, LEAN-LLM-OPT demonstrates practical value by achieving leading performance across a range of scenarios. Along the way, we introduce Large-Scale-OR and Air-NRM, the first comprehensive benchmarks for large-scale optimization auto-formulation. The code and data of this work is available at https://github.com/CoraLiang01/lean-llm-opt.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated version of https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5329027</p></details> |
| **[LaoBench: A Large-Scale Multidimensional Lao Benchmark for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11334v2)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has not been matched by their evaluation in low-resource languages, especially Southeast Asian languages like Lao. To fill this gap, we introduce \textbf{LaoBench}, the first large-scale, high-quality, and multidimensional benchmark for assessing LLM language understanding and reasoning in Lao. LaoBench contains \textbf{17,000+} expert-curated samples across three dimensions: culturally grounded knowledge application, curriculum-aligned K12 education, and bilingual translation among Lao, Chinese, and English. It includes open-source and held-out subsets, where the held-out portion enables secure black-box evaluation via a controlled service to improve fairness and data security. We construct LaoBench with a hybrid pipeline that combines expert authoring with agent-assisted verification, ensuring linguistic accuracy, cultural relevance, and educational validity. We evaluate diverse state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source LLMs, and find that even strong multilingual models lag behind human experts, particularly in culturally grounded reasoning and translation fidelity. We hope LaoBench will catalyze research on Lao and other underrepresented Southeast Asian languages for more inclusive multilingual evaluation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Model-Based Automatic Formulation for Stochastic Optimization Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17200v3)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents an integrated systematic study of the performance of large language models (LLMs), specifically ChatGPT, for automatically formulating and solving Stochastic Optimization (SO) problems from natural language descriptions. Focusing on three key categories, individual chance-constrained models, joint chance-constrained models, and two-stage stochastic mixed-integer linear programming models, we design several prompts that guide ChatGPT through structured tasks using chain-of-thought and agentic reasoning. We introduce a novel soft-scoring metric that evaluates the structural quality and partial correctness of generated models, addressing the limitations of canonical and execution-based accuracy metrics. Across a diverse set of SO problems, GPT-4-Turbo achieves better partial scores than GPT-3.5 variants except for individual chance-constrained problems. Structured prompts significantly outperform simple prompting, reducing extra-element generation and improving objective matching, although extra-element generation remains a nontrivial task. Our findings reveal that with well-engineered prompts and multi-agent collaboration, LLMs can facilitate SO formulations, paving the way for intelligent, language-driven modeling pipelines for SO in practice.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Large Language Models for Time-Series Forecasting via Vector-Injected In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07903v2)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The World Wide Web needs reliable predictive capabilities to respond to changes in user behavior and usage patterns. Time series forecasting (TSF) is a key means to achieve this goal. In recent years, the large language models (LLMs) for TSF (LLM4TSF) have achieved good performance. However, there is a significant difference between pretraining corpora and time series data, making it hard to guarantee forecasting quality when directly applying LLMs to TSF; fine-tuning LLMs can mitigate this issue, but often incurs substantial computational overhead. Thus, LLM4TSF faces a dual challenge of prediction performance and compute overhead. To address this, we aim to explore a method for improving the forecasting performance of LLM4TSF while freezing all LLM parameters to reduce computational overhead. Inspired by in-context learning (ICL), we propose LVICL. LVICL uses our vector-injected ICL to inject example information into a frozen LLM, eliciting its in-context learning ability and thereby enhancing its performance on the example-related task (i.e., TSF). Specifically, we first use the LLM together with a learnable context vector adapter to extract a context vector from multiple examples adaptively. This vector contains compressed, example-related information. Subsequently, during the forward pass, we inject this vector into every layer of the LLM to improve forecasting performance. Compared with conventional ICL that adds examples into the prompt, our vector-injected ICL does not increase prompt length; moreover, adaptively deriving a context vector from examples suppresses components harmful to forecasting, thereby improving model performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmarking Post-Training Quantization of Large Language Models under Microscaling Floating Point Formats](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09555v1)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Microscaling Floating-Point (MXFP) has emerged as a promising low-precision format for large language models (LLMs). Despite various post-training quantization (PTQ) algorithms being proposed, they mostly focus on integer quantization, while their applicability and behavior under MXFP formats remain largely unexplored. To address this gap, this work conducts a systematic investigation of PTQ under MXFP formats, encompassing over 7 PTQ algorithms, 15 evaluation benchmarks, and 3 LLM families. The key findings include: 1) MXFP8 consistently achieves near-lossless performance, while MXFP4 introduces substantial accuracy degradation and remains challenging; 2) PTQ effectiveness under MXFP depends strongly on format compatibility, with some algorithmic paradigms being consistently more effective than others; 3) PTQ performance exhibits highly consistent trends across model families and modalities, in particular, quantization sensitivity is dominated by the language model rather than the vision encoder in multimodal LLMs; 4) The scaling factor of quantization is a critical error source in MXFP4, and a simple pre-scale optimization strategy can significantly mitigate its impact. Together, these results provide practical guidance on adapting existing PTQ methods to MXFP quantization.</p></details> |  |

Recent efforts to address this limitation often augment LLMs with an external memory bank, yet most existing pipelines are static and heuristic-driven, lacking a learned mechanism for deciding what to store, update, or retrieve. We present Memory-R1, a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that equips LLMs with the ability to actively manage and utilize external memory through two specialized agents: a Memory Manager that learns structured operations, including ADD, UPDATE, DELETE, and NOOP; and an Answer Agent that pre-selects and reasons over relevant entries. Both agents are fine-tuned with outcome-driven RL (PPO and GRPO), enabling adaptive memory management with minimal supervision. With only 152 training QA pairs, Memory-R1 outperforms strong baselines and generalizes across diverse question types, three benchmarks (LoCoMo, MSC, LongMemEval), and multiple model scales (3B-14B).</p></details> |  |
| **[Structured yet Bounded Temporal Understanding in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16685v2)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) increasingly show strong performance on temporally grounded tasks, such as timeline construction, temporal question answering, and event ordering. However, it remains unclear how their behavior depends on the way time is anchored in language. In this work, we study LLMs' temporal understanding through temporal frames of reference (t-FoRs), contrasting deictic framing (past-present-future) and sequential framing (before-after). Using a large-scale dataset of real-world events from Wikidata and similarity judgement task, we examine how LLMs' outputs vary with temporal distance, interval relations, and event duration. Our results show that LLMs systematically adapt to both t-FoRs, but the resulting similarity patterns differ significantly. Under deictic t-FoR, the similarity judgement scores form graded and asymmetric structures centered on the present, with sharper decline for future events and higher variance in the past. Under sequential t-FoR, similarity becomes strongly negative once events are temporally separated. Temporal judgements are also shaped by interval algebra and duration, with instability concentrated in overlap- and containment-based relations, and duration influencing only past events under deictic t-FoR. Overall, these findings characterize how LLMs organize temporal representation under different reference structures and identify the factors that most strongly shape their temporal understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review.

Leveraging large volumes of unlabeled brain MRI data, such models can learn anatomical priors that improve few-shot performance in diverse neuroimaging tasks. However, most SSL frameworks are tailored to natural images, and their adaptation to capture multi-modal MRI information remains underexplored. This work proposes a modality-invariant representation learning setup and evaluates its effectiveness in stroke and epilepsy lesion segmentation, following large-scale pre-training. Experimental results suggest that despite successful cross-modality alignment, lesion segmentation primarily benefits from preserving fine-grained modality-specific features.

| **[Effects of personality steering on cooperative behavior in Large Language Model agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05302v2)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as autonomous agents in strategic and social interactions. Although recent studies suggest that assigning personality traits to LLMs can influence their behavior, how personality steering affects cooperation under controlled conditions remains unclear. In this study, we examine the effects of personality steering on cooperative behavior in LLM agents using repeated Prisoner's Dilemma games. Based on the Big Five framework, we first measure basic personality scores of three models, GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o, and GPT-5, using the Big Five Inventory. We then compare behavior under baseline and personality-informed conditions, and further analyze the effects of independently manipulating each personality dimension to extreme values. Our results show that agreeableness is the dominant factor promoting cooperation across all models, while other personality traits have limited impact. Explicit personality information increases cooperation but can also raise vulnerability to exploitation, particularly in earlier-generation models. In contrast, later-generation models exhibit more selective cooperation. These findings indicate that personality steering acts as a behavioral bias rather than a deterministic control mechanism.</p></details> |  |
| **[Red Teaming Large Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00412v3)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have emerged as a powerful advancement in multi-step reasoning tasks, offering enhanced transparency and logical consistency through explicit chains of thought (CoT). However, these models introduce novel safety and reliability risks, such as CoT-hijacking and prompt-induced inefficiencies, which are not fully captured by existing evaluation methods. To address this gap, we propose RT-LRM, a unified benchmark designed to assess the trustworthiness of LRMs. RT-LRM evaluates three core dimensions: truthfulness, safety and efficiency. Beyond metric-based evaluation, we further introduce the training paradigm as a key analytical perspective to investigate the systematic impact of different training strategies on model trustworthiness. We achieve this by designing a curated suite of 30 reasoning tasks from an observational standpoint. We conduct extensive experiments on 26 models and identify several valuable insights into the trustworthiness of LRMs. For example, LRMs generally face trustworthiness challenges and tend to be more fragile than Large Language Models (LLMs) when encountering reasoning-induced risks. These findings uncover previously underexplored vulnerabilities and highlight the need for more targeted evaluations. In addition, we release a scalable toolbox for standardized trustworthiness research to support future advancements in this important field. Our code and datasets will be open-sourced.</p></details> | 30 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Exploring the Secondary Risks of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12382v4)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring the safety and alignment of Large Language Models is a significant challenge with their growing integration into critical applications and societal functions. While prior research has primarily focused on jailbreak attacks, less attention has been given to non-adversarial failures that subtly emerge during benign interactions. We introduce secondary risks a novel class of failure modes marked by harmful or misleading behaviors during benign prompts. Unlike adversarial attacks, these risks stem from imperfect generalization and often evade standard safety mechanisms. To enable systematic evaluation, we introduce two risk primitives verbose response and speculative advice that capture the core failure patterns. Building on these definitions, we propose SecLens, a black-box, multi-objective search framework that efficiently elicits secondary risk behaviors by optimizing task relevance, risk activation, and linguistic plausibility. To support reproducible evaluation, we release SecRiskBench, a benchmark dataset of 650 prompts covering eight diverse real-world risk categories. Experimental results from extensive evaluations on 16 popular models demonstrate that secondary risks are widespread, transferable across models, and modality independent, emphasizing the urgent need for enhanced safety mechanisms to address benign yet harmful LLM behaviors in real-world deployments.</p></details> | 18 pages, 5 figures |

The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has facilitated the paradigm shift from manual to automated data exploration. However, existing methods generally lack the ability for cross-domain analysis, and the exploration of LLMs capabilities remains insufficient. This paper presents TiInsight, an SQL-based automated cross-domain exploratory data analysis system. First, TiInsight offers a user-friendly GUI enabling users to explore data using natural language queries. Second, TiInsight offers a robust cross-domain exploratory data analysis pipeline: hierarchical data context (i.e., HDC) generation, question clarification and decomposition, text-to-SQL (i.e., TiSQL), and data visualization (i.e., TiChart). Third, we have implemented and deployed TiInsight in the production environment of PingCAP and demonstrated its capabilities using representative datasets.

We derive both an analytic capacity formula and an asymptotically optimal input distribution in the large-antenna regime, each of which depends solely on the single-output channel's Fisher information through a term we call the (tilted) Jeffreys factor. We demonstrate how our method applies broadly to scenarios with clipping, coarse quantization (including 1-bit ADCs), phase noise, fading with imperfect CSI, and even optical Poisson channels. Our asymptotic analysis motivates a practical approach to constellation design via a compander-like transformation. Furthermore, we introduce a low-complexity receiver structure that approximates the log-likelihood by quantizing the channel outputs into finitely many bins, enabling near-capacity performance with computational complexity independent of the output dimension. Numerical results confirm that the proposed method unifies and simplifies many previously intractable MIMO capacity problems and reveals how the Fisher information alone governs the channel's asymptotic behavior.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 8 figures, submitted to IEEE Trans. on Inf.

However, most of the MLLM frameworks take vision as the main input modality, and provide limited in-depth support for the modality of speech, audio, and music. This situation hinders the development of audio-language models, and forces researchers to spend a lot of effort on code writing and hyperparameter tuning. We present SLAM-LLM, an open-source deep learning framework designed to train customized MLLMs, focused on speech, language, audio, and music processing. SLAM-LLM provides a modular configuration of different encoders, projectors, LLMs, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning plugins. SLAM-LLM also includes detailed training and inference recipes for mainstream tasks, along with high-performance checkpoints like LLM-based Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Automated Audio Captioning (AAC), and Music Captioning (MC). Some of these recipes have already reached or are nearing state-of-the-art performance, and some relevant techniques have also been accepted by academic papers. We hope SLAM-LLM will accelerate iteration, development, data engineering, and model training for researchers. We are committed to continually pushing forward audio-based MLLMs through this open-source framework, and call on the community to contribute to the LLM-based speech, audio and music processing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing (JSTSP)</p></details> |

We investigate the Imperfective Paradox, a logical phenomenon where the past progressive aspect entails event realization for activities (e.g., running $\to$ ran) but not for accomplishments (e.g., building $\nrightarrow$ built). We introduce ImperfectiveNLI, a diagnostic dataset designed to probe this distinction across diverse semantic classes. Evaluating state-of-the-art open-weight models, we uncover a pervasive Teleological Bias: models systematically hallucinate completion for goal-oriented events, often overriding explicit textual negation. Representational analyses show that while internal embeddings often distinguish process from result, inference decisions are dominated by strong priors about goal attainment. We further find that prompting-based interventions reduce hallucinated completions but also increase incorrect rejections of valid entailments. Our findings suggest that current LLMs lack structural aspectual awareness, operating as predictive narrative engines rather than faithful logical reasoners.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Test-Time Scaling of Multi-Step Reasoning by Probing Internal States of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06209v3)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs can solve complex tasks by generating long, multi-step reasoning chains. Test-time scaling (TTS) can further improve LLM performance by sampling multiple variants of intermediate reasoning steps, verifying their correctness, and strategically choosing the best steps for continuation. However, existing verification approaches, such as Process Reward Models (PRMs), are computationally expensive, limited to specific domains, and require large-scale human or model-generated annotations. We propose a lightweight alternative for step-level reasoning verification based on probing the internal states of LLMs. We train a transformer-based probe that uses the internal states of the frozen LLM to estimate the credibility of its reasoning steps during generation. Annotation can be generated either by another larger LLM (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) or in a self-supervised manner by the original model itself. The probes are both effective and lightweight, containing fewer than 10M parameters. Across multiple domains, including mathematics, planning, and general knowledge question answering, our probes match or even exceed the performance of PRMs that are up to 810x larger. Our findings suggest that the internal states of LLMs encode their confidence in reasoning processes and can serve as reliable signals for reasoning step verification, offering a promising direction towards scalable and generalizable TTS and introspective LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint under review</p></details> |
| **[On-Device Large Language Models for Sequential Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09306v1)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>On-device recommendation is critical for a number of real-world applications, especially in scenarios that have agreements on execution latency, user privacy, and robust functionality when internet connectivity is unstable or even impossible. While large language models (LLMs) can now provide exceptional capabilities that model user behavior for sequential recommendation tasks, their substantial memory footprint and computational overhead make the deployment on resource-constrained devices a high risk proposition. In this paper, we propose OD-LLM, the first task-adaptive compression framework explicitly designed to provide efficient and accurate on-device deployment of LLMs for sequential recommendation tasks. OD-LLM uniquely integrates two complementary compression strategies: a low-rank structural compression algorithm which uses Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to significantly reduce parameter redundancy in the model, and a novel tokenization normalization technique that better complements the low-rank decomposition process being used. Additionally, to minimize any potential performance degradation when using higher compression ratios, a novel progressive alignment algorithm is used to iteratively refine the parameters required layerwise in the target model. Empirical evaluations conducted on sequential recommendation benchmarks show that OD-LLM exhibits no loss in effectiveness when compared to the original recommendation model, when the deployed model size is halved. These promising results demonstrate the efficacy and scalability of OD-LLM, making this novel solution a practical alternative for real-time, on-device solutions wishing to replace expensive, remotely executed LLMs.</p></details> | WSDM'26 |

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating crystals, their application to MOFs is hindered by MOFs' high atomic complexity. Inspired by the success of block-wise paradigms in deep generative models, we pioneer the use of LLMs in this domain by introducing MOF-LLM, the first LLM framework specifically adapted for block-level MOF structure prediction. To effectively harness LLMs for this modular assembly task, our training paradigm integrates spatial-aware continual pre-training (CPT), structural supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and matching-driven reinforcement learning (RL). By incorporating explicit spatial priors and optimizing structural stability via Soft Adaptive Policy Optimization (SAPO), our approach substantially enhances the spatial reasoning capability of a Qwen-3 8B model for accurate MOF structure prediction. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that MOF-LLM outperforms state-of-the-art denoising-based and LLM-based methods while exhibiting superior sampling efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Multimodal Models for Embodied Intelligent Driving: The Next Frontier in Self-Driving?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08434v2)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advent of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) offers a promising technology to tackle the limitations of modular design in autonomous driving, which often falters in open-world scenarios requiring sustained environmental understanding and logical reasoning. Besides, embodied artificial intelligence facilitates policy optimization through closed-loop interactions to achieve the continuous learning capability, thereby advancing autonomous driving toward embodied intelligent (El) driving. However, such capability will be constrained by relying solely on LMMs to enhance EI driving without joint decision-making. This article introduces a novel semantics and policy dual-driven hybrid decision framework to tackle this challenge, ensuring continuous learning and joint decision. The framework merges LMMs for semantic understanding and cognitive representation, and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for real-time policy optimization. We starts by introducing the foundational principles of EI driving and LMMs. Moreover, we examine the emerging opportunities this framework enables, encompassing potential benefits and representative use cases. A case study is conducted experimentally to validate the performance superiority of our framework in completing lane-change planning task. Finally, several future research directions to empower EI driving are identified to guide subsequent work.</p></details> |  |

Existing Large Language Models (LLMs) unlearning approaches that typically focus on modifying only final answers are insufficient for LRMs, as they fail to remove sensitive content from intermediate steps, leading to persistent privacy leakage and degraded security. To address these challenges, we propose Sensitive Trajectory Regulation (STaR), a parameter-free, inference-time unlearning framework that achieves robust privacy protection throughout the reasoning process. Specifically, we first identify sensitive content via semantic-aware detection. Then, we inject global safety constraints through secure prompt prefix. Next, we perform trajectory-aware suppression to dynamically block sensitive content across the entire reasoning chain. Finally, we apply token-level adaptive filtering to prevent both exact and paraphrased sensitive tokens during generation. Furthermore, to overcome the inadequacies of existing evaluation protocols, we introduce two metrics: Multi-Decoding Consistency Assessment (MCS), which measures the consistency of unlearning across diverse decoding strategies, and Multi-Granularity Membership Inference Attack (MIA) Evaluation, which quantifies privacy protection at both answer and reasoning-chain levels. Experiments on the R-TOFU benchmark demonstrate that STaR achieves comprehensive and stable unlearning with minimal utility loss, setting a new standard for privacy-preserving reasoning in LRMs.</p></details> |  |

However, human-driven responses are often fragmented and reactive, with policies formulated in isolation and adjusted only after outbreaks escalate, undermining proactive intervention and global pandemic mitigation. To address this challenge, here we propose a large language model (LLM) multi-agent policymaking framework that supports coordinated and proactive pandemic control across regions. Within our framework, each administrative region is assigned an LLM agent as an AI policymaking assistant. The agent reasons over region-specific epidemiological dynamics while communicating with other agents to account for cross-regional interdependencies. By integrating real-world data, a pandemic evolution simulator, and structured inter-agent communication, our framework enables agents to jointly explore counterfactual intervention scenarios and synthesize coordinated policy decisions through a closed-loop simulation process. We validate the proposed framework using state-level COVID-19 data from the United States between April and December 2020, together with real-world mobility records and observed policy interventions.

Traditionally, template-registration methods were used, but recent advances have shifted to deep learning for faster workflows. While large models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) offer transferable feature representations, they are not tailored for the high precision required in brain parcellation. To address this, we propose BrainSegNet, a novel framework that adapts SAM for accurate whole-brain parcellation into 95 regions. We enhance SAM by integrating U-Net skip connections and specialized modules into its encoder and decoder, enabling fine-grained anatomical precision. Key components include a hybrid encoder combining U-Net skip connections with SAM's transformer blocks, a multi-scale attention decoder with pyramid pooling for varying-sized structures, and a boundary refinement module to sharpen edges. Experimental results on the Human Connectome Project (HCP) dataset demonstrate that BrainSegNet outperforms several state-of-the-art methods, achieving higher accuracy and robustness in complex, multi-label parcellation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Paths and Dense Rewards: Probabilistic Flow Reasoning for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09260v1)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-quality chain-of-thought has demonstrated strong potential for unlocking the reasoning capabilities of large language models. However, current paradigms typically treat the reasoning process as an indivisible sequence, lacking an intrinsic mechanism to quantify step-wise information gain. This granularity gap manifests in two limitations: inference inefficiency from redundant exploration without explicit guidance, and optimization difficulty due to sparse outcome supervision or costly external verifiers. In this work, we propose CoT-Flow, a framework that reconceptualizes discrete reasoning steps as a continuous probabilistic flow, quantifying the contribution of each step toward the ground-truth answer. Built on this formulation, CoT-Flow enables two complementary methodologies: flow-guided decoding, which employs a greedy flow-based decoding strategy to extract information-efficient reasoning paths, and flow-based reinforcement learning, which constructs a verifier-free dense reward function. Experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate that CoT-Flow achieves a superior balance between inference efficiency and reasoning performance.</p></details> |  |

These manuals, written in natural language, describe many steps in detail. Unfortunately, the number, magnitude, and articulation of these descriptions can significantly slow down and complicate the retrieval of the correct procedure during critical incidents. Interestingly, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) enables the development of tools based on conversational interfaces that can assist operators in their retrieval tasks, improving their capability to respond to incidents. This paper presents the results of a set of experiments that derive from the analysis of the troubleshooting procedures available in Fincantieri, a large international company developing complex naval cyber-physical systems. Results show that RAG can assist operators in reacting promptly to failure symptoms, although specific measures have to be taken into consideration to cross-validate recommendations before actuating them.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication in the Software Engineering in Practice track at the 48th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2026)</p></details> |

To address this gap, we introduce two new datasets -- BEA-Large and BEA-Dialogue -- constructed from the previously unprocessed portions of the Hungarian speech corpus named BEA. BEA-Large extends BEA-Base with 255 hours of spontaneous speech from 433 speakers, enriched with detailed segment-level metadata. BEA-Dialogue, comprising 85 hours of spontaneous conversations, is a Hungarian speech corpus featuring natural dialogues partitioned into speaker-independent subsets, supporting research in conversational ASR and speaker diarization. We establish reproducible baselines on these datasets using publicly available ASR models, with the fine-tuned Fast Conformer model achieving word error rates as low as 14.18% on spontaneous and 4.8% on repeated speech. Diarization experiments yield diarization error rates between 12.46% and 17.40%, providing reference points for future improvements. The results highlight the persistent difficulty of conversational ASR, particularly due to disfluencies, overlaps, and informal speech patterns. By releasing these datasets and baselines, we aim to advance Hungarian speech technology and offer a methodological framework for developing spontaneous and conversational benchmarks in other languages.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to LREC 2026</p></details> |
| **[$D^2Prune$: Sparsifying Large Language Models via Dual Taylor Expansion and Attention Distribution Awareness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09176v1)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) face significant deployment challenges due to their massive computational demands. % While pruning offers a promising compression solution, existing methods suffer from two critical limitations: (1) They neglect activation distribution shifts between calibration data and test data, resulting in inaccurate error estimations; (2) They overlook the long-tail distribution characteristics of activations in the attention module. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel pruning method, $D^2Prune$. First, we propose a dual Taylor expansion-based method that jointly models weight and activation perturbations for precise error estimation, leading to precise pruning mask selection and weight updating and facilitating error minimization during pruning. % Second, we propose an attention-aware dynamic update strategy that preserves the long-tail attention pattern by jointly minimizing the KL divergence of attention distributions and the reconstruction error. Extensive experiments show that $D^2Prune$ consistently outperforms SOTA methods across various LLMs (e.g., OPT-125M, LLaMA2/3, and Qwen3). Moreover, the dynamic attention update mechanism also generalizes well to ViT-based vision models like DeiT, achieving superior accuracy on ImageNet-1K.</p></details> |  |
| **[BalDRO: A Distributionally Robust Optimization based Framework for Large Language Model Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09172v1)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly shape online content, removing targeted information from well-trained LLMs (also known as LLM unlearning) has become critical for web governance. A key challenge lies in sample-wise imbalance within the forget set: different samples exhibit widely varying unlearning difficulty, leading to asynchronous forgetting where some knowledge remains insufficiently erased while others become over-forgotten. To address this, we propose BalDRO, a novel and efficient framework for balanced LLM unlearning. BalDRO formulates unlearning as a min-sup process: an inner step identifies a worst-case data distribution that emphasizes hard-to-unlearn samples, while an outer step updates model parameters under this distribution. We instantiate BalDRO via two efficient variants: BalDRO-G, a discrete GroupDRO-based approximation focusing on high-loss subsets, and BalDRO-DV, a continuous Donsker-Varadhan dual method enabling smooth adaptive weighting within standard training pipelines. Experiments on TOFU and MUSE show that BalDRO significantly improves both forgetting quality and model utility over existing methods, and we release code for reproducibility.</p></details> |  |

Comprehensive documentation is essential for long-term software maintenance and collaboration, yet current automated approaches still fail to model the rich semantic dependencies and architectural structures that define real-world software systems. We present \textbf{CodeWiki}, a unified framework for automated repository-level documentation across seven programming languages. CodeWiki introduces three key innovations: (i) hierarchical decomposition that preserves architectural context across multiple levels of granularity, (ii) recursive multi-agent processing with dynamic task delegation for scalable generation, and (iii) multi-modal synthesis that integrates textual descriptions with visual artifacts such as architecture diagrams and data-flow representations. To enable rigorous evaluation, we introduce \textbf{CodeWikiBench}, a comprehensive benchmark featuring multi-dimensional rubrics and LLM-based assessment protocols. Experimental results show that CodeWiki achieves a 68.79\% quality score with proprietary models, outperforming the closed-source DeepWiki baseline (64.06\%) by 4.73\%, with particularly strong improvements on high-level scripting languages (+10.47\%). We open-source CodeWiki to foster future research and community adoption.</p></details> |  |

However, business scenarios often involve complex standard operating procedures (SOPs), and the evaluation of LLM capabilities in such contexts has not been fully explored. To bridge this gap, we propose SOP-Maze, a benchmark constructed from real-world business data and adapted into a collection of 397 instances and 3422 subtasks from 23 complex SOP scenarios. We further categorize SOP tasks into two broad classes: Lateral Root System (LRS), representing wide-option tasks that demand precise selection; and Heart Root System (HRS), which emphasizes deep logical reasoning with complex branches. Extensive experiments reveal that nearly all state-of-the-art models struggle with SOP-Maze. We conduct a comprehensive analysis and identify three key error categories: (i) route blindness: difficulty following procedures; (ii) conversational fragility: inability to handle real dialogue nuances; and (iii) calculation errors: mistakes in time or arithmetic reasoning under complex contexts. The systematic study explores LLM performance across SOP tasks that challenge both breadth and depth, offering new insights for improving model capabilities. We have open-sourced our work on: https://github.com/meituan-longcat/SOP-Maze.</p></details> |  |

The prevailing "restoration-then-recognition" two-stage paradigm suffers from a fundamental flaw: the pixel-level optimization objectives of image restoration models are misaligned with the semantic goals of character recognition, leading to artifact interference and error accumulation. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated powerful general capabilities, they lack explicit structural modeling for license plate character sequences (e.g., fixed length, specific order). To address this, we propose an end-to-end structure-aware multimodal reasoning framework based on Qwen3-VL. The core innovation lies in the Character-Aware Multimodal Reasoning Module (CMRM), which introduces a set of learnable Character Slot Queries. Through a cross-attention mechanism, these queries actively retrieve fine-grained evidence corresponding to character positions from visual features. Subsequently, we inject these character-aware representations back into the visual tokens via residual modulation, enabling the language model to perform autoregressive generation based on explicit structural priors. Furthermore, combined with the LoRA parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy, the model achieves domain adaptation while retaining the generalization capabilities of the large model. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world severely degraded datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing restoration-recognition combinations and general VLMs, validating the superiority of incorporating structured reasoning into large models for low-quality text recognition tasks.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods are typically built upon moderate-scale pre-trained models and employ diverse optimization strategies to achieve promising performance under full-parameter fine-tuning. In fact, deeper and larger-scale foundation models can provide stronger support for performance improvement. However, due to their massive number of parameters, directly adopting full-parameter fine-tuning leads to pronounced training difficulties, such as excessive GPU memory consumption and high computational costs, which result in extremely limited exploration of large-scale models in existing works. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic wavelet expert-guided fine-tuning paradigm with fewer trainable parameters, dubbed WEFT, which efficiently adapts large-scale foundation models to ORSIs segmentation tasks by leveraging the guidance of wavelet experts. Specifically, we introduce a task-specific wavelet expert extractor to model wavelet experts from different perspectives and dynamically regulate their outputs, thereby generating trainable features enriched with task-specific information for subsequent fine-tuning. Furthermore, we construct an expert-guided conditional adapter that first enhances the fine-grained perception of frozen features for specific tasks by injecting trainable features, and then iteratively updates the information of both types of feature, allowing for efficient fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that our WEFT not only outperforms 21 state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on three ORSIs datasets, but also achieves optimal results in camouflage, natural, and medical scenarios.

Yet conventional Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions in aviation remain siloed and narrow, focusing on isolated tasks or single modalities. They struggle to integrate heterogeneous data such as voice communications, radar tracks, sensor streams and textual reports, which limits situational awareness, adaptability, and real-time decision support. This paper introduces the vision of AviationLMM, a Large Multimodal foundation Model for civil aviation, designed to unify the heterogeneous data streams of civil aviation and enable understanding, reasoning, generation and agentic applications. We firstly identify the gaps between existing AI solutions and requirements. Secondly, we describe the model architecture that ingests multimodal inputs such as air-ground voice, surveillance, on-board telemetry, video and structured texts, and performs cross-modal alignment and fusion, and produces flexible outputs ranging from situation summaries and risk alerts to predictive diagnostics and multimodal incident reconstructions. In order to fully realize this vision, we identify key research opportunities to address, including data acquisition, alignment and fusion, pretraining, reasoning, trustworthiness, privacy, robustness to missing modalities, and synthetic scenario generation. By articulating the design and challenges of AviationLMM, we aim to boost the civil aviation foundation model progress and catalyze coordinated research efforts toward an integrated, trustworthy and privacy-preserving aviation AI ecosystem.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 2025 7th International Conference on Interdisciplinary Computer Science and Engineering (ICICSE 2025) conference, Chongqing, China; 9 pages,1 figure,5 tables</p></details> |

Most existing soft grippers are pneumatically actuated with several hundred kPa pressure, and cannot generate output force sufficient for such a large and heavy object. Instead of pneumatic actuation, hydraulic actuation has a potential to generate much larger power by several MPa pressure. In this study, we develop a hydraulically-driven soft gripper, in which its basic design parameters are determined based on a mathematical model that represents the relationship among the driving pressure, bending angle, object mass and grasping force. Moreover, we selected materials suitable for grasping a heavier object, based on the finite element analysis result of the detailed design. We report experimental results on a 20 kg object grasping and closed-loop control of the finger bending angle.</p></details> |  |

Conventional approaches typically rely on event-specific models and explicit analytical formulations, which limits their adaptability and generalization across previously unseen disturbances. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes DScheLLM, a dynamic scheduling approach that leverages fine-tuned large language models within a dual-system (fast-slow) reasoning architecture to address disturbances of different scales. A unified large language model-based framework is constructed to handle dynamic events, where training datasets for both fast and slow reasoning modes are generated using exact schedules obtained from an operations research solver. The Huawei OpenPangu Embedded-7B model is subsequently fine-tuned under the hybrid reasoning paradigms using LoRA. Experimental evaluations on standard job shop scheduling benchmarks demonstrate that the fast-thinking mode can efficiently generate high-quality schedules and the slow-thinking mode can produce solver-compatible and well-formatted decision inputs. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents one of the earliest studies applying large language models to job shop scheduling in dynamic environments, highlighting their considerable potential for intelligent and adaptive scheduling optimization.</p></details> | 14 pages, 6 figures |

To systematically evaluate state-of-the-art MLLMs across a panoramic gastrointestinal endoscopy workflow and determine their clinical utility compared with human endoscopists. We constructed GI-Bench, a benchmark encompassing 20 fine-grained lesion categories. Twelve MLLMs were evaluated across a five-stage clinical workflow: anatomical localization, lesion identification, diagnosis, findings description, and management. Model performance was benchmarked against three junior endoscopists and three residency trainees using Macro-F1, mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU), and multi-dimensional Likert scale. Gemini-3-Pro achieved state-of-the-art performance. In diagnostic reasoning, top-tier models (Macro-F1 0.641) outperformed trainees (0.492) and rivaled junior endoscopists (0.727; p>0.05). However, a critical "spatial grounding bottleneck" persisted; human lesion localization (mIoU >0.506) significantly outperformed the best model (0.345; p<0.05). Furthermore, qualitative analysis revealed a "fluency-accuracy paradox": models generated reports with superior linguistic readability compared with humans (p<0.05) but exhibited significantly lower factual correctness (p<0.05) due to "over-interpretation" and hallucination of visual features. GI-Bench maintains a dynamic leaderboard that tracks the evolving performance of MLLMs in clinical endoscopy.

| **[GeoMotionGPT: Geometry-Aligned Motion Understanding with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07632v2)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discrete motion tokenization has recently enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) to serve as versatile backbones for motion understanding and motion-language reasoning. However, existing pipelines typically decouple motion quantization from semantic embedding learning, linking them solely via token IDs. This approach fails to effectively align the intrinsic geometry of the motion space with the embedding space, thereby hindering the LLM's capacity for nuanced motion reasoning. We argue that alignment is most effective when both modalities share a unified geometric basis. Therefore, instead of forcing the LLM to reconstruct the complex geometry among motion tokens from scratch, we present a novel framework that explicitly enforces orthogonality on both the motion codebook and the LLM embedding space, ensuring that their relational structures naturally mirror each other. Specifically, we employ a decoder-only quantizer with Gumbel-Softmax for differentiable training and balanced codebook usage. To bridge the modalities, we use a sparse projection that maps motion codes into the LLM embedding space while preserving orthogonality. Finally, a two-stage orthonormal regularization schedule enforces soft constraints during tokenizer training and LLM fine-tuning to maintain geometric alignment without hindering semantic adaptation. Extensive experiments on HumanML3D demonstrate that our framework achieves a 20% performance improvement over current state-of-the-art methods, validating that a unified geometric basis effectively empowers the LLM for nuanced motion reasoning.</p></details> |  |

This benchmark uses a dynamic game-like framework to test LLMs ability to mimic human cognitive processes through word associations. By simulating complex human interactions, it assesses how LLMs interpret and align with human thought patterns during conversational exchanges, which are essential for effective social partnerships in HCI. Initial findings highlight the influence of model sophistication on performance, offering insights into the models capabilities to engage in meaningful social interactions and adapt behaviors in human-like ways. This research advances the understanding of LLMs potential to replicate or diverge from human cognitive functions, paving the way for more nuanced and empathetic human-machine collaborations.</p></details> |  |

Across 49 eTVUS reports, we compared three LLMs (7B/8B and a 20B-parameter model) against expert human extraction. The 20B model achieved a mean accuracy of 86.02%, substantially outperforming smaller models and confirming the importance of scale in handling complex clinical text. Crucially, we identified a highly complementary error profile: the LLM excelled at syntactic consistency (e.g., date/numeric formatting) where humans faltered, while human experts provided superior semantic and contextual interpretation. We also found that the LLM's semantic errors were fundamental limitations that could not be mitigated by simple prompt engineering. These findings strongly support a human-in-the-loop (HITL) workflow in which the on-premise LLM serves as a collaborative tool, not a full replacement. It automates routine structuring and flags potential human errors, enabling imaging specialists to focus on high-level semantic validation. We discuss implications for structured reporting and interactive AI systems in clinical practice.</p></details> |  |

This paper evaluates the efficacy of state-of-the-art LLMs in classifying executable code as either benign or malicious. We introduce an automated pipeline that first decompiles Windows executable into a C code using Ghidra disassembler and then leverages LLMs to perform the classification. Our evaluation reveals that while standard LLMs show promise, they are not yet robust enough to replace traditional anti-virus software. We demonstrate that a fine-tuned model, trained on curated malware and benign datasets, significantly outperforms its vanilla counterpart. However, the performance of even this specialized model degrades notably when encountering newer malware. This finding demonstrates the critical need for continuous fine-tuning with emerging threats to maintain model effectiveness against the changing coding patterns and behaviors of malicious software.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, published in 2025 IEMCON</p></details> |

The quality of generated content heavily relies on the usefulness of the retrieved information and the capacity of LLMs' internal information processing mechanism to incorporate it in answer generation. It is generally assumed that the retrieved information is relevant to the question. However, the retrieved information may have a variable degree of relevance and usefulness, depending on the question and the document collection. It is important to take into account the relevance of the retrieved information in answer generation. In this paper, we propose OpenDecoder, a new approach that leverages explicit evaluation of the retrieved information as quality indicator features for generation. We aim to build a RAG model that is more robust to varying levels of noisy context. Three types of explicit evaluation information are considered: relevance score, ranking score, and QPP (query performance prediction) score. The experimental results on five benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and better robustness of OpenDecoder by outperforming various baseline methods. Importantly, this paradigm is flexible to be integrated with the post-training of LLMs for any purposes and incorporated with any type of external indicators.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM WWW 2026</p></details> |

It focuses on alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) schemes and block coordinate descent (BCD) methods. Specifically, it introduces a new proximal ADMM algorithm and proposes two BCD methods. The first part of the research presents a new proximal ADMM algorithm. This method is adaptive to all problem parameters and solves the proximal augmented Lagrangian (AL) subproblem inexactly. This adaptiveness facilitates the highly efficient application of the algorithm to a broad swath of practical problems. The inexact solution of the proximal AL subproblem overcomes many key challenges in the practical applications of ADMM. The resultant algorithm obtains an approximate solution of an optimization problem in a number of iterations that matches the state-of-the-art complexity for the class of proximal ADMM schemes. The second part of the research focuses on an inexact proximal mapping for the class of block proximal gradient methods. Key properties of this operator is established, facilitating the derivation of convergence rates for the proposed algorithm. Under two error decreases conditions, the algorithm matches the convergence rate of its exactly computed counterpart. Numerical results demonstrate the superior performance of the algorithm under a dynamic error regime over a fixed one. The dissertation concludes by providing convergence guarantees for the randomized BCD method applied to a broad class of functions, known as Hölder smooth functions. Convergence rates are derived for non-convex, convex, and strongly convex functions. These convergence rates match those furnished in the existing literature for the Lipschtiz smooth setting.</p></details> |  |

While substantial work has examined social biases such as gender and race, systematic studies of political bias remain limited, despite their direct societal impact. This paper introduces a general methodology for constructing political bias benchmarks by aligning model-generated voting predictions with verified parliamentary voting records. We instantiate this methodology in three national case studies: PoliBiasNL (2,701 Dutch parliamentary motions and votes from 15 political parties), PoliBiasNO (10,584 motions and votes from 9 Norwegian parties), and PoliBiasES (2,480 motions and votes from 10 Spanish parties). Across these benchmarks, we assess ideological tendencies and political entity bias in LLM behavior. As part of our evaluation framework, we also propose a method to visualize the ideology of LLMs and political parties in a shared two-dimensional CHES (Chapel Hill Expert Survey) space by linking their voting-based positions to the CHES dimensions, enabling direct and interpretable comparisons between models and real-world political actors. Our experiments reveal fine-grained ideological distinctions: state-of-the-art LLMs consistently display left-leaning or centrist tendencies, alongside clear negative biases toward right-conservative parties. These findings highlight the value of transparent, cross-national evaluation grounded in real parliamentary behavior for understanding and auditing political bias in modern LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Conventional neural models learn statistical correspondences between names and nationalities from task-specific training data, posing challenges in generalizing to low-frequency nationalities and distinguishing similar nationalities within the same region. Large language models (LLMs) have the potential to address these challenges by leveraging world knowledge acquired during pre-training. In this study, we comprehensively compare neural models and LLMs on nationality prediction, evaluating six neural models and six LLM prompting strategies across three granularity levels (nationality, region, and continent), with frequency-based stratified analysis and error analysis. Results show that LLMs outperform neural models at all granularity levels, with the gap narrowing as granularity becomes coarser. Simple machine learning methods exhibit the highest frequency robustness, while pre-trained models and LLMs show degradation for low-frequency nationalities. Error analysis reveals that LLMs tend to make ``near-miss'' errors, predicting the correct region even when nationality is incorrect, whereas neural models exhibit more cross-regional errors and bias toward high-frequency classes. These findings indicate that LLM superiority stems from world knowledge, model selection should consider required granularity, and evaluation should account for error quality beyond accuracy.</p></details> |  |

We introduce QuantEval, a benchmark that evaluates LLMs across three essential dimensions of quantitative finance: knowledge-based QA, quantitative mathematical reasoning, and quantitative strategy coding. Unlike prior financial benchmarks, QuantEval integrates a CTA-style backtesting framework that executes model-generated strategies and evaluates them using financial performance metrics, enabling a more realistic assessment of quantitative coding ability. We evaluate some state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary LLMs and observe substantial gaps to human experts, particularly in reasoning and strategy coding. Finally, we conduct large-scale supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning experiments on domain-aligned data, demonstrating consistent improvements. We hope QuantEval will facilitate research on LLMs' quantitative finance capabilities and accelerate their practical adoption in real-world trading workflows. We additionally release the full deterministic backtesting configuration (asset universe, cost model, and metric definitions) to ensure strict reproducibility.</p></details> |  |
| **[Accelerated Gradient Methods with Biased Gradient Estimates: Risk Sensitivity, High-Probability Guarantees, and Large Deviation Bounds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13628v3)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study trade-offs between convergence rate and robustness to gradient errors in the context of first-order methods. Our focus is on generalized momentum methods (GMMs)--a broad class that includes Nesterov's accelerated gradient, heavy-ball, and gradient descent methods--for minimizing smooth strongly convex objectives. We allow stochastic gradient errors that may be adversarial and biased, and quantify robustness of these methods to gradient errors via the risk-sensitive index (RSI) from robust control theory. For quadratic objectives with i.i.d. Gaussian noise, we give closed form expressions for RSI in terms of solutions to 2x2 matrix Riccati equations, revealing a Pareto frontier between RSI and convergence rate over the choice of step-size and momentum parameters. We then prove a large-deviation principle for time-averaged suboptimality in the large iteration limit and show that the rate function is, up to a scaling, the convex conjugate of the RSI function. We further show that the rate function and RSI are linked to the $H_\infty$-norm--a measure of robustness to the worst-case deterministic gradient errors--so that stronger worst-case robustness (smaller $H_\infty$-norm) leads to sharper decay of the tail probabilities for the average suboptimality. Beyond quadratics, under potentially biased sub-Gaussian gradient errors, we derive non-asymptotic bounds on a finite-time analogue of the RSI, yielding finite-time high-probability guarantees and non-asymptotic large-deviation bounds for the averaged iterates. In the case of smooth strongly convex functions, we also observe an analogous trade-off between RSI and convergence-rate bounds. To our knowledge, these are the first non-asymptotic guarantees for GMMs with biased gradients and the first risk-sensitive analysis of GMMs. Finally, we provide numerical experiments on a robust regression problem to illustrate our results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Analyzing Bias in False Refusal Behavior of Large Language Models for Hate Speech Detoxification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08668v1)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large language models (LLMs) have increasingly been applied to hate speech detoxification, the prompts often trigger safety alerts, causing LLMs to refuse the task. In this study, we systematically investigate false refusal behavior in hate speech detoxification and analyze the contextual and linguistic biases that trigger such refusals. We evaluate nine LLMs on both English and multilingual datasets, our results show that LLMs disproportionately refuse inputs with higher semantic toxicity and those targeting specific groups, particularly nationality, religion, and political ideology. Although multilingual datasets exhibit lower overall false refusal rates than English datasets, models still display systematic, language-dependent biases toward certain targets. Based on these findings, we propose a simple cross-translation strategy, translating English hate speech into Chinese for detoxification and back, which substantially reduces false refusals while preserving the original content, providing an effective and lightweight mitigation approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[TROJail: Trajectory-Level Optimization for Multi-Turn Large Language Model Jailbreaks with Process Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07761v2)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models have seen widespread adoption, yet they remain vulnerable to multi-turn jailbreak attacks, threatening their safe deployment. This has led to the task of training automated multi-turn attackers to probe model safety vulnerabilities. However, existing approaches typically rely on turn-level optimization, which is insufficient for learning long-term attack strategies. To bridge this gap, we formulate this task as a multi-turn reinforcement learning problem, directly optimizing the harmfulness of the final-turn response as the outcome reward. To address the sparse supervision of the outcome reward, we introduce TROJail, which employs two process rewards to evaluate the utility of intermediate prompts and integrate them into advantage estimation. These rewards (1) penalize overly harmful prompts that trigger the model's refusal mechanism, and (2) encourage steering the semantic relevance of responses toward the targeted harmful content. Experimental results show improved attack success rates across multiple models and benchmarks, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach. The code is available at https://github.com/xxiqiao/TROJail. Warning: This paper contains examples of harmful content.</p></details> | 21 pages, 15 figures |
| **[Efficient Maintenance of Leiden Communities in Large Dynamic Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08554v1)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As a well-known community detection algorithm, Leiden has been widely used in various scenarios such as large language model generation (e.g., Graph-RAG), anomaly detection, and biological analysis. In these scenarios, the graphs are often large and dynamic, where vertices and edges are inserted and deleted frequently, so it is costly to obtain the updated communities by Leiden from scratch when the graph has changed. Recently, one work has attempted to study how to maintain Leiden communities in the dynamic graph, but it lacks a detailed theoretical analysis, and its algorithms are inefficient for large graphs. To address these issues, in this paper, we first theoretically show that the existing algorithms are relatively unbounded via the boundedness analysis (a powerful tool for analyzing incremental algorithms on dynamic graphs), and also analyze the memberships of vertices in communities when the graph changes. Based on theoretical analysis, we develop a novel efficient maintenance algorithm, called Hierarchical Incremental Tree Leiden (HIT-Leiden), which effectively reduces the range of affected vertices by maintaining the connected components and hierarchical community structures. Comprehensive experiments in various datasets demonstrate the superior performance of HIT-Leiden. In particular, it achieves speedups of up to five orders of magnitude over existing methods.</p></details> |  |

With the rapid growth of vector data, efficient indexing for real-time vector search has become rudimentary. Existing CPU-based solutions support updates but suffer from low throughput, while GPU-accelerated systems deliver high performance but face challenges with dynamic updates and limited GPU memory, resulting in a critical performance gap for continuous, large-scale vector search requiring both accuracy and speed. In this paper, we present SVFusion, a GPU-CPU-disk collaborative framework for real-time vector search that bridges sophisticated GPU computation with online updates. SVFusion leverages a hierarchical vector index architecture that employs CPU-GPU co-processing, along with a workload-aware vector caching mechanism to maximize the efficiency of limited GPU memory. It further enhances performance through real-time coordination with CUDA multi-stream optimization and adaptive resource management, along with concurrency control that ensures data consistency under interleaved queries and updates. Empirical results demonstrate that SVFusion achieves significant improvements in query latency and throughput, exhibiting a 20.9x higher throughput on average and 1.3x to 50.7x lower latency compared to baseline methods, while maintaining high recall for large-scale datasets under various streaming workloads.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication in PVLDB Volume 19(VLDB 2026)</p></details> |
| **[MoHoBench: Assessing Honesty of Multimodal Large Language Models via Unanswerable Visual Questions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21503v4)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved considerable advancements in vision-language tasks, yet produce potentially harmful or untrustworthy content. Despite substantial work investigating the trustworthiness of language models, MMLMs' capability to act honestly, especially when faced with visually unanswerable questions, remains largely underexplored. This work presents the first systematic assessment of honesty behaviors across various MLLMs. We ground honesty in models' response behaviors to unanswerable visual questions, define four representative types of such questions, and construct MoHoBench, a large-scale MMLM honest benchmark, consisting of 12k+ visual question samples, whose quality is guaranteed by multi-stage filtering and human verification. Using MoHoBench, we benchmarked the honesty of 28 popular MMLMs and conducted a comprehensive analysis. Our findings show that: (1) most models fail to appropriately refuse to answer when necessary, and (2) MMLMs' honesty is not solely a language modeling issue, but is deeply influenced by visual information, necessitating the development of dedicated methods for multimodal honesty alignment. Therefore, we implemented initial alignment methods using supervised and preference learning to improve honesty behavior, providing a foundation for future work on trustworthy MLLMs. Our data and code can be found at https://github.com/yanxuzhu/MoHoBench.</p></details> | AAAI2026 Oral |

To improve accessibility, audio CAPTCHAs are designed to complement visual ones. However, the robustness of audio CAPTCHAs against advanced Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models remains unclear. In this paper, we introduce AI-CAPTCHA, a unified framework that offers (i) an evaluation framework, ACEval, which includes advanced LALM- and ASR-based solvers, and (ii) a novel audio CAPTCHA approach, IllusionAudio, leveraging audio illusions. Through extensive evaluations of seven widely deployed audio CAPTCHAs, we show that most existing methods can be solved with high success rates by advanced LALMs and ASR models, exposing critical security weaknesses. To address these vulnerabilities, we design a new audio CAPTCHA approach, IllusionAudio, which exploits perceptual illusion cues rooted in human auditory mechanisms. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method defeats all tested LALM- and ASR-based attacks while achieving a 100% human pass rate, significantly outperforming existing audio CAPTCHA methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spectral Generative Flow Models: A Physics-Inspired Replacement for Vectorized Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08893v1)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Spectral Generative Flow Models (SGFMs), a physics-inspired alternative to transformer-based large language models. Instead of representing text or video as sequences of discrete tokens processed by attention, SGFMs treat generation as the evolution of a continuous field governed by constrained stochastic dynamics in a multiscale wavelet basis. This formulation replaces global attention with local operators, spectral projections, and Navier--Stokes-like transport, yielding a generative mechanism grounded in continuity, geometry, and physical structure. Our framework provides three key innovations: (i) a field-theoretic ontology in which text and video are unified as trajectories of a stochastic partial differential equation; (ii) a wavelet-domain representation that induces sparsity, scale separation, and computational efficiency; and (iii) a constrained stochastic flow that enforces stability, coherence, and uncertainty propagation. Together, these components define a generative architecture that departs fundamentally from autoregressive modeling and diffusion-based approaches. SGFMs offer a principled path toward long-range coherence, multimodal generality, and physically structured inductive bias in next-generation generative models.</p></details> |  |

Existing solutions either require substantial training data or rely on domain-specific rules that limit scalability. In this paper, we present MHEL-LLaMo (Multilingual Historical Entity Linking with Large Language MOdels), an unsupervised ensemble approach combining a Small Language Model (SLM) and an LLM. MHEL-LLaMo leverages a multilingual bi-encoder (BELA) for candidate retrieval and an instruction-tuned LLM for NIL prediction and candidate selection via prompt chaining. Our system uses SLM's confidence scores to discriminate between easy and hard samples, applying an LLM only for hard cases. This strategy reduces computational costs while preventing hallucinations on straightforward cases. We evaluate MHEL-LLaMo on four established benchmarks in six European languages (English, Finnish, French, German, Italian and Swedish) from the 19th and 20th centuries. Results demonstrate that MHEL-LLaMo outperforms state-of-the-art models without requiring fine-tuning, offering a scalable solution for low-resource historical EL. The implementation of MHEL-LLaMo is available on Github.</p></details> |  |

Unlike jailbreaks or prompt injection, Overflow arises under ordinary interaction settings and can lead to elevated serving cost, latency, and cross-user performance degradation, particularly when scaled across many requests. Beyond usability, the stakes are economic and environmental: unnecessary tokens increase per-request cost and energy consumption, compounding into substantial operational spend and carbon footprint at scale. Moreover, Overflow represents a practical vector for compute amplification and service degradation in shared environments. We introduce BenchOverflow, a model-agnostic benchmark of nine plain-text prompting strategies that amplify output volume without adversarial suffixes or policy circumvention. Using a standardized protocol with a fixed budget of 5000 new tokens, we evaluate nine open- and closed-source models and observe pronounced rightward shifts and heavy tails in length distributions. Cap-saturation rates (CSR@1k/3k/5k) and empirical cumulative distribution functions (ECDFs) quantify tail risk; within-prompt variance and cross-model correlations show that Overflow is broadly reproducible yet heterogeneous across families and attack vectors. A lightweight mitigation-a fixed conciseness reminder-attenuates right tails and lowers CSR for all strategies across the majority of models. Our findings position length control as a measurable reliability, cost, and sustainability concern rather than a stylistic quirk. By enabling standardized comparison of length-control robustness across models, BenchOverflow provides a practical basis for selecting deployments that minimize resource waste and operating expense, and for evaluating defenses that curb compute amplification without eroding task performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at TMLR 2026</p></details> |

Training and evaluating agents on complex agentic tasks such as software engineering and computer use requires not only efficient model computation but also sophisticated infrastructure capable of coordinating vast agent-environment interactions. However, no open-source infrastructure can effectively support large-scale training and evaluation on such complex agentic tasks. To address this challenge, we present MegaFlow, a large-scale distributed orchestration system that enables efficient scheduling, resource allocation, and fine-grained task management for agent-environment workloads. MegaFlow abstracts agent training infrastructure into three independent services (Model Service, Agent Service, and Environment Service) that interact through unified interfaces, enabling independent scaling and flexible resource allocation across diverse agent-environment configurations. In our agent training deployments, MegaFlow successfully orchestrates tens of thousands of concurrent agent tasks while maintaining high system stability and achieving efficient resource utilization. By enabling such large-scale agent training, MegaFlow addresses a critical infrastructure gap in the emerging agentic AI landscape.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Models to Enhance Multi-task Drone Operations in Simulated Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08405v1)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Benefiting from the rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs), human-drone interaction has reached unprecedented opportunities. In this paper, we propose a method that integrates a fine-tuned CodeT5 model with the Unreal Engine-based AirSim drone simulator to efficiently execute multi-task operations using natural language commands. This approach enables users to interact with simulated drones through prompts or command descriptions, allowing them to easily access and control the drone's status, significantly lowering the operational threshold. In the AirSim simulator, we can flexibly construct visually realistic dynamic environments to simulate drone applications in complex scenarios. By combining a large dataset of (natural language, program code) command-execution pairs generated by ChatGPT with developer-written drone code as training data, we fine-tune the CodeT5 to achieve automated translation from natural language to executable code for drone tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits superior task execution efficiency and command understanding capabilities in simulated environments. In the future, we plan to extend the model functionality in a modular manner, enhancing its adaptability to complex scenarios and driving the application of drone technologies in real-world environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>1st I...</summary><p>1st International Conference on Drones and Unmanned Systems (DAUS' 2025)</p></details> |

However, different tutoring strategies benefit different student personalities, and mismatches can be counterproductive to student outcomes. Despite this, current LLM tutoring systems do not take into account student personality traits. To address this problem, we first construct a taxonomy that links pedagogical methods to personality profiles, based on pedagogical literature. We simulate student-teacher conversations and use our framework to let the LLM tutor adjust its strategy to the simulated student personality. We evaluate the scenario with human teachers and find that they consistently prefer our approach over two baselines. Our method also increases the use of less common, high-impact strategies such as role-playing, which human and LLM annotators prefer significantly. Our findings pave the way for developing more personalized and effective LLM use in educational applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sequential Enumeration in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04727v2)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reliably counting and generating sequences of items remain a significant challenge for neural networks, including Large Language Models (LLMs). Indeed, although this capability is readily handled by rule-based symbolic systems based on serial computation, learning to systematically deploy counting procedures is difficult for neural models, which should acquire these skills through learning. Previous research has demonstrated that recurrent architectures can only approximately track and enumerate sequences of events, and it remains unclear whether modern deep learning systems, including LLMs, can deploy systematic counting procedures over sequences of discrete symbols. This paper aims to fill this gap by investigating the sequential enumeration abilities of five state-of-the-art LLMs, including proprietary, open-source, and reasoning models. We probe LLMs in sequential naming and production tasks involving lists of letters and words, adopting a variety of prompting instructions to explore the role of chain-of-thought in the spontaneous emerging of counting strategies. We also evaluate open-source models with the same architecture but increasing size to see whether the mastering of counting principles follows scaling laws, and we analyze the embedding dynamics during sequential enumeration to investigate the emergent encoding of numerosity. We find that some LLMs are indeed capable of deploying counting procedures when explicitly prompted to do so, but none of them spontaneously engage in counting when simply asked to enumerate the number of items in a sequence. Our results suggest that, despite their impressive emergent abilities, LLMs cannot yet robustly and systematically deploy counting procedures, highlighting a persistent gap between neural and symbolic approaches to compositional generalization.</p></details> |  |

The widespread adoption of test-time scaling further intensifies the tension between model capability and resource consumption, highlighting the importance of inference efficiency. However, a unified metric that accurately reflects an LLM's efficiency across diverse model sizes and architectures remains absent. Motivated by the correlation between compression and intelligence, we introduce information capacity, a measure of model efficiency based on text compression performance relative to computational complexity. A distinctive feature of information capacity is its incorporation of tokenizer efficiency, which affects inference costs but is often neglected in LLM evaluations. We assess the information capacity of 52 open-source models and observe a consistent information capacity among different-sized models within a series. Experiments on 5 heterogeneous datasets reveal strong linguistic bias in mainstream LLMs. Three major factors of information capacity include tokenizer efficiency, pretraining data, and the mixture-of-experts architecture. Empirical results verify the accuracy of performance prediction across model sizes based on information capacity and show the correlation between information capacity and benchmark scores.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/TeleAI-AI-Flow/InformationCapacity.

In this study, epoch-wise double descent, which is delayed generalization following overfitting, was empirically investigated by focusing on the evolution of internal structures. Fully connected neural networks of three different sizes were trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset with 30% label noise. By decomposing the loss curves into signal contributions from clean and noisy training data, the epoch-wise evolutions of internal signals were analyzed separately. Three main findings were obtained from this analysis. First, the model achieved strong re-generalization on test data even after perfectly fitting noisy training data during the double descent phase, corresponding to a "benign overfitting" state. Second, noisy data were learned after clean data, and as learning progressed, their corresponding internal activations became increasingly separated in outer layers; this enabled the model to overfit only noisy data. Third, a single, very large activation emerged in the shallow layer across all models; this phenomenon is referred as "outliers," "massive activa-tions," and "super activations" in recent large language models and evolves with re-generalization. The magnitude of large activation correlated with input patterns but not with output patterns. These empirical findings directly link the recent key phenomena of "deep double descent," "benign overfitting," and "large activation", and support the proposal of a novel scenario for understanding deep double descent.</p></details> | 17 pages, 9 figures |

It evaluates advanced prompting techniques like few-shot learning, chain-of-thought prompting, and self-consistency against a baseline. Key tasks include sentiment classification, aspect-based sentiment analysis, and detecting subtle nuances such as irony. The research details the theoretical background, datasets, and methods used, assessing performance of LLMs as measured by accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 score. Findings reveal that advanced prompting significantly improves sentiment analysis, with the few-shot approach excelling in GPT-4o-mini and chain-of-thought prompting boosting irony detection in gemini-1.5-flash by up to 46%. Thus, while advanced prompting techniques overall improve performance, the fact that few-shot prompting works best for GPT-4o-mini and chain-of-thought excels in gemini-1.5-flash for irony detection suggests that prompting strategies must be tailored to both the model and the task. This highlights the importance of aligning prompt design with both the LLM's architecture and the semantic complexity of the task.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 4 figures, 13 tables</p></details> |

While token compression can reduce computational costs, existing approaches are designed for single-view LVLMs and fail to consider the unique multi-view characteristics of high-resolution LVLMs with dynamic cropping. Existing methods treat all tokens uniformly, but our analysis reveals that global thumbnails can naturally guide the compression of local crops by providing holistic context for informativeness evaluation. In this paper, we first analyze dynamic cropping strategy, revealing both the complementary nature between thumbnails and crops, and the distinctive characteristics across different crops. Based on our observations, we propose ``Global Compression Commander'' (\textit{i.e.}, \textbf{GlobalCom$^2$}), a novel plug-and-play token compression framework for HR-LVLMs. GlobalCom$^2$ leverages thumbnail as the ``commander'' to guide the compression of local crops, adaptively preserving informative details while eliminating redundancy.

To investigate this, we introduce KidVis, a novel benchmark grounded in the theory of human visual development. KidVis deconstructs visual intelligence into six atomic capabilities - Concentration, Tracking, Discrimination, Memory, Spatial, and Closure - already possessed by 6-7 year old children, comprising 10 categories of low-semantic-dependent visual tasks. Evaluating 20 state-of-the-art MLLMs against a human physiological baseline reveals a stark performance disparity. Results indicate that while human children achieve a near-perfect average score of 95.32, the state-of-the-art GPT-5 attains only 67.33. Crucially, we observe a "Scaling Law Paradox": simply increasing model parameters fails to yield linear improvements in these foundational visual capabilities. This study confirms that current MLLMs, despite their reasoning prowess, lack the essential physiological perceptual primitives required for generalized visual intelligence.</p></details> |  |

We formalize this setting as Sparse Agentic Control (SAC), where policies admit block-sparse representations over M >> 1 actions and rewards depend on sparse main effects and (optionally) sparse synergies. We study ell_{1,2}-regularized policy learning through a convex surrogate and establish sharp, compressed-sensing-style results: (i) estimation and value suboptimality scale as k (log M / T)^{1/2} under a Policy-RSC condition; (ii) exact tool-support recovery holds via primal-dual witness arguments when T > k log M under incoherence and beta-min; and (iii) any dense policy class requires Omega(M) samples, explaining the instability of prompt-only controllers. We further show that under partial observability, LLMs matter only through a belief/representation error epsilon_b, yielding an additive O(epsilon_b) degradation while preserving logarithmic dependence on M. Extensions cover tuning-free, online, robust, group-sparse, and interaction-aware SAC.</p></details> |  |

The LLM operates as a high level coordinator that generates textual guidance that shape the reward of the DRL agent during training. The results show that the LAM-DRL outperforms the traditional DRL by 40% in nominal weather scenarios and 64% in extreme weather scenarios compared to heuristics in terms of throughput, fairness, and outage probability.</p></details> |  |

Recent zero-shot methods based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have the advantage of removing the reliance on labeled ADL sensor data. However, existing approaches rely on time-based segmentation, which is poorly aligned with the contextual reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Moreover, existing approaches lack methods for estimating prediction confidence. This paper proposes to improve zero-shot ADL recognition with event-based segmentation and a novel method for estimating prediction confidence. Our experimental evaluation shows that event-based segmentation consistently outperforms time-based LLM approaches on complex, realistic datasets and surpasses supervised data-driven methods, even with relatively small LLMs (e.g., Gemma 3 27B). The proposed confidence measure effectively distinguishes correct from incorrect predictions.</p></details> |  |

While most prior studies focus on detection that responds to existing conditions, forecasting mental health enables proactive support through Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive benchmarking study comparing traditional machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and large language model (LLM) approaches for mental health forecasting using the College Experience Sensing (CES) dataset, the most extensive longitudinal dataset of college student mental health to date. We systematically evaluate models across temporal windows, feature granularities, personalization strategies, and class imbalance handling. Our results show that DL models, particularly Transformer (Macro-F1 = 0.58), achieve the best overall performance, while LLMs show strength in contextual reasoning but weaker temporal modeling. Personalization substantially improves forecasts of severe mental health states. By revealing how different modeling approaches interpret phone sensing behavioral data over time, this work lays the groundwork for next-generation, adaptive, and human-centered mental health technologies that can advance both research and real-world well-being.</p></details> |  |

Existing backdoor-based fingerprints either rely on rare tokens -- leading to high-perplexity inputs susceptible to filtering -- or use fixed trigger-response mappings that are brittle to leakage and post-hoc adaptation. We propose \textsc{Dual-Layer Nested Fingerprinting} (DNF), a black-box method that embeds a hierarchical backdoor by coupling domain-specific stylistic cues with implicit semantic triggers. Across Mistral-7B, LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct, and Falcon3-7B-Instruct, DNF achieves perfect fingerprint activation while preserving downstream utility. Compared with existing methods, it uses lower-perplexity triggers, remains undetectable under fingerprint detection attacks, and is relatively robust to incremental fine-tuning and model merging. These results position DNF as a practical, stealthy, and resilient solution for LLM ownership verification and intellectual property protection.</p></details> |  |

However, the two dominant paradigms for private knowledge injection each have pronounced drawbacks: fine-tuning is expensive to iterate, and continual updates risk catastrophic forgetting and general-capability regression; retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) keeps the base model intact but is brittle in specialized private corpora due to chunk-induced evidence fragmentation, retrieval drift, and long-context pressure that yields query-dependent prompt inflation. Inspired by how multimodal LLMs align heterogeneous modalities into a shared semantic space, we propose Generation-Augmented Generation (GAG), which treats private expertise as an additional expert modality and injects it via a compact, representation-level interface aligned to the frozen base model, avoiding prompt-time evidence serialization while enabling plug-and-play specialization and scalable multi-domain composition with reliable selective activation. Across two private scientific QA benchmarks (immunology adjuvant and catalytic materials) and mixed-domain evaluations, GAG improves specialist performance over strong RAG baselines by 15.34% and 14.86% on the two benchmarks, respectively, while maintaining performance on six open general benchmarks and enabling near-oracle selective activation for scalable multi-domain deployment.</p></details> |  |

The proposed methodology employs a three-tiered framework incorporating multi-layer corner screening and adaptive template matching. Firstly, dimensionality is reduced through illumination equalization and structural information extraction. A coarse-to-fine candidate selection strategy minimizes sliding window computational costs, enabling rapid estimation of the marker's position. Finally, adaptive templates are generated for candidate points, achieving subpixel precision through improved template matching with correlation coefficient extremum fitting. Experimental results demonstrate the method's effectiveness in extracting and localizing diagonal markers in complex, large-scale environments, making it ideal for field-of-view measurement in navigation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by Applied Optics</p></details> |

However, there is still no consensus on how best to construct and utilize such profiles. To address this, we revisit recent profiling-based approaches in recommender systems along four dimensions: 1) knowledge base, 2) preference indicator, 3) impact range, and 4) subject. We argue that large language models (LLMs) are effective at extracting compressed rationales from diverse knowledge sources, while knowledge graphs (KGs) are better suited for propagating these profiles to extend their reach. Building on this insight, we propose a new recommendation model, called SPiKE. SPiKE consists of three core components: i) Entity profile generation, which uses LLMs to generate semantic profiles for all KG entities; ii) Profile-aware KG aggregation, which integrates these profiles into the KG; and iii) Pairwise profile preference matching, which aligns LLM- and KG-based representations during training. In experiments, we demonstrate that SPiKE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art KG- and LLM-based recommenders in real-world settings.</p></details> | Accepted at KDD 2026 |

Existing deep forecasting models typically supervise predictions using full-length temporal windows, which include substantial high-frequency noise and obscure long-term trends. Moreover, auxiliary variables containing rich domain-specific information are often underutilized, especially in few-shot settings. To address these challenges, we propose LoFT-LLM, a frequency-aware forecasting pipeline that integrates low-frequency learning with semantic calibration via a large language model (LLM). Firstly, a Patch Low-Frequency forecasting Module (PLFM) extracts stable low-frequency trends from localized spectral patches. Secondly, a residual learner then models high-frequency variations. Finally, a fine-tuned LLM refines the predictions by incorporating auxiliary context and domain knowledge through structured natural language prompts. Extensive experiments on financial and energy datasets demonstrate that LoFT-LLM significantly outperforms strong baselines under both full-data and few-shot regimes, delivering superior accuracy, robustness, and interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This submission is withdrawn due to internal review and compliance considerations</p></details> |

Existing multilingual models demonstrate poor performance on Urdu-specific tasks, struggling with the language's complex morphology, right-to-left Nastaliq script, and rich literary traditions. Even the base LLaMA-3.1 8B-Instruct model shows limited capability in generating fluent, contextually appropriate Urdu text. We introduce Qalb, an Urdu language model developed through a two-stage approach: continued pre-training followed by supervised fine-tuning. Starting from LLaMA 3.1 8B, we perform continued pre-training on a dataset of 1.97 billion tokens. This corpus comprises 1.84 billion tokens of diverse Urdu text-spanning news archives, classical and contemporary literature, government documents, and social media-combined with 140 million tokens of English Wikipedia data to prevent catastrophic forgetting. We then fine-tune the resulting model on the Alif Urdu-instruct dataset. Through extensive evaluation on Urdu-specific benchmarks, Qalb demonstrates substantial improvements, achieving a weighted average score of 90.34 and outperforming the previous state-of-the-art Alif-1.0-Instruct model (87.1) by 3.24 points, while also surpassing the base LLaMA-3.1 8B-Instruct model by 44.64 points. Qalb achieves state-of-the-art performance with comprehensive evaluation across seven diverse tasks including Classification, Sentiment Analysis, and Reasoning. Our results demonstrate that continued pre-training on diverse, high-quality language data, combined with targeted instruction fine-tuning, effectively adapts foundation models to low-resource languages.</p></details> |  |

A Systematic Benchmark on High-Stakes Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08134v1)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The miscalibration of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) undermines their reliability in high-stakes domains, necessitating methods to accurately estimate the confidence of their long-form, multi-step outputs. To address this gap, we introduce the Reasoning Model Confidence estimation Benchmark (RMCB), a public resource of 347,496 reasoning traces from six popular LRMs across different architectural families. The benchmark is constructed from a diverse suite of datasets spanning high-stakes domains, including clinical, financial, legal, and mathematical reasoning, alongside complex general reasoning benchmarks, with correctness annotations provided for all samples. Using RMCB, we conduct a large-scale empirical evaluation of over ten distinct representation-based methods, spanning sequential, graph-based, and text-based architectures. Our central finding is a persistent trade-off between discrimination (AUROC) and calibration (ECE): text-based encoders achieve the best AUROC (0.672), while structurally-aware models yield the best ECE (0.148), with no single method dominating both. Furthermore, we find that increased architectural complexity does not reliably outperform simpler sequential baselines, suggesting a performance ceiling for methods relying solely on chunk-level hidden states. This work provides the most comprehensive benchmark for this task to date, establishing rigorous baselines and demonstrating the limitations of current representation-based paradigms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 19th Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (EACL 2026) main conference</p></details> |

Yet, despite increasing demand for transparency and interpretability, the field has yet to develop a widely accepted solution for interpretable automated scoring to be used in large-scale real-world assessments. This work takes a principled approach to address this challenge. We analyze the needs and potential benefits of interpretable automated scoring for various assessment stakeholder groups and develop four principles of interpretability -- (F)aithfulness, (G)roundedness, (T)raceability, and (I)nterchangeability (FGTI) -- targeted at those needs. To illustrate the feasibility of implementing these principles, we develop the AnalyticScore framework for short answer scoring as a baseline reference framework for future research. In terms of scoring accuracy, AnalyticScore outperforms many uninterpretable scoring methods and is, on average, within 0.06 QWK of the uninterpretable SOTA across 10 items from the ASAP-SAS dataset. By comparing against human annotators conducting the same featurization task, we further demonstrate that the featurization behavior of AnalyticScore aligns well with that of humans.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 5 figures (Extended discussion, added details, error fixes)</p></details> |

To address these limitations, we propose an Adaptive Causal Prompting with Sketch-of-Thought (ACPS) framework, which leverages structural causal models to infer the causal effect of a query on its answer and adaptively select an appropriate intervention (i.e., standard front-door and conditional front-door adjustments). This design enables generalisable causal reasoning across heterogeneous tasks without task-specific retraining. By replacing verbose CoT with concise Sketch-of-Thought, ACPS enables efficient reasoning that significantly reduces token usage and inference cost. Extensive experiments on multiple reasoning benchmarks and LLMs demonstrate that ACPS consistently outperforms existing prompting baselines in terms of accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Findings of EACL 2026</p></details> |
| **[Large-scale Regional Traffic Signal Control Based on Single-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09252v2)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the context of global urbanization and motorization, traffic congestion has become a significant issue, severely affecting the quality of life, environment, and economy. This paper puts forward a single-agent reinforcement learning (RL)-based regional traffic signal control (TSC) model. Different from multi - agent systems, this model can coordinate traffic signals across a large area, with the goals of alleviating regional traffic congestion and minimizing the total travel time. The TSC environment is precisely defined through specific state space, action space, and reward functions. The state space consists of the current congestion state, which is represented by the queue lengths of each link, and the current signal phase scheme of intersections. The action space is designed to select an intersection first and then adjust its phase split. Two reward functions are meticulously crafted. One focuses on alleviating congestion and the other aims to minimize the total travel time while considering the congestion level. The experiments are carried out with the SUMO traffic simulation software. The performance of the TSC model is evaluated by comparing it with a base case where no signal-timing adjustments are made. The results show that the model can effectively control congestion. For example, the queuing length is significantly reduced in the scenarios tested. Moreover, when the reward is set to both alleviate congestion and minimize the total travel time, the average travel time is remarkably decreased, which indicates that the model can effectively improve traffic conditions. This research provides a new approach for large-scale regional traffic signal control and offers valuable insights for future urban traffic management.</p></details> | <details><summary>A cri...</summary><p>A critical error in the methodology. The reported congestion control effects were not caused by the proposed signal timing optimization, but by an incorrect traffic volume scaling factor during evaluation. The traffic demand was not properly amplified, resulting in misleading performance gains.

| **[Reasoning Beyond Chain-of-Thought: A Latent Computational Mode in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08058v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has improved the reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs), but it remains unclear why it works and whether it is the unique mechanism for triggering reasoning in large language models. In this work, we study this question by directly analyzing and intervening on the internal representations of LLMs with Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), identifying a small set of latent features that are causally associated with LLM reasoning behavior. Across multiple model families and reasoning benchmarks, we find that steering a single reasoning-related latent feature can substantially improve accuracy without explicit CoT prompting. For large models, latent steering achieves performance comparable to standard CoT prompting while producing more efficient outputs. We further observe that this reasoning-oriented internal state is triggered early in generation and can override prompt-level instructions that discourage explicit reasoning. Overall, our results suggest that multi-step reasoning in LLMs is supported by latent internal activations that can be externally activated, while CoT prompting is one effective, but not unique, way of activating this mechanism rather than its necessary cause.</p></details> |  |

Due to its complexity, behavior is best mapped onto a rich, semantic structure such as language. Emerging multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are promising candidates, but their fine-grained action understanding ability has not been fully examined. In this work, we reformulate EPIC-KITCHENS-100, one of the largest and most challenging egocentric action recognition datasets, into a MLLM benchmark (EPIC-KITCHENS-100-MQA). We demonstrate that when we sample difficult answers based on specialist models as distractors, leading MLLMs struggle to recognize the correct actions. How can we increase the performance of MLLMs? We curated a supervised finetuning dataset that includes `hard' action recognition, temporal detection, captioning, and free-form question answering to improve models' diverse action understanding capabilities. We introduce a new model called LLaVAction that adds an action token to boost models' attention on visual tokens and a two-stage pipeline to obtain structured actions. LLaVAction greatly improves the MLLMs' ability of action understanding, achieving strong improvements on both MLLM benchmarks (21 points in accuracy over GPT-4o on EPIC-KITCHENS-100-MQA) and established action recognition benchmarks, suggesting that our methods prepare MLLMs to be a promising path forward for complex action tasks.

Multimodal haptic sensing provides a promising avenue for inferring such properties, yet progress has been constrained by the lack of large, diverse, and realistic haptic datasets. In this work, we introduce the CLAMP device, a low-cost (<\$200) sensorized reacher-grabber designed to collect large-scale, in-the-wild multimodal haptic data from non-expert users in everyday settings. We deployed 16 CLAMP devices to 41 participants, resulting in the CLAMP dataset, the largest open-source multimodal haptic dataset to date, comprising 12.3 million datapoints across 5357 household objects. Using this dataset, we train a haptic encoder that can infer material and compliance object properties from multimodal haptic data. We leverage this encoder to create the CLAMP model, a visuo-haptic perception model for material recognition that generalizes to novel objects and three robot embodiments with minimal finetuning. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in three real-world robot manipulation tasks: sorting recyclable and non-recyclable waste, retrieving objects from a cluttered bag, and distinguishing overripe from ripe bananas. Our results show that large-scale, in-the-wild haptic data collection can unlock new capabilities for generalizable robot manipulation.

| **[Vocabulary Expansion of Large Language Models via Kullback-Leibler-Based Self-Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15807v2)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large pre-trained language models often struggle to incorporate new domain-specific terminology when fine-tuned on small, specialized corpora. In this work, we address the challenge of vocabulary expansion in frozen LLMs by introducing a mathematically grounded method for knowledge distillation via KL divergence, even when the original and extended models use different tokenizations. This allows the student model to inherit distributional knowledge from the teacher despite differing vocabularies. We compare our KL-based distillation approach to conventional cross-entropy training, evaluating both methods across multiple strategies for initializing new token embeddings. After embedding initialization, models are further fine-tuned to integrate the new vocabulary. Each trained model is benchmarked on approximately 2000 code-generation tasks, where our approach achieves the best performance across the board. Finally, through mechanistic interpretability, we analyze how models learn representations for the new tokens, providing an explanation for the observed gains and offering insight into the structure of embedding space during vocabulary expansion.</p></details> | Master's Thesis |

However, aligning LLMs with the nuanced demands of medical ethics, especially under complex real world scenarios, remains underexplored. In this work, we present MedES, a dynamic, scenario-centric benchmark specifically constructed from 260 authoritative Chinese medical, ethical, and legal sources to reflect the challenges in clinical decision-making. To facilitate model alignment, we introduce a guardian-in-the-loop framework that leverages a dedicated automated evaluator (trained on expert-labeled data and achieving over 97% accuracy within our domain) to generate targeted prompts and provide structured ethical feedback. Using this pipeline, we align a 7B-parameter LLM through supervised fine-tuning and domain-specific preference optimization. Experimental results, conducted entirely within the Chinese medical ethics context, demonstrate that our aligned model outperforms notably larger baselines on core ethical tasks, with observed improvements in both quality and composite evaluation metrics. Our work offers a practical and adaptable framework for aligning LLMs with medical ethics in the Chinese healthcare domain, and suggests that similar alignment pipelines may be instantiated in other legal and cultural environments through modular replacement of the underlying normative corpus.</p></details> |  |

A single session using a 70-billion-parameter model can cost around $127 in cloud computing fees, which puts these tools out of reach for organizations operating on limited budgets. We present AgentCompress, a framework that tackles this problem through task-aware dynamic compression. The idea comes from a simple observation: not all tasks require the same computational effort. Complex reasoning, for example, is far more demanding than text reformatting, yet conventional compression applies the same reduction to both. Our approach uses a lightweight neural controller that looks at the first few tokens of each request, estimates how complex the task will be, and sends it to an appropriately quantized version of the model. This routing step adds only about 12 milliseconds of overhead. We tested the framework on 290 multi-stage workflows from domains including computer science, physics, chemistry, and biology. The results show a 68.3% reduction in computational costs while preserving 96.2% of the original success rate. These findings suggest that routing queries intelligently can make powerful language models substantially more affordable without sacrificing output quality</p></details> |  |

We find that zero-shot TFMs already achieve strong performance, while the benefits of fine-tuning are highly model and data-dependent. Meta-learning and PEFT provide moderate gains under specific conditions, whereas full supervised fine-tuning (SFT) often reduces accuracy or calibration quality. This work presents the first comprehensive study of fine-tuning in TFMs across benchmarks including TALENT, OpenML-CC18, and TabZilla. We compare Zero-Shot, Meta-Learning, Supervised (SFT), and parameter-efficient (PEFT) approaches, analyzing how dataset factors such as imbalance, size, and dimensionality affect outcomes. Our findings cover performance, calibration, and fairness, offering practical guidelines on when fine-tuning is most beneficial and its limitations.</p></details> |  |

Foundation Models (FMs), trained on vast datasets through self-supervised learning, enable efficient adaptation across medical imaging tasks while reducing dependency on labeled data. These models demonstrate potential for enhancing fairness, though significant challenges remain in achieving consistent performance across demographic groups. Our review indicates that effective bias mitigation in FMs requires systematic interventions throughout all stages of development. While previous approaches focused primarily on model-level bias mitigation, our analysis reveals that fairness in FMs requires integrated interventions throughout the development pipeline, from data documentation to deployment protocols. This comprehensive framework advances current knowledge by demonstrating how systematic bias mitigation, combined with policy engagement, can effectively address both technical and institutional barriers to equitable AI in healthcare. The development of equitable FMs represents a critical step toward democratizing advanced healthcare technologies, particularly for underserved populations and regions with limited medical infrastructure and computational resources.</p></details> |  |

Analyzing network traffic is vital for security and management, yet remains challenging due to the heterogeneity of plain-text packet headers and encrypted payloads. To capture the latent semantics of traffic, recent studies have adopted Transformer-based pretraining techniques to learn network representations from massive traffic data. However, these methods pre-train on data-driven tasks but overlook network knowledge, such as masking partial digits of the indivisible network port numbers for prediction, thereby limiting semantic understanding. In addition, they struggle to extend classification to new classes during fine-tuning due to the distribution shift. Motivated by these limitations, we propose \Lens, a unified knowledge-guided foundation model for both network traffic classification and generation. In pretraining, we propose a Knowledge-Guided Mask Span Prediction method with textual context for learning knowledge-enriched representations. For extending to new classes in finetuning, we reframe the traffic classification as a closed-ended generation task and introduce context-aware finetuning to adapt to the distribution shift. Evaluation results across various benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed Lens~achieves superior performance on both classification and generation tasks. For traffic classification, Lens~outperforms competitive baselines substantially on 8 out of 12 tasks with an average accuracy of \textbf{96.33\%} and extends to novel classes with significantly better performance. For traffic generation, Lens~generates better high-fidelity network traffic for network simulation, gaining up to \textbf{30.46\%} and \textbf{33.3\%} better accuracy and F1 in fuzzing tests. We will open-source the code upon publication.</p></details> |  |

This work proposes a modality-invariant representation learning setup and evaluates its effectiveness in stroke and epilepsy lesion segmentation, following large-scale pre-training. Experimental results suggest that despite successful cross-modality alignment, lesion segmentation primarily benefits from preserving fine-grained modality-specific features.

The successes of the Ingenuity helicopter and multiple planetary orbiters lay the groundwork for future missions that use ground-aerial robotic teams. In this paper, we consider rovers using machine learning to localise themselves in a local aerial map using limited field-of-view monocular ground-view RGB images as input. A key consideration for machine learning methods is that real space data with ground-truth position labels suitable for training is scarce. In this work, we propose a novel method of localising rovers in an aerial map using cross-view-localising dual-encoder deep neural networks. We leverage semantic segmentation with vision foundation models and high volume synthetic data to bridge the domain gap to real images. We also contribute a new cross-view dataset of real-world rover trajectories with corresponding ground-truth localisation data captured in a planetary analogue facility, plus a high volume dataset of analogous synthetic image pairs. Using particle filters for state estimation with the cross-view networks allows accurate position estimation over simple and complex trajectories based on sequences of ground-view images.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 10 figures.

Yet conventional Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions in aviation remain siloed and narrow, focusing on isolated tasks or single modalities. They struggle to integrate heterogeneous data such as voice communications, radar tracks, sensor streams and textual reports, which limits situational awareness, adaptability, and real-time decision support. This paper introduces the vision of AviationLMM, a Large Multimodal foundation Model for civil aviation, designed to unify the heterogeneous data streams of civil aviation and enable understanding, reasoning, generation and agentic applications. We firstly identify the gaps between existing AI solutions and requirements. Secondly, we describe the model architecture that ingests multimodal inputs such as air-ground voice, surveillance, on-board telemetry, video and structured texts, and performs cross-modal alignment and fusion, and produces flexible outputs ranging from situation summaries and risk alerts to predictive diagnostics and multimodal incident reconstructions. In order to fully realize this vision, we identify key research opportunities to address, including data acquisition, alignment and fusion, pretraining, reasoning, trustworthiness, privacy, robustness to missing modalities, and synthetic scenario generation. By articulating the design and challenges of AviationLMM, we aim to boost the civil aviation foundation model progress and catalyze coordinated research efforts toward an integrated, trustworthy and privacy-preserving aviation AI ecosystem.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 2025 7th International Conference on Interdisciplinary Computer Science and Engineering (ICICSE 2025) conference, Chongqing, China; 9 pages,1 figure,5 tables</p></details> |
| **[Scaling Remote Sensing Foundation Models: Data Domain Tradeoffs at the Peta-Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23903v2)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We explore the scaling behaviors of artificial intelligence to establish practical techniques for training foundation models on high-resolution electro-optical (EO) datasets that exceed the current state-of-the-art scale by orders of magnitude. Modern multimodal machine learning (ML) applications, such as generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) systems for image captioning, search, and reasoning, depend on robust, domain-specialized encoders for non-text modalities. In natural image domains where internet-scale data is plentiful, well-established scaling laws help optimize the joint scaling of model capacity, training compute, and dataset size. Unfortunately, these relationships are much less well understood in high-value domains like remote sensing (RS). Using over a quadrillion pixels of commercial satellite EO data and MITRE's Federal AI Sandbox, we train progressively larger vision transformer (ViT) backbones, report successes and failure modes observed at peta-scale, and analyze implications for bridging domain gaps across additional RS modalities. We observe that even at this scale, performance is consistent with a data-limited regime rather than a model parameter-limited one. These practical insights are intended to inform data collection strategies, compute budgets, and optimization schedules that advance the future development of frontier scale RS foundation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Incentivizing Multi-Tenant Split Federated Learning for Foundation Models at the Network Edge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04971v2)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models (FMs) such as GPT-4 exhibit exceptional generative capabilities across diverse downstream tasks through fine-tuning. Split Federated Learning (SFL) facilitates privacy-preserving FM fine-tuning on resource-constrained local devices by offloading partial FM computations to edge servers, enabling device-edge synergistic fine-tuning. Practical edge networks often host multiple SFL tenants to support diversified downstream tasks. However, existing research primarily focuses on single-tenant SFL scenarios, and lacks tailored incentive mechanisms for multi-tenant settings, which are essential to effectively coordinate self-interested local devices for participation in various downstream tasks, ensuring that each SFL tenant's distinct FM fine-tuning requirements (e.g., FM types, performance targets, and fine-tuning deadlines) are met. To address this gap, we propose a novel Price-Incentive Mechanism (PRINCE) that guides multiple SFL tenants to offer strategic price incentives, which solicit high-quality device participation for efficient FM fine-tuning. Specifically, we first develop a bias-resilient global SFL model aggregation scheme to eliminate model biases caused by independent device participation. We then derive a rigorous SFL convergence bound to evaluate the contributions of heterogeneous devices to FM performance improvements, guiding the incentive strategies of SFL tenants. Furthermore, we model inter-tenant device competition as a congestion game for Stackelberg equilibrium (SE) analysis, deriving each SFL tenant's optimal incentive strategy. Extensive simulations involving four representative SFL tenant types (ViT, BERT, Whisper, and LLaMA) across diverse data modalities (text, images, and audio) demonstrate that PRINCE accelerates FM fine-tuning by up to 3.07x compared to state-of-the-art approaches, while consistently meeting fine-tuning performance targets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking.

Learning robust and transferable representations directly from such raw signals, however, remains challenging due to heterogeneous communication systems, diverse propagation environments, and limited labeled data. To address this, we present LWM-Spectro, a transformer-based foundation model pretrained on large-scale I/Q data represented as time-frequency spectrograms. The model leverages self-supervised masked modeling, contrastive learning, and a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture to learn general-purpose wireless representations. These representations transfer effectively to downstream tasks such as modulation classification and joint SNR/mobility recognition, even with minimal supervision. Across tasks, LWM-Spectro consistently outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning baselines in both few-shot and data-rich regimes, providing a unified foundation for wireless learning.</p></details> | 6 pages, 5 figures |

| **[MUSE-FM: Multi-task Environment-aware Foundation Model for Wireless Communications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01967v2)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in foundation models (FMs) have attracted increasing attention in the wireless communication domain. Leveraging the powerful multi-task learning capability, FMs hold the promise of unifying multiple tasks of wireless communication with a single framework. Nevertheless, existing wireless FMs face limitations in the uniformity to address multiple tasks with diverse inputs/outputs across different communication scenarios. In this paper, we propose a MUlti-taSk Environment-aware FM (MUSE-FM) with a unified architecture to handle multiple tasks in wireless communications, while effectively incorporating scenario information. Specifically, to achieve task uniformity, we propose a unified prompt-guided data encoder-decoder pair to handle data with heterogeneous formats and distributions across different tasks. Besides, we integrate the environmental context as a multi-modal input, which serves as prior knowledge of environment and channel distributions and facilitates cross-scenario feature extraction. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed MUSE-FM outperforms existing methods for various tasks, and its prompt-guided encoder-decoder pair facilitates few-shot adaptation to new task configurations. Moreover, the incorporation of environment information improves the ability to adapt to different scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, subjective visual assessment and inter-institutional variability limit diagnostic consistency. This study developed and externally evaluated a multi-centre, foundation model-driven framework that automatically classifies EVI and MFI on axial and sagittal MRI. Methods A total of 331 pre-treatment rectal cancer T2-weighted MRI scans from three European hospitals were retrospectively recruited. A self-supervised frequency domain harmonization strategy was applied to reduce scanner variability. Three classifiers, SeResNet, the universal biomedical pretrained model (UMedPT) with a multilayer perceptron head, and a logistic-regression variant using frozen UMedPT features (UMedPT_LR), were trained (n=265) and tested (n=66). Gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) visualized model predictions. Results UMedPT_LR achieved the best EVI performance with multiplanar fusion (AUC=0.82, test set). For MFI, UMedPT trained on axial harmonized images yielded the highest performance (AUC = 0.77). Both tasks outperformed the CHAIMELEON 2024 benchmark (EVI: 0.82 vs 0.74; MFI: 0.77 vs 0.75). Harmonization enhanced MFI classification, and multiplanar fusion further boosted EVI performance. Grad-CAM confirmed biologically plausible attention on peritumoral regions (EVI) and mesorectal fascia margins (MFI). Conclusion The proposed foundation model-driven framework, leveraging frequency domain harmonization and multiplanar fusion, achieves state-of-the-art performance for automated EVI and MFI classification on MRI, demonstrating strong generalizability across multiple centers.</p></details> | 27 pages, 9 figures |

We developed a foundation model-based AI pipeline for patient-level classification and lesion-level detection of CRLM on contrast-enhanced CT, integrating uncertainty quantification and explainability. CT data from the EuCanImage consortium (n=2437) and an external TCIA cohort (n=197) were used. Among several pretrained models, UMedPT achieved the best performance and was fine-tuned with an MLP head for classification and an FCOS-based head for lesion detection. The classification model achieved an AUC of 0.90 and a sensitivity of 0.82 on the combined test set, with a sensitivity of 0.85 on the external cohort. Excluding the most uncertain 20 percent of cases improved AUC to 0.91 and balanced accuracy to 0.86. Decision curve analysis showed clinical benefit for threshold probabilities between 0.30 and 0.40. The detection model identified 69.1 percent of lesions overall, increasing from 30 percent to 98 percent across lesion size quartiles. Grad-CAM highlighted lesion-corresponding regions in high-confidence cases. These results demonstrate that foundation model-based pipelines can support robust and interpretable CRLM detection and classification across heterogeneous CT data.</p></details> |  |

The advancement of video-text research has spurred growing interest in extending image-based models to the video domain. This paradigm, termed as image-to-video transfer learning, effectively mitigates the substantial data and computational demands compared to training video-language models from scratch while achieves comparable or even stronger model performance. This survey provides the first comprehensive review of this emerging field, which begins by summarizing the widely used ILFMs and their capabilities. We then systematically classify existing image-to-video transfer learning techniques into two broad root categories (frozen features and adapted features), along with numerous fine-grained subcategories, based on the paradigm for transferring image understanding capability to video tasks. Building upon the task-specific nature of image-to-video transfer, this survey methodically elaborates these strategies and details their applications across a spectrum of video-text learning tasks, ranging from fine-grained settings (e.g., spatio-temporal video grounding) to coarse-grained ones (e.g., video question answering). We further present a detailed experimental analysis to investigate the efficacy of different image-to-video transfer learning paradigms on a range of downstream video understanding tasks. Finally, we identify prevailing challenges and highlight promising directions for future research. By offering a comprehensive and structured overview, this survey aims to establish a structured roadmap for advancing video-text learning based on existing ILFM, and to inspire future research directions in this rapidly evolving domain.

Existing paradigms rely on restrictive assumptions or effortful human priors, limiting practicality, efficiency, and adaptability. Recent foundation models (FMs) offer great potential to bridge this gap. This paper investigates a critical research problem: What system architecture can effectively integrate FM knowledge for this task? We answer it with FlyCo, a principled FM-empowered perception-prediction-planning loop enabling fully autonomous, prompt-driven 3D target scanning in diverse unknown open-world environments. FlyCo directly translates low-effort human prompts (text, visual annotations) into precise adaptive scanning flights via three coordinated stages: (1) perception fuses streaming sensor data with vision-language FMs for robust target grounding and tracking; (2) prediction distills FM knowledge and combines multi-modal cues to infer the partially observed target's complete geometry; (3) planning leverages predictive foresight to generate efficient and safe paths with comprehensive target coverage. Building on this, we further design key components to boost open-world target grounding efficiency and robustness, enhance prediction quality in terms of shape accuracy, zero-shot generalization, and temporal stability, and balance long-horizon flight efficiency with real-time computability and online collision avoidance. Extensive challenging real-world and simulation experiments show FlyCo delivers precise scene understanding, high efficiency, and real-time safety, outperforming existing paradigms with lower human effort and verifying the proposed architecture's practicality. Comprehensive ablations validate each component's contribution. FlyCo also serves as a flexible, extensible blueprint, readily leveraging future FM and robotics advances. Code will be released.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 24 figures, 9 tables.

| **[CompNO: A Novel Foundation Model approach for solving Partial Differential Equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07384v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Partial differential equations (PDEs) govern a wide range of physical phenomena, but their numerical solution remains computationally demanding, especially when repeated simulations are required across many parameter settings. Recent Scientific Foundation Models (SFMs) aim to alleviate this cost by learning universal surrogates from large collections of simulated systems, yet they typically rely on monolithic architectures with limited interpretability and high pretraining expense. In this work we introduce Compositional Neural Operators (CompNO), a compositional neural operator framework for parametric PDEs. Instead of pretraining a single large model on heterogeneous data, CompNO first learns a library of Foundation Blocks, where each block is a parametric Fourier neural operator specialized to a fundamental differential operator (e.g. convection, diffusion, nonlinear convection). These blocks are then assembled, via lightweight Adaptation Blocks, into task-specific solvers that approximate the temporal evolution operator for target PDEs. A dedicated boundary-condition operator further enforces Dirichlet constraints exactly at inference time. We validate CompNO on one-dimensional convection, diffusion, convection--diffusion and Burgers' equations from the PDEBench suite. The proposed framework achieves lower relative L2 error than strong baselines (PFNO, PDEFormer and in-context learning based models) on linear parametric systems, while remaining competitive on nonlinear Burgers' flows. The model maintains exact boundary satisfaction with zero loss at domain boundaries, and exhibits robust generalization across a broad range of Peclet and Reynolds numbers. These results demonstrate that compositional neural operators provide a scalable and physically interpretable pathway towards foundation models for PDEs.</p></details> | Under review at MDPI |
| **[The Semantic Lifecycle in Embodied AI: Acquisition, Representation and Storage via Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08876v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic information in embodied AI is inherently multi-source and multi-stage, making it challenging to fully leverage for achieving stable perception-to-action loops in real-world environments. Early studies have combined manual engineering with deep neural networks, achieving notable progress in specific semantic-related embodied tasks. However, as embodied agents encounter increasingly complex environments and open-ended tasks, the demand for more generalizable and robust semantic processing capabilities has become imperative. Recent advances in foundation models (FMs) address this challenge through their cross-domain generalization abilities and rich semantic priors, reshaping the landscape of embodied AI research. In this survey, we propose the Semantic Lifecycle as a unified framework to characterize the evolution of semantic knowledge within embodied AI driven by foundation models. Departing from traditional paradigms that treat semantic processing as isolated modules or disjoint tasks, our framework offers a holistic perspective that captures the continuous flow and maintenance of semantic knowledge. Guided by this embodied semantic lifecycle, we further analyze and compare recent advances across three key stages: acquisition, representation, and storage. Finally, we summarize existing challenges and outline promising directions for future research.</p></details> |  |

We introduce HydroGEM (Hydrological Generalizable Encoder for Monitoring), a foundation model for continental-scale streamflow quality control. HydroGEM uses two-stage training: self-supervised pretraining on 6.03 million sequences from 3,724 USGS stations learns hydrological representations, followed by fine-tuning with synthetic anomalies for detection and reconstruction. A hybrid TCN-Transformer architecture (14.2M parameters) captures local temporal patterns and long-range dependencies, while hierarchical normalization handles six orders of magnitude in discharge. On held-out synthetic tests comprising 799 stations with 18 expert-validated anomaly types, HydroGEM achieves F1 = 0.792 for detection and 68.7% reconstruction-error reduction, a 36.3% improvement over existing methods. Zero-shot transfer to 100 Environment and Climate Change Canada stations yields F1 = 0.586, exceeding all baselines and demonstrating cross-national generalization. The model maintains consistent detection across correction magnitudes and aligns with operational seasonal patterns. HydroGEM is designed for human-in-the-loop workflows - outputs are quality control suggestions requiring expert review, not autonomous corrections.</p></details> | <details><summary>Suppl...</summary><p>Supplementary materials, datasets, and implementation code will be made publicly available upon acceptance for publication in a peer-reviewed journal</p></details> |
| **[The Blueprints of Intelligence: A Functional-Topological Foundation for Perception and Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05089v3)** | 2026-01-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world phenomena do not generate arbitrary variability: their signals concentrate on compact, low-variability subsets of functional space, enabling rapid generalization from few examples. A small child can recognize a dog after extremely limited exposure because the perceptual manifold of "dog" is compact, structured, and low-dimensional. We formalize this principle through a deterministic functional-topological framework in which the set of valid realizations produced by a physical process forms a compact subset of a Banach space, endowed with stable invariants, a finite Hausdorff radius, and an induced continuous perceptual functional. This geometry provides explicit limits on knowledge, conditions for identifiability, and guarantees for generalization from sparse evidence -- properties fundamental to both natural and artificial intelligence. Across electromechanical, electrochemical, and physiological domains, we show that real-world processes consistently generate compact perceptual manifolds with the same geometric characteristics. Their boundaries can be discovered in a fully self-supervised manner as the empirical radius saturates with increasing sampling, even when the governing equations are unknown. These results demonstrate that deterministic functional topology offers a unified mathematical foundation for perception, representation, and world-model construction. It provides a geometric explanation for why biological learners and self-supervised AI systems can generalize from few observations, and establishes compact perceptual manifolds as a fundamental building block for future AI architectures. Finally, this work unifies biological perception and modern self-supervised models under a single geometric principle: both derive their generalization ability from the compactness and invariants of real-world perceptual manifolds.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 6 figures.

This work presents a unified framework leveraging vision foundation models to automate the quantification and classification of CNTs in electron microscopy images. First, we introduce an interactive quantification tool built on the Segment Anything Model (SAM) that segments particles with near-perfect accuracy using minimal user input. Second, we propose a novel classification pipeline that utilizes these segmentation masks to spatially constrain a DINOv2 vision transformer, extracting features exclusively from particle regions while suppressing background noise. Evaluated on a dataset of 1,800 TEM images, this architecture achieves 95.5% accuracy in distinguishing between four different CNT morphologies, significantly outperforming the current baseline despite using a fraction of the training data. Crucially, this instance-level processing allows the framework to resolve mixed samples, correctly classifying distinct particle types co-existing within a single field of view. These results demonstrate that integrating zero-shot segmentation with self-supervised feature learning enables high-throughput, reproducible nanomaterial analysis, transforming a labor-intensive bottleneck into a scalable, data-driven process.</p></details> |  |

From Geometric to Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03422v2)** | 2026-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of existing scene representation methods for robotics, covering traditional representations such as point clouds, voxels, signed distance functions (SDF), and scene graphs, as well as more recent neural representations like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), and the emerging Foundation Models. While current SLAM and localization systems predominantly rely on sparse representations like point clouds and voxels, dense scene representations are expected to play a critical role in downstream tasks such as navigation and obstacle avoidance. Moreover, neural representations such as NeRF, 3DGS, and foundation models are well-suited for integrating high-level semantic features and language-based priors, enabling more comprehensive 3D scene understanding and embodied intelligence. In this paper, we categorized the core modules of robotics into five parts (Perception, Mapping, Localization, Navigation, Manipulation). We start by presenting the standard formulation of different scene representation methods and comparing the advantages and disadvantages of scene representation across different modules. This survey is centered around the question: What is the best 3D scene representation for robotics? We then discuss the future development trends of 3D scene representations, with a particular focus on how the 3D Foundation Model could replace current methods as the unified solution for future robotic applications. The remaining challenges in fully realizing this model are also explored. We aim to offer a valuable resource for both newcomers and experienced researchers to explore the future of 3D scene representations and their application in robotics. We have published an open-source project on GitHub and will continue to add new works and technologies to this project.</p></details> |  |

Their detection remains a significant challenge due to subtle morphological cues, class imbalance, and inter-observer variability among pathologists. The MIDOG 2025 challenge introduced a dedicated track for atypical mitosis classification, enabling systematic evaluation of deep learning methods. In this study, we investigated the use of large vision foundation models, including Virchow, Virchow2, and UNI, with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for parameter-efficient fine-tuning. We conducted extensive experiments with different LoRA ranks, as well as random and group-based data splits, to analyze robustness under varied conditions. Our best approach, Virchow with LoRA rank 8 and ensemble of three-fold cross-validation, achieved a balanced accuracy of 88.37% on the preliminary test set, ranking joint 9th in the challenge leaderboard. These results highlight the promise of foundation models with efficient adaptation strategies for the classification of atypical mitosis, while underscoring the need for improvements in specificity and domain generalization.</p></details> | MIDOG'25 |

However, existing time series foundation models primarily focus on forecasting tasks and often overlook classification-specific challenges, such as modeling interpretable shapelets that capture class-discriminative temporal features. To bridge this gap, we propose UniShape, a unified shape-aware foundation model designed for time series classification. UniShape incorporates a shape-aware adapter that adaptively aggregates multiscale discriminative subsequences (shapes) into class tokens, effectively selecting the most relevant subsequence scales to enhance model interpretability. Meanwhile, a prototype-based pretraining module is introduced to jointly learn instance- and shape-level representations, enabling the capture of transferable shape patterns. Pre-trained on a large-scale multi-domain time series dataset comprising 1.89 million samples, UniShape exhibits superior generalization across diverse target domains. Experiments on 128 UCR datasets and 30 additional time series datasets demonstrate that UniShape achieves state-of-the-art classification performance, with interpretability and ablation analyses further validating its effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[The Promise of Time-Series Foundation Models for Agricultural Forecasting: Evidence from Marketing Year Average Prices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06371v1)** | 2026-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting agricultural markets remains a core challenge in business analytics, where nonlinear dynamics, structural breaks, and sparse data have historically limited the gains from increasingly complex econometric and machine learning models. As a result, a long-standing belief in the literature is that simple time-series methods often outperform more advanced alternatives. This paper provides the first systematic evidence that this belief no longer holds in the modern era of time-series foundation models (TSFMs). Using USDA ERS data from 1997-2025, we evaluate 17 forecasting approaches across four model classes, assessing monthly forecasting performance and benchmarking against Market Year Average (MYA) price predictions. This period spans multiple agricultural cycles, major policy changes, and major market disruptions, with substantial cross-commodity price volatility. Focusing on five state-of-the-art TSFMs, we show that zero-shot foundation models (with only historical prices and without any additional covariates) consistently outperform traditional time-series methods, machine learning models, and deep learning architectures trained from scratch. Among them, Time-MoE delivers the largest accuracy gains, improving forecasts by 45% (MAE) overall and by more than 50% for corn and soybeans relative to USDA benchmarks. These results point to a paradigm shift in agricultural forecasting: while earlier generations of advanced models struggled to surpass simple benchmarks, modern pre-trained foundation models achieve substantial and robust improvements, offering a scalable and powerful new framework for highstakes predictive analytics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Foundational Analysis of Safety Engineering Requirements (SAFER)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06335v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a framework for Foundational Analysis of Safety Engineering Requirements (SAFER), a model-driven methodology supported by Generative AI to improve the generation and analysis of safety requirements for complex safety-critical systems. Safety requirements are often specified by multiple stakeholders with uncoordinated objectives, leading to gaps, duplications, and contradictions that jeopardize system safety and compliance. Existing approaches are largely informal and insufficient for addressing these challenges. SAFER enhances Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) by consuming requirement specification models and generating the following results: (1) mapping requirements to system functions, (2) identifying functions with insufficient requirement specifications, (3) detecting duplicate requirements, and (4) identifying contradictions within requirement sets. SAFER provides structured analysis, reporting, and decision support for safety engineers. We demonstrate SAFER on an autonomous drone system, significantly improving the detection of requirement inconsistencies, enhancing both efficiency and reliability of the safety engineering process. We show that Generative AI must be augmented by formal models and queried systematically, to provide meaningful early-stage safety requirement specifications and robust safety architectures.</p></details> |  |

Existing works using this technique have shown great success using temporal graph neural networks and skip-gram-based approaches on random walks. However, random walk-based approaches are unable to incorporate rich edge data, while the GNN-based approaches require large amounts of memory to train. In this work, we propose extending the original insight from random walk-based skip-grams--that random walks through a graph are analogous to sentences in a corpus--to the more modern transformer-based foundation models. Using language models that take advantage of GPU optimizations, we can quickly train a graph foundation model to predict missing tokens in random walks through a network of computers. The graph foundation model is then finetuned for link prediction and used as a network anomaly detector. This new approach allows us to combine the efficiency of random walk-based methods and the rich semantic representation of deep learning methods. This system, which we call CyberGFM, achieved state-of-the-art results on three widely used network anomaly detection datasets, delivering a up to 2$\times$ improvement in average precision. We found that CyberGFM outperforms all prior works in unsupervised link prediction for network anomaly detection, using the same number of parameters, and with equal or better efficiency than the previous best approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages; 11 figures; 8 tables</p></details> |

| **[Open World Knowledge Aided Single-Cell Foundation Model with Robust Cross-Modal Cell-Language Pre-training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05648v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in single-cell multi-omics, particularly RNA-seq, have provided profound insights into cellular heterogeneity and gene regulation. While pre-trained language model (PLM) paradigm based single-cell foundation models have shown promise, they remain constrained by insufficient integration of in-depth individual profiles and neglecting the influence of noise within multi-modal data. To address both issues, we propose an Open-world Language Knowledge-Aided Robust Single-Cell Foundation Model (OKR-CELL). It is built based on a cross-modal Cell-Language pre-training framework, which comprises two key innovations: (1) leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) based workflow with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enriches cell textual descriptions using open-world knowledge; (2) devising a Cross-modal Robust Alignment (CRA) objective that incorporates sample reliability assessment, curriculum learning, and coupled momentum contrastive learning to strengthen the model's resistance to noisy data. After pretraining on 32M cell-text pairs, OKR-CELL obtains cutting-edge results across 6 evaluation tasks. Beyond standard benchmarks such as cell clustering, cell-type annotation, batch-effect correction, and few-shot annotation, the model also demonstrates superior performance in broader multi-modal applications, including zero-shot cell-type annotation and bidirectional cell-text retrieval.</p></details> | 41 pages |
| **[One Language-Free Foundation Model Is Enough for Universal Vision Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05552v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Universal visual anomaly detection (AD) aims to identify anomaly images and segment anomaly regions towards open and dynamic scenarios, following zero- and few-shot paradigms without any dataset-specific fine-tuning. We have witnessed significant progress in widely use of visual-language foundational models in recent approaches. However, current methods often struggle with complex prompt engineering, elaborate adaptation modules, and challenging training strategies, ultimately limiting their flexibility and generality. To address these issues, this paper rethinks the fundamental mechanism behind visual-language models for AD and presents an embarrassingly simple, general, and effective framework for Universal vision Anomaly Detection (UniADet). Specifically, we first find language encoder is used to derive decision weights for anomaly classification and segmentation, and then demonstrate that it is unnecessary for universal AD. Second, we propose an embarrassingly simple method to completely decouple classification and segmentation, and decouple cross-level features, i.e., learning independent weights for different tasks and hierarchical features. UniADet is highly simple (learning only decoupled weights), parameter-efficient (only 0.002M learnable parameters), general (adapting a variety of foundation models), and effective (surpassing state-of-the-art zero-/few-shot by a large margin and even full-shot AD methods for the first time) on 14 real-world AD benchmarks covering both industrial and medical domains. We will make the code and model of UniADet available at https://github.com/gaobb/UniADet.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 5 figures, 34 tabels</p></details> |
| **[Tracing Moral Foundations in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05437v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) often produce human-like moral judgments, but it is unclear whether this reflects an internal conceptual structure or superficial ``moral mimicry.'' Using Moral Foundations Theory (MFT) as an analytic framework, we study how moral foundations are encoded, organized, and expressed within two instruction-tuned LLMs: Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct. We employ a multi-level approach combining (i) layer-wise analysis of MFT concept representations and their alignment with human moral perceptions, (ii) pretrained sparse autoencoders (SAEs) over the residual stream to identify sparse features that support moral concepts, and (iii) causal steering interventions using dense MFT vectors and sparse SAE features. We find that both models represent and distinguish moral foundations in a structured, layer-dependent way that aligns with human judgments. At a finer scale, SAE features show clear semantic links to specific foundations, suggesting partially disentangled mechanisms within shared representations. Finally, steering along either dense vectors or sparse features produces predictable shifts in foundation-relevant behavior, demonstrating a causal connection between internal representations and moral outputs. Together, our results provide mechanistic evidence that moral concepts in LLMs are distributed, layered, and partly disentangled, suggesting that pluralistic moral structure can emerge as a latent pattern from the statistical regularities of language alone.</p></details> |  |

Eye gaze offers a fast, non-intrusive, and intent-rich input modality, making it an attractive channel for conveying user goals. In this work, we present GAMMA (Gaze Assisted Manipulation for Modular Autonomy), a system that leverages ego-centric gaze tracking and a vision-language model to infer user intent and autonomously execute robotic manipulation tasks. By contextualizing gaze fixations within the scene, the system maps visual attention to high-level semantic understanding, enabling skill selection and parameterization without task-specific training. We evaluate GAMMA on a range of table-top manipulation tasks and compare it against baseline gaze-based control without reasoning. Results demonstrate that GAMMA provides robust, intuitive, and generalizable control, highlighting the potential of combining foundation models and gaze for natural and scalable robot autonomy.

In this report, we present Atlas 2, Atlas 2-B, and Atlas 2-S, three pathology vision foundation models which bridge these shortcomings by showing state-of-the-art performance in prediction performance, robustness, and resource efficiency in a comprehensive evaluation across eighty public benchmarks.

While various studies have analyzed statistical, machine learning, or deep learning approaches for household electricity STLF, recently proposed time series foundation models such as Chronos, TimesFM or Time-MoE promise a new approach for household electricity STLF. These models are trained on a vast amount of time series data and are able to forecast time series without explicit task-specific training (zero-shot learning). In this study, we benchmark the forecasting capabilities of time series foundation models compared to Trained-from-Scratch (TFS) Transformer-based approaches. Our results suggest that foundation models perform comparably to TFS Transformer models, while certain time series foundation models outperform all TFS models when the input size increases. At the same time, they require less effort, as they need no domain-specific training and only limited contextual data for inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Access</p></details> |
| **[Filter-and-Attend: Wireless Channel Foundation Model with Noise-Plus-Interference Suppression Structure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15993v2)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Wireless channel foundation model (WCFM) is a task-agnostic AI model that is pre-trained to learn a universal channel representation for a wide range of communications and sensing tasks. While existing works on WCFM have demonstrated its great potentials in various downstream tasks, the models are all trained using perfect (i.e., error-free and complete) channel information state (CSI) data. In practical systems, however, only degraded CSI obtained from pilot-based channel estimation is accessible, leading to distorted channel representations and performance degradation in downstream tasks for some real-world environments with severe noise and interference. To address this issue, this paper proposes a new paradigm for WCFM, termed as Filter-and-Attend. In this paradigm, Filter refers to explicitly suppressing noise-plus-interference (NPI) in the received signals, while Attend means performing correlation-aware CSI completion and feature extraction using attention mechanism. Specifically, an enhanced WCFM architecture is developed. In this architecture, coarse estimates of the CSIs are first obtained and exploited to construct two projection matrices that extract NPI components in the received signals, which are further processed and removed by a subtraction module. The filtered signal is subsequently passed through a CSI completion network to get a clean CSI for feature extraction. Simulation results demonstrated that compared to the state-of-the-art solutions, WCFM with NPI suppression structure achieves improved performance on various downstream tasks including time-domain channel prediction, frequency-domain channel prediction, and localization.</p></details> |  |
| **[CRUNet-MR-Univ: A Foundation Model for Diverse Cardiac MRI Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04428v1)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, deep learning has attracted increasing attention in the field of Cardiac MRI (CMR) reconstruction due to its superior performance over traditional methods, particularly in handling higher acceleration factors, highlighting its potential for real-world clinical applications. However, current deep learning methods remain limited in generalizability. CMR scans exhibit wide variability in image contrast, sampling patterns, scanner vendors, anatomical structures, and disease types. Most existing models are designed to handle only a single or narrow subset of these variations, leading to performance degradation when faced with distribution shifts. Therefore, it is beneficial to develop a unified model capable of generalizing across diverse CMR scenarios. To this end, we propose CRUNet-MR-Univ, a foundation model that leverages spatio-temporal correlations and prompt-based priors to effectively handle the full diversity of CMR scans. Our approach consistently outperforms baseline methods across a wide range of settings, highlighting its effectiveness and promise.</p></details> | STACOM 2025 |
| **[Few-Shot LoRA Adaptation of a Flow-Matching Foundation Model for Cross-Spectral Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04381v1)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models for vision are predominantly trained on RGB data, while many safety-critical applications rely on non-visible modalities such as infrared (IR) and synthetic aperture radar (SAR). We study whether a single flow-matching foundation model pre-trained primarily on RGB images can be repurposed as a cross-spectral translator using only a few co-measured examples, and whether the resulting synthetic data can enhance downstream detection. Starting from FLUX.1 Kontext, we insert low-rank adaptation (LoRA) modules and fine-tune them on just 100 paired images per domain for two settings: RGB to IR on the KAIST dataset and RGB to SAR on the M4-SAR dataset. The adapted model translates RGB images into pixel-aligned IR/SAR, enabling us to reuse existing bounding boxes and train object detection models purely in the target modality. Across a grid of LoRA hyperparameters, we find that LPIPS computed on only 50 held-out pairs is a strong proxy for downstream performance: lower LPIPS consistently predicts higher mAP for YOLOv11n on both IR and SAR, and for DETR on KAIST IR test data. Using the best LPIPS-selected LoRA adapter, synthetic IR from external RGB datasets (LLVIP, FLIR ADAS) improves KAIST IR pedestrian detection, and synthetic SAR significantly boosts infrastructure detection on M4-SAR when combined with limited real SAR. Our results suggest that few-shot LoRA adaptation of flow-matching foundation models is a promising path toward foundation-style support for non-visible modalities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scanner-Induced Domain Shifts Undermine the Robustness of Pathology Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04163v1)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pathology foundation models (PFMs) have become central to computational pathology, aiming to offer general encoders for feature extraction from whole-slide images (WSIs). Despite strong benchmark performance, PFM robustness to real-world technical domain shifts, such as variability from whole-slide scanner devices, remains poorly understood. We systematically evaluated the robustness of 14 PFMs to scanner-induced variability, including state-of-the-art models, earlier self-supervised models, and a baseline trained on natural images. Using a multiscanner dataset of 384 breast cancer WSIs scanned on five devices, we isolated scanner effects independently from biological and laboratory confounders. Robustness is assessed via complementary unsupervised embedding analyses and a set of clinicopathological supervised prediction tasks. Our results demonstrate that current PFMs are not invariant to scanner-induced domain shifts. Most models encode pronounced scanner-specific variability in their embedding spaces. While AUC often remains stable, this masks a critical failure mode: scanner variability systematically alters the embedding space and impacts calibration of downstream model predictions, resulting in scanner-dependent bias that can impact reliability in clinical use cases. We further show that robustness is not a simple function of training data scale, model size, or model recency. None of the models provided reliable robustness against scanner-induced variability. While the models trained on the most diverse data, here represented by vision-language models, appear to have an advantage with respect to robustness, they underperformed on downstream supervised tasks. We conclude that development and evaluation of PFMs requires moving beyond accuracy-centric benchmarks toward explicit evaluation and optimisation of embedding stability and calibration under realistic acquisition variability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal Data Augmentation for Robust Fine-Tuning of Tabular Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04110v1)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuning tabular foundation models (TFMs) under data scarcity is challenging, as early stopping on even scarcer validation data often fails to capture true generalization performance. We propose CausalMixFT, a method that enhances fine-tuning robustness and downstream performance by generating structurally consistent synthetic samples using Structural Causal Models (SCMs) fitted on the target dataset. This approach augments limited real data with causally informed synthetic examples, preserving feature dependencies while expanding training diversity. Evaluated across 33 classification datasets from TabArena and over 2300 fine-tuning runs, our CausalMixFT method consistently improves median normalized ROC-AUC from 0.10 (standard fine-tuning) to 0.12, outperforming purely statistical generators such as CTGAN (-0.01), TabEBM (-0.04), and TableAugment (-0.09). Moreover, it narrows the median validation-test performance correlation gap from 0.67 to 0.30, enabling more reliable validation-based early stopping, a key step toward improving fine-tuning stability under data scarcity. These results demonstrate that incorporating causal structure into data augmentation provides an effective and principled route to fine-tuning tabular foundation models in low-data regimes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for oral presentation at the EurIPS 2025 Workshop on AI for Tabular Data (Copenhagen)</p></details> |

Researchers are burdened with tracking numerous experiments, design choices, and their effects on performance, often relying on ad-hoc, manual workflows that are inherently slow and error-prone. We introduce EvalBlocks, a modular, plug-and-play framework for efficient evaluation of foundation models during development. Built on Snakemake, EvalBlocks supports seamless integration of new datasets, foundation models, aggregation methods, and evaluation strategies. All experiments and results are tracked centrally and are reproducible with a single command, while efficient caching and parallel execution enable scalable use on shared compute infrastructure. Demonstrated on five state-of-the-art foundation models and three medical imaging classification tasks, EvalBlocks streamlines model evaluation, enabling researchers to iterate faster and focus on model innovation rather than evaluation logistics. The framework is released as open source software at https://github.com/DIAGNijmegen/eval-blocks.</p></details> | Accepted at BVM 2026 |
| **[Generalized Logit Adjustment: Calibrating Fine-tuned Models by Removing Label Bias in Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08106v4)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models like CLIP allow zero-shot transfer on various tasks without additional training data. Yet, the zero-shot performance is less competitive than a fully supervised one. Thus, to enhance the performance, fine-tuning and ensembling are also commonly adopted to better fit the downstream tasks. However, we argue that such prior work has overlooked the inherent biases in foundation models. Due to the highly imbalanced Web-scale training set, these foundation models are inevitably skewed toward frequent semantics, and thus the subsequent fine-tuning or ensembling is still biased. In this study, we systematically examine the biases in foundation models and demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed Generalized Logit Adjustment (GLA) method. Note that bias estimation in foundation models is challenging, as most pre-train data cannot be explicitly accessed like in traditional long-tailed classification tasks. To this end, GLA has an optimization-based bias estimation approach for debiasing foundation models. As our work resolves a fundamental flaw in the pre-training, the proposed GLA demonstrates significant improvements across a diverse range of tasks: it achieves 1.5 pp accuracy gains on ImageNet, an large average improvement (1.4-4.6 pp) on 11 few-shot datasets, 2.4 pp gains on long-tailed classification.

| **[Adapting Vision-Language Foundation Model for Next Generation Medical Ultrasound Image Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08849v3)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable generalization capabilities, yet their application to medical ultrasound remains constrained by the significant domain shift between natural images and sonographic data. The unique physics of ultrasound, manifesting as speckle noise, shadowing, and variable artifacts, often leads to suboptimal performance when applying off-the-shelf foundation models. To address this, we propose a novel Hybrid-tuning (HT) strategy for the efficient adaptation of CLIP-based models to ultrasound analysis. Our method introduces a lightweight adapter module integrated into the frozen visual backbone, featuring frequency-domain filtering to suppress periodic artifacts and dynamic noise estimation to calibrate feature representations. Furthermore, we design specialized segmentation and classification heads that employ multi-scale feature aggregation to maximize the utility of pre-trained semantic priors. Extensive evaluations across six multi-center datasets (covering lymph nodes, breast, thyroid, and prostate) reveal that our HT-enhanced models significantly outperform existing state-of-the-art methods, including BiomedCLIP and standard LoRA fine-tuning. The results highlight the superior data efficiency and robustness of our approach, paving the way for practical, foundational intelligence in automated ultrasound diagnosis.

| **[Computational Foundations for Strategic Coopetition: Formalizing Trust and Reputation Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24909v2)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern socio-technical systems increasingly involve multi-stakeholder environments where actors simultaneously cooperate and compete. These coopetitive relationships exhibit dynamic trust evolution based on observed behavior over repeated interactions. While conceptual modeling languages like i* represent trust relationships qualitatively, they lack computational mechanisms for analyzing how trust changes with behavioral evidence. Conversely, computational trust models from multi-agent systems provide algorithmic updating but lack grounding in conceptual models that capture strategic dependencies covering mixed motives of actors. This technical report bridges this gap by developing a computational trust model that extends game-theoretic foundations for strategic coopetition with dynamic trust evolution. Building on companion work that achieved 58/60 validation (96.7%) for logarithmic specifications, we introduce trust as a two-layer system with immediate trust responding to current behavior and reputation tracking violation history. Trust evolves through asymmetric updating where cooperation builds trust gradually while violations erode it sharply, creating hysteresis effects and trust ceilings that constrain relationship recovery. We develop a structured translation framework enabling practitioners to instantiate computational trust models from i* dependency networks encompassing mixed motives of actors. Comprehensive experimental validation across 78,125 parameter configurations establishes robust emergence of negativity bias, hysteresis effects, and cumulative damage amplification. Empirical validation using the Renault-Nissan Alliance case study (1999-2025) achieves 49/60 validation points (81.7%), successfully reproducing documented trust evolution across five distinct relationship phases including crisis and recovery periods.</p></details> | <details><summary>57 pa...</summary><p>57 pages, 20 figures.

| **[Personalization of Large Foundation Models for Health Interventions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03482v1)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large foundation models (LFMs) transform healthcare AI in prevention, diagnostics, and treatment. However, whether LFMs can provide truly personalized treatment recommendations remains an open question. Recent research has revealed multiple challenges for personalization, including the fundamental generalizability paradox: models achieving high accuracy in one clinical study perform at chance level in others, demonstrating that personalization and external validity exist in tension. This exemplifies broader contradictions in AI-driven healthcare: the privacy-performance paradox, scale-specificity paradox, and the automation-empathy paradox. As another challenge, the degree of causal understanding required for personalized recommendations, as opposed to mere predictive capacities of LFMs, remains an open question. N-of-1 trials -- crossover self-experiments and the gold standard for individual causal inference in personalized medicine -- resolve these tensions by providing within-person causal evidence while preserving privacy through local experimentation. Despite their impressive capabilities, this paper argues that LFMs cannot replace N-of-1 trials. We argue that LFMs and N-of-1 trials are complementary: LFMs excel at rapid hypothesis generation from population patterns using multimodal data, while N-of-1 trials excel at causal validation for a given individual. We propose a hybrid framework that combines the strengths of both to enable personalization and navigate the identified paradoxes: LFMs generate ranked intervention candidates with uncertainty estimates, which trigger subsequent N-of-1 trials. Clarifying the boundary between prediction and causation and explicitly addressing the paradoxical tensions are essential for responsible AI integration in personalized medicine.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the AAAI 2026 Workshop on Personalization in the Era of Large Foundation Models (PerFM)</p></details> |

This paper develops an economic foundation for multi-agent learning by studying a principal-agent interaction in a Markov decision process with strategic externalities, where both the principal and the agent learn over time. We propose a two-phase incentive mechanism that first estimates implementable transfers and then uses them to steer long-run dynamics; under mild regret-based rationality and exploration conditions, the mechanism achieves sublinear social-welfare regret and thus asymptotically optimal welfare. Simulations illustrate how even coarse incentives can correct inefficient learning under stateful externalities, highlighting the necessity of incentive-aware design for safe and welfare-aligned AI in markets and insurance.</p></details> |  |

We introduce LTX-2, an open-source foundational model capable of generating high-quality, temporally synchronized audiovisual content in a unified manner. LTX-2 consists of an asymmetric dual-stream transformer with a 14B-parameter video stream and a 5B-parameter audio stream, coupled through bidirectional audio-video cross-attention layers with temporal positional embeddings and cross-modality AdaLN for shared timestep conditioning. This architecture enables efficient training and inference of a unified audiovisual model while allocating more capacity for video generation than audio generation. We employ a multilingual text encoder for broader prompt understanding and introduce a modality-aware classifier-free guidance (modality-CFG) mechanism for improved audiovisual alignment and controllability. Beyond generating speech, LTX-2 produces rich, coherent audio tracks that follow the characters, environment, style, and emotion of each scene -- complete with natural background and foley elements. In our evaluations, the model achieves state-of-the-art audiovisual quality and prompt adherence among open-source systems, while delivering results comparable to proprietary models at a fraction of their computational cost and inference time. All model weights and code are publicly released.</p></details> |  |

The integration of FMs into wireless networks is expected to enable the development of general-purpose AI agents capable of handling diverse network management requests and highly complex wireless-related tasks involving multi-modal data. Inspired by these ideas, this work discusses the utilization of FMs, especially multi-modal FMs in wireless networks.

In particular, we first discuss FMs-enabled multi-modal contextual information understanding in wireless networks.

While prior studies have examined links between low-level audio features and affective perception, the systematic impact of audio FX on emotion remains underexplored. This work investigates how foundation models - large-scale neural architectures pretrained on multimodal data - can be leveraged to analyze these effects. Such models encode rich associations between musical structure, timbre, and affective meaning, offering a powerful framework for probing the emotional consequences of sound design techniques. By applying various probing methods to embeddings from deep learning models, we examine the complex, nonlinear relationships between audio FX and estimated emotion, uncovering patterns tied to specific effects and evaluating the robustness of foundation audio models. Our findings aim to advance understanding of the perceptual impact of audio production practices, with implications for music cognition, performance, and affective computing.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/stelioskt/audioFX</p></details> |

However, different regional varieties often employ different scripts to write the same language, rendering speech recognition output also subject to non-determinism in the output script. To mitigate this problem, we show that script is linearly encoded in the activation space of multilingual speech models, and that modifying activations at inference time enables direct control over output script. We find the addition of such script vectors to activations at test time can induce script change even in unconventional language-script pairings (e.g. Italian in Cyrillic and Japanese in Latin script). We apply this approach to inducing post-hoc control over the script of speech recognition output, where we observe competitive performance across all model sizes of Whisper.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agentic Physical AI toward a Domain-Specific Foundation Model for Nuclear Reactor Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23292v2)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The prevailing paradigm in AI for physical systems, scaling general-purpose foundation models toward universal multimodal reasoning, confronts a fundamental barrier at the control interface. Recent benchmarks show that even frontier vision-language models achieve only 50-53% accuracy on basic quantitative physics tasks, behaving as approximate guessers that preserve semantic plausibility while violating physical constraints. This input unfaithfulness is not a scaling deficiency but a structural limitation. Perception-centric architectures optimize parameter-space imitation, whereas safety-critical control demands outcome-space guarantees over executed actions. Here, we present a fundamentally different pathway toward domain-specific foundation models by introducing compact language models operating as Agentic Physical AI, in which policy optimization is driven by physics-based validation rather than perceptual inference. We train a 360-million-parameter model on synthetic reactor control scenarios, scaling the dataset from 10^3 to 10^5 examples. This induces a sharp phase transition absent in general-purpose models. Small-scale systems exhibit high-variance imitation with catastrophic tail risk, while large-scale models undergo variance collapse exceeding 500x reduction, stabilizing execution-level behavior. Despite balanced exposure to four actuation families, the model autonomously rejects approximately 70% of the training distribution and concentrates 95% of runtime execution on a single-bank strategy. Learned representations transfer across distinct physics and continuous input modalities without architectural modification.</p></details> |  |
| **[MetagenBERT: a Transformer-based Architecture using Foundational genomic Large Language Models for novel Metagenome Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03295v1)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Metagenomic disease prediction commonly relies on species abundance tables derived from large, incomplete reference catalogs, constraining resolution and discarding valuable information contained in DNA reads. To overcome these limitations, we introduce MetagenBERT, a Transformer based framework that produces end to end metagenome embeddings directly from raw DNA sequences, without taxonomic or functional annotations. Reads are embedded using foundational genomic language models (DNABERT2 and the microbiome specialized DNABERTMS), then aggregated through a scalable clustering strategy based on FAISS accelerated KMeans. Each metagenome is represented as a cluster abundance vector summarizing the distribution of its embedded reads. We evaluate this approach on five benchmark gut microbiome datasets (Cirrhosis, T2D, Obesity, IBD, CRC). MetagenBERT achieves competitive or superior AUC performance relative to species abundance baselines across most tasks. Concatenating both representations further improves prediction, demonstrating complementarity between taxonomic and embedding derived signals. Clustering remains robust when applied to as little as 10% of reads, highlighting substantial redundancy in metagenomes and enabling major computational gains. We additionally introduce MetagenBERT Glob Mcardis, a cross cohort variant trained on the large, phenotypically diverse MetaCardis cohort and transferred to other datasets, retaining predictive signal including for unseen phenotypes, indicating the feasibility of a foundation model for metagenome representation. Robustness analyses (PERMANOVA, PERMDISP, entropy) show consistent separation of different states across subsamples. Overall, MetagenBERT provides a scalable, annotation free representation of metagenomes pointing toward future phenotype aware generalization across heterogeneous cohorts and sequencing technologies.</p></details> |  |

Full fine-tuning is computationally expensive and risks catastrophic forgetting. We propose \textbf{TopoLoRA-SAM}, a topology-aware and parameter-efficient adaptation framework for binary semantic segmentation. TopoLoRA-SAM injects Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) into the frozen ViT encoder, augmented with a lightweight spatial convolutional adapter and optional topology-aware supervision via differentiable clDice. We evaluate our approach on five benchmarks spanning retinal vessel segmentation (DRIVE, STARE, CHASE\_DB1), polyp segmentation (Kvasir-SEG), and SAR sea/land segmentation (SL-SSDD), comparing against U-Net, DeepLabV3+, SegFormer, and Mask2Former. TopoLoRA-SAM achieves the best retina-average Dice and the best overall average Dice across datasets, while training only \textbf{5.2\%} of model parameters ($\sim$4.9M). On the challenging CHASE\_DB1 dataset, our method substantially improves segmentation accuracy and robustness, demonstrating that topology-aware parameter-efficient adaptation can match or exceed fully fine-tuned specialist models.

However, the fairness implications of this new paradigm remain largely unexplored. We present the first investigation of fairness in tabular ICL, evaluating three recently proposed foundation models--TabPFNv2, TabICL, and TabDPT--on multiple benchmark datasets. To mitigate biases, we explore three pre-processing fairness-enhancing methods: correlation removal (decorrelating input features from the sensitive attribute), group-balanced sample selection (ensuring equal representation of protected groups in context examples), and uncertainty-based sample selection (prioritizing context examples with high sensitive-attribute prediction uncertainty). Our experiments show that the uncertainty-based strategy consistently improves group fairness metrics (e.g., demographic parity, equalized odds, and equal opportunity) with minimal impact on predictive accuracy. We release our code to facilitate reproducibility https://github.com/patrikken/Fair-TabICL.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (TMLR)</p></details> |

Yet, the performance of pathology foundation models across magnifications and the effect of magnification sampling during training remain poorly understood. We model magnification sampling as a multi-source domain adaptation problem and develop a simple theoretical framework that reveals systematic trade-offs between sampling strategies. We show that the widely used discrete uniform sampling of magnifications (0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 mpp) leads to degradation at intermediate magnifications. We introduce continuous magnification sampling, which removes gaps in magnification coverage while preserving performance at standard scales. Further, we derive sampling distributions that optimize representation quality across magnification scales. To evaluate these strategies, we introduce two new benchmarks (TCGA-MS, BRACS-MS) with appropriate metrics. Our experiments show that continuous sampling substantially improves over discrete sampling at intermediate magnifications, with gains of up to 4 percentage points in balanced classification accuracy, and that optimized distributions can further improve performance. Finally, we evaluate current histopathology foundation models, finding that magnification is a primary driver of performance variation across models. Our work paves the way towards future pathology foundation models that perform reliably across magnifications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Foundation models on the bridge: Semantic hazard detection and safety maneuvers for maritime autonomy with vision-language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24470v2)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The draft IMO MASS Code requires autonomous and remotely supervised maritime vessels to detect departures from their operational design domain, enter a predefined fallback that notifies the operator, permit immediate human override, and avoid changing the voyage plan without approval. Meeting these obligations in the alert-to-takeover gap calls for a short-horizon, human-overridable fallback maneuver. Classical maritime autonomy stacks struggle when the correct action depends on meaning (e.g., diver-down flag means people in the water, fire close by means hazard). We argue (i) that vision-language models (VLMs) provide semantic awareness for such out-of-distribution situations, and (ii) that a fast-slow anomaly pipeline with a short-horizon, human-overridable fallback maneuver makes this practical in the handover window. We introduce Semantic Lookout, a camera-only, candidate-constrained VLM fallback maneuver selector that selects one cautious action (or station-keeping) from water-valid, world-anchored trajectories under continuous human authority. On 40 harbor scenes we measure per-call scene understanding and latency, alignment with human consensus (model majority-of-three voting), short-horizon risk-relief on fire hazard scenes, and an on-water alert->fallback maneuver->operator handover. Sub-10 s models retain most of the awareness of slower state-of-the-art models. The fallback maneuver selector outperforms geometry-only baselines and increases standoff distance on fire scenes. A field run verifies end-to-end operation. These results support VLMs as semantic fallback maneuver selectors compatible with the draft IMO MASS Code, within practical latency budgets, and motivate future work on domain-adapted, hybrid autonomy that pairs foundation-model semantics with multi-sensor bird's-eye-view perception and short-horizon replanning.

| **[RS-Prune: Training-Free Data Pruning at High Ratios for Efficient Remote Sensing Diffusion Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23239v2)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based remote sensing (RS) generative foundation models are cruial for downstream tasks. However, these models rely on large amounts of globally representative data, which often contain redundancy, noise, and class imbalance, reducing training efficiency and preventing convergence. Existing RS diffusion foundation models typically aggregate multiple classification datasets or apply simplistic deduplication, overlooking the distributional requirements of generation modeling and the heterogeneity of RS imagery. To address these limitations, we propose a training-free, two-stage data pruning approach that quickly select a high-quality subset under high pruning ratios, enabling a preliminary foundation model to converge rapidly and serve as a versatile backbone for generation, downstream fine-tuning, and other applications. Our method jointly considers local information content with global scene-level diversity and representativeness. First, an entropy-based criterion efficiently removes low-information samples. Next, leveraging RS scene classification datasets as reference benchmarks, we perform scene-aware clustering with stratified sampling to improve clustering effectiveness while reducing computational costs on large-scale unlabeled data. Finally, by balancing cluster-level uniformity and sample representativeness, the method enables fine-grained selection under high pruning ratios while preserving overall diversity and representativeness. Experiments show that, even after pruning 85\% of the training data, our method significantly improves convergence and generation quality. Furthermore, diffusion foundation models trained with our method consistently achieve state-of-the-art performance across downstream tasks, including super-resolution and semantic image synthesis. This data pruning paradigm offers practical guidance for developing RS generative foundation models.</p></details> |  |

Although recent vision foundation models and multimodal large language models advance representation learning, they often lack the sequential planning and active tool orchestration required for complex geospatial workflows. This survey presents the first comprehensive review of agentic AI in remote sensing. We introduce a unified taxonomy distinguishing between single-agent copilots and multi-agent systems while analyzing architectural foundations such as planning mechanisms, retrieval-augmented generation, and memory structures. Furthermore, we review emerging benchmarks that move the evaluation from pixel-level accuracy to trajectory-aware reasoning correctness. By critically examining limitations in grounding, safety, and orchestration, this work outlines a strategic roadmap for the development of robust, autonomous geospatial intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV) 2026, GeoCV Workshop</p></details> |

However, existing approaches often rely on end-to-end fine-tuning and exhibit limited efficacy under frozen-probing protocols, lacking the intrinsic universality required for broad generalization. This limitation stems from adapting general-purpose sequence architectures that overlook the biophysical and dynamical principles of neural activity. To bridge this gap, we propose DeeperBrain, a neuro-grounded foundation model integrating domain-specific inductive biases into its model design and learning objectives. Architecturally, DeeperBrain incorporates a volume conduction-aware channel encoding to model spatial mixing via 3D geometry, and a neurodynamics-aware temporal encoding capturing slow adaptations using oscillatory and exponential bases. For pretraining, we introduce a dual-objective strategy combining Masked EEG Reconstruction (MER) for local fidelity and Neurodynamics Statistics Prediction (NSP). NSP enforces alignment with macroscopic brain states by predicting interpretable order parameters, including spectral power, functional connectivity, cross-frequency coupling, and dynamic complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeeperBrain achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance under end-to-end fine-tuning. Crucially, it maintains superior efficacy under a rigorous frozen-probing protocol, verifying that embedding neuroscientific first principles endows learned representations with the intrinsic universality essential for universal BCI. The code will be publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.Under Review</p></details> |

However, giga-scale foundation models, which are trained on hundreds of thousands of slides covering tens of cancer types and contain billions of parameters, pose significant challenges for practical use due to their tremendous computational costs in both development and deployment. In this work, we present a novel strategy, named the G2L framework, to increase the performance of large-scale foundation models, which consist of only $15\%$ of the parameters of giga-scale models, to a comparable performance level of giga-scale models in cancer-specific tasks. Our approach applies knowledge distillation, transferring the capabilities of a giga-scale model to a large-scale model, using just 1K pathology slides of a target cancer (e.g., breast, prostate, etc.). The resulting distilled model not only outperformed state-of-the-art models of the same size (i.e., large-scale) across several benchmarks but also, interestingly, surpassed the giga-scale teacher and huge-scale models in some benchmarks. In addition, the distilled model exhibited a higher robustness index, indicating improved resilience to image variations originating from multiple institutions. These findings suggest that the proposed distillation approach for a large-scale model is a data- and parameter-efficient way to achieve giga-scale-level performance for cancer-specific applications without prohibitive computational burden.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in AAAI 2026 workshop in Health Intelligence Special Theme on Foundation Models and AI Agents</p></details> |

We incorporate three key ingredients: 1) an internet-scale video-action dataset constructed by automatically extracting player actions from publicly available gameplay videos, 2) a multi-game benchmark environment that can measure cross-game generalization, and 3) a unified vision-action model trained with large-scale behavior cloning. NitroGen exhibits strong competence across diverse domains, including combat encounters in 3D action games, high-precision control in 2D platformers, and exploration in procedurally generated worlds. It transfers effectively to unseen games, achieving up to 52% relative improvement in task success rates over models trained from scratch. We release the dataset, evaluation suite, and model weights to advance research on generalist embodied agents.</p></details> | 16 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Utilizing Earth Foundation Models to Enhance the Simulation Performance of Hydrological Models with AlphaEarth Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01558v1)** | 2026-01-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting river flow in places without streamflow records is challenging because basins respond differently to climate, terrain, vegetation, and soils. Traditional basin attributes describe some of these differences, but they cannot fully represent the complexity of natural environments. This study examines whether AlphaEarth Foundation embeddings, which are learned from large collections of satellite images rather than designed by experts, offer a more informative way to describe basin characteristics. These embeddings summarize patterns in vegetation, land surface properties, and long-term environmental dynamics. We find that models using them achieve higher accuracy when predicting flows in basins not used for training, suggesting that they capture key physical differences more effectively than traditional attributes. We further investigate how selecting appropriate donor basins influences prediction in ungauged regions. Similarity based on the embeddings helps identify basins with comparable environmental and hydrological behavior, improving performance, whereas adding many dissimilar basins can reduce accuracy. The results show that satellite-informed environmental representations can strengthen hydrological forecasting and support the development of models that adapt more easily to different landscapes.</p></details> | 12 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Towards Vision-Language Geo-Foundation Model: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09385v2)** | 2026-01-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Foundation Models (VLFMs) have made remarkable progress on various multimodal tasks, such as image captioning, image-text retrieval, visual question answering, and visual grounding. However, most methods rely on training with general image datasets, and the lack of geospatial data leads to poor performance on earth observation. Numerous geospatial image-text pair datasets and VLFMs fine-tuned on them have been proposed recently. These new approaches aim to leverage large-scale, multimodal geospatial data to build versatile intelligent models with diverse geo-perceptive capabilities, which we refer to as Vision-Language Geo-Foundation Models (VLGFMs). This paper thoroughly reviews VLGFMs, summarizing and analyzing recent developments in the field. In particular, we introduce the background and motivation behind the rise of VLGFMs, highlighting their unique research significance. Then, we systematically summarize the core technologies employed in VLGFMs, including data construction, model architectures, and applications of various multimodal geospatial tasks. Finally, we conclude with insights, issues, and discussions regarding future research directions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive literature review of VLGFMs. We keep tracing related works at https://github.com/zytx121/Awesome-VLGFM.</p></details> | 18 pages, 4 figures |

However, the lack of comprehensive evaluation has become a critical bottleneck for further progress in the field, particularly in audio generation. Current audio evaluation faces three major challenges: (1) audio evaluation lacks a unified framework, with datasets and code scattered across various sources, hindering fair and efficient cross-model comparison;(2) audio codecs, as a key component of audio foundation models, lack a widely accepted and holistic evaluation methodology; (3) existing speech benchmarks are heavily reliant on English, making it challenging to objectively assess models' performance on Chinese. To address the first issue, we introduce UltraEval-Audio, a unified evaluation framework for audio foundation models, specifically designed for both audio understanding and generation tasks. UltraEval-Audio features a modular architecture, supporting 10 languages and 14 core task categories, while seamlessly integrating 24 mainstream models and 36 authoritative benchmarks. To enhance research efficiency, the framework provides a one-command evaluation feature, accompanied by real-time public leaderboards. For the second challenge, UltraEval-Audio adopts a novel comprehensive evaluation scheme for audio codecs, evaluating performance across three key dimensions: semantic accuracy, timbre fidelity, and acoustic quality. To address the third issue, we propose two new Chinese benchmarks, SpeechCMMLU and SpeechHSK, designed to assess Chinese knowledge proficiency and language fluency. We wish that UltraEval-Audio will provide both academia and industry with a transparent, efficient, and fair platform for comparison of audio models. Our code, benchmarks, and leaderboards are available at https://github.com/OpenBMB/UltraEval-Audio.</p></details> | 13 pages, 2 figures |

In response, the Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HCAI) approach has emerged as both a design philosophy and a methodological complement to prevailing technology-centered AI paradigms. Placing humans at the core, HCAI seeks to ensure that AI systems serve, augment, and empower humans rather than harm or replace them. This chapter establishes the conceptual and methodological foundations of HCAI by tracing its evolution and recent advancements. It introduces key HCAI concepts, frameworks, guiding principles, methodologies, and practical strategies that bridge philosophical HCAI principles with operational implementation. Through an analytical review of the emerging characteristics and challenges of AI technologies, the chapter positions HCAI as a holistic paradigm for aligning AI innovation with human values, societal well-being, and sustainable progress. Finally, this chapter outlines the structure and contributions of the Handbook of Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence. The purpose of this chapter is to provide an integrated foundation that connects HCAI conceptual frameworks, principles, methodology, and practices for this handbook, thereby paving the way for the content of subsequent chapters.</p></details> |  |
| **[Promptable Foundation Models for SAR Remote Sensing: Adapting the Segment Anything Model for Snow Avalanche Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01213v1)** | 2026-01-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote sensing solutions for avalanche segmentation and mapping are key to supporting risk forecasting and mitigation in mountain regions. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery from Sentinel-1 can be effectively used for this task, but training an effective detection model requires gathering a large dataset with high-quality annotations from domain experts, which is prohibitively time-consuming. In this work, we aim to facilitate and accelerate the annotation of SAR images for avalanche mapping. We build on the Segment Anything Model (SAM), a segmentation foundation model trained on natural images, and tailor it to Sentinel-1 SAR data. Adapting SAM to our use-case requires addressing several domain-specific challenges: (i) domain mismatch, since SAM was not trained on satellite/SAR imagery; (ii) input adaptation, because SAR products typically provide more than three channels, while SAM is constrained to RGB images; (iii) robustness to imprecise prompts that can affect target identification and degrade the segmentation quality, an issue exacerbated in small, low-contrast avalanches; and (iv) training efficiency, since standard fine-tuning is computationally demanding for SAM. We tackle these challenges through a combination of adapters to mitigate the domain gap, multiple encoders to handle multi-channel SAR inputs, prompt-engineering strategies to improve avalanche localization accuracy, and a training algorithm that limits the training time of the encoder, which is recognized as the major bottleneck. We integrate the resulting model into an annotation tool and show experimentally that it speeds up the annotation of SAR images.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Knowledge Guided Pretraining Approaches for Multimodal Foundation Models: Applications in Remote Sensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19660v4)** | 2026-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm for pretraining foundation models using large-scale data. Existing pretraining approaches predominantly rely on masked reconstruction or next-token prediction strategies, demonstrating strong performance across various downstream tasks, including geoscience applications. However, these approaches do not fully capture the knowledge of causal interplay between different geospatial and environmental variables. To address this limitation, we propose Knowledge Guided Variable-Step Forecasting (KG-VSF), a novel pretraining task that models forecasting as a conditional generation task, where driver variables (e.g., weather) inform the prediction of response variables (e.g., satellite imagery). We demonstrate that pretraining in such a fashion leads to strong embeddings which give enhanced performance when finetuned on downstream tasks where capturing this causality matters such as pixel wise crop type mapping, soil moisture estimation and forecasting, missing image prediction, and future image forecasting when compared to finetuning embeddings from other standard pretraining approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages with appendix</p></details> |

ERP plays a critical role in cognitive analysis, the detection of neurological diseases, and the assessment of psychological states. Recent years have seen substantial advances in deep learning-based methods for spontaneous EEG and other non-time-locked task-related EEG signals. However, their effectiveness on ERP data remains underexplored, and many existing ERP studies still rely heavily on manually extracted features. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive benchmark study that systematically compares traditional manual features (followed by a linear classifier), deep learning models, and pre-trained EEG foundation models for ERP analysis. We establish a unified data preprocessing and training pipeline and evaluate these approaches on two representative tasks, ERP stimulus classification and ERP-based brain disease detection, across 12 publicly available datasets. Furthermore, we investigate various patch-embedding strategies within advanced Transformer architectures to identify embedding designs that better suit ERP data. Our study provides a landmark framework to guide method selection and tailored model design for future ERP analysis.

Understanding how foundation model (FM) agents understand and act in such environments is therefore critical for enabling reliable map-based reasoning and applications. However, most existing evaluations of spatial ability in FMs rely on static map inputs or text-based queries, overlooking the interactive and experience-driven nature of spatial understanding.In this paper, we propose an interactive evaluation framework to analyze how FM agents explore, remember, and reason in symbolic map environments. Agents incrementally explore partially observable grid-based maps consisting of roads, intersections, and points of interest (POIs), receiving only local observations at each step. Spatial understanding is then evaluated using six kinds of spatial tasks. By systematically varying exploration strategies, memory representations, and reasoning schemes across multiple foundation models, we reveal distinct functional roles of these components. Exploration primarily affects experience acquisition but has a limited impact on final reasoning accuracy. In contrast, memory representation plays a central role in consolidating spatial experience, with structured memories particularly sequential and graph-based representations, substantially improving performance on structure-intensive tasks such as path planning. Reasoning schemes further shape how stored spatial knowledge is used, with advanced prompts supporting more effective multi-step inference. We further observe that spatial reasoning performance saturates across model versions and scales beyond a certain capability threshold, indicating that improvements in map-based spatial understanding require mechanisms tailored to spatial representation and reasoning rather than scaling alone.</p></details> | 43 pages, 8 figures |

We explore whether time series foundation models (TSFMs), pretrained on large heterogeneous data, can serve as universal backbones for anomaly detection. Through systematic experiments across multiple benchmarks, we compare zero-shot inference, full model adaptation, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) strategies. Our results demonstrate that TSFMs outperform task-specific baselines, achieving notable gains in AUC-PR and VUS-PR, particularly under severe class imbalance. Moreover, PEFT methods such as LoRA, OFT, and HRA not only reduce computational cost but also match or surpass full fine-tuning in most cases, indicating that TSFMs can be efficiently adapted for anomaly detection, even when pretrained for forecasting. These findings position TSFMs as promising general-purpose models for scalable and efficient time series anomaly detection.</p></details> |  |

Our core idea is to bridge flow estimation with geometric reasoning by leveraging the guidance from foundation depth models. To this end, we first develop a Hybrid Flow Network that produces geometry-aware correspondences, enabling consistent depth and pose inference across diverse keyframes. To enforce global consistency, we propose a Bi-Consistent Bundle Adjustment Layer that jointly optimizes keyframe pose and depth under multi-view constraints. Furthermore, we introduce a Reliability-Aware Refinement mechanism that dynamically adapts the flow update process by distinguishing between reliable and uncertain regions, forming a closed feedback loop between matching and optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FoundationSLAM achieves superior trajectory accuracy and dense reconstruction quality across multiple challenging datasets, while running in real-time at 18 FPS, demonstrating strong generalization to various scenarios and practical applicability of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accept at AAAI 2026 (Oral)</p></details> |

This work bridges the gap between advanced representation learning and practical network protection by introducing Traffic-MoE, a sparse foundation model optimized for high-efficiency real-time inference. By dynamically routing traffic tokens to a small subset of specialized experts, Traffic-MoE effectively decouples model capacity from computational overhead. Extensive evaluations across three security-oriented tasks demonstrate that Traffic-MoE achieves up to a 12.38% improvement in detection performance compared to leading dense competitors. Crucially, it delivers a 91.62% increase in throughput, reduces inference latency by 47.81%, and cuts peak GPU memory consumption by 38.72%. Beyond efficiency, Traffic-MoE exhibits superior robustness against adversarial traffic shaping and maintains high detection efficacy in few-shot scenarios, establishing a new paradigm for scalable and resilient network traffic analysis.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we propose TotalFM, a radiological foundation model that efficiently learns the correspondence between 3D-CT images and linguistic expressions based on the concept of organ separation, utilizing a large-scale dataset of 140,000 series. By automating the creation of organ volume and finding-sentence pairs through segmentation techniques and Large Language Model (LLM)-based radiology report processing, and by combining self-supervised pre-training via VideoMAE with contrastive learning using volume-text pairs, we aimed to balance computational efficiency and representation capability. In zero-shot organ-wise lesion classification tasks, the proposed model achieved higher F1 scores in 83% (5/6) of organs compared to CT-CLIP and 64% (9/14) of organs compared to Merlin. These results suggest that the proposed model exhibits high generalization performance in a clinical evaluation setting using actual radiology report sentences. Furthermore, in zero-shot finding-wise lesion classification tasks, our model achieved a higher AUROC in 83% (25/30) of finding categories compared to Merlin. We also confirmed performance comparable to existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in radiology report generation tasks. Our results demonstrate that the organ-separated learning framework can serve as a realistic and effective design guideline for the practical implementation of 3D-CT foundation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Generalisable Foundation Models for Brain MRI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23415v3)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models in artificial intelligence (AI) are transforming medical imaging by enabling general-purpose feature learning from large-scale, unlabeled datasets. In this work, we introduce BrainFound, a self-supervised foundation model for brain MRI, built by extending DINO-v2, a vision transformer originally designed for 2D natural images. BrainFound adapts DINO-v2 to model full 3D brain anatomy by incorporating volumetric information from sequential MRI slices, moving beyond conventional single-slice paradigms. It supports both single- and multimodal inputs, enabling a broad range of downstream tasks, including disease detection and image segmentation, while generalising across varied imaging protocols and clinical scenarios. We show that BrainFound consistently outperforms existing self-supervised pretraining strategies and supervised baselines, particularly in label-scarce and multi-contrast settings. By integrating information from diverse 3D MRI modalities (e.g., T1, T2, FLAIR), it enhances diagnostic accuracy and reduces dependency on extensive expert annotations. This flexibility makes BrainFound a scalable and practical solution for 3D neuroimaging pipelines, with significant potential for clinical deployment and research innovation.</p></details> |  |

Exotic expressions involving sets related to formulas of unlimited quantifiers height appear mostly in esoteric or foundational studies. Recognizing internal to math (formula-specified) and external (based on parameters in those formulas) aspects of math objects greatly simplifies foundations. I postulate external sets (not internally specified, constituting the domain of variables) to be hereditarily countable and independent of formula-defined classes, i.e. with finite algorithmic information about them. This allows to eliminate all non-integer quantifiers in Set Theory sentences.

While large language models possess broad domain knowledge, they often fail to capture dataset-specific patterns critical for prediction tasks. Our approach addresses this by discovering semantic feature descriptions through an iterative process that contrasts groups of items identified via statistical modeling errors, rather than relying solely on the foundational model's domain understanding. We formulate this as a generalized EM algorithm that jointly optimizes semantic feature descriptors and statistical model parameters. The method prompts a frozen foundational model to classify items based on discovered features, treating these judgments as noisy observations of latent binary features that predict real-valued targets through learned statistical relationships. We demonstrate the approach on two domains: house price prediction (hedonic regression) and cold-start collaborative filtering for movie recommendations. On house prices, our model achieves 12\% median relative error using discovered semantic features from multimodal listing data, substantially outperforming a GPT-5 baseline (38\% error) that relies on the LLM's general domain knowledge. For Netflix movie embeddings, our model predicts collaborative filtering representations with 0.59 cosine similarity purely from semantic descriptions -- matching the performance that would require approximately 4000 user ratings through traditional collaborative filtering. The discovered features reveal dataset-specific patterns (e.g., architectural details predicting local housing markets, franchise membership predicting user preferences) that diverge from the model's domain knowledge alone.</p></details> |  |
| **[TALO: Pushing 3D Vision Foundation Models Towards Globally Consistent Online Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02341v2)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D vision foundation models have shown strong generalization in reconstructing key 3D attributes from uncalibrated images through a single feed-forward pass. However, when deployed in online settings such as driving scenarios, predictions are made over temporal windows, making it non-trivial to maintain consistency across time. Recent strategies align consecutive predictions by solving global transformation, yet our analysis reveals their fundamental limitations in assumption validity, local alignment scope, and robustness under noisy geometry. In this work, we propose a higher-DOF and long-term alignment framework based on Thin Plate Spline, leveraging globally propagated control points to correct spatially varying inconsistencies. In addition, we adopt a point-agnostic submap registration design that is inherently robust to noisy geometry predictions. The proposed framework is fully plug-and-play, compatible with diverse 3D foundation models and camera configurations (e.g., monocular or surround-view). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently yields more coherent geometry and lower trajectory errors across multiple datasets, backbone models, and camera setups, highlighting its robustness and generality.

| **[ALF: Advertiser Large Foundation Model for Multi-Modal Advertiser Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18785v3)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present ALF (Advertiser Large Foundation model), a multi-modal transformer architecture for understanding advertiser behavior and intent across text, image, video, and structured data modalities. Through contrastive learning and multi-task optimization, ALF creates unified advertiser representations that capture both content and behavioral patterns. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on critical tasks including fraud detection, policy violation identification, and advertiser similarity matching. In production deployment, ALF demonstrates significant real-world impact by delivering simultaneous gains in both precision and recall, for instance boosting recall by over 40 percentage points on one critical policy and increasing precision to 99.8% on another. The architecture's effectiveness stems from its novel combination of multi-modal transformations, inter-sample attention mechanism, spectrally normalized projections, and calibrated probabilistic outputs.</p></details> | KDD 2026 ADS Track |
| **[F2IDiff: Real-world Image Super-resolution using Feature to Image Diffusion Foundation Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24473v1)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the advent of Generative AI, Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) quality has seen substantial improvement, as the strong priors learned by Text-2-Image Diffusion (T2IDiff) Foundation Models (FM) can bridge the gap between High-Resolution (HR) and Low-Resolution (LR) images. However, flagship smartphone cameras have been slow to adopt generative models because strong generation can lead to undesirable hallucinations. For substantially degraded LR images, as seen in academia, strong generation is required and hallucinations are more tolerable because of the wide gap between LR and HR images. In contrast, in consumer photography, the LR image has substantially higher fidelity, requiring only minimal hallucination-free generation. We hypothesize that generation in SISR is controlled by the stringency and richness of the FM's conditioning feature. First, text features are high level features, which often cannot describe subtle textures in an image. Additionally, Smartphone LR images are at least $12MP$, whereas SISR networks built on T2IDiff FM are designed to perform inference on much smaller images ($<1MP$). As a result, SISR inference has to be performed on small patches, which often cannot be accurately described by text feature. To address these shortcomings, we introduce an SISR network built on a FM with lower-level feature conditioning, specifically DINOv2 features, which we call a Feature-to-Image Diffusion (F2IDiff) Foundation Model (FM). Lower level features provide stricter conditioning while being rich descriptors of even small patches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Virtual-Eyes: Quantitative Validation of a Lung CT Quality-Control Pipeline for Foundation-Model Cancer Risk Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24294v1)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robust preprocessing is rarely quantified in deep-learning pipelines for low-dose CT (LDCT) lung cancer screening. We develop and validate Virtual-Eyes, a clinically motivated 16-bit CT quality-control pipeline, and measure its differential impact on generalist foundation models versus specialist models. Virtual-Eyes enforces strict 512x512 in-plane resolution, rejects short or non-diagnostic series, and extracts a contiguous lung block using Hounsfield-unit filtering and bilateral lung-coverage scoring while preserving the native 16-bit grid. Using 765 NLST patients (182 cancer, 583 non-cancer), we compute slice-level embeddings from RAD-DINO and Merlin with frozen encoders and train leakage-free patient-level MLP heads; we also evaluate Sybil and a 2D ResNet-18 baseline under Raw versus Virtual-Eyes inputs without backbone retraining. Virtual-Eyes improves RAD-DINO slice-level AUC from 0.576 to 0.610 and patient-level AUC from 0.646 to 0.683 (mean pooling) and from 0.619 to 0.735 (max pooling), with improved calibration (Brier score 0.188 to 0.112). In contrast, Sybil and ResNet-18 degrade under Virtual-Eyes (Sybil AUC 0.886 to 0.837; ResNet-18 AUC 0.571 to 0.596) with evidence of context dependence and shortcut learning, and Merlin shows limited transferability (AUC approximately 0.507 to 0.567) regardless of preprocessing. These results demonstrate that anatomically targeted QC can stabilize and improve generalist foundation-model workflows but may disrupt specialist models adapted to raw clinical context.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, and Under Review-MIDL-2026</p></details> |
| **[MotivNet: Evolving Meta-Sapiens into an Emotionally Intelligent Foundation Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24231v1)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce MotivNet, a generalizable facial emotion recognition model for robust real-world application. Current state-of-the-art FER models tend to have weak generalization when tested on diverse data, leading to deteriorated performance in the real world and hindering FER as a research domain. Though researchers have proposed complex architectures to address this generalization issue, they require training cross-domain to obtain generalizable results, which is inherently contradictory for real-world application. Our model, MotivNet, achieves competitive performance across datasets without cross-domain training by using Meta-Sapiens as a backbone. Sapiens is a human vision foundational model with state-of-the-art generalization in the real world through large-scale pretraining of a Masked Autoencoder. We propose MotivNet as an additional downstream task for Sapiens and define three criteria to evaluate MotivNet's viability as a Sapiens task: benchmark performance, model similarity, and data similarity. Throughout this paper, we describe the components of MotivNet, our training approach, and our results showing MotivNet is generalizable across domains. We demonstrate that MotivNet can be benchmarked against existing SOTA models and meets the listed criteria, validating MotivNet as a Sapiens downstream task, and making FER more incentivizing for in-the-wild application.

| **[Scaling Spatial Intelligence with Multimodal Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13719v3)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite remarkable progress, multimodal foundation models still exhibit surprising deficiencies in spatial intelligence. In this work, we explore scaling up multimodal foundation models to cultivate spatial intelligence within the SenseNova-SI family, built upon established multimodal foundations including visual understanding models (i.e., Qwen3-VL and InternVL3) and unified understanding and generation models (i.e., Bagel). We take a principled approach to constructing high-performing and robust spatial intelligence by systematically curating SenseNova-SI-8M: eight million diverse data samples under a rigorous taxonomy of spatial capabilities. SenseNova-SI demonstrates unprecedented performance across a broad range of spatial intelligence benchmarks: 68.7% on VSI-Bench, 43.3% on MMSI, 85.6% on MindCube, 54.6% on ViewSpatial, and 50.1% on SITE, while maintaining strong general multimodal understanding (e.g., 84.9% on MMBench-En). More importantly, we analyze the impact of data scaling, discuss early signs of emergent generalization capabilities enabled by diverse data training, analyze the risk of overfitting and language shortcuts, present a preliminary study on spatial chain-of-thought reasoning, and validate the potential downstream application. SenseNova-SI is an ongoing project, and this report will be updated continuously. All newly trained multimodal foundation models are publicly released to facilitate further research in this direction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Codeb...</summary><p>Codebase: https://github.com/OpenSenseNova/SenseNova-SI ; Models: https://huggingface.co/collections/sensenova/sensenova-si</p></details> |
| **[Universal Battery Degradation Forecasting Driven by Foundation Model Across Diverse Chemistries and Conditions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00862v1)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate forecasting of battery capacity fade is essential for the safety, reliability, and long-term efficiency of energy storage systems. However, the strong heterogeneity across cell chemistries, form factors, and operating conditions makes it difficult to build a single model that generalizes beyond its training domain. This work proposes a unified capacity forecasting framework that maintains robust performance across diverse chemistries and usage scenarios. We curate 20 public aging datasets into a large-scale corpus covering 1,704 cells and 3,961,195 charge-discharge cycle segments, spanning temperatures from $-5\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ to $45\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$, multiple C-rates, and application-oriented profiles such as fast charging and partial cycling. On this corpus, we adopt a Time-Series Foundation Model (TSFM) backbone and apply parameter-efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) together with physics-guided contrastive representation learning to capture shared degradation patterns. Experiments on both seen and deliberately held-out unseen datasets show that a single unified model achieves competitive or superior accuracy compared with strong per-dataset baselines, while retaining stable performance on chemistries, capacity scales, and operating conditions excluded from training. These results demonstrate the potential of TSFM-based architectures as a scalable and transferable solution for capacity degradation forecasting in real battery management systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Due t...</summary><p>Due to space limitations, the open-source method for supporting materials is currently under discussion</p></details> |
| **[Harvesting AlphaEarth: Benchmarking the Geospatial Foundation Model for Agricultural Downstream Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00857v1)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Geospatial foundation models (GFMs) have emerged as a promising approach to overcoming the limitations in existing featurization methods. More recently, Google DeepMind has introduced AlphaEarth Foundation (AEF), a GFM pre-trained using multi-source EOs across continuous time. An annual and global embedding dataset is produced using AEF that is ready for analysis and modeling. The internal experiments show that AEF embeddings have outperformed operational models in 15 EO tasks without re-training. However, those experiments are mostly about land cover and land use classification. Applying AEF and other GFMs to agricultural monitoring require an in-depth evaluation in critical agricultural downstream tasks. There is also a lack of comprehensive comparison between the AEF-based models and traditional remote sensing (RS)-based models under different scenarios, which could offer valuable guidance for researchers and practitioners. This study addresses some of these gaps by evaluating AEF embeddings in three agricultural downstream tasks in the U.S., including crop yield prediction, tillage mapping, and cover crop mapping. Datasets are compiled from both public and private sources to comprehensively evaluate AEF embeddings across tasks at different scales and locations, and RS-based models are trained as comparison models. AEF-based models generally exhibit strong performance on all tasks and are competitive with purpose-built RS-based models in yield prediction and county-level tillage mapping when trained on local data. However, we also find several limitations in current AEF embeddings, such as limited spatial transferability compared to RS-based models, low interpretability, and limited time sensitivity. These limitations recommend caution when applying AEF embeddings in agriculture, where time sensitivity, generalizability, and interpretability is important.</p></details> |  |
| **[Wireless Multimodal Foundation Model (WMFM): Integrating Vision and Communication Modalities for 6G ISAC Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23897v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of multimodal foundation models has revolutionized learning paradigms by enabling joint understanding across diverse data types. In the context of next-generation wireless networks, integrating sensing and communication modalities presents a unique opportunity to develop generalizable and data-efficient models. In this work, we introduce the contrastive learning based Wireless Multimodal Foundation Model (WMFM), a large-scale framework that jointly learns from wireless channel coefficients and visual imagery. The WMFM is pretrained using contrastive learning, a self-supervised learning technique that aligns embeddings of camera and channel data without requiring explicit labels. The pretrained encoders are then frozen and employed as feature extractors, with lightweight task-specific heads, fine-tuned for downstream tasks, including user localization and LoS/nLoS classification. Extensive experiments on the DeepVerse6G dataset demonstrate that the proposed WMFM achieves a 17% improvement in balanced accuracy for LoS/nLoS classification and a 48.5% reduction in localization error compared to the end-to-end (E2E) benchmark, while reducing training time by up to 90-fold. Even when trained with as little as 20% of the data, the WMFM-based heads outperform the fully supervised E2E model, underscoring their robustness and data-efficient learning. The proposed approach establishes a foundation for scalable, multimodal learning in Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) systems, paving the way for intelligent and adaptive 6G networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Journ...</summary><p>Journal Paper, 13 pages, 11 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Breaking Data Silos: Towards Open and Scalable Mobility Foundation Models via Generative Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06694v6)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human mobility is a fundamental pillar of urban science and sustainability, providing critical insights into energy consumption, carbon emissions, and public health. However, the discovery of universal mobility laws is currently hindered by the ``data silo'' problem, where institutional boundaries and privacy regulations fragment the necessary large-scale datasets. In this paper, we propose MoveGCL, a transformative framework that facilitates collaborative and decentralized mobility science via generative continual learning. MoveGCL enables a distributed ecosystem of data holders to jointly evolve a foundation model without compromising individual privacy. The core of MoveGCL lies in its ability to replay synthetic trajectories derived from a generative teacher and utilize a mobility-pattern-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. This allows the model to encapsulate the unique characteristics of diverse urban structures while mitigating the risk of knowledge erosion (catastrophic forgetting). With a specialized layer-wise progressive adaptation strategy, MoveGCL ensures stable convergence during the continuous integration of new urban domains. Our experiments on six global urban datasets demonstrate that MoveGCL achieves performance parity with joint training, a previously unattainable feat under siloed conditions. This work provides a scalable, privacy-preserving pathway toward Open Mobility Science, empowering researchers to address global sustainability challenges through cross-institutional AI collaboration. To facilitate reproducibility and future research, we have released the code and models at \color{blue}{https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/MoveGCL}.</p></details> |  |
