| **[Spatial-Agent: Agentic Geo-spatial Reasoning with Scientific Core Concepts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16965v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Geospatial reasoning is essential for real-world applications such as urban analytics, transportation planning, and disaster response. However, existing LLM-based agents often fail at genuine geospatial computation, relying instead on web search or pattern matching while hallucinating spatial relationships. We present Spatial-Agent, an AI agent grounded in foundational theories of spatial information science. Our approach formalizes geo-analytical question answering as a concept transformation problem, where natural-language questions are parsed into executable workflows represented as GeoFlow Graphs -- directed acyclic graphs with nodes corresponding to spatial concepts and edges representing transformations. Drawing on spatial information theory, Spatial-Agent extracts spatial concepts, assigns functional roles with principled ordering constraints, and composes transformation sequences through template-based generation. Extensive experiments on MapEval-API and MapQA benchmarks demonstrate that Spatial-Agent significantly outperforms existing baselines including ReAct and Reflexion, while producing interpretable and executable geospatial workflows.</p></details> | 15pages, 4 figures |
| **[A Lightweight Fourier-based Network for Binaural Speech Enhancement with Spatial Cue Preservation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14076v2)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Binaural speech enhancement faces a severe trade-off challenge, where state-of-the-art performance is achieved by computationally intensive architectures, while lightweight solutions often come at the cost of significant performance degradation. To bridge this gap, we propose the Global Adaptive Fourier Network (GAF-Net), a lightweight deep complex network that aims to establish a balance between performance and computational efficiency. The GAF-Net architecture consists of three components. First, a dual-feature encoder combining short-time Fourier transform and gammatone features enhances the robustness of acoustic representation. Second, a channel-independent globally adaptive Fourier modulator efficiently captures long-term temporal dependencies while preserving the spatial cues. Finally, a dynamic gating mechanism is implemented to reduce processing artifacts. Experimental results show that GAF-Net achieves competitive performance, particularly in terms of binaural cues (ILD and IPD error) and objective intelligibility (MBSTOI), with fewer parameters and computational cost. These results confirm that GAF-Net provides a feasible way to achieve high-fidelity binaural processing on resource-constrained devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE ICASSP 2026</p></details> |
| **[Revisiting the Ordering of Channel and Spatial Attention: A Comprehensive Study on Sequential and Parallel Designs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07310v2)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Attention mechanisms have become a core component of deep learning models, with Channel Attention and Spatial Attention being the two most representative architectures. Current research on their fusion strategies primarily bifurcates into sequential and parallel paradigms, yet the selection process remains largely empirical, lacking systematic analysis and unified principles. We systematically compare channel-spatial attention combinations under a unified framework, building an evaluation suite of 18 topologies across four classes: sequential, parallel, multi-scale, and residual. Across two vision and nine medical datasets, we uncover a "data scale-method-performance" coupling law: (1) in few-shot tasks, the "Channel-Multi-scale Spatial" cascaded structure achieves optimal performance; (2) in medium-scale tasks, parallel learnable fusion architectures demonstrate superior results; (3) in large-scale tasks, parallel structures with dynamic gating yield the best performance. Additionally, experiments indicate that the "Spatial-Channel" order is more stable and effective for fine-grained classification, while residual connections mitigate vanishing gradient problems across varying data scales. We thus propose scenario-based guidelines for building future attention modules. Code is open-sourced at https://github.com/DWlzm.</p></details> |  |
| **[TangramPuzzle: Evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models with Compositional Spatial Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16520v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in visual recognition and semantic understanding. Nevertheless, their ability to perform precise compositional spatial reasoning remains largely unexplored. Existing benchmarks often involve relatively simple tasks and rely on semantic approximations or coarse relative positioning, while their evaluation metrics are typically limited and lack rigorous mathematical formulations. To bridge this gap, we introduce TangramPuzzle, a geometry-grounded benchmark designed to evaluate compositional spatial reasoning through the lens of the classic Tangram game. We propose the Tangram Construction Expression (TCE), a symbolic geometric framework that grounds tangram assemblies in exact, machine-verifiable coordinate specifications, to mitigate the ambiguity of visual approximation. We design two complementary tasks: Outline Prediction, which demands inferring global shapes from local components, and End-to-End Code Generation, which requires solving inverse geometric assembly problems. We conduct extensive evaluation experiments on advanced open-source and proprietary models, revealing an interesting insight: MLLMs tend to prioritize matching the target silhouette while neglecting geometric constraints, leading to distortions or deformations of the pieces.</p></details> |  |
| **[Auditory Attention Decoding without Spatial Information: A Diotic EEG Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16442v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Auditory attention decoding (AAD) identifies the attended speech stream in multi-speaker environments by decoding brain signals such as electroencephalography (EEG). This technology is essential for realizing smart hearing aids that address the cocktail party problem and for facilitating objective audiometry systems. Existing AAD research mainly utilizes dichotic environments where different speech signals are presented to the left and right ears, enabling models to classify directional attention rather than speech content. However, this spatial reliance limits applicability to real-world scenarios, such as the "cocktail party" situation, where speakers overlap or move dynamically. To address this challenge, we propose an AAD framework for diotic environments where identical speech mixtures are presented to both ears, eliminating spatial cues. Our approach maps EEG and speech signals into a shared latent space using independent encoders. We extract speech features using wav2vec 2.0 and encode them with a 2-layer 1D convolutional neural network (CNN), while employing the BrainNetwork architecture for EEG encoding. The model identifies the attended speech by calculating the cosine similarity between EEG and speech representations. We evaluate our method on a diotic EEG dataset and achieve 72.70% accuracy, which is 22.58% higher than the state-of-the-art direction-based AAD method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Coupled Physics-Gated Adaptation: Spatially Decoding Volumetric Photochemical Conversion in Complex 3D-Printed Objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19913v2)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a framework that pioneers the prediction of photochemical conversion in complex three-dimensionally printed objects, introducing a challenging new computer vision task: predicting dense, non-visual volumetric physical properties from 3D visual data. This approach leverages the largest-ever optically printed 3D specimen dataset, comprising a large family of parametrically designed complex minimal surface structures that have undergone terminal chemical characterisation. Conventional vision models are ill-equipped for this task, as they lack an inductive bias for the coupled, non-linear interactions of optical physics (diffraction, absorption) and material physics (diffusion, convection) that govern the final chemical state. To address this, we propose Coupled Physics-Gated Adaptation (C-PGA), a novel multimodal fusion architecture. Unlike standard concatenation, C-PGA explicitly models physical coupling by using sparse geometrical and process parameters (e.g., surface transport, print layer height) as a Query to dynamically gate and adapt the dense visual features via feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM). This mechanism spatially modulates dual 3D visual streams-extracted by parallel 3D-CNNs processing raw projection stacks and their diffusion-diffraction corrected counterparts allowing the model to recalibrate its visual perception based on the physical context. This approach offers a breakthrough in virtual chemical characterisation, eliminating the need for traditional post-print measurements and enabling precise control over the chemical conversion state.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spherical Spatial Autoregressive Model for Spherically Embedded Spatial Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16385v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spherically embedded spatial data are spatially indexed observations whose values naturally reside on or can be equivalently mapped to the unit sphere. Such data are increasingly ubiquitous in fields ranging from geochemistry to demography. However, analysing such data presents unique difficulties due to the intrinsic non-Euclidean nature of the sphere, and rigorous methodologies for statistical modelling, inference, and uncertainty quantification remain limited. This paper introduces a unified framework to address these three limitations for spherically embedded spatial data. We first propose a novel spherical spatial autoregressive model that leverages optimal transport geometry and then extend it to accommodate exogenous covariates. Second, for either scenario with or without covariates, we establish the asymptotic properties of the estimators and derive a distribution-free Wald test for spatial dependence, complemented by a bootstrap procedure to enhance finite-sample performance. Third, we contribute a novel approach to uncertainty quantification by developing a conformal prediction procedure specifically tailored to spherically embedded spatial data. The practical utility of these methodological advances is illustrated through extensive simulations and applications to Spanish geochemical compositions and Japanese age-at-death mortality distributions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Spatial Goodness Encoding: Advancing and Scaling Forward-Forward Learning Without Backpropagation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12394v2)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Forward-Forward (FF) algorithm offers a promising alternative to backpropagation (BP). Despite advancements in recent FF-based extensions, which have enhanced the original algorithm and adapted it to convolutional neural networks (CNNs), they often suffer from limited representational capacity and poor scalability to large-scale datasets, primarily due to exploding channel dimensionality. In this work, we propose adaptive spatial goodness encoding (ASGE), a new FF-based training framework tailored for CNNs. ASGE leverages feature maps to compute spatially-aware goodness representations at each layer, enabling layer-wise supervision. Crucially, this approach decouples classification complexity from channel dimensionality, thereby addressing the issue of channel explosion and achieving competitive performance compared to other BP alternatives. ASGE outperforms all other FF-based approaches across multiple benchmarks, delivering test accuracies of 99.65% on MNIST, 93.41% on FashionMNIST, 90.62% on CIFAR-10, and 65.42% on CIFAR-100. Moreover, we present the first successful application of FF-based training to ImageNet, with Top-1 and Top-5 accuracies of 51.58% and 75.23%. Furthermore, we propose three prediction strategies to achieve flexible trade-offs among accuracy, parameters and memory usage, enabling deployment under diverse resource constraints.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 2026 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP2026)</p></details> |
| **[The Spatial Blindspot of Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09954v2)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced rapidly, but their ability to capture spatial relationships remains a blindspot. Current VLMs are typically built with contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP) style image encoders. The training recipe often flattens images into 1D patch sequences, discarding the 2D structure necessary for spatial reasoning. We argue that this lack of spatial awareness is a missing dimension in VLM design and a bottleneck for applications requiring spatial grounding, such as robotics and embodied AI. To address this, we investigate (i) image encoders trained with alternative objectives and (ii) 2D positional encodings. Our experiments show that these architectural choices can lead to improved spatial reasoning on several benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work done as part of the EleutherAI SOAR Program</p></details> |
| **[Clustering-Guided Spatial-Spectral Mamba for Hyperspectral Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16098v1)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although Mamba models greatly improve Hyperspectral Image (HSI) classification, they have critical challenges in terms defining efficient and adaptive token sequences for improve performance. This paper therefore presents CSSMamba (Clustering-guided Spatial-Spectral Mamba) framework to better address the challenges, with the following contributions. First, to achieve efficient and adaptive token sequences for improved Mamba performance, we integrate the clustering mechanism into a spatial Mamba architecture, leading to a cluster-guided spatial Mamba module (CSpaMamba) that reduces the Mamba sequence length and improves Mamba feature learning capability. Second, to improve the learning of both spatial and spectral information, we integrate the CSpaMamba module with a spectral mamba module (SpeMamba), leading to a complete clustering-guided spatial-spectral Mamba framework. Third, to further improve feature learning capability, we introduce an Attention-Driven Token Selection mechanism to optimize Mamba token sequencing. Last, to seamlessly integrate clustering into the Mamba model in a coherent manner, we design a Learnable Clustering Module that learns the cluster memberships in an adaptive manner. Experiments on the Pavia University, Indian Pines, and Liao-Ning 01 datasets demonstrate that CSSMamba achieves higher accuracy and better boundary preservation compared to state-of-the-art CNN, Transformer, and Mamba-based methods.</p></details> | 5 pages, 3 figures |
| **[DISPATCH -- Decentralized Informed Spatial Planning and Assignment of Tasks for Cooperative Heterogeneous Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17915v4)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial task allocation in systems such as multi-robot delivery or ride-sharing requires balancing efficiency with fair service across tasks. Greedy assignment policies that match each agent to its highest-preference or lowest-cost task can maximize efficiency but often create inequities: some tasks receive disproportionately favorable service (e.g., shorter delays or better matches), while others face long waits or poor allocations. We study fairness in heterogeneous multi-agent systems where tasks vary in preference alignment and urgency. Most existing approaches either assume centralized coordination or largely ignore fairness under partial observability. Distinct from this prior work, we establish a connection between the Eisenberg-Gale (EG) equilibrium convex program and decentralized, partially observable multi-agent learning. Building on this connection, we develop two equilibrium-informed algorithms that integrate fairness and efficiency: (i) a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework, EG-MARL, whose training is guided by a centralized EG equilibrium assignment algorithm; and (ii) a stochastic online optimization mechanism that performs guided exploration and subset-based fair assignment as tasks are discovered. We evaluate on Multi-Agent Particle Environment (MPE) simulations across varying team sizes against centralized EG, Hungarian, and Min-Max distance baselines, and also present a Webots-based warehouse proof-of-concept with heterogeneous robots. Both methods preserve the fairness-efficiency balance of the EG solution under partial observability, with EG-MARL achieving near-centralized coordination and reduced travel distances, and the online mechanism enabling real-time allocation with competitive fairness.</p></details> |  |
| **[regTPS-KLE: A Novel Approach To Approximate A Gaussian Random Field for Bayesian Spatial Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04256v2)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gaussian random field is a ubiquitous model for spatial phenomena in diverse scientific disciplines. Its approximation is often crucial for computational feasibility in simulation, inference, and uncertainty quantification. The Karhunen-Loève Expansion provides a theoretically optimal basis for representing a Gaussian random field as a sum of deterministic orthonormal functions weighted by uncorrelated random variables. While this is a well-established method for dimension reduction and approximation of (spatial) stochastic processes, its practical application depends on the explicit or implicit definition of the covariance structure. In this work, we propose a novel approach, referred to as regTPS-KLE, for approximating a Gaussian random field by explicitly constructing its covariance via a regularized thin plate spline (TPS) kernel. Because TPS kernels are conditionally positive definite and lack a direct spectral decomposition, we formulate the covariance as the inverse of a regularized elliptic operator. To evaluate its statistical performance, we compare its predictive accuracy and computational efficiency with a Gaussian random field approximation constructed using the stochastic partial differential equations (SPDE) method and implemented within an MCMC algorithm. In simulation studies, the predictive differences between the SPDE and regTPS-KLE models were minimal when the spatial field was generated using Matèrn and exponential covariance functions, while regTPS-KLE models consistently outperformed the SPDE approach in terms of computational efficiency. In a real data application, regTPS-KLE exhibits superior predictive accuracy compared with SPDE models based on leave-one-out cross-validation while also achieving improved computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Assessing Situational and Spatial Awareness of VLMs with Synthetically Generated Video](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15780v1)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial reasoning in vision language models (VLMs) remains fragile when semantics hinge on subtle temporal or geometric cues. We introduce a synthetic benchmark that probes two complementary skills: situational awareness (recognizing whether an interaction is harmful or benign) and spatial awareness (tracking who does what to whom, and reasoning about relative positions and motion). Through minimal video pairs, we test three challenges: distinguishing violence from benign activity, binding assailant roles across viewpoints, and judging fine-grained trajectory alignment. While we evaluate recent VLMs in a training-free setting, the benchmark is applicable to any video classification model. Results show performance only slightly above chance across tasks. A simple aid, stable color cues, partly reduces assailant role confusions but does not resolve the underlying weakness. By releasing data and code, we aim to provide reproducible diagnostics and seed exploration of lightweight spatial priors to complement large-scale pretraining.</p></details> |  |
| **[AtomWorld: A Benchmark for Evaluating Spatial Reasoning in Large Language Models on Crystalline Materials](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04704v3)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at textual reasoning and are beginning to develop spatial understanding, prompting the question of whether these abilities can be combined for complex, domain-specific tasks. This question is essential in fields like materials science, where deep understanding of 3D atomic structures is fundamental. While initial studies have successfully applied LLMs to tasks involving pure crystal generation or coordinate understandings, a standardized benchmark to systematically evaluate their core reasoning abilities across diverse atomic structures has been notably absent. To address this gap, we introduce the AtomWorld benchmark to evaluate LLMs on tasks based in Crystallographic Information Files (CIFs), a standard structure representation format. These tasks, including structural editing, CIF perception, and property-guided modeling, reveal a critical limitation: current models, despite establishing promising baselines, consistently fail in structural understanding and spatial reasoning. Our experiments show that these models make frequent errors on structure modification tasks, and even in the basic CIF format understandings, potentially leading to cumulative errors in subsequent analysis and materials insights. By defining these standardized tasks, AtomWorld lays the ground for advancing LLMs toward robust atomic-scale modeling, crucial for accelerating materials research and automating scientific workflows.</p></details> |  |
| **[SAGE-FM: A lightweight and interpretable spatial transcriptomics foundation model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15504v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial transcriptomics enables spatial gene expression profiling, motivating computational models that capture spatially conditioned regulatory relationships. We introduce SAGE-FM, a lightweight spatial transcriptomics foundation model based on graph convolutional networks (GCNs) trained with a masked central spot prediction objective. Trained on 416 human Visium samples spanning 15 organs, SAGE-FM learns spatially coherent embeddings that robustly recover masked genes, with 91% of masked genes showing significant correlations (p < 0.05). The embeddings generated by SAGE-FM outperform MOFA and existing spatial transcriptomics methods in unsupervised clustering and preservation of biological heterogeneity. SAGE-FM generalizes to downstream tasks, enabling 81% accuracy in pathologist-defined spot annotation in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma and improving glioblastoma subtype prediction relative to MOFA. In silico perturbation experiments further demonstrate that the model captures directional ligand-receptor and upstream-downstream regulatory effects consistent with ground truth. These results demonstrate that simple, parameter-efficient GCNs can serve as biologically interpretable and spatially aware foundation models for large-scale spatial transcriptomics.</p></details> | 26 pages, 5 figures |
| **[The $α$--regression for compositional data: a unified framework for standard, spatially-lagged, spatial autoregressive and geographically-weighted regression models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12663v3)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Compositional data-vectors of non-negative components summing to unity-frequently arise in scientific applications where covariates influence the relative proportions of components, yet traditional regression approaches ace challenges regarding the unit-sum constraint and zero values. This paper revisits the $α$--regression framework, which uses a flexible power transformation parameterized by $α$ to interpolate between raw data analysis and log-ratio methods, naturally handling zeros without imputation while allowing data-driven transformation selection. We formulate $α$--regression as a non-linear least squares problem, provide efficient estimation via the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, and derive marginal effects for interpretation. The framework is extended to spatial settings through two models: the $α$--spatially lagged X regression model, which incorporates spatial spillover effects via spatially lagged covariates with decomposition into direct and indirect effects, the $α$--spatially autoregressive regression model and the geographically weighted $α$--regression, which allows coefficients to vary spatially for capturing local relationships. Applications to two real data sets illustrate the performance of the models and showcase that spatial extensions capture the spatial dependence and improve the predictive performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[SpatialV2A: Visual-Guided High-fidelity Spatial Audio Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15017v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While video-to-audio generation has achieved remarkable progress in semantic and temporal alignment, most existing studies focus solely on these aspects, paying limited attention to the spatial perception and immersive quality of the synthesized audio. This limitation stems largely from current models' reliance on mono audio datasets, which lack the binaural spatial information needed to learn visual-to-spatial audio mappings. To address this gap, we introduce two key contributions: we construct BinauralVGGSound, the first large-scale video-binaural audio dataset designed to support spatially aware video-to-audio generation; and we propose a end-to-end spatial audio generation framework guided by visual cues, which explicitly models spatial features. Our framework incorporates a visual-guided audio spatialization module that ensures the generated audio exhibits realistic spatial attributes and layered spatial depth while maintaining semantic and temporal alignment. Experiments show that our approach substantially outperforms state-of-the-art models in spatial fidelity and delivers a more immersive auditory experience, without sacrificing temporal or semantic consistency. All datasets, code, and model checkpoints will be publicly released to facilitate future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Global-local shrinkage priors for modeling random effects in multivariate spatial small area estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14752v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Small area estimation (SAE) plays a central role in survey statistics and epidemiology, providing reliable estimates for domains with limited sample sizes. The multivariate Fay-Herriot model has been extensively used for this purpose, because it enhances estimation accuracy by borrowing strength across multiple correlated variables. In this paper, we develop a Bayesian extension of the multivariate Fay-Herriot model that enables flexible, component-specific shrinkage of the random effects. The proposed approach employs global-local priors formulated through a sandwich mixture representation, allowing adaptive regularization of each element of the random-effect vectors. This construction yields greater robustness and prevents excessive shrinkage in areas exhibiting strong underlying signals. In addition, we incorporate spatial dependence into the model to account for geographical correlation across small areas. The resulting spatial multivariate framework simultaneously exploits cross-variable relationships and spatial structure, yielding improved estimation efficiency. The utility of the proposed method is demonstrated through simulation studies and an empirical application to real survey data.</p></details> | 39 pages, 10 figures |
| **[LRR-Bench: Left, Right or Rotate? Vision-Language models Still Struggle With Spatial Understanding Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20174v2)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world applications, such as autonomous driving and humanoid robot manipulation, require precise spatial perception. However, it remains underexplored how Vision-Language Models (VLMs) recognize spatial relationships and perceive spatial movement. In this work, we introduce a spatial evaluation pipeline and construct a corresponding benchmark. Specifically, we categorize spatial understanding into two main types: absolute spatial understanding, which involves querying the absolute spatial position (e.g., left, right) of an object within an image, and 3D spatial understanding, which includes movement and rotation. Notably, our dataset is entirely synthetic, enabling the generation of test samples at a low cost while also preventing dataset contamination. We conduct experiments on multiple state-of-the-art VLMs and observe that there is significant room for improvement in their spatial understanding abilities. Explicitly, in our experiments, humans achieve near-perfect performance on all tasks, whereas current VLMs attain human-level performance only on the two simplest tasks. For the remaining tasks, the performance of VLMs is distinctly lower than that of humans. In fact, the best-performing Vision-Language Models even achieve near-zero scores on multiple tasks. The dataset and code are available on https://github.com/kong13661/LRR-Bench.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatially Generalizable Mobile Manipulation via Adaptive Experience Selection and Dynamic Imagination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14649v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mobile Manipulation (MM) involves long-horizon decision-making over multi-stage compositions of heterogeneous skills, such as navigation and picking up objects. Despite recent progress, existing MM methods still face two key limitations: (i) low sample efficiency, due to ineffective use of redundant data generated during long-term MM interactions; and (ii) poor spatial generalization, as policies trained on specific tasks struggle to transfer to new spatial layouts without additional training. In this paper, we address these challenges through Adaptive Experience Selection (AES) and model-based dynamic imagination. In particular, AES makes MM agents pay more attention to critical experience fragments in long trajectories that affect task success, improving skill chain learning and mitigating skill forgetting. Based on AES, a Recurrent State-Space Model (RSSM) is introduced for Model-Predictive Forward Planning (MPFP) by capturing the coupled dynamics between the mobile base and the manipulator and imagining the dynamics of future manipulations. RSSM-based MPFP can reinforce MM skill learning on the current task while enabling effective generalization to new spatial layouts. Comparative studies across different experimental configurations demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing MM policies. Real-world experiments further validate the feasibility and practicality of our method.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Tool for Semantic-Aware Spatial Corpus Construction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01415v2)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial natural language interface to database systems provide non-expert users with convenient access to spatial data through natural language queries. However, the scarcity of high-quality spatial natural language query corpora limits the performance of such systems. Existing methods rely on manual knowledge base construction and template-based dynamic generation, which suffer from low construction efficiency and unstable corpus quality. This paper presents semantic-aware spatial corpus construction (SSCC), a tool designed for constructing high-quality spatial natural language query and executable language query pair corpora. SSCC consists of two core modules: (i) a knowledge base construction module based on spatial relations, which extracts and determines spatial relations from datasets, and (ii) a template-augmented query pair corpus generation module, which produces query pairs via template matching and parameter substitution. The tool ensures geometric consistency and adherence to spatial logic in the generated spatial relations. Experimental results demonstrate that SSCC achieves (i) a 53x efficiency improvement for knowledge base construction and (ii) a 2.5x effectiveness improvement for query pair corpus. SSCC provides high-quality corpus support for spatial natural language interface training, substantially reducing both time and labor costs in corpus construction.</p></details> |  |

A Comparative Study of AR X-Ray vs. 2D Minimap](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14316v3)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and indoor sensing increasingly support decision-making in spatial environments. However, traditional visualization methods impose a substantial mental workload when viewers translate this digital information into real-world spaces, leading to inappropriate reliance on AI. Embedded visualizations in Augmented Reality (AR), by integrating information into physical environments, may reduce this workload and foster more appropriate reliance on AI. To assess this, we conducted an empirical study (N = 32) comparing an AR embedded visualization (X-ray) and 2D Minimap in AI-assisted, time-critical spatial target selection tasks. Surprisingly, evidence shows that the embedded visualization led to greater inappropriate reliance on AI, primarily as over-reliance, due to factors like perceptual challenges, visual proximity illusions, and highly realistic visual representations. Nonetheless, the embedded visualization demonstrated benefits in spatial mapping. We conclude by discussing empirical insights, design implications, and directions for future research on human-AI collaborative decision in AR.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 10 figures, Accepted for publication in CHI'26, Barcelona, Spain, April 13 - 17, 2026; CHI '26: ACM CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems</p></details> |
| **[PAS-Mamba: Phase-Amplitude-Spatial State Space Model for MRI Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14530v1)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Joint feature modeling in both the spatial and frequency domains has become a mainstream approach in MRI reconstruction. However, existing methods generally treat the frequency domain as a whole, neglecting the differences in the information carried by its internal components. According to Fourier transform theory, phase and amplitude represent different types of information in the image. Our spectrum swapping experiments show that magnitude mainly reflects pixel-level intensity, while phase predominantly governs image structure. To prevent interference between phase and magnitude feature learning caused by unified frequency-domain modeling, we propose the Phase-Amplitude-Spatial State Space Model (PAS-Mamba) for MRI Reconstruction, a framework that decouples phase and magnitude modeling in the frequency domain and combines it with image-domain features for better reconstruction. In the image domain, LocalMamba preserves spatial locality to sharpen fine anatomical details. In frequency domain, we disentangle amplitude and phase into two specialized branches to avoid representational coupling. To respect the concentric geometry of frequency information, we propose Circular Frequency Domain Scanning (CFDS) to serialize features from low to high frequencies. Finally, a Dual-Domain Complementary Fusion Module (DDCFM) adaptively fuses amplitude phase representations and enables bidirectional exchange between frequency and image domains, delivering superior reconstruction. Extensive experiments on the IXI and fastMRI knee datasets show that PAS-Mamba consistently outperforms state of the art reconstruction methods.</p></details> |  |

However, they still struggle to properly render the spatial relationships described in text prompts. To address the lack of spatial information in T2I generations, existing methods typically use external network conditioning and predefined layouts, resulting in higher computational costs and reduced flexibility. Our approach builds upon a curated dataset of spatially explicit prompts, meticulously extracted and synthesized from LAION-400M to ensure precise alignment between textual descriptions and spatial layouts. Alongside this dataset, we present ESPLoRA, a flexible fine-tuning framework based on Low-Rank Adaptation, specifically designed to enhance spatial consistency in generative models without increasing generation time or compromising the quality of the outputs. In addition to ESPLoRA, we propose refined evaluation metrics grounded in geometric constraints, capturing 3D spatial relations such as "in front of" or "behind". These metrics also expose spatial biases in T2I models which, even when not fully mitigated, can be strategically exploited by our TORE algorithm to further improve the spatial consistency of generated images. Our method outperforms CoMPaSS, the current baseline framework, on spatial consistency benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[CityCube: Benchmarking Cross-view Spatial Reasoning on Vision-Language Models in Urban Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14339v1)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-view spatial reasoning is essential for embodied AI, underpinning spatial understanding, mental simulation and planning in complex environments. Existing benchmarks primarily emphasize indoor or street settings, overlooking the unique challenges of open-ended urban spaces characterized by rich semantics, complex geometries, and view variations. To address this, we introduce CityCube, a systematic benchmark designed to probe cross-view reasoning capabilities of current VLMs in urban settings. CityCube integrates four viewpoint dynamics to mimic camera movements and spans a wide spectrum of perspectives from multiple platforms, e.g., vehicles, drones and satellites. For a comprehensive assessment, it features 5,022 meticulously annotated multi-view QA pairs categorized into five cognitive dimensions and three spatial relation expressions. A comprehensive evaluation of 33 VLMs reveals a significant performance disparity with humans: even large-scale models struggle to exceed 54.1% accuracy, remaining 34.2% below human performance. By contrast, small-scale fine-tuned VLMs achieve over 60.0% accuracy, highlighting the necessity of our benchmark. Further analyses indicate the task correlations and fundamental cognitive disparity between VLMs and human-like reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[GeoSurDepth: Harnessing Foundation Model for Spatial Geometry Consistency-Oriented Self-Supervised Surround-View Depth Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05839v2)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate surround-view depth estimation provides a competitive alternative to laser-based sensors and is essential for 3D scene understanding in autonomous driving. While empirical studies have proposed various approaches that primarily focus on enforcing cross-view constraints at photometric level, few explicitly exploit the rich geometric structure inherent in both monocular and surround-view setting. In this work, we propose GeoSurDepth, a framework that leverages geometry consistency as the primary cue for surround-view depth estimation. Concretely, we utilize vision foundation models as pseudo geometry priors and feature representation enhancement tool to guide the network to maintain surface normal consistency in spatial 3D space and regularize object- and texture-consistent depth estimation in 2D. In addition, we introduce a novel view synthesis pipeline where 2D-3D lifting is achieved with dense depth reconstructed via spatial warping, encouraging additional photometric supervision across temporal and spatial contexts, and compensating for the limitations of target-view image reconstruction. Finally, a newly-proposed adaptive joint motion learning strategy enables the network to adaptively emphasize informative spatial geometry cues for improved motion reasoning. Extensive experiments on KITTI, DDAD and nuScenes demonstrate that GeoSurDepth achieves SoTA performance, validating the effectiveness of our approach. Our framework highlights the importance of exploiting geometry coherence and consistency for robust self-supervised depth estimation.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Distributed Spatial Data Warehouse for AIS Data (DIPAAL)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13795v1)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AIS data from ships is excellent for analyzing single-ship movements and monitoring all ships within a specific area. However, the AIS data needs to be cleaned, processed, and stored before being usable. This paper presents a system consisting of an efficient and modular ETL process for loading AIS data, as well as a distributed spatial data warehouse storing the trajectories of ships. To efficiently analyze a large set of ships, a raster approach to querying the AIS data is proposed. A spatially partitioned data warehouse with a granularized cell representation and heatmap presentation is designed, developed, and evaluated. Currently the data warehouse stores ~312 million kilometers of ship trajectories and more than +8 billion rows in the largest table. It is found that searching the cell representation is faster than searching the trajectory representation. Further, we show that the spatially divided shards enable a consistently good scale-up for both cell and heatmap analytics in large areas, ranging between 354% to 1164% with a 5x increase in workers</p></details> |  |

Mainstream approaches based on modality-invariant and modality-specific factorization or on complex fusion still rely on spatiotemporal mixed modeling. This ignores spatiotemporal heterogeneity, leading to spatiotemporal information asymmetry and thus limited performance. Hence, we propose TSDA, Temporal-Spatial Decouple before Act, which explicitly decouples each modality into temporal dynamics and spatial structural context before any interaction. For every modality, a temporal encoder and a spatial encoder project signals into separate temporal and spatial body. Factor-Consistent Cross-Modal Alignment then aligns temporal features only with their temporal counterparts across modalities, and spatial features only with their spatial counterparts. Factor specific supervision and decorrelation regularization reduce cross factor leakage while preserving complementarity. A Gated Recouple module subsequently recouples the aligned streams for task. Extensive experiments show that TSDA outperforms baselines. Ablation analysis studies confirm the necessity and interpretability of the design.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This study has been accepted by IEEE ICASSP2026</p></details> |

However, the global organization of such intra-urban centers remains poorly understood due to the lack of consistent, comparable data. Here we develop a scalable geospatial framework to identify intra-urban activity centers worldwide using nighttime light observations. Applying this approach to more than 9,500 cities, we construct a high-resolution global dataset of over 15,000 centers. We uncover a striking regularity: despite vast differences in city size, regional development, and population density, the built-up area associated with individual centers remains remarkably consistent. Across cities, total urban area scales proportionally with the number of centers, yielding a stable mean spatial footprint. This regularity holds at the micro-scale, where Voronoi-based service areas exhibit a characteristic size that is persistent across countries and independent of local population concentration. As a geometric consequence, this polycentric multiplication maintains stable average distances to the nearest center as cities expand, preventing the accessibility decay inherent in monocentric growth. These findings reveal a universal organizing principle whereby urban expansion is accommodated through the replication of activity centers with a consistent spatial extent, providing a new empirical foundation for understanding the nature of urban growth.</p></details> |  |

However, to meet emerging demands such as high-frequency operation, wide bandwidths, co-existence, integrated sensing, and resilience to dynamic interference, future systems must exhibit both scalability and spectral agility. These requirements place increasing pressure on the underlying processing hardware to be both efficient and reconfigurable. This paper proposes a custom-designed spatial array architecture that serves as a reconfigurable, general-purpose core optimized for a class of wireless kernels that commonly arise in diverse communications and sensing tasks. The proposed spatial array is evaluated against specialized cores for each kernel using High-Level Synthesis (HLS). Both the reconfigurable and specialized designs are synthesized in a 32 nm process to assess latency, throughput, area, and power in realistic processes. The results identify conditions under which general-purpose systolic architectures can approach the efficiency of specialized cores, thereby paving the way toward more scalable and agile systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted and presented in 2025 Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers</p></details> |

Object detectors may miss targets or return multiple plausible detections, and simple geometric tests can become ambiguous in borderline cases. Spatial evaluation is naturally a selective prediction problem, the checker may abstain when evidence is weak and report confidence so that results can be interpreted as a risk coverage tradeoff rather than a single score. We introduce SpatialBench-UC, a small, reproducible benchmark for pairwise spatial relations. The benchmark contains 200 prompts (50 object pairs times 4 relations) grouped into 100 counterfactual pairs obtained by swapping object roles. We release a benchmark package, versioned prompts, pinned configs, per-sample checker outputs, and report tables, enabling reproducible and auditable comparisons across models. We also include a lightweight human audit used to calibrate the checker's abstention margin and confidence threshold. We evaluate three baselines, Stable Diffusion 1.5, SD 1.5 BoxDiff, and SD 1.4 GLIGEN. The checker reports pass rate and coverage as well as conditional pass rates on decided samples. The results show that grounding methods substantially improve both pass rate and coverage, while abstention remains a dominant factor due mainly to missing detections.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, includes figures and tables</p></details> |
| **[A uniformity principle for spatial matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13426v1)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Platforms matching spatially distributed supply to demand face a fundamental design choice: given a fixed total budget of service range, how should it be allocated across supply nodes ex ante, i.e. before supply and demand locations are realized, to maximize fulfilled demand? We model this problem using bipartite random geometric graphs where $n$ supply and $m$ demand nodes are uniformly distributed on $[0,1]^k$ ($k \ge 1$), and edges form when demand falls within a supply node's service region, the volume of which is determined by its service range. Since each supply node serves at most one demand, platform performance is determined by the expected size of a maximum matching. We establish a uniformity principle: whenever one service range allocation is more uniform than the other, the more uniform allocation yields a larger expected matching. This principle emerges from diminishing marginal returns to range expanding service range, and limited interference between supply nodes due to bounded ranges naturally fragmenting the graph. For $k=1$, we further characterize the expected matching size through a Markov chain embedding and derive closed-form expressions for special cases. Our results provide theoretical guidance for optimizing service range allocation and designing incentive structures in ride-hailing, on-demand labor markets, and drone delivery networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Two-Stage Bayesian Framework for Multi-Fidelity Online Updating of Spatial Fragility Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13396v1)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses a long-standing gap in natural hazard modeling by unifying physics-based fragility functions with real-time post-disaster observations. It introduces a Bayesian framework that continuously refines regional vulnerability estimates as new data emerges. The framework reformulates physics-informed fragility estimates into a Probit-Normal (PN) representation that captures aleatory variability and epistemic uncertainty in an analytically tractable form. Stage 1 performs local Bayesian updating by moment-matching PN marginals to Beta surrogates that preserve their probability shapes, enabling conjugate Beta-Bernoulli updates with soft, multi-fidelity observations. Fidelity weights encode source reliability, and the resulting Beta posteriors are re-projected into PN form, producing heteroscedastic fragility estimates whose variances reflect data quality and coverage. Stage 2 assimilates these heteroscedastic observations within a probit-warped Gaussian Process (GP), which propagates information from high-fidelity sites to low-fidelity and unobserved regions through a composite kernel that links space, archetypes, and correlated damage states. The framework is applied to the 2011 Joplin tornado, where wind-field priors and computer-vision damage assessments are fused under varying assumptions about tornado width, sampling strategy, and observation completeness. Results show that the method corrects biased priors, propagates information spatially, and produces uncertainty-aware exceedance probabilities that support real-time situational awareness.</p></details> | <details><summary>46 pa...</summary><p>46 pages, 14 figures, 2 tables.

| **[MultiST: A Cross-Attention-Based Multimodal Model for Spatial Transcriptomic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13331v1)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial transcriptomics (ST) enables transcriptome-wide profiling while preserving the spatial context of tissues, offering unprecedented opportunities to study tissue organization and cell-cell interactions in situ. Despite recent advances, existing methods often lack effective integration of histological morphology with molecular profiles, relying on shallow fusion strategies or omitting tissue images altogether, which limits their ability to resolve ambiguous spatial domain boundaries. To address this challenge, we propose MultiST, a unified multimodal framework that jointly models spatial topology, gene expression, and tissue morphology through cross-attention-based fusion. MultiST employs graph-based gene encoders with adversarial alignment to learn robust spatial representations, while integrating color-normalized histological features to capture molecular-morphological dependencies and refine domain boundaries. We evaluated the proposed method on 13 diverse ST datasets spanning two organs, including human brain cortex and breast cancer tissue. MultiST yields spatial domains with clearer and more coherent boundaries than existing methods, leading to more stable pseudotime trajectories and more biologically interpretable cell-cell interaction patterns. The MultiST framework and source code are available at https://github.com/LabJunBMI/MultiST.git.</p></details> |  |
| **[CausalSpatial: A Benchmark for Object-Centric Causal Spatial Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13304v1)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans can look at a static scene and instantly predict what happens next -- will moving this object cause a collision? We call this ability Causal Spatial Reasoning. However, current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) cannot do this, as they remain largely restricted to static spatial perception, struggling to answer "what-if" questions in a 3D scene. We introduce CausalSpatial, a diagnostic benchmark evaluating whether models can anticipate consequences of object motions across four tasks: Collision, Compatibility, Occlusion, and Trajectory. Results expose a severe gap: humans score 84% while GPT-5 achieves only 54%. Why do MLLMs fail? Our analysis uncovers a fundamental deficiency: models over-rely on textual chain-of-thought reasoning that drifts from visual evidence, producing fluent but spatially ungrounded hallucinations. To address this, we propose the Causal Object World model (COW), a framework that externalizes the simulation process by generating videos of hypothetical dynamics. With explicit visual cues of causality, COW enables models to ground their reasoning in physical reality rather than linguistic priors.

While recent graph-based methods modeling cell-cell interactions have improved clustering accuracy, they remain limited in two key aspects: (i) reliance on local aggregation in static graphs often fails to capture robust global topological structures (e.g., loops and voids) and is vulnerable to noisy edges; and (ii) dimensionality reduction techniques frequently neglect spatial coherence, causing physically adjacent spots to be erroneously separated in the latent space. To overcome these challenges, we propose SPHENIC, a Spatial Persistent Homology-Enhanced Neighborhood Integrative Clustering method. Specifically, it explicitly incorporates topology-invariant features into the clustering network to ensure robust representation learning against noise. Furthermore, we design a dual-regularized optimization module that imposes spatial constraints alongside distributional optimization, ensuring that the embedding space preserves the physical proximity of cells. Extensive experiments on 11 benchmark datasets demonstrate that SPHENIC outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 4.19%-9.14%, validating its superiority in characterizing complex tissue architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Listening tests are currently the standard but remain costly in terms of time and resources. Several models predicting subjective scores have been proposed, but they do not generalize well to real-world signals. In this paper, we propose QASTAnet (Quality Assessment for SpaTial Audio network), a new metric based on a deep neural network, specialized on spatial audio (ambisonics and binaural). As training data is scarce, we aim for the model to be trainable with a small amount of data. To do so, we propose to rely on expert modeling of the low-level auditory system and use a neurnal network to model the high-level cognitive function of the quality judgement. We compare its performance to two reference metrics on a wide range of content types (speech, music, ambiance, anechoic, reverberated) and focusing on codec artifacts. Results demonstrate that QASTAnet overcomes the aforementioned limitations of the existing methods. The strong correlation between the proposed metric prediction and subjective scores makes it a good candidate for comparing codecs in their development.</p></details> | <details><summary>Minor...</summary><p>Minor typo corrections, figure updates for clarity, add two references, no modifications of the results and their interpretation</p></details> |
| **[Fine-grained spatial-temporal perception for gas leak segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00295v2)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gas leaks pose significant risks to human health and the environment. Despite long-standing concerns, there are limited methods that can efficiently and accurately detect and segment leaks due to their concealed appearance and random shapes. In this paper, we propose a Fine-grained Spatial-Temporal Perception (FGSTP) algorithm for gas leak segmentation. FGSTP captures critical motion clues across frames and integrates them with refined object features in an end-to-end network. Specifically, we first construct a correlation volume to capture motion information between consecutive frames. Then, the fine-grained perception progressively refines the object-level features using previous outputs. Finally, a decoder is employed to optimize boundary segmentation. Because there is no highly precise labeled dataset for gas leak segmentation, we manually label a gas leak video dataset, GasVid. Experimental results on GasVid demonstrate that our model excels in segmenting non-rigid objects such as gas leaks, generating the most accurate mask compared to other state-of-the-art (SOTA) models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 2025 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)</p></details> |

While recent vision large models (VLMs) excel at visual understanding, they remain fundamentally 2D perceivers and struggle with genuine 3D reasoning. We introduce Think3D, a framework that enables VLM agents to think with 3D space. By leveraging 3D reconstruction models that recover point clouds and camera poses from images or videos, Think3D allows the agent to actively manipulate space through camera-based operations and ego/global-view switching, transforming spatial reasoning into an interactive 3D chain-of-thought process. Without additional training, Think3D significantly improves the spatial reasoning performance of advanced models such as GPT-4.1 and Gemini 2.5 Pro, yielding average gains of +7.8% on BLINK Multi-view and MindCube, and +4.7% on VSI-Bench. We further show that smaller models, which struggle with spatial exploration, benefit significantly from a reinforcement learning policy that enables the model to select informative viewpoints and operations. With RL, the benefit from tool usage increases from +0.7% to +6.8%. Our findings demonstrate that training-free, tool-augmented spatial exploration is a viable path toward more flexible and human-like 3D reasoning in multimodal agents, establishing a new dimension of multimodal intelligence.

Yet it is still unclear whether such understanding is truly acquired, and if so, through what mechanisms. We present a controllable 1D image-text testbed to probe how left-right relational understanding emerges in Transformer-based vision and text encoders trained with a CLIP-style contrastive objective. We train lightweight Transformer-based vision and text encoders end-to-end on paired descriptions of one- and two-object scenes and evaluate generalization to unseen object pairs while systematically varying label and layout diversity. We find that contrastive training learns left-right relations and that label diversity, more than layout diversity, is the primary driver of generalization in this setting. To gain the mechanistic understanding, we perform an attention decomposition and show that interactions between positional and token embeddings induce a horizontal attention gradient that breaks left-right symmetry in the encoders; ablating this contribution substantially reduces left-right discrimination. Our results provide a mechanistic insight of when and how CLIP-style models acquire relational competence.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose FocusNav, a spatial selective attention framework that adaptively modulates the robot's perceptual field based on navigational intent and real-time stability. FocusNav features a Waypoint-Guided Spatial Cross-Attention (WGSCA) mechanism that anchors environmental feature aggregation to a sequence of predicted collision-free waypoints, ensuring task-relevant perception along the planned trajectory. To enhance robustness in complex terrains, the Stability-Aware Selective Gating (SASG) module autonomously truncates distal information when detecting instability, compelling the policy to prioritize immediate foothold safety. Extensive experiments on the Unitree G1 humanoid robot demonstrate that FocusNav significantly improves navigation success rates in challenging scenarios, outperforming baselines in both collision avoidance and motion stability, achieving robust navigation in dynamic and complex environments.</p></details> | 12 pages, 11 figures |

Focusing on complex continuous environments, we categorize key perceptual bottlenecks into three spatial challenges: door interaction,multi-room navigation, and ambiguous instruction execution, where existing methods consistently suffer high failure rates. We present Spatial-VLN, a perception-guided exploration framework designed to overcome these challenges. The framework consists of two main modules. The Spatial Perception Enhancement (SPE) module integrates panoramic filtering with specialized door and region experts to produce spatially coherent, cross-view consistent perceptual representations. Building on this foundation, our Explored Multi-expert Reasoning (EMR) module uses parallel LLM experts to address waypoint-level semantics and region-level spatial transitions. When discrepancies arise between expert predictions, a query-and-explore mechanism is activated, prompting the agent to actively probe critical areas and resolve perceptual ambiguities. Experiments on VLN-CE demonstrate that Spatial VLN achieves state-of-the-art performance using only low-cost LLMs. Furthermore, to validate real-world applicability, we introduce a value-based waypoint sampling strategy that effectively bridges the Sim2Real gap. Extensive real-world evaluations confirm that our framework delivers superior generalization and robustness in complex environments.

The graph bandit problem extends the MAB setting by introducing spatial constraints, yet quantum approaches remain limited. We propose a quantum algorithmic framework for best-arm identification in graph bandits, termed Quantum Spatial Best-Arm Identification (QSBAI), which is applicable to general graph structures. The method employs quantum walks to encode superpositions over graph-constrained actions, extending amplitude amplification and generalizing the Quantum BAI algorithm via Szegedy's walk framework. This establishes a link between Grover-type search and reinforcement learning tasks with structural restrictions. We focus our theoretical analysis on complete and bipartite graphs, deriving the maximal success probability of identifying the best arm and the time step at which it is achieved. Our results highlight the potential of quantum walks to accelerate exploration in constrained environments and extend the applicability of quantum algorithms for decision-making.</p></details> | 15 pages, 8 figures |

However, existing detection methods generally suffer from overfitting to specific source models, leading to significant performance degradation when confronted with unseen generative architectures. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a cross-model detection framework called S 2 F-Net, whose core lies in exploring and leveraging the inherent spectral discrepancies between real and synthetic textures. Considering that upsampling operations leave unique and distinguishable frequency fingerprints in both texture-poor and texture-rich regions, we focus our research on the detection of frequency-domain artifacts, aiming to fundamentally improve the generalization performance of the model. Specifically, we introduce a learnable frequency attention module that adaptively weights and enhances discriminative frequency bands by synergizing spatial texture analysis and spectral dependencies.On the AIGCDetectBenchmark, which includes 17 categories of generative models, S 2 F-Net achieves a detection accuracy of 90.49%, significantly outperforming various existing baseline methods in cross-domain detection scenarios.</p></details> | 27pages 9figures |

Current robustness testing methods require excessive computational resources through exhaustive frame-by-frame processing and full-image perturbations, proving impractical for large-scale deployments where massive image streams demand immediate processing. This paper presents DDSA (Dual-Domain Strategic Attack), a resource-efficient adversarial robustness testing framework that optimizes testing through temporal selectivity and spatial precision. We introduce a scenario-aware trigger function that identifies critical frames requiring robustness evaluation based on class priority and model uncertainty, and employ explainable AI techniques to locate influential pixel regions for targeted perturbation. Our dual-domain approach achieves substantial temporal-spatial resource conservation while maintaining attack effectiveness. The framework enables practical deployment of comprehensive adversarial robustness testing in resource-constrained real-time applications where computational efficiency directly impacts mission success.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint accepted by ICASSP 2026 with minor revisions</p></details> |

Building on our work~\cite{r15} that introduced a Clique Lovász Local Lemma (CLLL)-based design principle and a Moser--Tardos (MT)-type constructive approach, this work quantifies the size and structure of the feasible design space. Using the quantitative CLLL, we derive explicit lower bounds on the number of feasible edge-spreading and lifting assignments satisfying a given family of structure-avoidance constraints, and further obtain bounds on the number of non-equivalent solutions under row/column permutations. Moreover, via Rényi entropy bounds for the MT distribution, we provide a computable lower bound on the number of distinct solutions that the MT algorithm can output, giving a concrete diversity guarantee for randomized constructions. Specializations for eliminating 4-cycles yield closed-form bounds as functions of system parameters, offering a principled way to select the memory and lifting degree and to estimate the remaining search space.</p></details> | 10 pages |

As a result, recent work incorporates some 3D tasks (such as depth estimation) into VFM training. However, VFM performance remains inconsistent across other spatial tasks, raising the question of whether these models truly have spatial awareness or overfit to specific 3D objectives. To address this question, we introduce the Spatial Relation Recognition Task (SpaRRTa) benchmark, which evaluates the ability of VFMs to identify relative positions of objects in the image. Unlike traditional 3D objectives that focus on precise metric prediction (e.g., surface normal estimation), SpaRRTa probes a fundamental capability underpinning more advanced forms of human-like spatial understanding. SpaRRTa generates an arbitrary number of photorealistic images with diverse scenes and fully controllable object arrangements, along with freely accessible spatial annotations. Evaluating a range of state-of-the-art VFMs, we reveal significant disparities between their spatial reasoning abilities. Through our analysis, we provide insights into the mechanisms that support or hinder spatial awareness in modern VFMs. We hope that SpaRRTa will serve as a useful tool for guiding the development of future spatially aware visual models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page is available at https://sparrta.gmum.net/</p></details> |

Metric-CogMap provides a unified spatial representation by integrating a discrete grid for relational reasoning with a continuous, metric-scale representation for precise geometric understanding. Building upon the Metric-CogMap, Cog-CoT performs explicit geometric reasoning through deterministic operations, including vector operations, bounding-box distances, and occlusion-aware appearance order cues, producing interpretable inference traces grounded in 3D structure. Experimental results show that Map2Thought enables explainable 3D understanding, achieving 59.9% accuracy using only half the supervision, closely matching the 60.9% baseline trained with the full dataset. It consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 5.3%, 4.8%, and 4.0% under 10%, 25%, and 50% training subsets, respectively, on the VSI-Bench.</p></details> |  |
| **[Simultaneous and Proportional Finger Motion Decoding Using Spatial Features from High-Density Surface Electromyography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13870v3)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Restoring natural and intuitive hand function requires simultaneous and proportional control (SPC) of multiple degrees of freedom (DoFs). This study systematically evaluated the multichannel linear descriptors-based block field method (MLD-BFM) for continuous decoding of five finger-joint DoFs by leveraging the rich spatial information of high-density surface electromyography (HD sEMG). Twenty-one healthy participants performed dynamic sinusoidal finger movements while HD sEMG signals were recorded from the extensor digitorum communis (EDC) and flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) muscles. MLD-BFM extracted region-specific spatial features, including effective field strength ($Σ$), field-strength variation rate ($Φ$), and spatial complexity ($Ω$). Model performance was optimized (block size: $2 \times 2$; window: 0.15 s) and compared with conventional time-domain features and dimensionality reduction approaches when applied to multi-output regression models. MLD-BFM consistently achieved the highest $\mathrm{R}^2_{\mathrm{vw}}$ values across all models. The multilayer perceptron (MLP) combined with MLD-BFM yielded the best performance ($\mathrm{R}^2_{\mathrm{vw}} = 86.68\% \pm 0.33$). Time-domain features also showed strong predictive capability and were statistically comparable to MLD-BFM in some models, whereas dimensionality reduction techniques exhibited lower accuracy. Decoding accuracy was higher for the middle and ring fingers than for the thumb. Overall, MLD-BFM improved continuous finger movement decoding accuracy, underscoring the importance of taking advantage of the spatial richness of HD sEMG. These findings suggest that spatially structured features enhance SPC and provide practical guidance for designing robust, real-time, and responsive myoelectric interfaces.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, 13 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Although CNN has shown strong capability to extract semantics from raw pixels, its capacity to capture spatial relationships of pixels across rows and columns of an image is not fully explored. These relationships are important to learn semantic objects with strong shape priors but weak appearance coherences, such as traffic lanes, which are often occluded or not even painted on the road surface as shown in Fig. 1 (a). In this paper, we propose Spatial CNN (SCNN), which generalizes traditional deep layer-by-layer convolutions to slice-byslice convolutions within feature maps, thus enabling message passings between pixels across rows and columns in a layer. Such SCNN is particular suitable for long continuous shape structure or large objects, with strong spatial relationship but less appearance clues, such as traffic lanes, poles, and wall. We apply SCNN on a newly released very challenging traffic lane detection dataset and Cityscapse dataset. The results show that SCNN could learn the spatial relationship for structure output and significantly improves the performance. We show that SCNN outperforms the recurrent neural network (RNN) based ReNet and MRF+CNN (MRFNet) in the lane detection dataset by 8.7% and 4.6% respectively. Moreover, our SCNN won the 1st place on the TuSimple Benchmark Lane Detection Challenge, with an accuracy of 96.53%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2018</p></details> |

Although recent studies have led to the advent of deep learning methods using satellite imagery to predict height maps, these approaches often face a trade-off between data accessibility and spatial resolution. To overcome these limitations, we present SERA-H, an end-to-end model combining a super-resolution module (EDSR) and temporal attention encoding (UTAE). Trained under the supervision of high-density LiDAR data (ALS), our model generates 2.5 m resolution height maps from freely available Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 (10 m) time series data. Evaluated on an open-source benchmark dataset in France, SERA-H, with a MAE of 2.6 m and a coefficient of determination of 0.82, not only outperforms standard Sentinel-1/2 baselines but also achieves performance comparable to or better than methods relying on commercial very high-resolution imagery (SPOT-6/7, PlanetScope, Maxar). These results demonstrate that combining high-resolution supervision with the spatiotemporal information embedded in time series enables the reconstruction of details beyond the input sensors' native resolution. SERA-H opens the possibility of freely mapping forests with high revisit frequency, achieving accuracy comparable to that of costly commercial imagery.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 8 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

However, whereas latent space modeling paradigms have transformed image and video generation, similar approaches are more difficult for most dynamical systems. Such systems -- from chemical molecule structures to collective human behavior -- are described by interactions of entities, making them inherently linked to connectivity patterns, entity conservation, and the traceability of entities over time. Our approach, LaM-SLidE (Latent Space Modeling of Spatial Dynamical Systems via Linked Entities), bridges the gap between: (1) keeping the traceability of individual entities in a latent system representation, and (2) leveraging the efficiency and scalability of recent advances in image and video generation, where pre-trained encoder and decoder enable generative modeling directly in latent space. The core idea of LaM-SLidE is the introduction of identifier representations (IDs) that enable the retrieval of entity properties and entity composition from latent system representations, thus fostering traceability. Experimentally, across different domains, we show that LaM-SLidE performs favorably in terms of speed, accuracy, and generalizability.

For safe deployment in robotics and autonomous systems, we need to predict when to trust VLM spatial predictions rather than accepting all outputs. We propose a vision-based confidence estimation framework that validates VLM predictions through independent geometric verification using object detection. Unlike text-based approaches relying on self-assessment, our method fuses four signals via gradient boosting: geometric alignment between VLM claims and coordinates, spatial ambiguity from overlap, detection quality, and VLM internal uncertainty. We achieve 0.674 AUROC on BLIP-2 (34.0% improvement over text-based baselines) and 0.583 AUROC on CLIP (16.1% improvement), generalizing across generative and classification architectures. Our framework enables selective prediction: at 60% target accuracy, we achieve 61.9% coverage versus 27.6% baseline (2.2x improvement) on BLIP-2. Feature analysis reveals vision-based signals contribute 87.4% of model importance versus 12.7% from VLM confidence, validating that external geometric verification outperforms self-assessment. We demonstrate reliable scene graph construction where confidence-based pruning improves precision from 52.1% to 78.3% while retaining 68.2% of edges.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Federated Class-Incremental Learning via Spatial-Temporal Statistics Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01327v2)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Class-Incremental Learning (FCIL) enables Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) from distributed data. Existing FCIL methods typically integrate old knowledge preservation into local client training. However, these methods cannot avoid spatial-temporal client drift caused by data heterogeneity and often incur significant computational and communication overhead, limiting practical deployment. To address these challenges simultaneously, we propose a novel approach, Spatial-Temporal Statistics Aggregation (STSA), which provides a unified framework to aggregate feature statistics both spatially (across clients) and temporally (across stages). The aggregated feature statistics are unaffected by data heterogeneity and can be used to update the classifier in closed form at each stage. Additionally, we introduce STSA-E, a communication-efficient variant with theoretical guarantees, achieving similar performance to STSA-E with much lower communication overhead. Extensive experiments on three widely used FCIL datasets, with varying degrees of data heterogeneity, show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art FCIL methods in terms of performance, flexibility, and both communication and computation efficiency.

Unlike conventional covariance-based spatial models, CFSM represents spatial processes using a multiscale ensemble of local models. To ensure stable model training, larger-scale patterns that are easier to learn are modeled first, followed by smaller-scale patterns, with training terminated once the validation score stops improving. The training procedure, which is based on holdout validation, can be easily integrated with other machine learning algorithms, including random forests and neural networks. CFSM training is computationally efficient because it avoids explicit matrix inversion, which is a major computational bottleneck in conventional spatial Gaussian processes. Comparative Monte Carlo experiments demonstrated that the CFSM, as well as its integration with random forests, achieved superior predictive performance compared to existing models. Finally, we applied the proposed methods to an analysis of residential land prices in the Tokyo metropolitan area, Japan. The CFSM is implemented in an R package spCF (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/spCF/).</p></details> |  |

However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on single-step perception-to-judgment tasks, leaving scenarios requiring complex visual-spatial logical chains significantly underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce Video-MSR, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate Multi-hop Spatial Reasoning (MSR) in dynamic video scenarios. Video-MSR systematically probes MSR capabilities through four distinct tasks: Constrained Localization, Chain-based Reference Retrieval, Route Planning, and Counterfactual Physical Deduction. Our benchmark comprises 3,052 high-quality video instances with 4,993 question-answer pairs, constructed via a scalable, visually-grounded pipeline combining advanced model generation with rigorous human verification. Through a comprehensive evaluation of 20 state-of-the-art MLLMs, we uncover significant limitations, revealing that while models demonstrate proficiency in surface-level perception, they exhibit distinct performance drops in MSR tasks, frequently suffering from spatial disorientation and hallucination during multi-step deductions. To mitigate these shortcomings and empower models with stronger MSR capabilities, we further curate MSR-9K, a specialized instruction-tuning dataset, and fine-tune Qwen-VL, achieving a +7.82% absolute improvement on Video-MSR. Our results underscore the efficacy of multi-hop spatial instruction data and establish Video-MSR as a vital foundation for future research.

While mapping from feature space to input space aids in interpreting the former, existing approaches often rely on crude approximations. We propose using a conditional diffusion model - a pretrained high-fidelity diffusion model conditioned on spatially resolved feature maps - to learn such a mapping in a probabilistic manner. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach across various pretrained image classifiers from CNNs to ViTs, showing excellent reconstruction capabilities. Through qualitative comparisons and robustness analysis, we validate our method and showcase possible applications, such as the visualization of concept steering in input space or investigations of the composite nature of the feature space. This approach has broad potential for improving feature space understanding in computer vision models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Versi...</summary><p>Version published by Transactions on Machine Learning Research in 2025 (TMLR ISSN 2835-8856) at https://openreview.net/forum?id=UtE1YnPNgZ. 32 pages, 27 figures.

| **[Enhancing Spatial Reasoning in Large Language Models for Metal-Organic Frameworks Structure Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09285v1)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are porous crystalline materials with broad applications such as carbon capture and drug delivery, yet accurately predicting their 3D structures remains a significant challenge. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating crystals, their application to MOFs is hindered by MOFs' high atomic complexity. Inspired by the success of block-wise paradigms in deep generative models, we pioneer the use of LLMs in this domain by introducing MOF-LLM, the first LLM framework specifically adapted for block-level MOF structure prediction. To effectively harness LLMs for this modular assembly task, our training paradigm integrates spatial-aware continual pre-training (CPT), structural supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and matching-driven reinforcement learning (RL). By incorporating explicit spatial priors and optimizing structural stability via Soft Adaptive Policy Optimization (SAPO), our approach substantially enhances the spatial reasoning capability of a Qwen-3 8B model for accurate MOF structure prediction. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that MOF-LLM outperforms state-of-the-art denoising-based and LLM-based methods while exhibiting superior sampling efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Universal Few-Shot Spatial Control for Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07530v2)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial conditioning in pretrained text-to-image diffusion models has significantly improved fine-grained control over the structure of generated images. However, existing control adapters exhibit limited adaptability and incur high training costs when encountering novel spatial control conditions that differ substantially from the training tasks. To address this limitation, we propose Universal Few-Shot Control (UFC), a versatile few-shot control adapter capable of generalizing to novel spatial conditions. Given a few image-condition pairs of an unseen task and a query condition, UFC leverages the analogy between query and support conditions to construct task-specific control features, instantiated by a matching mechanism and an update on a small set of task-specific parameters. Experiments on six novel spatial control tasks show that UFC, fine-tuned with only 30 annotated examples of novel tasks, achieves fine-grained control consistent with the spatial conditions. Notably, when fine-tuned with 0.1% of the full training data, UFC achieves competitive performance with the fully supervised baselines in various control tasks. We also show that UFC is applicable agnostically to various diffusion backbones and demonstrate its effectiveness on both UNet and DiT architectures.

Our investigations reveal that these costs primarily stem from the static inference paradigm, which inevitably introduces redundant computation in certain diffusion timesteps and spatial regions. To overcome this inefficiency, we propose Dynamic Diffusion Transformer (DyDiT), an architecture that dynamically adjusts its computation along both timestep and spatial dimensions. Building on these designs, we present an extended version, DyDiT++, with improvements in three key aspects. First, it extends the generation mechanism of DyDiT beyond diffusion to flow matching, demonstrating that our method can also accelerate flow-matching-based generation, enhancing its versatility. Furthermore, we enhance DyDiT to tackle more complex visual generation tasks, including video generation and text-to-image generation, thereby broadening its real-world applications. Finally, to address the high cost of full fine-tuning and democratize technology access, we investigate the feasibility of training DyDiT in a parameter-efficient manner and introduce timestep-based dynamic LoRA (TD-LoRA). Extensive experiments on diverse visual generation models, including DiT, SiT, Latte, and FLUX, demonstrate the effectiveness of DyDiT++. Remarkably, with <3% additional fine-tuning iterations, our approach reduces the FLOPs of DiT-XL by 51%, yielding 1.73x realistic speedup on hardware, and achieves a competitive FID score of 2.07 on ImageNet.

| **[Changes in Visual Attention Patterns for Detection Tasks due to Dependencies on Signal and Background Spatial Frequencies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09008v1)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We aim to investigate the impact of image and signal properties on visual attention mechanisms during a signal detection task in digital images. The application of insight yielded from this work spans many areas of digital imaging where signal or pattern recognition is involved in complex heterogenous background. We used simulated tomographic breast images as the platform to investigate this question. While radiologists are highly effective at analyzing medical images to detect and diagnose diseases, misdiagnosis still occurs. We selected digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) images as a sample medical images with different breast densities and structures using digital breast phantoms (Bakic and XCAT). Two types of lesions (with distinct spatial frequency properties) were randomly inserted in the phantoms during projections to generate abnormal cases. Six human observers participated in observer study designed for a locating and detection of an 3-mm sphere lesion and 6-mm spicule lesion in reconstructed in-plane DBT slices. We collected eye-gaze data to estimate gaze metrics and to examine differences in visual attention mechanisms. We found that detection performance in complex visual environments is strongly constrained by later perceptual stages, with decision failures accounting for the largest proportion of errors. Signal detectability is jointly influenced by both target morphology and background complexity, revealing a critical interaction between local signal features and global anatomical noise. Increased fixation duration on spiculated lesions suggests that visual attention is differentially engaged depending on background and signal spatial frequency dependencies.</p></details> | 21 pages, 7 images |

Textual resources carry unique information that can be used in complementarity with geospatial data sources, thus providing insights at the local scale into environmental conditions and properties hidden from more traditional data sources. Leveraging textual information in a spatial context presents several challenges. First, the contribution of textual data remains poorly defined in an ecological context, and it is unclear for which tasks it should be incorporated. Unlike ubiquitous satellite imagery or environmental covariates, the availability of textual data is sparse and irregular; its integration with geospatial data is not straightforward. In response to these challenges, this work proposes an attention-based approach that combines aerial imagery and geolocated text within a spatial neighbourhood, i.e. integrating contributions from several nearby observations. Our approach combines vision and text representations with a geolocation encoding, with an attention-based module that dynamically selects spatial neighbours that are useful for predictive tasks.The proposed approach is applied to the EcoWikiRS dataset, which combines high-resolution aerial imagery with sentences extracted from Wikipedia describing local environmental conditions across Switzerland. Our model is evaluated on the task of predicting 103 environmental variables from the SWECO25 data cube. Our approach consistently outperforms single-location or unimodal, i.e. image-only or text-only, baselines. When analysing variables by thematic groups, results show a significant improvement in performance for climatic, edaphic, population and land use/land cover variables, underscoring the benefit of including the spatial context when combining text and image data.</p></details> | submitted |

The effective reproduction number, defined as the expected number of secondary infections stemming from one contaminated individual, is a state-of-the-art indicator quantifying the epidemic intensity. Numerous estimators have been developed to precisely track the reproduction number temporal evolution. Yet, COVID-19 pandemic surveillance raised unprecedented challenges due to the poor quality of worldwide reported infection counts. When monitoring the epidemic in different territories simultaneously, leveraging the spatial structure of data significantly enhances both the accuracy and robustness of reproduction number estimates. However, this requires a good estimate of the spatial structure. To tackle this major limitation, the present work proposes a joint estimator of the reproduction number and connectivity structure. The procedure is assessed through intensive numerical simulations on carefully designed synthetic data and illustrated on real COVID-19 spatiotemporal infection counts.</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 figures |

LiDAR sensors capture 3D in real time, but produce sparce point clouds. Therefore, this paper presents a high-speed LiDAR point cloud densification method to generate dense 3D scene with minimal latency, addressing the need for on-the-fly depth completion while maintaining real-time performance. Our approach combines multiple LiDAR inputs with high-resolution color images and applies a joint bilateral filtering strategy implemented through a convolutional neural network architecture. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method produces dense depth maps at full HD resolution in real time (30 fps), which is over 15x faster than a recent training-based depth completion approach. The resulting dense point clouds exhibit accurate geometry without multiview inconsistencies or ghosting artifacts.</p></details> |  |

This study introduces a novel computational framework that employs spatial transcriptomics (ST) to create an explainable machine learning model for IBD classification. We analyzed ST data from the colonic mucosa of healthy controls (HC), UC, and CD patients. Using Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), we first identified four recurring cellular niches, representing distinct functional microenvironments within the tissue. From these niches, we systematically engineered 44 features capturing three key aspects of tissue pathology: niche composition, neighborhood enrichment, and niche-gene signals. A multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier trained on these features achieved an accuracy of $0.774 \pm 0.161$ for the more challenging three-class problem (HC, UC, and CD) and $0.916 \pm 0.118$ in the two-class problem of distinguishing IBD from healthy tissue. Crucially, model explainability analysis revealed that disruptions in the spatial organization of niches were the strongest predictors of general inflammation, while the classification between UC and CD relied on specific niche-gene expression signatures. This work provides a robust, proof-of-concept pipeline that transforms descriptive spatial data into an accurate and explainable predictive tool, offering not only a potential new diagnostic paradigm but also deeper insights into the distinct biological mechanisms that drive IBD subtypes.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 8 figures, 7 tables.

Finite mixture models, especially Gaussian mixture models, particularly suffer from high dimensionality due to the number of free covariance parameters. This study introduces a spatial covariance constraint for Gaussian mixture models that requires only four free parameters for each component, independent of dimensionality. Using a coordinate system, the spatially constrained Gaussian mixture model enables clustering of multi-way spatial data and inference of spatial patterns. The parameter estimation is conducted by combining the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm with the generalized least squares (GLS) estimator. Simulation studies and applications to Raman spectroscopy data are provided to demonstrate the proposed model.</p></details> | 19 pages, 7 figures |

Point-based methods suffer from sparse sampling, leading to the loss of fine-grained semantics. Image-based methods typically feed RGB and depth into 2D backbones pre-trained on 3D auxiliary tasks, but their entangled semantics and geometry are sensitive to inherent depth noise in real-world that disrupts semantic understanding. Moreover, these methods focus on high-level geometry while overlooking low-level spatial cues essential for precise interaction. We propose SpatialActor, a disentangled framework for robust robotic manipulation that explicitly decouples semantics and geometry. The Semantic-guided Geometric Module adaptively fuses two complementary geometry from noisy depth and semantic-guided expert priors. Also, a Spatial Transformer leverages low-level spatial cues for accurate 2D-3D mapping and enables interaction among spatial features. We evaluate SpatialActor on multiple simulation and real-world scenarios across 50+ tasks. It achieves state-of-the-art performance with 87.4% on RLBench and improves by 13.9% to 19.4% under varying noisy conditions, showing strong robustness. Moreover, it significantly enhances few-shot generalization to new tasks and maintains robustness under various spatial perturbations.

Representative queries over such data include range queries, nearest neighbor queries, and join queries. However, formulating those queries usually requires domain-specific expertise and familiarity with executable query languages, which would be a challenging task for non-expert users. It leads to a great demand for well-supported natural language queries (NLQs) in spatio-temporal databases. To bridge the gap between non-experts and query plans in databases, we present NL4ST, an interactive tool that allows users to query spatio-temporal databases in natural language. NL4ST features a three-layer architecture: (i) knowledge base and corpus for knowledge preparation, (ii) natural language understanding for entity linking, and (iii) generating physical plans.

| **[UBATrack: Spatio-Temporal State Space Model for General Multi-Modal Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14799v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-modal object tracking has attracted considerable attention by integrating multiple complementary inputs (e.g., thermal, depth, and event data) to achieve outstanding performance. Although current general-purpose multi-modal trackers primarily unify various modal tracking tasks (i.e., RGB-Thermal infrared, RGB-Depth or RGB-Event tracking) through prompt learning, they still overlook the effective capture of spatio-temporal cues. In this work, we introduce a novel multi-modal tracking framework based on a mamba-style state space model, termed UBATrack. Our UBATrack comprises two simple yet effective modules: a Spatio-temporal Mamba Adapter (STMA) and a Dynamic Multi-modal Feature Mixer. The former leverages Mamba's long-sequence modeling capability to jointly model cross-modal dependencies and spatio-temporal visual cues in an adapter-tuning manner. The latter further enhances multi-modal representation capacity across multiple feature dimensions to improve tracking robustness. In this way, UBATrack eliminates the need for costly full-parameter fine-tuning, thereby improving the training efficiency of multi-modal tracking algorithms. Experiments show that UBATrack outperforms state-of-the-art methods on RGB-T, RGB-D, and RGB-E tracking benchmarks, achieving outstanding results on the LasHeR, RGBT234, RGBT210, DepthTrack, VOT-RGBD22, and VisEvent datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[FeedbackSTS-Det: Sparse Frames-Based Spatio-Temporal Semantic Feedback Network for Infrared Small Target Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14690v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Infrared small target detection (ISTD) under complex backgrounds remains a critical yet challenging task, primarily due to the extremely low signal-to-clutter ratio, persistent dynamic interference, and the lack of distinct target features. While multi-frame detection methods leverages temporal cues to improve upon single-frame approaches, existing methods still struggle with inefficient long-range dependency modeling and insufficient robustness. To overcome these issues, we propose a novel scheme for ISTD, realized through a sparse frames-based spatio-temporal semantic feedback network named FeedbackSTS-Det. The core of our approach is a novel spatio-temporal semantic feedback strategy with a closed-loop semantic association mechanism, which consists of paired forward and backward refinement modules that work cooperatively across the encoder and decoder. Moreover, both modules incorporate an embedded sparse semantic module (SSM), which performs structured sparse temporal modeling to capture long-range dependencies with low computational cost. This integrated design facilitates robust implicit inter-frame registration and continuous semantic refinement, effectively suppressing false alarms. Furthermore, our overall procedure maintains a consistent training-inference pipeline, which ensures reliable performance transfer and increases model robustness. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets confirm the effectiveness of FeedbackSTS-Det.

However, most existing video customization methods rely on reference images or task-specific temporal priors, failing to fully exploit the rich spatio-temporal information inherent in videos, thereby limiting flexibility and generalization in video generation. To address these limitations, we propose OmniTransfer, a unified framework for spatio-temporal video transfer. It leverages multi-view information across frames to enhance appearance consistency and exploits temporal cues to enable fine-grained temporal control. To unify various video transfer tasks, OmniTransfer incorporates three key designs: Task-aware Positional Bias that adaptively leverages reference video information to improve temporal alignment or appearance consistency; Reference-decoupled Causal Learning separating reference and target branches to enable precise reference transfer while improving efficiency; and Task-adaptive Multimodal Alignment using multimodal semantic guidance to dynamically distinguish and tackle different tasks. Extensive experiments show that OmniTransfer outperforms existing methods in appearance (ID and style) and temporal transfer (camera movement and video effects), while matching pose-guided methods in motion transfer without using pose, establishing a new paradigm for flexible, high-fidelity video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Githu...</summary><p>Github Page: https://pangzecheung.github.io/OmniTransfer/</p></details> |
| **[Riemannian Liquid Spatio-Temporal Graph Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14115v1)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Liquid Time-Constant networks (LTCs), a type of continuous-time graph neural network, excel at modeling irregularly-sampled dynamics but are fundamentally confined to Euclidean space. This limitation introduces significant geometric distortion when representing real-world graphs with inherent non-Euclidean structures (e.g., hierarchies and cycles), degrading representation quality. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the Riemannian Liquid Spatio-Temporal Graph Network (RLSTG), a framework that unifies continuous-time liquid dynamics with the geometric inductive biases of Riemannian manifolds. RLSTG models graph evolution through an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) formulated directly on a curved manifold, enabling it to faithfully capture the intrinsic geometry of both structurally static and dynamic spatio-temporal graphs. Moreover, we provide rigorous theoretical guarantees for RLSTG, extending stability theorems of LTCs to the Riemannian domain and quantifying its expressive power via state trajectory analysis. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmarks demonstrate that, by combining advanced temporal dynamics with a Riemannian spatial representation, RLSTG achieves superior performance on graphs with complex structures.

Existing evaluation metrics primarily focus on perceptual quality or reconstruction fidelity, and are not designed to assess whether a set of sampled frames adequately captures informative and representative video content. We propose Spatio-Temporal Entropy Coverage (STEC), a simple and non-reference metric for evaluating the effectiveness of video frame sampling. STEC builds upon Spatio-Temporal Frame Entropy (STFE), which measures per-frame spatial information via entropy-based structural complexity, and evaluates sampled frames based on their temporal coverage and redundancy. By jointly modeling spatial information strength, temporal dispersion, and non-redundancy, STEC provides a principled and lightweight measure of sampling quality. Experiments on the MSR-VTT test-1k benchmark demonstrate that STEC clearly differentiates common sampling strategies, including random, uniform, and content-aware methods. We further show that STEC reveals robustness patterns across individual videos that are not captured by average performance alone, highlighting its practical value as a general-purpose evaluation tool for efficient video understanding. We emphasize that STEC is not designed to predict downstream task accuracy, but to provide a task-agnostic diagnostic signal for analyzing frame sampling behavior under constrained budgets.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper corresponds to the camera-ready version of a WACV 2026 Workshop paper</p></details> |

Point processes specified on linear networks can provide a more accurate description of crime incidents by considering the geometry of the city. We propose a spatio-temporal Dirichlet process mixture model on a linear network to analyze crime events in Valencia, Spain. We propose a Bayesian hierarchical model with a Dirichlet process prior to automatically detect space-time clusters of the events and adopt a convolution kernel estimator to account for the network structure in the city. From the fitted model, we provide crime hotspot visualizations that can inform social interventions to prevent crime incidents. Furthermore, we study the relationships between the detected cluster centers and the city's amenities, which provides an intuitive explanation of criminal contagion.</p></details> |  |

While advances in semantic scene representations have enriched robotic scene understanding, current approaches lack a connection between spatial features and dynamic events; e.g., connecting the blue mug to the event washing a mug. In this work, we introduce the event-grounding graph (EGG), a framework grounding event interactions to spatial features of a scene. This representation allows robots to perceive, reason, and respond to complex spatio-temporal queries. Experiments using real robotic data demonstrate EGG's capability to retrieve relevant information and respond accurately to human inquiries concerning the environment and events within. Furthermore, the EGG framework's source code and evaluation dataset are released as open-source at: https://github.com/aalto-intelligent-robotics/EGG.</p></details> | Submitted to RA-L |
| **[A Graph Prompt Fine-Tuning Method for WSN Spatio-Temporal Correlation Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12745v1)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection of multi-temporal modal data in Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) can provide an important guarantee for reliable network operation. Existing anomaly detection methods in multi-temporal modal data scenarios have the problems of insufficient extraction of spatio-temporal correlation features, high cost of anomaly sample category annotation, and imbalance of anomaly samples. In this paper, a graph neural network anomaly detection backbone network incorporating spatio-temporal correlation features and a multi-task self-supervised training strategy of "pre-training - graph prompting - fine-tuning" are designed for the characteristics of WSN graph structure data. First, the anomaly detection backbone network is designed by improving the Mamba model based on a multi-scale strategy and inter-modal fusion method, and combining it with a variational graph convolution module, which is capable of fully extracting spatio-temporal correlation features in the multi-node, multi-temporal modal scenarios of WSNs. Secondly, we design a three-subtask learning "pre-training" method with no-negative comparative learning, prediction, and reconstruction to learn generic features of WSN data samples from unlabeled data, and design a "graph prompting-fine-tuning" mechanism to guide the pre-trained self-supervised learning. The model is fine-tuned through the "graph prompting-fine-tuning" mechanism to guide the pre-trained self-supervised learning model to complete the parameter fine-tuning, thereby reducing the training cost and enhancing the detection generalization performance. The F1 metrics obtained from experiments on the public dataset and the actual collected dataset are up to 91.30% and 92.31%, respectively, which provides better detection performance and generalization ability than existing methods designed by the method.</p></details> |  |
| **[CurConMix+: A Unified Spatio-Temporal Framework for Hierarchical Surgical Workflow Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12312v1)** | 2026-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Surgical action triplet recognition aims to understand fine-grained surgical behaviors by modeling the interactions among instruments, actions, and anatomical targets. Despite its clinical importance for workflow analysis and skill assessment, progress has been hindered by severe class imbalance, subtle visual variations, and the semantic interdependence among triplet components. Existing approaches often address only a subset of these challenges rather than tackling them jointly, which limits their ability to form a holistic understanding. This study builds upon CurConMix, a spatial representation framework. At its core, a curriculum-guided contrastive learning strategy learns discriminative and progressively correlated features, further enhanced by structured hard-pair sampling and feature-level mixup. Its temporal extension, CurConMix+, integrates a Multi-Resolution Temporal Transformer (MRTT) that achieves robust, context-aware understanding by adaptively fusing multi-scale temporal features and dynamically balancing spatio-temporal cues. Furthermore, we introduce LLS48, a new, hierarchically annotated benchmark for complex laparoscopic left lateral sectionectomy, providing step-, task-, and action-level annotations. Extensive experiments on CholecT45 and LLS48 demonstrate that CurConMix+ not only outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in triplet recognition, but also exhibits strong cross-level generalization, as its fine-grained features effectively transfer to higher-level phase and step recognition tasks. Together, the framework and dataset provide a unified foundation for hierarchy-aware, reproducible, and interpretable surgical workflow understanding. The code and dataset will be publicly released on GitHub to facilitate reproducibility and further research.</p></details> |  |

Substantially extending our preliminary conference version, we present FactoST-v2, an enhanced factorized framework redesigned for full weight transfer and arbitrary-length generalization. FactoST-v2 decouples universal temporal learning from domain-specific spatial adaptation. The first stage pretrains a minimalist encoder-only backbone using randomized sequence masking to capture invariant temporal dynamics, enabling probabilistic quantile prediction across variable horizons. The second stage employs a streamlined adapter to rapidly inject spatial awareness via meta adaptive learning and prompting. Comprehensive evaluations across diverse domains demonstrate that FactoST-v2 achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with linear efficiency - significantly outperforming existing foundation models in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios while rivaling domain-specific expert baselines. This factorized paradigm offers a practical, scalable path toward truly universal STFMs. Code is available at https://github.com/CityMind-Lab/FactoST.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is an extended version of the paper presented at NeurIPS 2025.

| **[A Method for Detecting Spatio-temporal Correlation Anomalies of WSN Nodes Based on Topological Information Enhancement and Time-frequency Feature Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11951v1)** | 2026-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing anomaly detection methods for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) generally suffer from insufficient ex-traction of spatio-temporal correlation features, reliance on either time-domain or frequency-domain information alone, and high computational overhead. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a topology-enhanced spatio-temporal feature fusion anomaly detection method, TE-MSTAD. First, building upon the RWKV model with linear attention mechanisms, a Cross-modal Feature Extraction (CFE) module is introduced to fully extract spatial correlation features among multiple nodes while reducing computational resource consumption. Second, a strategy is designed to construct an adjacency matrix by jointly learning spatial correlation from time-frequency domain features. Different graph neural networks are integrated to enhance spatial correlation feature extraction, thereby fully capturing spatial relationships among multiple nodes. Finally, a dual-branch network TE-MSTAD is designed for time-frequency domain feature fusion, overcoming the limitations of relying solely on the time or frequency domain to improve WSN anomaly detection performance. Testing on both public and real-world datasets demonstrates that the TE-MSTAD model achieves F1 scores of 92.52% and 93.28%, respectively, exhibiting superior detection performance and generalization capabilities compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Communication-Efficient Federated Learning by Exploiting Spatio-Temporal Correlations of Gradients](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10491v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Communication overhead is a critical challenge in federated learning, particularly in bandwidth-constrained networks. Although many methods have been proposed to reduce communication overhead, most focus solely on compressing individual gradients, overlooking the temporal correlations among them. Prior studies have shown that gradients exhibit spatial correlations, typically reflected in low-rank structures. Through empirical analysis, we further observe a strong temporal correlation between client gradients across adjacent rounds. Based on these observations, we propose GradESTC, a compression technique that exploits both spatial and temporal gradient correlations. GradESTC exploits spatial correlations to decompose each full gradient into a compact set of basis vectors and corresponding combination coefficients. By exploiting temporal correlations, only a small portion of the basis vectors need to be dynamically updated in each round. GradESTC significantly reduces communication overhead by transmitting lightweight combination coefficients and a limited number of updated basis vectors instead of the full gradients. Extensive experiments show that, upon reaching a target accuracy level near convergence, GradESTC reduces uplink communication by an average of 39.79% compared to the strongest baseline, while maintaining comparable convergence speed and final accuracy to uncompressed FedAvg. By effectively leveraging spatio-temporal gradient structures, GradESTC offers a practical and scalable solution for communication-efficient federated learning.</p></details> |  |

To better respond real-time user feedback, we have deployed an interactive recommender system (IRS) alongside our core homepage recommender system. This IRS is triggered by user click on homepage, and generates a series of highly relevant recommendations based on the clicked item to meet focused browsing demands. Different from traditional e-commerce RecSys, the full-screen UI and immersive swiping down functionality present two distinct challenges for regular ranking system. First, there exists explicit interference (overlap or conflicts) between ranking objectives, i.e., conversion, view and swipe down. This is because there are intrinsic behavioral co-occurrences under the premise of immersive browsing and swiping down functionality. Second, the ranking system is prone to temporal greedy traps in sequential recommendation slot transitions, which is caused by full-screen UI design. To alleviate these challenges, we propose a novel Spatio-temporal collaborative ranking (STCRank) framework to achieve collaboration between multi-objectives within one slot (spatial) and between multiple sequential recommondation slots. In multi-objective collaboration (MOC) module, we push Pareto frontier by mitigating the objective overlaps and conflicts. In multi-slot collaboration (MSC) module, we achieve global optima on overall sequential slots by dual-stage look-ahead ranking mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate our proposed method brings about purchase and DAU co-growth.

| **[STORM: A Spatio-Temporal Factor Model Based on Dual Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders for Financial Trading](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09468v4)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In financial trading, factor models are widely used to price assets and capture excess returns from mispricing. Recently, we have witnessed the rise of variational autoencoder-based latent factor models, which learn latent factors self-adaptively. While these models focus on modeling overall market conditions, they often fail to effectively capture the temporal patterns of individual stocks. Additionally, representing multiple factors as single values simplifies the model but limits its ability to capture complex relationships and dependencies. As a result, the learned factors are of low quality and lack diversity, reducing their effectiveness and robustness across different trading periods. To address these issues, we propose a Spatio-Temporal factOR Model based on dual vector quantized variational autoencoders, named STORM, which extracts features of stocks from temporal and spatial perspectives, then fuses and aligns these features at the fine-grained and semantic level, and represents the factors as multi-dimensional embeddings. The discrete codebooks cluster similar factor embeddings, ensuring orthogonality and diversity, which helps distinguish between different factors and enables factor selection in financial trading. To show the performance of the proposed factor model, we apply it to two downstream experiments: portfolio management on two stock datasets and individual trading tasks on six specific stocks. The extensive experiments demonstrate STORM's flexibility in adapting to downstream tasks and superior performance over baseline models.</p></details> |  |
| **[TrackNetV5: Residual-Driven Spatio-Temporal Refinement and Motion Direction Decoupling for Fast Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02789v4)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The TrackNet series has established a strong baseline for fast-moving small object tracking in sports. However, existing iterations face significant limitations: V1-V3 struggle with occlusions due to a reliance on purely visual cues, while TrackNetV4, despite introducing motion inputs, suffers from directional ambiguity as its absolute difference method discards motion polarity. To overcome these bottlenecks, we propose TrackNetV5, a robust architecture integrating two novel mechanisms. First, to recover lost directional priors, we introduce the Motion Direction Decoupling (MDD) module. Unlike V4, MDD decomposes temporal dynamics into signed polarity fields, explicitly encoding both movement occurrence and trajectory direction. Second, we propose the Residual-Driven Spatio-Temporal Refinement (R-STR) head. Operating on a coarse-to-fine paradigm, this Transformer-based module leverages factorized spatio-temporal contexts to estimate a corrective residual, effectively recovering occluded targets. Extensive experiments on the TrackNetV2 dataset demonstrate that TrackNetV5 achieves a new state-of-the-art F1-score of 0.9859 and an accuracy of 0.9733, significantly outperforming previous versions. Notably, this performance leap is achieved with a marginal 3.7% increase in FLOPs compared to V4, maintaining real-time inference capabilities while delivering superior tracking precision.</p></details> |  |
| **[U-MASK: User-adaptive Spatio-Temporal Masking for Personalized Mobile AI Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06867v1)** | 2026-01-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Personalized mobile artificial intelligence applications are widely deployed, yet they are expected to infer user behavior from sparse and irregular histories under a continuously evolving spatio-temporal context. This setting induces a fundamental tension among three requirements, i.e., immediacy to adapt to recent behavior, stability to resist transient noise, and generalization to support long-horizon prediction and cold-start users. Most existing approaches satisfy at most two of these requirements, resulting in an inherent impossibility triangle in data-scarce, non-stationary personalization. To address this challenge, we model mobile behavior as a partially observed spatio-temporal tensor and unify short-term adaptation, long-horizon forecasting, and cold-start recommendation as a conditional completion problem, where a user- and task-specific mask specifies which coordinates are treated as evidence. We propose U-MASK, a user-adaptive spatio-temporal masking method that allocates evidence budgets based on user reliability and task sensitivity. To enable mask generation under sparse observations, U-MASK learns a compact, task-agnostic user representation from app and location histories via U-SCOPE, which serves as the sole semantic conditioning signal. A shared diffusion transformer then performs mask-guided generative completion while preserving observed evidence, so personalization and task differentiation are governed entirely by the mask and the user representation. Experiments on real-world mobile datasets demonstrate consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods across short-term prediction, long-horizon forecasting, and cold-start settings, with the largest gains under severe data sparsity. The code and dataset will be available at https://github.com/NICE-HKU/U-MASK.</p></details> | 18 pages, 9 figures |

Some existing VLA approaches attempt to improve action accuracy by explicitly generating linguistic reasoning traces or future visual observations before action execution. However, explicit reasoning typically incurs non-negligible inference latency, which constrains the temporal resolution required for robotic manipulation. Moreover, such reasoning is confined to the linguistic space, imposing a representational bottleneck that struggles to faithfully capture ineffable physical attributes. To mitigate these limitations, we propose LaST$_0$, a framework that enables efficient reasoning before acting through a Latent Spatio-Temporal Chain-of-Thought (CoT), capturing fine-grained physical and robotic dynamics that are often difficult to verbalize. Specifically, we introduce a token-efficient latent CoT space that models future visual dynamics, 3D structural information, and robot proprioceptive states, and further extends these representations across time to enable temporally consistent implicit reasoning trajectories. Furthermore, LaST$_0$ adopts a dual-system architecture implemented via a Mixture-of-Transformers design, where a reasoning expert conducts low-frequency latent inference and an acting expert generates high-frequency actions conditioned on robotics-oriented latent representations. To facilitate coordination, LaST$_0$ is trained with heterogeneous operation frequencies, enabling adaptive switching between reasoning and action inference rates during deployment. Across ten simulated and six real-world manipulation tasks, LaST$_0$ improves mean success rates by 8% and 13% over prior VLA methods, respectively, while achieving substantially faster inference.

Conventional 3D methods detect lanes from dense birds-eye-viewed (BEV) features, though erroneous transformations often result in a poor feature representation misaligned with the true 3D road surface. While recent sparse lane detectors have surpassed dense BEV approaches, they completely disregard valuable lane-specific priors. Furthermore, existing methods fail to utilize historic lane observations, which yield the potential to resolve ambiguities in situations of poor visibility. To address these challenges, we present SparseLaneSTP, a novel method that integrates both geometric properties of the lane structure and temporal information into a sparse lane transformer. It introduces a new lane-specific spatio-temporal attention mechanism, a continuous lane representation tailored for sparse architectures as well as temporal regularization. Identifying weaknesses of existing 3D lane datasets, we also introduce a precise and consistent 3D lane dataset using a simple yet effective auto-labeling strategy. Our experimental section proves the benefits of our contributions and demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across all detection and error metrics on existing 3D lane detection benchmarks as well as on our novel dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) 2025</p></details> |

However, the asynchronous sampling and irregular intervals inherent to IMTS pose two core challenges for existing methods: (1) how to accurately represent the raw information of irregular time series without introducing data distortion, and (2) how to effectively capture the complex dynamic dependencies between observation points. To address these challenges, we propose the Adaptive Spatio-Temporal Graph Interaction (ASTGI) framework. Specifically, the framework first employs a Spatio-Temporal Point Representation module to encode each discrete observation as a point within a learnable spatio-temporal embedding space. Second, a Neighborhood-Adaptive Graph Construction module adaptively builds a causal graph for each point in the embedding space via nearest neighbor search. Subsequently, a Spatio-Temporal Dynamic Propagation module iteratively updates information on these adaptive causal graphs by generating messages and computing interaction weights based on the relative spatio-temporal positions between points. Finally, a Query Point-based Prediction module generates the final forecast by aggregating neighborhood information for a new query point and performing regression. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that ASTGI outperforms various state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes a novel Graph Enhanced Spatio-temporal Hierarchical Inference Network (GEnSHIN) to handle the complex spatio-temporal dependencies in traffic flow prediction. The model integrates three innovative designs: 1) An attention-enhanced Graph Convolutional Recurrent Unit (GCRU), which strengthens the modeling capability for long-term temporal dependencies by introducing Transformer modules; 2) An asymmetric dual-embedding graph generation mechanism, which leverages the real road network and data-driven latent asymmetric topology to generate graph structures that better fit the characteristics of actual traffic flow; 3) A dynamic memory bank module, which utilizes learnable traffic pattern prototypes to provide personalized traffic pattern representations for each sensor node, and introduces a lightweight graph updater during the decoding phase to adapt to dynamic changes in road network states. Extensive experiments on the public dataset METR-LA show that GEnSHIN achieves or surpasses the performance of comparative models across multiple metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). Notably, the model demonstrates excellent prediction stability during peak morning and evening traffic hours. Ablation experiments further validate the effectiveness of each core module and its contribution to the final performance.</p></details> |  |

This capability is vital for high-stakes decision-making in systems such as traffic networks, power grids, and disease propagation. However, the field remains underdeveloped because most existing works prioritize predictive accuracy over reasoning. To address the gap, we introduce ST-Bench, a benchmark consisting of four core tasks, including etiological reasoning, entity identification, correlation reasoning, and in-context forecasting, developed via a network SDE-based multi-agent data synthesis pipeline. We then propose STReasoner, which empowers LLM to integrate time series, graph structure, and text for explicit reasoning. To promote spatially grounded logic, we introduce S-GRPO, a reinforcement learning algorithm that rewards performance gains specifically attributable to spatial information. Experiments show that STReasoner achieves average accuracy gains between 17% and 135% at only 0.004X the cost of proprietary models and generalizes robustly to real-world data.</p></details> | <details><summary>prepr...</summary><p>preprint, we release our code publicly at https://github.com/LingFengGold/STReasoner</p></details> |
| **[Learning and Optimizing the Efficacy of Spatio-Temporal Task Allocation under Temporal and Resource Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02505v1)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Complex multi-robot missions often require heterogeneous teams to jointly optimize task allocation, scheduling, and path planning to improve team performance under strict constraints. We formalize these complexities into a new class of problems, dubbed Spatio-Temporal Efficacy-optimized Allocation for Multi-robot systems (STEAM). STEAM builds upon trait-based frameworks that model robots using their capabilities (e.g., payload and speed), but goes beyond the typical binary success-failure model by explicitly modeling the efficacy of allocations as trait-efficacy maps. These maps encode how the aggregated capabilities assigned to a task determine performance. Further, STEAM accommodates spatio-temporal constraints, including a user-specified time budget (i.e., maximum makespan). To solve STEAM problems, we contribute a novel algorithm named Efficacy-optimized Incremental Task Allocation Graph Search (E-ITAGS) that simultaneously optimizes task performance and respects time budgets by interleaving task allocation, scheduling, and path planning. Motivated by the fact that trait-efficacy maps are difficult, if not impossible, to specify, E-ITAGS efficiently learns them using a realizability-aware active learning module. Our approach is realizability-aware since it explicitly accounts for the fact that not all combinations of traits are realizable by the robots available during learning. Further, we derive experimentally-validated bounds on E-ITAGS' suboptimality with respect to efficacy. Detailed numerical simulations and experiments using an emergency response domain demonstrate that E-ITAGS generates allocations of higher efficacy compared to baselines, while respecting resource and spatio-temporal constraints. We also show that our active learning approach is sample efficient and establishes a principled tradeoff between data and computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>The j...</summary><p>The journal extension version of our conference paper: arXiv:2404.07902, which has been accepted by ISRR 2024</p></details> |
| **[A Spatio-Temporal Deep Learning Approach For High-Resolution Gridded Monsoon Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02445v1)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) is a critical climate phenomenon, fundamentally impacting the agriculture, economy, and water security of over a billion people. Traditional long-range forecasting, whether statistical or dynamical, has predominantly focused on predicting a single, spatially-averaged seasonal value, lacking the spatial detail essential for regional-level resource management. To address this gap, we introduce a novel deep learning framework that reframes gridded monsoon prediction as a spatio-temporal computer vision task. We treat multi-variable, pre-monsoon atmospheric and oceanic fields as a sequence of multi-channel images, effectively creating a video-like input tensor. Using 85 years of ERA5 reanalysis data for predictors and IMD rainfall data for targets, we employ a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based architecture to learn the complex mapping from the five-month pre-monsoon period (January-May) to a high-resolution gridded rainfall pattern for the subsequent monsoon season. Our framework successfully produces distinct forecasts for each of the four monsoon months (June-September) as well as the total seasonal average, demonstrating its utility for both intra-seasonal and seasonal outlooks.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, 2 Tables, to be submitted to "IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing"</p></details> |
| **[Spatio-temporal modeling and forecasting with Fourier neural operators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01813v1)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal process models are often used for modeling dynamic physical and biological phenomena that evolve across space and time. These phenomena may exhibit environmental heterogeneity and complex interactions that are difficult to capture using traditional statistical process models such as Gaussian processes. This work proposes the use of Fourier neural operators (FNOs) for constructing statistical dynamical spatio-temporal models for forecasting. An FNO is a flexible mapping of functions that approximates the solution operator of possibly unknown linear or non-linear partial differential equations (PDEs) in a computationally efficient manner. It does so using samples of inputs and their respective outputs, and hence explicit knowledge of the underlying PDE is not required. Through simulations from a nonlinear PDE with known solution, we compare FNO forecasts to those from state-of-the-art statistical spatio-temporal-forecasting methods. Further, using sea surface temperature data over the Atlantic Ocean and precipitation data across Europe, we demonstrate the ability of FNO-based dynamic spatio-temporal (DST) statistical modeling to capture complex real-world spatio-temporal dependencies. Using collections of testing instances, we show that the FNO-DST forecasts are accurate with valid uncertainty quantification.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Graph Deep Learning with Stochastic Differential Equations for Uncovering Alzheimer's Disease Progression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21735v3)** | 2026-01-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying objective neuroimaging biomarkers to forecast Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression is crucial for timely intervention. However, this task remains challenging due to the complex dysfunctions in the spatio-temporal characteristics of underlying brain networks, which are often overlooked by existing methods. To address these limitations, we develop an interpretable spatio-temporal graph neural network framework to predict future AD progression, leveraging dual Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) to model the irregularly-sampled longitudinal functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. We validate our approach on two independent cohorts, including the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS-3) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Our framework effectively learns sparse regional and connective importance probabilities, enabling the identification of key brain circuit abnormalities associated with disease progression. Notably, we detect the parahippocampal cortex, prefrontal cortex, and parietal lobule as salient regions, with significant disruptions in the ventral attention, dorsal attention, and default mode networks. These abnormalities correlate strongly with longitudinal AD-related clinical symptoms. Moreover, our interpretability strategy reveals both established and novel neural systems-level and sex-specific biomarkers, offering new insights into the neurobiological mechanisms underlying AD progression. Our findings highlight the potential of spatio-temporal graph-based learning for early, individualized prediction of AD progression, even in the context of irregularly-sampled longitudinal imaging data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Echo State Networks for Spatio-Temporal Area-Level Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10641v2)** | 2026-01-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal area-level datasets play a critical role in official statistics, providing valuable insights for policy-making and regional planning. Accurate modeling and forecasting of these datasets can be extremely useful for policymakers to develop informed strategies for future planning. Echo State Networks (ESNs) are efficient methods for capturing nonlinear temporal dynamics and generating forecasts. However, ESNs lack a direct mechanism to account for the neighborhood structure inherent in area-level data. Ignoring these spatial relationships can significantly compromise the accuracy and utility of forecasts. In this paper, we incorporate approximate graph spectral filters at the input stage of the ESN, thereby improving forecast accuracy while preserving the model's computational efficiency during training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using Eurostat's tourism occupancy dataset and show how it can support more informed decision-making in policy and planning contexts.</p></details> | 23 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Damba-ST: Domain-Adaptive Mamba for Efficient Urban Spatio-Temporal Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18939v3)** | 2026-01-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training urban spatio-temporal foundation models that generalize well across diverse regions and cities is critical for deploying urban services in unseen or data-scarce regions. Recent studies have typically focused on fusing cross-domain spatio-temporal data to train unified Transformer-based models. However, these models suffer from quadratic computational complexity and high memory overhead, limiting their scalability and practical deployment. Inspired by the efficiency of Mamba, a state space model with linear time complexity, we explore its potential for efficient urban spatio-temporal prediction. However, directly applying Mamba as a spatio-temporal backbone leads to negative transfer and severe performance degradation. This is primarily due to spatio-temporal heterogeneity and the recursive mechanism of Mamba's hidden state updates, which limit cross-domain generalization. To overcome these challenges, we propose Damba-ST, a novel domain-adaptive Mamba-based model for efficient urban spatio-temporal prediction. Damba-ST retains Mamba's linear complexity advantage while significantly enhancing its adaptability to heterogeneous domains. Specifically, we introduce two core innovations: (1) a domain-adaptive state space model that partitions the latent representation space into a shared subspace for learning cross-domain commonalities and independent, domain-specific subspaces for capturing intra-domain discriminative features; (2) three distinct Domain Adapters, which serve as domain-aware proxies to bridge disparate domain distributions and facilitate the alignment of cross-domain commonalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate the generalization and efficiency of Damba-ST. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on prediction tasks and demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization, enabling seamless deployment in new urban environments without extensive retraining or fine-tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICDE 2026</p></details> |

Rather than relying on inefficient standard im2col-like implementations (e.g., spatial convolutions, depthwise convolutions and feature-shifting mechanisms) or hardware-specific CUDA kernels (e.g., deformable and neighborhood attention), which often suffer from limited portability across non-CUDA devices, we reorganize the local sampling process through a direction-based sampling perspective. Specifically, we implement a non-parametric sampling mechanism that enables dynamically varying sampling regions. This approach provides the flexibility to adapt to diverse spatial structures without the computational costs of parametric layers and the need for model retraining. To further enhance feature coherence across frames, we design a supervised spatio-temporal contrastive learning scheme that enforces consistency in feature representations. In addition, we introduce a publicly available benchmark dataset for multi-object segmentation in X-ray angiography videos (MOSXAV), featuring detailed, manually labeled segmentation ground truth. Extensive experiments on the CADICA, XACV, and MOSXAV datasets show that our proposed FSVOS method outperforms current state-of-the-art video segmentation methods in terms of segmentation accuracy and generalization capability (i.e., seen and unseen categories). This work offers enhanced flexibility and potential for a wide range of clinical applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[IMBWatch -- a Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network approach to detect Illicit Massage Business](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00075v1)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Illicit Massage Businesses (IMBs) are a covert and persistent form of organized exploitation that operate under the facade of legitimate wellness services while facilitating human trafficking, sexual exploitation, and coerced labor. Detecting IMBs is difficult due to encoded digital advertisements, frequent changes in personnel and locations, and the reuse of shared infrastructure such as phone numbers and addresses. Traditional approaches, including community tips and regulatory inspections, are largely reactive and ineffective at revealing the broader operational networks traffickers rely on. To address these challenges, we introduce IMBWatch, a spatio-temporal graph neural network (ST-GNN) framework for large-scale IMB detection. IMBWatch constructs dynamic graphs from open-source intelligence, including scraped online advertisements, business license records, and crowdsourced reviews. Nodes represent heterogeneous entities such as businesses, aliases, phone numbers, and locations, while edges capture spatio-temporal and relational patterns, including co-location, repeated phone usage, and synchronized advertising. The framework combines graph convolutional operations with temporal attention mechanisms to model the evolution of IMB networks over time and space, capturing patterns such as intercity worker movement, burner phone rotation, and coordinated advertising surges. Experiments on real-world datasets from multiple U.S. cities show that IMBWatch outperforms baseline models, achieving higher accuracy and F1 scores. Beyond performance gains, IMBWatch offers improved interpretability, providing actionable insights to support proactive and targeted interventions. The framework is scalable, adaptable to other illicit domains, and released with anonymized data and open-source code to support reproducible research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to AAAI AISI 2026</p></details> |
| **[Modeling Spatio-Temporal Transport: From Rigid Advection to Realistic Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02756v4)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stochastic models for spatio-temporal transport face a critical trade-off between physical realism and interpretability. The advection model with a single constant velocity is interpretable but physically limited by its perfect correlation over time. This work aims to bridge the gap between this simple framework and its physically realistic extensions. Our guiding principle is to introduce a spatial correlation structure that vanishes over time. To achieve this, we present two distinct approaches. The first constructs complex velocity structures, either through superpositions of advection components or by allowing the velocity to vary locally. The second is a spectral technique that replaces the singular spectrum of rigid advection with a more flexible form, introducing temporal decorrelation controlled by parameters. We accompany these models with efficient simulation algorithms and demonstrate their success in replicating complex dynamics, such as tropical cyclones and the solutions of partial differential equations. Finally, we illustrate the practical utility of the proposed framework by comparing its simulations to real-world precipitation data from Hurricane Florence.</p></details> |  |
| **[RAST: A Retrieval Augmented Spatio-Temporal Framework for Traffic Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16623v2)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic prediction is a cornerstone of modern intelligent transportation systems and a critical task in spatio-temporal forecasting. Although advanced Spatio-temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) and pre-trained models have achieved significant progress in traffic prediction, two key challenges remain: (i) limited contextual capacity when modeling complex spatio-temporal dependencies, and (ii) low predictability at fine-grained spatio-temporal points due to heterogeneous patterns. Inspired by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), we propose RAST, a universal framework that integrates retrieval-augmented mechanisms with spatio-temporal modeling to address these challenges. Our framework consists of three key designs: 1) Decoupled Encoder and Query Generator to capture decoupled spatial and temporal features and construct a fusion query via residual fusion; 2) Spatio-temporal Retrieval Store and Retrievers to maintain and retrieve vectorized fine-grained patterns; and 3) Universal Backbone Predictor that flexibly accommodates pre-trained STGNNs or simple MLP predictors. Extensive experiments on six real-world traffic networks, including large-scale datasets, demonstrate that RAST achieves superior performance while maintaining computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026 (AI for Social Impact)</p></details> |

Integrating data from satellite products and ground monitors are increasingly used to produce exposure surfaces. However, spatio-temporal misalignment often induced from missing data introduces substantial uncertainty and reduces predictive accuracy. We propose a Bayesian weighted predictor regression framework that models spatio-temporal relationships when predictors are observed on irregular supports or have substantial missing data, and are not concurrent with the outcome. The key feature of our model is a spatio-temporal kernel that aggregates the predictor over local space-time neighborhoods, built directly into the likelihood, eliminating any separate gap-filling or forced data alignment stage. We introduce a numerical approximation using a Voronoi-based spatial quadrature combined with irregular temporal increments for estimation under data missingness and misalignment. We showed that misspecification of the spatial and temporal lags induced bias in the mean and parameter estimates, indicating the need for principled parameter selection. Simulation studies confirmed these findings, where careful tuning was critical to control bias and achieve accurate prediction, while the proposed quadrature performed well under severe missingness. As an illustrative application, we estimated fine particulate matter (PM$_{2.5}$) in northern California using satellite-derived aerosol optical depth (AOD) and wildfire smoke plume indicators. Relative to a traditional collocated linear model, our approach improved out-of-sample predictive performance, reduced uncertainty, and yielded robust temporal predictions and spatial surface estimation. Our framework is extensible to additional spatio-temporally varying covariates and other kernel families.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 6 figures, Updated results section</p></details> |
| **[Rethinking the Spatio-Temporal Alignment of End-to-End 3D Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23635v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal alignment is crucial for temporal modeling of end-to-end (E2E) perception in autonomous driving (AD), providing valuable structural and textural prior information. Existing methods typically rely on the attention mechanism to align objects across frames, simplifying the motion model with a unified explicit physical model (constant velocity, etc.). These approaches prefer semantic features for implicit alignment, challenging the importance of explicit motion modeling in the traditional perception paradigm. However, variations in motion states and object features across categories and frames render this alignment suboptimal. To address this, we propose HAT, a spatio-temporal alignment module that allows each object to adaptively decode the optimal alignment proposal from multiple hypotheses without direct supervision. Specifically, HAT first utilizes multiple explicit motion models to generate spatial anchors and motion-aware feature proposals for historical instances. It then performs multi-hypothesis decoding by incorporating semantic and motion cues embedded in cached object queries, ultimately providing the optimal alignment proposal for the target frame. On nuScenes, HAT consistently improves 3D temporal detectors and trackers across diverse baselines. It achieves state-of-the-art tracking results with 46.0% AMOTA on the test set when paired with the DETR3D detector. In an object-centric E2E AD method, HAT enhances perception accuracy (+1.3% mAP, +3.1% AMOTA) and reduces the collision rate by 32%. When semantics are corrupted (nuScenes-C), the enhancement of motion modeling by HAT enables more robust perception and planning in the E2E AD.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[Long-Term Spatio-Temporal Forecasting of Monthly Rainfall in West Bengal Using Ensemble Learning Approaches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13927v2)** | 2025-12-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rainfall forecasting plays a critical role in climate adaptation, agriculture, and water resource management. This study develops long-term forecasts of monthly rainfall across 19 districts of West Bengal using a century-scale dataset spanning 1900-2019. Daily rainfall records are aggregated into monthly series, resulting in 120 years of observations for each district. The forecasting task involves predicting the next 108 months (9 years, 2011-2019) while accounting for temporal dependencies and spatial interactions among districts. To address the nonlinear and complex structure of rainfall dynamics, we propose a hierarchical modeling framework that combines regression-based forecasting of yearly features with multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) for monthly prediction. Yearly features, such as annual totals, quarterly proportions, variability measures, skewness, and extremes, are first forecasted using regression models that incorporate both own lags and neighboring-district lags. These forecasts are then integrated as auxiliary inputs into an MLP model, which captures nonlinear temporal patterns and spatial dependencies in the monthly series. The results demonstrate that the hierarchical regression-MLP architecture provides robust long-term spatio-temporal forecasts, offering valuable insights for agriculture, irrigation planning, and water conservation strategies.</p></details> | 25 pages, 22 figures |

Hence, they are critical components of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous vehicles. While many existing systems depend on multiple sensors such as LiDAR, radar, and GPS, relying solely on dash-cam videos presents a more challenging, yet more cost-effective and easily deployable solution. In this work, we incorporate improved spatio-temporal features and aggregate them through a recurrent network to enhance state-of-the-art graph neural networks for predicting accidents from dash-cam videos. Experiments using three publicly available datasets (DAD, DoTA and DADA) show that our proposed STAGNet model achieves higher average precision and mean time-to-accident scores than previous methods, both when cross-validated on a given dataset and when trained and tested on different datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE Access</p></details> |

Although recent approaches model spatial and temporal correlations, they often under-exploit two practical characteristics of real deployments: the sparse spatial distribution of locations and the heterogeneous availability of auxiliary features across locations. To address these challenges, we propose AnchorGK, an Anchor-based Incremental and Stratified Graph Learning framework for inductive spatio-temporal kriging. AnchorGK introduces anchor locations to stratify the data in a principled manner. Anchors are constructed according to feature availability, and strata are then formed around these anchors. This stratification serves two complementary roles. First, it explicitly represents and continuously updates correlations between unobserved regions and surrounding observed locations within a graph learning framework. Second, it enables the systematic use of all available features across strata via an incremental representation mechanism, mitigating feature incompleteness without discarding informative signals. Building on the stratified structure, we design a dual-view graph learning layer that jointly aggregates feature-relevant and location-relevant information, learning stratum-specific representations that support accurate inference under inductive settings. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that AnchorGK consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines for spatio-temporal kriging.</p></details> |  |

We introduce DynAttn, an interpretable dynamic-attention forecasting framework for high-dimensional spatio-temporal count processes. DynAttn combines rolling-window estimation, shared elastic-net feature gating, a compact weight-tied self-attention encoder, and a zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) likelihood. This architecture produces calibrated multi-horizon forecasts of expected casualties and exceedance probabilities, while retaining transparent diagnostics through feature gates, ablation analysis, and elasticity measures. We evaluate DynAttn using global country-level and high-resolution PRIO-grid-level conflict data from the VIEWS forecasting system, benchmarking it against established statistical and machine-learning approaches, including DynENet, LSTM, Prophet, PatchTST, and the official VIEWS baseline. Across forecast horizons from one to twelve months, DynAttn consistently achieves substantially higher predictive accuracy, with particularly large gains in sparse grid-level settings where competing models often become unstable or degrade sharply. Beyond predictive performance, DynAttn enables structured interpretation of regional conflict dynamics. In our application, cross-regional analyses show that short-run conflict persistence and spatial diffusion form the core predictive backbone, while climate stress acts either as a conditional amplifier or a primary driver depending on the conflict theater.</p></details> |  |

Despite the advances in this field, the complex and stochastic nature of this task still poses challenges to existing approaches. Specifically, deterministic models tend to produce blurry predictions while generative models often struggle with poor accuracy. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective model architecture termed STLDM, a diffusion-based model that learns the latent representation from end to end alongside both the Variational Autoencoder and the conditioning network. STLDM decomposes this task into two stages: a deterministic forecasting stage handled by the conditioning network, and an enhancement stage performed by the latent diffusion model. Experimental results on multiple radar datasets demonstrate that STLDM achieves superior performance compared to the state of the art, while also improving inference efficiency.

We explore exocentric video with ambient sensors as a non-intrusive, scalable alternative. While prior egocentric-wearable works predominantly adopt Global Alignment by encoding entire sequences into unified representations, this approach fails in exocentric-ambient settings due to two problems: (P1) inability to capture local details such as subtle motions, and (P2) over-reliance on modality-invariant temporal patterns, causing misalignment between actions sharing similar temporal patterns with different spatio-semantic contexts. To resolve these problems, we propose DETACH, a decomposed spatio-temporal framework. This explicit decomposition preserves local details, while our novel sensor-spatial features discovered via online clustering provide semantic grounding for context-aware alignment. To align the decomposed features, our two-stage approach establishes spatial correspondence through mutual supervision, then performs temporal alignment via a spatial-temporal weighted contrastive loss that adaptively handles easy negatives, hard negatives, and false negatives. Comprehensive experiments with downstream tasks on Opportunity++ and HWU-USP datasets demonstrate substantial improvements over adapted egocentric-wearable baselines.</p></details> |  |

Although many existing methods utilize multi-head attention mechanisms and message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) to capture both spatial and temporal relations, these approaches encode temporal and spatial relations independently, and reflect the graph's topological characteristics in a limited manner. In this work, we introduce the Cycle to Mixer (Cy2Mixer), a novel spatio-temporal GNN based on topological non-trivial invariants of spatio-temporal graphs with gated multi-layer perceptrons (gMLP). The Cy2Mixer is composed of three blocks based on MLPs: A temporal block for capturing temporal properties, a message-passing block for encapsulating spatial information, and a cycle message-passing block for enriching topological information through cyclic subgraphs. We bolster the effectiveness of Cy2Mixer with mathematical evidence emphasizing that our cycle message-passing block is capable of offering differentiated information to the deep learning model compared to the message-passing block. Furthermore, empirical evaluations substantiate the efficacy of the Cy2Mixer, demonstrating state-of-the-art performances across various spatio-temporal benchmark datasets.

In contrast, many real-world systems including maritime traffic lack such fixed anchors, making the construction of spatio-temporal graphs a fundamental challenge. Anomaly detection in these non-grid environments is particularly difficult due to the absence of canonical reference points, the sparsity and irregularity of trajectories, and the fact that anomalies may manifest at multiple granularities. In this work, we introduce a novel benchmark dataset for anomaly detection in the maritime domain, extending the Open Maritime Traffic Analysis Dataset (OMTAD) into a benchmark tailored for graph-based anomaly detection. Our dataset enables systematic evaluation across three different granularities: node-level, edge-level, and graph-level anomalies. We plan to employ two specialized LLM-based agents: \emph{Trajectory Synthesizer} and \emph{Anomaly Injector} to construct richer interaction contexts and generate semantically meaningful anomalies. We expect this benchmark to promote reproducibility and to foster methodological advances in anomaly detection for non-grid spatio-temporal systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025 Workshop in AI for Science: The Reach and Limits of AI for Scientific Discovery</p></details> |

However, current thermal infrared satellite sensors cannot simultaneously achieve high spatial and temporal resolution. Spatio-temporal fusion (STF) techniques address this limitation by combining complementary satellite data, one with high spatial but low temporal resolution, and another with high temporal but low spatial resolution. Existing STF techniques, from classical models to modern deep learning (DL) architectures, were primarily developed for surface reflectance (SR). Their application to thermal data remains limited and often overlooks LST-specific spatial and temporal variability. This study provides a focused review of DL-based STF methods for LST. We present a formal mathematical definition of the thermal fusion task, propose a refined taxonomy of relevant DL methods, and analyze the modifications required when adapting SR-oriented models to LST. To support reproducibility and benchmarking, we introduce a new dataset comprising 51 Terra MODIS-Landsat LST pairs from 2013 to 2024, and evaluate representative models to explore their behavior on thermal data. The analysis highlights performance gaps, architecture sensitivities, and open research challenges.

To date, long-term and accurate MJO prediction has remained a challenge for researchers. Conventional MJO prediction methods using Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) are resource-intensive, time-consuming, and highly unstable (most NWP methods are sensitive to seasons, with better MJO forecast results in winter). While existing Artificial Neural Network (ANN) methods save resources and speed forecasting, their accuracy never reaches the 28 days predicted by the state-of-the-art NWP method, i.e., the operational forecasts from ECMWF, since neural networks cannot handle climate data effectively. In this paper, we present a Domain Knowledge Embedded Spatio-Temporal Network (DK-STN), a stable neural network model for accurate and efficient MJO forecasting. It combines the benefits of NWP and ANN methods and successfully improves the forecast accuracy of ANN methods while maintaining a high level of efficiency and stability. We begin with a spatial-temporal network (STN) and embed domain knowledge in it using two key methods: (i) applying a domain knowledge enhancement method and (ii) integrating a domain knowledge processing method into network training. We evaluated DK-STN with the 5th generation of ECMWF reanalysis (ERA5) data and compared it with ECMWF. Given 7 days of climate data as input, DK-STN can generate reliable forecasts for the following 28 days in 1-2 seconds, with an error of only 2-3 days in different seasons. DK-STN significantly exceeds ECMWF in that its forecast accuracy is equivalent to ECMWF's, while its efficiency and stability are significantly superior.</p></details> | 18 pages, 10 figures |

Automatic and precise detection of behaviorally relevant neuron activity from the recordings is critical to study the mapping of brain activity in organisms. However a perpetual bottleneck to this problem is the manual segmentation which is time and labor intensive and lacks generalizability. To this end, we present a Bayesian Deep Learning Framework to detect neuronal activities in 4D spatio-temporal data obtained by light sheet microscopy. Our approach accounts for the use of temporal information by calculating pixel wise correlation maps and combines it with spatial information given by the mean summary image. The Bayesian framework not only produces probability segmentation maps but also models the uncertainty pertaining to active neuron detection. To evaluate the accuracy of our framework we implemented the test of reproducibility to assert the generalization of the network to detect neuron activity. The network achieved a mean Dice Score of 0.81 relative to the synthetic Ground Truth obtained by Otsu's method and a mean Dice Score of 0.79 between the first and second run for test of reproducibility. Our method successfully deployed can be used for rapid detection of active neuronal activities for behavioural studies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Context-Aware Network Based on Multi-scale Spatio-temporal Attention for Action Recognition in Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18750v1)** | 2025-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Action recognition is a critical task in video understanding, requiring the comprehensive capture of spatio-temporal cues across various scales. However, existing methods often overlook the multi-granularity nature of actions. To address this limitation, we introduce the Context-Aware Network (CAN). CAN consists of two core modules: the Multi-scale Temporal Cue Module (MTCM) and the Group Spatial Cue Module (GSCM). MTCM effectively extracts temporal cues at multiple scales, capturing both fast-changing motion details and overall action flow. GSCM, on the other hand, extracts spatial cues at different scales by grouping feature maps and applying specialized extraction methods to each group. Experiments conducted on five benchmark datasets (Something-Something V1 and V2, Diving48, Kinetics-400, and UCF101) demonstrate the effectiveness of CAN. Our approach achieves competitive performance, outperforming most mainstream methods, with accuracies of 50.4% on Something-Something V1, 63.9% on Something-Something V2, 88.4% on Diving48, 74.9% on Kinetics-400, and 86.9% on UCF101. These results highlight the importance of capturing multi-scale spatio-temporal cues for robust action recognition.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 4 figures.

A critical component of disease behavior is the velocity with which disease spreads, defined as the rate of change between time and space. In this paper, we propose a spatio-temporal modeling approach to determine the velocities of infectious disease spread. Our approach assumes that the locations and times of people infected can be considered as a spatio-temporal point pattern that arises as a realization of a spatio-temporal log-Gaussian Cox process. The intensity of this process is estimated using fast Bayesian inference by employing the integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) and the Stochastic Partial Differential Equations (SPDE) approaches. The velocity is then calculated using finite differences that approximate the derivatives of the intensity function. Finally, the directions and magnitudes of the velocities can be mapped at specific times to examine better the spread of the disease throughout the region. We demonstrate our method by analyzing COVID-19 spread in Cali, Colombia, during the 2020-2021 pandemic.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 46 figures, Journal American Statistican, submitted on 3rd of September</p></details> |
| **[A Distributed Hierarchical Spatio-Temporal Edge-Enhanced Graph Neural Network for City-Scale Dynamic Logistics Routing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18441v1)** | 2025-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>City-scale logistics routing has become increasingly challenging as metropolitan road networks grow to tens of millions of edges and traffic conditions evolve rapidly under high-volume mobility demands. Conventional centralized routing algorithms and monolithic graph neural network (GNN) models suffer from limited scalability, high latency, and poor real-time adaptability, which restricts their effectiveness in large urban logistics systems. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Distributed Hierarchical Spatio-Temporal Edge-Enhanced Graph Neural Network (HSTE-GNN) for dynamic routing over ultra-large road networks. The framework partitions the city-scale graph into regional subgraphs processed in parallel across distributed computing nodes, enabling efficient learning of localized traffic dynamics. Within each region, an edge-enhanced spatio-temporal module jointly models node states, dynamic edge attributes, and short-term temporal dependencies. A hierarchical coordination layer further aggregates cross-region representations through an asynchronous parameter-server mechanism, ensuring global routing coherence under high-frequency traffic updates. This distributed hierarchical design balances local responsiveness with global consistency, significantly improving scalability and inference efficiency. Experiments on real-world large-scale traffic datasets from Beijing and New York demonstrate that HSTE-GNN outperforms strong spatio-temporal baselines such as ST-GRAPH, achieving 34.9% lower routing delay, 14.7% lower MAPE, and 11.8% lower RMSE, while improving global route consistency by 7.3%. These results confirm that the proposed framework provides a scalable, adaptive, and efficient solution for next-generation intelligent transportation systems and large-scale logistics platforms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatially-informed transformers: Injecting geostatistical covariance biases into self-attention for spatio-temporal forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17696v1)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The modeling of high-dimensional spatio-temporal processes presents a fundamental dichotomy between the probabilistic rigor of classical geostatistics and the flexible, high-capacity representations of deep learning. While Gaussian processes offer theoretical consistency and exact uncertainty quantification, their prohibitive computational scaling renders them impractical for massive sensor networks. Conversely, modern transformer architectures excel at sequence modeling but inherently lack a geometric inductive bias, treating spatial sensors as permutation-invariant tokens without a native understanding of distance. In this work, we propose a spatially-informed transformer, a hybrid architecture that injects a geostatistical inductive bias directly into the self-attention mechanism via a learnable covariance kernel. By formally decomposing the attention structure into a stationary physical prior and a non-stationary data-driven residual, we impose a soft topological constraint that favors spatially proximal interactions while retaining the capacity to model complex dynamics. We demonstrate the phenomenon of ``Deep Variography'', where the network successfully recovers the true spatial decay parameters of the underlying process end-to-end via backpropagation. Extensive experiments on synthetic Gaussian random fields and real-world traffic benchmarks confirm that our method outperforms state-of-the-art graph neural networks. Furthermore, rigorous statistical validation confirms that the proposed method delivers not only superior predictive accuracy but also well-calibrated probabilistic forecasts, effectively bridging the gap between physics-aware modeling and data-driven learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Spatio-Temporal Feature Representations for Video-Based Gaze Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17673v1)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video-based gaze estimation methods aim to capture the inherently temporal dynamics of human eye gaze from multiple image frames. However, since models must capture both spatial and temporal relationships, performance is limited by the feature representations within a frame but also between multiple frames. We propose the Spatio-Temporal Gaze Network (ST-Gaze), a model that combines a CNN backbone with dedicated channel attention and self-attention modules to fuse eye and face features optimally. The fused features are then treated as a spatial sequence, allowing for the capture of an intra-frame context, which is then propagated through time to model inter-frame dynamics. We evaluated our method on the EVE dataset and show that ST-Gaze achieves state-of-the-art performance both with and without person-specific adaptation. Additionally, our ablation study provides further insights into the model performance, showing that preserving and modelling intra-frame spatial context with our spatio-temporal recurrence is fundamentally superior to premature spatial pooling. As such, our results pave the way towards more robust video-based gaze estimation using commonly available cameras.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 5 figures, the code repository is available at https://gitlab.kuleuven.be/u0172623/ST-Gaze</p></details> |
| **[Foundation for unbiased cross-validation of spatio-temporal models for species distribution modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03480v2)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating the predictive performance of species distribution models (SDMs) under realistic deployment scenarios requires careful handling of spatial and temporal dependencies in the data. Cross-validation (CV) is the standard approach for model evaluation, but its design strongly influences the validity of performance estimates. When SDMs are intended for spatial or temporal transfer, random CV can lead to overoptimistic results due to spatial autocorrelation (SAC) among neighboring observations. We benchmark four machine learning algorithms (GBM, XGBoost, LightGBM, Random Forest) on two real-world presence-absence datasets, a temperate plant and an anadromous fish, using multiple CV designs: random, spatial, spatio-temporal, environmental, and forward-chaining. Two training data usage strategies (LAST FOLD and RETRAIN) are evaluated, with hyperparameter tuning performed within each CV scheme. Model performance is assessed on independent out-of-time test sets using AUC, MAE, and correlation metrics. Random CV overestimates AUC by up to 0.16 and produces MAE values up to 80 percent higher than spatially blocked alternatives. Blocking at the empirical SAC range substantially reduces this bias. Training strategy affects evaluation outcomes: LAST FOLD yields smaller validation-test discrepancies under strong SAC, while RETRAIN achieves higher test AUC when SAC is weaker. Boosted ensemble models consistently perform best under spatially structured CV designs. We recommend a robust SDM workflow based on SAC-aware blocking, blocked hyperparameter tuning, and external temporal validation to improve reliability under spatial and temporal shifts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted manuscript.

| **[Pattern recognition in complex systems via vector-field representations of spatio-temporal data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16763v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A complex system comprises multiple interacting entities whose interdependencies form a unified whole, exhibiting emergent behaviours not present in individual components. Examples include the human brain, living cells, soft matter, Earth's climate, ecosystems, and the economy. These systems exhibit high-dimensional, non-linear dynamics, making their modelling, classification, and prediction particularly challenging. Advances in information technology have enabled data-driven approaches to studying such systems. However, the sheer volume and complexity of spatio-temporal data often hinder traditional methods like dimensionality reduction, phase-space reconstruction, and attractor characterisation. This paper introduces a geometric framework for analysing spatio-temporal data from complex systems, grounded in the theory of vector fields over discrete measure spaces. We propose a two-parameter family of metrics suitable for data analysis and machine learning applications. The framework supports time-dependent images, image gradients, and real- or vector-valued functions defined on graphs and simplicial complexes. We validate our approach using data from numerical simulations of biological and physical systems on flat and curved domains. Our results show that the proposed metrics, combined with multidimensional scaling, effectively address key analytical challenges. They enable dimensionality reduction, mode decomposition, phase-space reconstruction, and attractor characterisation. Our findings offer a robust pathway for understanding complex dynamical systems, especially in contexts where traditional modelling is impractical but abundant experimental data are available.</p></details> | 24 pages, 10 figures |
| **[A Survey on Spatio-Temporal Knowledge Graph Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16487v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many complex real-world systems exhibit inherently intertwined temporal and spatial characteristics. Spatio-temporal knowledge graphs (STKGs) have therefore emerged as a powerful representation paradigm, as they integrate entities, relationships, time and space within a unified graph structure. They are increasingly applied across diverse domains, including environmental systems and urban, transportation, social and human mobility networks. However, modeling STKGs remains challenging: their foundations span classical graph theory as well as temporal and spatial graph models, which have evolved independently across different research communities and follow heterogeneous modeling assumptions and terminologies. As a result, existing approaches often lack conceptual alignment, generalizability and reusability. This survey provides a systematic review of spatio-temporal knowledge graph models, tracing their origins in static, temporal and spatial graph modeling. We analyze existing approaches along key modeling dimensions, including edge semantics, temporal and spatial annotation strategies, temporal and spatial semantics and relate these choices to their respective application domains. Our analysis reveals that unified modeling frameworks are largely absent and that most current models are tailored to specific use cases rather than designed for reuse or long-term knowledge preservation. Based on these findings, we derive modeling guidelines and identify open challenges to guide future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[SNOW: Spatio-Temporal Scene Understanding with World Knowledge for Open-World Embodied Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16461v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous robotic systems require spatio-temporal understanding of dynamic environments to ensure reliable navigation and interaction. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) provide open-world semantic priors, they lack grounding in 3D geometry and temporal dynamics. Conversely, geometric perception captures structure and motion but remains semantically sparse. We propose SNOW (Scene Understanding with Open-World Knowledge), a training-free and backbone-agnostic framework for unified 4D scene understanding that integrates VLM-derived semantics with point cloud geometry and temporal consistency. SNOW processes synchronized RGB images and 3D point clouds, using HDBSCAN clustering to generate object-level proposals that guide SAM2-based segmentation. Each segmented region is encoded through our proposed Spatio-Temporal Tokenized Patch Encoding (STEP), producing multimodal tokens that capture localized semantic, geometric, and temporal attributes. These tokens are incrementally integrated into a 4D Scene Graph (4DSG), which serves as 4D prior for downstream reasoning. A lightweight SLAM backend anchors all STEP tokens spatially in the environment, providing the global reference alignment, and ensuring unambiguous spatial grounding across time. The resulting 4DSG forms a queryable, unified world model through which VLMs can directly interpret spatial scene structure and temporal dynamics. Experiments on a diverse set of benchmarks demonstrate that SNOW enables precise 4D scene understanding and spatially grounded inference, thereby setting new state-of-the-art performance in several settings, highlighting the importance of structured 4D priors for embodied reasoning and autonomous robotics.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Spatio-Temporal Machine Learning Model for Mortgage Credit Risk: Default Probabilities and Loan Portfolios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02846v3)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel machine learning model for credit risk by combining tree-boosting with a latent spatio-temporal Gaussian process model accounting for frailty correlation. This allows for modeling non-linearities and interactions among predictor variables in a flexible data-driven manner and for accounting for spatio-temporal variation that is not explained by observable predictor variables. We also show how estimation and prediction can be done in a computationally efficient manner. In an application to a large U.S. mortgage credit risk data set, we find that both predictive default probabilities for individual loans and predictive loan portfolio loss distributions obtained with our novel approach are more accurate compared to conventional independent linear hazard models and also linear spatio-temporal models. Using interpretability tools for machine learning models, we find that the likely reasons for this outperformance are strong interaction and non-linear effects in the predictor variables and the presence of spatio-temporal frailty effects.</p></details> |  |
| **[R4: Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning for Vision-Language Models in 4D Spatio-Temporal Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15940v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans perceive and reason about their surroundings in four dimensions by building persistent, structured internal representations that encode semantic meaning, spatial layout, and temporal dynamics. These multimodal memories enable them to recall past events, infer unobserved states, and integrate new information into context-dependent reasoning. Inspired by this capability, we introduce R4, a training-free framework for retrieval-augmented reasoning in 4D spatio-temporal space that equips vision-language models (VLMs) with structured, lifelong memory. R4 continuously constructs a 4D knowledge database by anchoring object-level semantic descriptions in metric space and time, yielding a persistent world model that can be shared across agents. At inference, natural language queries are decomposed into semantic, spatial, and temporal keys to retrieve relevant observations, which are integrated into the VLM's reasoning. Unlike classical retrieval-augmented generation methods, retrieval in R4 operates directly in 4D space, enabling episodic and collaborative reasoning without training. Experiments on embodied question answering and navigation benchmarks demonstrate that R4 substantially improves retrieval and reasoning over spatio-temporal information compared to baselines, advancing a new paradigm for embodied 4D reasoning in dynamic environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[OccSTeP: Benchmarking 4D Occupancy Spatio-Temporal Persistence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15621v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous driving requires a persistent understanding of 3D scenes that is robust to temporal disturbances and accounts for potential future actions. We introduce a new concept of 4D Occupancy Spatio-Temporal Persistence (OccSTeP), which aims to address two tasks: (1) reactive forecasting: ''what will happen next'' and (2) proactive forecasting: "what would happen given a specific future action". For the first time, we create a new OccSTeP benchmark with challenging scenarios (e.g., erroneous semantic labels and dropped frames). To address this task, we propose OccSTeP-WM, a tokenizer-free world model that maintains a dense voxel-based scene state and incrementally fuses spatio-temporal context over time. OccSTeP-WM leverages a linear-complexity attention backbone and a recurrent state-space module to capture long-range spatial dependencies while continually updating the scene memory with ego-motion compensation. This design enables online inference and robust performance even when historical sensor input is missing or noisy. Extensive experiments prove the effectiveness of the OccSTeP concept and our OccSTeP-WM, yielding an average semantic mIoU of 23.70% (+6.56% gain) and occupancy IoU of 35.89% (+9.26% gain). The data and code will be open source at https://github.com/FaterYU/OccSTeP.</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Rigid-Deformation Decomposition AI Framework for 3D Spatio-Temporal Prediction of Vehicle Collision Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19712v2)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study presents a rigid-deformation decomposition framework for vehicle collision dynamics that mitigates the spectral bias of implicit neural representations, that is, coordinate-based neural networks that directly map spatio-temporal coordinates to physical fields. We introduce a hierarchical architecture that decouples global rigid-body motion from local deformation using two scale-specific networks, denoted as RigidNet and DeformationNet. To enforce kinematic separation between the two components, we adopt a frozen-anchor training strategy combined with a quaternion-incremental scheme. This strategy alleviates the kinematic instability observed in joint training and yields a 29.8% reduction in rigid-body motion error compared with conventional direct prediction schemes. The stable rigid-body anchor improves the resolution of high-frequency structural buckling, which leads to a 17.2% reduction in the total interpolation error. Loss landscape analysis indicates that the decomposition smooths the optimization surface, which enhances robustness to distribution shifts in angular extrapolation and yields a 46.6% reduction in error. To assess physical validity beyond numerical accuracy, we benchmark the decomposed components against an oracle model that represents an upper bound on performance. The proposed framework recovers 92% of the directional correlation between rigid and deformation components and 96% of the spatial deformation localization accuracy relative to the oracle, while tracking the temporal energy dynamics with an 8 ms delay. These results demonstrate that rigid-deformation decomposition enables accurate and physically interpretable predictions for nonlinear collision dynamics.</p></details> | 38 pages, 24 figures |
| **[Question Answering Over Spatio-Temporal Knowledge Graph](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11542v2)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal knowledge graphs (STKGs) enhance traditional KGs by integrating temporal and spatial annotations, enabling precise reasoning over questions with spatio-temporal dependencies. Despite their potential, research on spatio-temporal knowledge graph question answering (STKGQA) remains limited. This is primarily due to the lack of datasets that simultaneously contain spatio-temporal information, as well as methods capable of handling implicit spatio-temporal reasoning. To bridge this gap, we introduce the spatio-temporal question answering dataset (STQAD), the first comprehensive benchmark comprising 10,000 natural language questions that require both temporal and spatial reasoning. STQAD is constructed with real-world facts containing spatio-temporal information, ensuring that the dataset reflects practical scenarios. Furthermore, our experiments reveal that existing KGQA methods underperform on STQAD, primarily due to their inability to model spatio-temporal interactions. To address this, we propose the spatio-temporal complex question answering (STCQA) method, which jointly embeds temporal and spatial features into KG representations and dynamically filters answers through constraint-aware reasoning. STCQA achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing baselines. Our work not only provides a valuable resource for future research but also advances the field by offering a robust baseline for answering complex spatio-temporal questions.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 10 figures.

Yet prior works have largely relied on standard temporal logic (TL), which models only robot trajectories and overlooks object-level interactions. Existing datasets built from randomly generated TL formulas paired with natural-language descriptions therefore cover temporal operators but fail to represent the layered spatial relations that manipulation tasks depend on. To address this gap, we introduce a dataset generation framework that synthesizes SpaTiaL specifications and converts them into natural-language descriptions through a deterministic, semantics-preserving back-translation procedure. This pipeline produces the NL2SpaTiaL dataset, aligning natural language with multi-level spatial relations and temporal objectives to reflect the compositional structure of manipulation tasks. Building on this foundation, we propose a translation-verification framework equipped with a language-based semantic checker that ensures the generated SpaTiaL formulas faithfully encode the semantics specified by the input description. Experiments across a suite of manipulation tasks show that SpaTiaL-based representations yield more interpretable, verifiable, and compositional grounding for instruction following.

Existing 2D speech-to-video diffusion models depend heavily on reference guidance, leading to limited motion diversity. At the same time, 3D-aware animation typically relies on inversion through pre-trained tri-plane generators, which often leads to imperfect reconstructions and identity drift. We rethink reference- and geometry-based paradigms in two ways. First, we deviate from strict reference conditioning at pre-training by introducing softer identity constraints. Second, we address 3D awareness implicitly within the 2D video domain by leveraging the inherent multi-view nature of video data. STARCaster adopts a compositional approach progressing from ID-aware motion modeling, to audio-visual synchronization via lip reading-based supervision, and finally to novel view animation through temporal-to-spatial adaptation. To overcome the scarcity of 4D audio-visual data, we propose a decoupled learning approach in which view consistency and temporal coherence are trained independently. A self-forcing training scheme enables the model to learn from longer temporal contexts than those generated at inference, mitigating the overly static animations common in existing autoregressive approaches. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that STARCaster generalizes effectively across tasks and identities, consistently surpassing prior approaches in different benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://foivospar.github.io/STARCaster/</p></details> |

While forecasting models generally disregard unmonitored roads by design, spatial imputation methods explicitly address network-wide estimation; yet this approach relies on volume data at inference time, limiting its applicability in sensor-scarce cities. Unlike traffic volume data, probe vehicle speeds and static road attributes are more broadly accessible and support full coverage of road segments in most urban networks. In this work, we present the Hybrid Directed-Attention Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network (HDA-STGNN), an inductive deep learning framework designed to tackle the network-wide volume estimation problem. Our approach leverages speed profiles, static road attributes, and road network topology to predict daily traffic volume profiles across all road segments in the network. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we perform extensive ablation studies that demonstrate the model's capacity to capture complex spatio-temporal dependencies and highlight the value of topological information for accurate network-wide traffic volume estimation without relying on volume data at inference time.</p></details> |  |

Our algorithm consists of two branches: spatial processing and time evolution. Regarding the spatial processing, the classical module encodes the local topological features of the road network based on the GCN method, and the quantum module is designed to map graph features onto parameterized quantum circuits through a differentiable pooling layer. The time evolution is solved by integrating multi-source contextual information and capturing dynamic trip dependencies on the classical TCN theory. Finally, our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the current methods in terms of prediction accuracy and stability, validating the unique advantages of the quantum-enhanced mechanism in capturing high-dimensional spatial dependencies.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing methods rely solely on the previous frame's features to predict temporal context, leading to two critical issues. First, the short reference window misses long-term dependencies and fine texture details. Second, propagating only feature-level information accumulates errors over frames, causing prediction inaccuracies and loss of subtle textures. To address these, we propose the Long-term Spatio-Temporal Enhanced Context (L-STEC) method. We first extend the reference chain with LSTM to capture long-term dependencies. We then incorporate warped spatial context from the pixel domain, fusing spatio-temporal information through a multi-receptive field network to better preserve reference details. Experimental results show that L-STEC significantly improves compression by enriching contextual information, achieving 37.01% bitrate savings in PSNR and 31.65% in MS-SSIM compared to DCVC-TCM, outperforming both VTM-17.0 and DCVC-FM and establishing new state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Data Compression Conference (DCC) 2026 as an oral paper</p></details> |

Adaptive delayed matching creates a trade-off between matching and pickup delays by deciding whether to assign drivers immediately or batch requests. Since outcomes accumulate over long horizons with stochastic dynamics, reinforcement learning (RL) is a suitable framework. However, existing approaches often oversimplify traffic dynamics or use shallow encoders that miss complex spatiotemporal patterns. We introduce the Regime-Aware Spatio-Temporal Mixture-of-Experts (RAST-MoE), which formalizes adaptive delayed matching as a regime-aware MDP equipped with a self-attention MoE encoder. Unlike monolithic networks, our experts specialize automatically, improving representation capacity while maintaining computational efficiency. A physics-informed congestion surrogate preserves realistic density-speed feedback, enabling millions of efficient rollouts, while an adaptive reward scheme guards against pathological strategies. With only 12M parameters, our framework outperforms strong baselines. On real-world Uber trajectory data (San Francisco), it improves total reward by over 13%, reducing average matching and pickup delays by 10% and 15% respectively. It demonstrates robustness across unseen demand regimes and stable training. These findings highlight the potential of MoE-enhanced RL for large-scale decision-making with complex spatiotemporal dynamics.</p></details> |  |

Land Surface Temperature (LST) is a key variable in this context and is retrieved from remote sensing satellites. However, these systems face a trade-off between spatial and temporal resolution. While spatio-temporal fusion methods offer promising solutions, few have addressed the estimation of daily LST at 10 m resolution. In this study, we present WGAST, a weakly-supervised generative network for daily 10 m LST estimation via spatio-temporal fusion of Terra MODIS, Landsat 8, and Sentinel-2. WGAST is the first end-to-end deep learning framework designed for this task. It adopts a conditional generative adversarial architecture, with a generator composed of four stages: feature extraction, fusion, LST reconstruction, and noise suppression. The first stage employs a set of encoders to extract multi-level latent representations from the inputs, which are then fused in the second stage using cosine similarity, normalization, and temporal attention mechanisms. The third stage decodes the fused features into high-resolution LST, followed by a Gaussian filter to suppress high-frequency noise. Training follows a weakly supervised strategy based on physical averaging principles and reinforced by a PatchGAN discriminator. Experiments demonstrate that WGAST outperforms existing methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Compared to the best-performing baseline, on average, WGAST reduces RMSE by 17.05% and improves SSIM by 4.22%. Furthermore, WGAST effectively captures fine-scale thermal patterns, as validated against near-surface air temperature measurements from 33 near-ground sensors.

In this article, we introduce the R software package deepspat, which allows for modeling, fitting and prediction with nonstationary spatial and spatio-temporal models applied to Gaussian and extremes data. The nonstationary models in our package are constructed using a deep multi-layered deformation of the original spatial or spatio-temporal domain, and are straightforward to implement. Model parameters are estimated using gradient-based optimization of customized loss functions with tensorflow, which implements automatic differentiation. The functionalities of the package are illustrated through simulation studies and an application to Nepal temperature data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Know-Show: Benchmarking Video-Language Models on Spatio-Temporal Grounded Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05513v2)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Video-Language Models (Video-LMs) have achieved impressive progress in multimodal understanding, yet their reasoning remains weakly grounded in space and time. We present Know-Show, a new benchmark designed to evaluate spatio-temporal grounded reasoning, the ability of a model to reason about actions and their semantics while simultaneously grounding its inferences in visual and temporal evidence. Know-Show unifies reasoning and localization within a single evaluation framework consisting of five complementary scenarios across spatial (person, object, person-object, and hand-object) and temporal dimensions. Built from Charades, Action Genome, and Ego4D with 2.5K human-authored questions, the benchmark exposes significant gaps between current Video-LMs and human reasoning. To bridge this gap, we propose GRAM, a training-free plug-in that augments Video-LMs with fine-grained grounding through attention-based video token selection and explicit timestamp encoding. Extensive experiments across open and closed Video-LMs (Qwen, VideoLLaVA, GPT-4o, and Gemini, etc.) reveal that existing models struggle to "show what they know" and vice versa, especially in fine-grained hand-object interactions. Know-Show establishes a unified standard for assessing grounded reasoning in video-language understanding and provides insights toward developing interpretable and reliable multimodal reasoning systems. We will release the dataset and the code at https://github.com/LUNAProject22/Know-Show.</p></details> |  |
| **[VOST-SGG: VLM-Aided One-Stage Spatio-Temporal Scene Graph Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05524v2)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal scene graph generation (ST-SGG) aims to model objects and their evolving relationships across video frames, enabling interpretable representations for downstream reasoning tasks such as video captioning and visual question answering. Despite recent advancements in DETR-style single-stage ST-SGG models, they still suffer from several key limitations. First, while these models rely on attention-based learnable queries as a core component, these learnable queries are semantically uninformed and instance-agnostically initialized. Second, these models rely exclusively on unimodal visual features for predicate classification. To address these challenges, we propose VOST-SGG, a VLM-aided one-stage ST-SGG framework that integrates the common sense reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) into the ST-SGG pipeline. First, we introduce the dual-source query initialization strategy that disentangles what to attend to from where to attend, enabling semantically grounded what-where reasoning. Furthermore, we propose a multi-modal feature bank that fuses visual, textual, and spatial cues derived from VLMs for improved predicate classification. Extensive experiments on the Action Genome dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness of integrating VLM-aided semantic priors and multi-modal features for ST-SGG. We will release the code at https://github.com/LUNAProject22/VOST.</p></details> |  |
| **[1 + 1 > 2: Detector-Empowered Video Large Language Model for Spatio-Temporal Grounding and Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06673v1)** | 2025-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal grounding and reasoning aims to locate the temporal segment and spatial region of an event in a video given a user query, while also reasoning about semantics such as causality, temporal order, and action relationships. To achieve this, current MLLMs primarily treats bounding boxes as text tokens and generates them autoregressively. However, such autoregressive spatial decoding leads to very-long output sequences, causing spatial errors to accumulated over time and the localization results to progressively drift across a video. To address this, we present a Detector-Empowered Video LLM, short for DEViL, which couples a Video LLM with an open-vocabulary detector (OVD). Specifically, the MLLM and detector are connected via a reference-semantic token (RST) that distills the user query into a rich semantic representation. Unlike tokens that merely serve as spatial prompts or segmentor switches, the RST functions as both a control signal and a replacement for the OVD's text embedding, enabling end-to-end learning of both referential understanding and spatial localization. Furthermore, we propose a tube-mined temporal regularization (TTReg) within OVD, which drives the OVD to generate temporally-consistent queries for target objects, thereby ensuring effective temporal association. Experiments demonstrate that DEViL achieves strong performance across various fine-grained video understanding tasks, particularly STVG and GroundedVQA. Code will be released on https://github.com/gaostar123/DeViL.</p></details> |  |

| **[Echo-E$^3$Net: Efficient Endocardial Spatio-Temporal Network for Ejection Fraction Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17543v2)** | 2025-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is a key indicator of cardiac function and is routinely used to diagnose heart failure and guide treatment decisions. Although deep learning has advanced automated LVEF estimation, many existing approaches are computationally demanding and underutilize the joint structure of spatial and temporal information in echocardiography videos, limiting their suitability for real-time clinical deployment. We propose Echo-E$^3$Net, an efficient endocardial spatio-temporal network specifically designed for LVEF estimation from echocardiography videos. Echo-E$^3$Net comprises two complementary modules: (1) a dual-phase Endocardial Border Detector (E$^2$CBD), which uses phase-specific cross-attention to predict ED/ES endocardial landmarks (EBs) and learn phase-aware landmark embeddings (LEs), and (2) an Endocardial Feature Aggregator (E$^2$FA), which fuses these embeddings with global statistical descriptors (mean, maximum, variance) of deep feature maps to refine EF regression. A multi-component loss function, inspired by Simpson's biplane method, jointly supervises EF, volumes, and landmark geometry, thereby aligning optimization with the clinical definition of LVEF and promoting robust spatio-temporal representation learning. Evaluated on the EchoNet-Dynamic dataset, Echo-E$^3$Net achieves an RMSE of 5.20 and an $R^2$ score of 0.82, while using only 1.54M parameters and 8.05 GFLOPs. The model operates without external pre-training, heavy data augmentation, or test-time ensembling, making it highly suitable for real-time point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) applications.

| **[Spatio-temporal Shared-Field Modeling of Beluga and Bowhead Whale Sightings Using a Joint Marked Log-Gaussian Cox Process](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06450v1)** | 2025-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We analyze a decade of aerial survey whale sighting data (2010-2019) to model the spatio-temporal distributions and group sizes of beluga (Delphinapterus leucas) and bowhead (Balaena mysticetus) whales in the United States Arctic. To jointly model these species, we develop a multi-species Log-Gaussian Cox Process (LGCP) in which species specific intensity surfaces are linked through a shared latent spatial Gaussian field. This structure allows the model to capture broad spatial patterns common to both species while still accommodating species level responses to environmental covariates and seasonal variation. The latent field is represented using the Stochastic Partial Differential Equation (SPDE) approach with an anisotropic Matern covariance, implemented on an ocean constrained triangulated mesh so that spatial dependence aligns with marine geography. Whale group size is incorporated through a marked point process extension with species specific negative binomial marks, allowing occurrence and group sizes to be jointly analyzed within a unified framework. Inference is carried out using the Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA), enabling efficient model fitting over a decade of survey effort. The results highlight persistent multi-species hotspots and distinct environmental associations for each species, demonstrating the value of shared field LGCPs for joint species distribution modeling in data sparse and heterogeneous survey settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modeling Spatio-temporal Extremes via Conditional Variational Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06348v1)** | 2025-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extreme weather events are widely studied in fields such as agriculture, ecology, and meteorology. The spatio-temporal co-occurrence of extreme events can strengthen or weaken under changing climate conditions. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to model spatio-temporal extremes by integrating climate indices via a conditional variational autoencoder (cXVAE). A convolutional neural network (CNN) is embedded in the decoder to convolve climatological indices with the spatial dependence within the latent space, thereby allowing the decoder to be dependent on the climate variables. There are three main contributions here. First, we demonstrate through extensive simulations that the proposed conditional XVAE accurately emulates spatial fields and recovers spatially and temporally varying extremal dependence with very low computational cost post training. Second, we provide a simple, scalable approach to detecting condition-driven shifts and whether the dependence structure is invariant to the conditioning variable. Third, when dependence is found to be condition-sensitive, the conditional XVAE supports counterfactual experiments allowing intervention on the climate covariate and propagating the associated change through the learned decoder to quantify differences in joint tail risk, co-occurrence ranges, and return metrics. To demonstrate the practical utility and performance of the model in real-world scenarios, we apply our method to analyze the monthly maximum Fire Weather Index (FWI) over eastern Australia from 2014 to 2024 conditioned on the El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) index.</p></details> |  |
| **[SOAP: Enhancing Spatio-Temporal Relation and Motion Information Capturing for Few-Shot Action Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16344v5)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High frame-rate (HFR) videos of action recognition improve fine-grained expression while reducing the spatio-temporal relation and motion information density. Thus, large amounts of video samples are continuously required for traditional data-driven training. However, samples are not always sufficient in real-world scenarios, promoting few-shot action recognition (FSAR) research. We observe that most recent FSAR works build spatio-temporal relation of video samples via temporal alignment after spatial feature extraction, cutting apart spatial and temporal features within samples. They also capture motion information via narrow perspectives between adjacent frames without considering density, leading to insufficient motion information capturing. Therefore, we propose a novel plug-and-play architecture for FSAR called Spatio-tempOral frAme tuPle enhancer (SOAP) in this paper. The model we designed with such architecture refers to SOAP-Net. Temporal connections between different feature channels and spatio-temporal relation of features are considered instead of simple feature extraction. Comprehensive motion information is also captured, using frame tuples with multiple frames containing more motion information than adjacent frames. Combining frame tuples of diverse frame counts further provides a broader perspective. SOAP-Net achieves new state-of-the-art performance across well-known benchmarks such as SthSthV2, Kinetics, UCF101, and HMDB51. Extensive empirical evaluations underscore the competitiveness, pluggability, generalization, and robustness of SOAP. The code is released at https://github.com/wenbohuang1002/SOAP.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM 2024</p></details> |
| **[STeP-Diff: Spatio-Temporal Physics-Informed Diffusion Models for Mobile Fine-Grained Pollution Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04385v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-grained air pollution forecasting is crucial for urban management and the development of healthy buildings. Deploying portable sensors on mobile platforms such as cars and buses offers a low-cost, easy-to-maintain, and wide-coverage data collection solution. However, due to the random and uncontrollable movement patterns of these non-dedicated mobile platforms, the resulting sensor data are often incomplete and temporally inconsistent. By exploring potential training patterns in the reverse process of diffusion models, we propose Spatio-Temporal Physics-Informed Diffusion Models (STeP-Diff). STeP-Diff leverages DeepONet to model the spatial sequence of measurements along with a PDE-informed diffusion model to forecast the spatio-temporal field from incomplete and time-varying data. Through a PDE-constrained regularization framework, the denoising process asymptotically converges to the convection-diffusion dynamics, ensuring that predictions are both grounded in real-world measurements and aligned with the fundamental physics governing pollution dispersion. To assess the performance of the system, we deployed 59 self-designed portable sensing devices in two cities, operating for 14 days to collect air pollution data. Compared to the second-best performing algorithm, our model achieved improvements of up to 89.12% in MAE, 82.30% in RMSE, and 25.00% in MAPE, with extensive evaluations demonstrating that STeP-Diff effectively captures the spatio-temporal dependencies in air pollution fields.</p></details> |  |
| **[A decay-adjusted spatio-temporal model to account for the impact of mass drug administration on neglected tropical disease prevalence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03760v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prevalence surveys are routinely used to monitor the effectiveness of mass drug administration (MDA) programmes for controlling neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). We propose a decay-adjusted spatio-temporal (DAST) model that explicitly accounts for the time-varying impact of MDA on NTD prevalence, providing a flexible and interpretable framework for estimating intervention effects from sparse survey data. Using case studies on soil-transmitted helminths and lymphatic filariasis, we show that DAST offers a practical alternative to standard geostatistical models when the objective includes quantifying MDA impact and supporting short-term programmatic forecasting. We also discuss extensions and identifiability challenges, advocating for data-driven parsimony over complexity in settings where the available data are too sparse to support the estimation of highly parameterised models.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[ToG-Bench: Task-Oriented Spatio-Temporal Grounding in Egocentric Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03666v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A core capability towards general embodied intelligence lies in localizing task-relevant objects from an egocentric perspective, formulated as Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding (STVG). Despite recent progress, existing STVG studies remain largely confined to object-centric and descriptive instructions, neglecting the task-oriented reasoning that is crucial for embodied agents to accomplish goal-directed interactions. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{ToG-Bench}, the first task-oriented spatio-temporal video grounding benchmark for egocentric videos. ToG-Bench is characterized by three key features: (1) \textbf{Task-oriented Grounding}, which requires identifying and localizing objects based on intended tasks rather than straightforward descriptions; (2) \textbf{Explicit-Implicit Dual Grounding}, where target objects can be either explicitly mentioned or implicitly inferred by contextual reasoning; (3) \textbf{One-to-Many Grounding}, where a single instruction may correspond to multiple objects involved in task execution. Built upon videos sourced from ScanNet, ToG-Bench comprises 100 annotated clips with 2,704 task-oriented grounding instructions, constructed via a semi-automated pipeline that combines foundation model annotation and human refinement. In addition, we introduce a set of task-level evaluation metrics tailored for multi-object and explicit-implicit object grounding, and systematically benchmark seven state-of-the-art MLLMs. Extensive experiments reveal the intrinsic challenges of task-oriented STVG and substantial performance gaps across explicit-implicit and multi-object grounding, highlighting the difficulty of bridging perception and interaction in embodied scenarios.

| **[GeoMAE: Masking Representation Learning for Spatio-Temporal Graph Forecasting with Missing Values](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14083v2)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ubiquity of missing data in urban intelligence systems, attributable to adverse environmental conditions and equipment failures, poses a significant challenge to the efficacy of downstream applications, notably in the realms of traffic forecasting and energy consumption prediction. Therefore, it is imperative to develop a robust spatio-temporal learning methodology capable of extracting meaningful insights from incomplete datasets. Despite the existence of methodologies for spatio-temporal graph forecasting in the presence of missing values, unresolved issues persist. Primarily, the majority of extant research is predicated on time-series analysis, thereby neglecting the dynamic spatial correlations inherent in sensor networks. Additionally, the complexity of missing data patterns compounds the intricacy of the problem. Furthermore, the variability in maintenance conditions results in a significant fluctuation in the ratio and pattern of missing values, thereby challenging the generalizability of predictive models. In response to these challenges, this study introduces GeoMAE, a self-supervised spatio-temporal representation learning model. The model is comprised of three principal components: an input preprocessing module, an attention-based spatio-temporal forecasting network (STAFN), and an auxiliary learning task, which draws inspiration from Masking AutoEncoders to enhance the robustness of spatio-temporal representation learning. Empirical evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that GeoMAE significantly outperforms existing benchmarks, achieving up to 13.20\% relative improvement over the best baseline models.</p></details> | 34 pages |

Conservation professionals urgently need timely, high-resolution predictions of biodiversity risks, especially in ecologically diverse regions like Africa. We propose EcoCast, a spatio-temporal model designed for continual biodiversity and climate risk forecasting.

The architecture is designed with support for continual learning to enable future operational deployment with new data streams. Our pilot study in Africa shows promising improvements in forecasting distributions of selected bird species compared to a Random Forest baseline, highlighting EcoCast's potential to inform targeted conservation policies. By demonstrating an end-to-end pipeline from multi-modal data ingestion to operational forecasting, EcoCast bridges the gap between cutting-edge machine learning and biodiversity management, ultimately guiding data-driven strategies for climate resilience and ecosystem conservation throughout Africa.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 3 figures, 1 table.

| **[Beyond Scaffold: A Unified Spatio-Temporal Gradient Tracking Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01732v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In distributed and federated learning algorithms, communication overhead is often reduced by performing multiple local updates between communication rounds. However, due to data heterogeneity across nodes and the local gradient noise within each node, this strategy can lead to the drift of local models away from the global optimum. To address this issue, we revisit the well-known federated learning method Scaffold (Karimireddy et al., 2020) under a gradient tracking perspective, and propose a unified spatio-temporal gradient tracking algorithm, termed ST-GT, for distributed stochastic optimization over time-varying graphs. ST-GT tracks the global gradient across neighboring nodes to mitigate data heterogeneity, while maintaining a running average of local gradients to substantially suppress noise, with slightly more storage overhead. Without assuming bounded data heterogeneity, we prove that ST-GT attains a linear convergence rate for strongly convex problems and a sublinear rate for nonconvex cases. Notably, ST-GT achieves the first linear speed-up in communication complexity with respect to the number of local updates per round $τ$ for the strongly-convex setting. Compared to traditional gradient tracking methods, ST-GT reduces the topology-dependent noise term from $σ^2$ to $σ^2/τ$, where $σ^2$ denotes the noise level, thereby improving communication efficiency.</p></details> | 13 pages |

Accurate predictive models require high-resolution spatio-temporal data to capture complex dynamics of environmental and human factors. To address the scarcity of fine-grained wildfire datasets in Spain, we introduce IberFire: a spatio-temporal dataset with 1 km x 1 km x 1-day resolution, covering mainland Spain and the Balearic Islands from December 2007 to December 2024. IberFire integrates 120 features across eight categories: auxiliary data, fire history, geography, topography, meteorology, vegetation indices, human activity and land cover. All features and processing rely on open-access data and tools, with a publicly available codebase ensuring transparency and applicability. IberFire offers enhanced spatial granularity and feature diversity compared to existing European datasets, and provides a reproducible framework. It supports advanced wildfire risk modelling via Machine Learning and Deep Learning, facilitates climate trend analysis, and informs fire prevention and land management strategies.

| **[The Dynamical Model Representation of Convolution-Generated Spatio-Temporal Gaussian Processes and Its Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01279v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Convolution-generated space-time models yield an important class of non-separable stationary Gaussian Processes (GP) through a sequence of convolution operations, in both space and time, on spatially correlated Brownian motion with a Gaussian convolution kernel. Because of its solid connection to stochastic partial differential equations, such a modeling approach offers strong physical interpretations when it is applied to scientific and engineering processes. In this paper, we obtain a new dynamical model representation for convolution-generated spatio-temporal GP. In particular, an infinite-dimensional linear state-space representation is firstly obtained where the state transition is governed by a stochastic differential equation (SDE) whose solution has the same space-time covariance as the original convolution-generated process. Then, using the Galerkin's method, a finite-dimension approximation to the infinite-dimensional SDE is obtained, yielding a dynamical model with finite states that facilitates the computation and parameter estimation. The space-time covariance of the approximated dynamical model is obtained, and the error between the approximate and exact covariance matrices is quantified. We investigate the performance of the proposed model through a simulation-based study, and apply the approach to a real case study utilizing the remote-sensing aerosol data during the recent 2025 Los Angeles wildfire. The modeling capability of the proposed approach has been well demonstrated, and the proposed approach is found particularly effective in monitoring the first-order time derivative of the underlying space-time process, making it a good candidate for process modeling, monitoring and anomaly detection problems. Computer code and data have been made publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating Spatio-Temporal Forecasting Trade-offs Between Graph Neural Networks and Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05179v2)** | 2025-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern IoT deployments for environmental sensing produce high volume spatiotemporal data to support downstream tasks such as forecasting, typically powered by machine learning models. While existing filtering and strategic deployment techniques optimize collected data volume at the edge, they overlook how variations in sampling frequencies and spatial coverage affect downstream model performance. In many forecasting models, incorporating data from additional sensors denoise predictions by providing broader spatial contexts. This interplay between sampling frequency, spatial coverage and different forecasting model architectures remain underexplored. This work presents a systematic study of forecasting models - classical models (VAR), neural networks (GRU, Transformer), spatio-temporal graph neural networks (STGNNs), and time series foundation models (TSFMs: Chronos Moirai, TimesFM) under varying spatial sensor nodes density and sampling intervals using real-world temperature data in a wireless sensor network. Our results show that STGNNs are effective when sensor deployments are sparse and sampling rate is moderate, leveraging spatial correlations via encoded graph structure to compensate for limited coverage. In contrast, TSFMs perform competitively at high frequencies but degrade when spatial coverage from neighboring sensors is reduced. Crucially, the multivariate TSFM Moirai outperforms all models by natively learning cross-sensor dependencies. These findings offer actionable insights for building efficient forecasting pipelines in spatio-temporal systems.

Recently, transformer models have shown remarkable potential in weather forecasting achieving state-of-the-art results. However, traditional transformers discretize spatio-temporal dimensions, limiting their ability to model continuous dynamical weather processes. Moreover, their reliance on increased depth to capture complex dependencies results in higher computational cost and parameter redundancy. We address these issues with STC-ViT, a Spatio-Temporal Continuous Vision Transformer for weather forecasting. STC-ViT integrates a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) for global spatial operators with a transformer parameterised Neural ODE for continuous-time dynamics, yielding a space-time continuous model for weather forecasting. Our proposed method achieves competitive forecasting performance even with a shallow, single-layer transformer encoder mitigating the reliance on deeper networks. STC-ViT generates complete forecast trajectories with an inference speed of only 0.125 seconds and achieves strong medium-range forecasting skill on 1.5-degree WeatherBench 2 as compared to state-of-the-art data-driven and NWP models trained on higher-resolution data, with substantially lower data and compute costs. We also provide detailed empirical analysis on model's performance with respect to denser time grids, higher-accuracy ODE solvers, and deeper transformer stacks.</p></details> |  |

We formalize audio 4D intelligence that is defined as reasoning over sound dynamics in time and 3D space, and introduce STAR-Bench to measure it. STAR-Bench combines a Foundational Acoustic Perception setting (six attributes under absolute and relative regimes) with a Holistic Spatio-Temporal Reasoning setting that includes segment reordering for continuous and discrete processes and spatial tasks spanning static localization, multi-source relations, and dynamic trajectories. Our data curation pipeline uses two methods to ensure high-quality samples. For foundational tasks, we use procedurally synthesized and physics-simulated audio. For holistic data, we follow a four-stage process that includes human annotation and final selection based on human performance. Unlike prior benchmarks where caption-only answering reduces accuracy slightly, STAR-Bench induces far larger drops (-31.5\% temporal, -35.2\% spatial), evidencing its focus on linguistically hard-to-describe cues. Evaluating 19 models reveals substantial gaps compared with humans and a capability hierarchy: closed-source models are bottlenecked by fine-grained perception, while open-source models lag across perception, knowledge, and reasoning. Our STAR-Bench provides critical insights and a clear path forward for developing future models with a more robust understanding of the physical world.</p></details> | <details><summary>Homep...</summary><p>Homepage: https://internlm.github.io/StarBench/</p></details> |

While PDE foundation models have shown much promise for simulating such complex spatio-temporal phenomena, existing models remain constrained by the pretraining datasets and struggle with auto-regressive rollout performance, especially in out-of-distribution (OOD) cases. Furthermore, they have significant compute and training data requirements which hamper their use in many critical applications. Inspired by recent advances in ``thinking" strategies used in large language models (LLMs), we introduce the first test-time computing (TTC) strategy for PDEs that utilizes computational resources during inference to achieve more accurate predictions with fewer training samples and smaller models. We accomplish this with two types of reward models that evaluate predictions of a stochastic based model for spatio-temporal consistency. We demonstrate this method on compressible Euler-equation simulations from the PDEGym benchmark and show that TTC captures improved predictions relative to standard non-adaptive auto-regressive inference. This TTC framework marks a foundational step towards more advanced reasoning algorithms or PDE modeling, inluding building reinforcement-learning-based approaches, potentially transforming computational workflows in physics and engineering.</p></details> |  |

We focus on redaction (erasure) mechanisms, in which data are either withheld or released unchanged, and measure utility by the average cardinality of the released set, equivalently, the expected Hamming distortion. Assuming the data are generated by a finite time-homogeneous Markov chain, we study the protection of the initial state while maximizing the amount of shared data. We establish a connection between perfect privacy and window-based redaction schemes, showing that erasing data up to a strong stationary time preserves privacy under suitable conditions. We further study an optimal sequential redaction mechanism and prove that it admits an equivalent window interpretation. Interestingly, we show that both mechanisms achieve the optimal distortion while redacting only a constant average number of data points, independent of the data length~$N$.</p></details> | 11 pages |
| **[Directional-Shift Dirichlet ARMA Models for Compositional Time Series with Structural Break Intervention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16821v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Compositional time series, vectors of proportions summing to unity observed over time, frequently exhibit structural breaks due to external shocks, policy changes, or market disruptions. Standard methods either ignore such breaks or handle them through ad-hoc dummy variables that cannot extrapolate beyond the estimation sample. We develop a Bayesian Dirichlet ARMA model augmented with a directional-shift intervention mechanism that captures structural breaks through three interpretable parameters: a unit direction vector specifying which components gain or lose share, an amplitude controlling the magnitude of redistribution, and a logistic gate governing the timing and speed of transition. The model preserves compositional constraints by construction, maintains innovation-form DARMA dynamics for short-run dependence, and produces coherent probabilistic forecasts during and after structural breaks. We establish that the directional shift corresponds to geodesic motion on the simplex and is invariant to the choice of ILR basis. A comprehensive simulation study with 400 fits across 8 scenarios demonstrates that when the shift direction is correctly identified (77.5% of cases), amplitude and timing parameters are recovered with near-zero bias, and credible intervals for the mean composition achieve nominal 80% coverage; we address the sign identification challenge through a hemisphere constraint. An empirical application to fee recognition lead-time distributions during COVID-19 compares baseline, fixed-effects, and intervention specifications in rolling forecast evaluation, demonstrating the intervention model's superior point accuracy (Aitchison distance 0.83 vs. 0.90) and calibration (87% vs. 71% coverage) during structural transitions.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-powered Real-time Patent Citation Recommendation for Financial Technologies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16775v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rapid financial innovation has been accompanied by a sharp increase in patenting activity, making timely and comprehensive prior-art discovery more difficult. This problem is especially evident in financial technologies, where innovations develop quickly, patent collections grow continuously, and citation recommendation systems must be updated as new applications arrive. Existing patent retrieval and citation recommendation methods typically rely on static indexes or periodic retraining, which limits their ability to operate effectively in such dynamic settings. In this study, we propose a real-time patent citation recommendation framework designed for large and fast-changing financial patent corpora. Using a dataset of 428,843 financial patents granted by the China National Intellectual Property Administration (CNIPA) between 2000 and 2024, we build a three-stage recommendation pipeline. The pipeline uses large language model (LLM) embeddings to represent the semantic content of patent abstracts, applies efficient approximate nearest-neighbor search to construct a manageable candidate set, and ranks candidates by semantic similarity to produce top-k citation recommendations. In addition to improving recommendation accuracy, the proposed framework directly addresses the dynamic nature of patent systems. By using an incremental indexing strategy based on hierarchical navigable small-world (HNSW) graphs, newly issued patents can be added without rebuilding the entire index. A rolling day-by-day update experiment shows that incremental updating improves recall while substantially reducing computational cost compared with rebuild-based indexing. The proposed method also consistently outperforms traditional text-based baselines and alternative nearest-neighbor retrieval approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Koopman Invariants as Drivers of Emergent Time-Series Clustering in Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09783v2)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs), a powerful class of self-supervised models, exhibit an unexplained ability to cluster time-series data by their underlying dynamical regimes. We propose a novel theoretical explanation for this phenomenon, hypothesizing that JEPA's predictive objective implicitly drives it to learn the invariant subspace of the system's Koopman operator. We prove that an idealized JEPA loss is minimized when the encoder represents the system's regime indicator functions, which are Koopman eigenfunctions. This theory was validated on synthetic data with known dynamics, demonstrating that constraining the JEPA's linear predictor to be a near-identity operator is the key inductive bias that forces the encoder to learn these invariants. We further discuss that this constraint is critical for selecting this interpretable solution from a class of mathematically equivalent but entangled optima, revealing the predictor's role in representation disentanglement. This work demystifies a key behavior of JEPAs, provides a principled connection between modern self-supervised learning and dynamical systems theory, and informs the design of more robust and interpretable time-series models.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Certificates in P and Subquadratic-Time Computation of Radius, Diameter, and all Eccentricities in Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.04660v6)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the context of fine-grained complexity, we investigate the notion of certificate enabling faster polynomial-time algorithms. We specifically target radius (minimum eccentricity), diameter (maximum eccentricity), and all-eccentricity computations for which quadratic-time lower bounds are known under plausible conjectures. In each case, we introduce a notion of certificate as a specific set of nodes from which appropriate bounds on all eccentricities can be derived in subquadratic time when this set has sublinear size. The existence of small certificates for radius, diameter and all eccentricities is a barrier against SETH-based lower bounds for these problems. We indeed prove that for graph classes with certificates of bounded size, there exist randomized subquadratic-time algorithms for computing the radius, the diameter, and all eccentricities respectively. Moreover, these notions of certificates are tightly related to algorithms probing the graph through one-to-all distance queries and allow to explain the efficiency of practical radius and diameter algorithms from the literature. In particular, our formalization enables a novel primal-dual analysis of a classical approach for diameter computation. Based on our novel insights for these problems, we introduce several new algorithmic techniques related to eccentricity computation and propose algorithms for radius, diameter and all eccentricities with theoretical guarantees with respect to certain graph parameters. This is complemented by experimental results on various types of real-world graphs showing that these parameters appear to be low in practice. Finally, we obtain refined results in the case where the input graph is a power-law random graph, has low doubling dimension, has low hyperbolicity, is chordal, satisfies some Helly-type property, or has bounded asteroidal number.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accept{é} {à} SODA 2025</p></details> |
| **[Dual-Prototype Disentanglement: A Context-Aware Enhancement Framework for Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16632v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting has witnessed significant progress with deep learning. While prevailing approaches enhance forecasting performance by modifying architectures or introducing novel enhancement strategies, they often fail to dynamically disentangle and leverage the complex, intertwined temporal patterns inherent in time series, thus resulting in the learning of static, averaged representations that lack context-aware capabilities. To address this, we propose the Dual-Prototype Adaptive Disentanglement framework (DPAD), a model-agnostic auxiliary method that equips forecasting models with the ability of pattern disentanglement and context-aware adaptation. Specifically, we construct a Dynamic Dual-Prototype bank (DDP), comprising a common pattern bank with strong temporal priors to capture prevailing trend or seasonal patterns, and a rare pattern bank dynamically memorizing critical yet infrequent events, and then an Dual-Path Context-aware routing (DPC) mechanism is proposed to enhance outputs with selectively retrieved context-specific pattern representations from the DDP. Additionally, we introduce a Disentanglement-Guided Loss (DGLoss) to ensure that each prototype bank specializes in its designated role while maintaining comprehensive coverage. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that DPAD consistently improves forecasting performance and reliability of state-of-the-art models across diverse real-world benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predicting Networks Before They Happen: Experimentation on a Real-Time V2X Digital Twin](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16559v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Emerging safety-critical Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) applications require networks to proactively adapt to rapid environmental changes rather than merely reacting to them. While Network Digital Twins (NDTs) offer a pathway to such predictive capabilities, existing solutions typically struggle to reconcile high-fidelity physical modeling with strict real-time constraints. This paper presents a novel, end-to-end real-time V2X Digital Twin framework that integrates live mobility tracking with deterministic channel simulation. By coupling the Tokyo Mobility Digital Twin-which provides live sensing and trajectory forecasting-with VaN3Twin-a full-stack simulator with ray tracing-we enable the prediction of network performance before physical events occur. We validate this approach through an experimental proof-of-concept deployed in Tokyo, Japan, featuring connected vehicles operating on 60 GHz links. Our results demonstrate the system's ability to predict Received Signal Strength (RSSI) with a maximum average error of 1.01 dB and reliably forecast Line-of-Sight (LoS) transitions within a maximum average end-to-end system latency of 250 ms, depending on the ray tracing level of detail. Furthermore, we quantify the fundamental trade-offs between digital model fidelity, computational latency, and trajectory prediction horizons, proving that high-fidelity and predictive digital twins are feasible in real-world urban environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[StarEmbed: Benchmarking Time Series Foundation Models on Astronomical Observations of Variable Stars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06200v2)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series foundation models (TSFMs) are increasingly being adopted as highly-capable general-purpose time series representation learners. Although their training corpora are vast, they exclude astronomical time series data. Observations of stars produce peta-scale time series with unique challenges including irregular sampling and heteroskedasticity. We introduce StarEmbed, the first public benchmark for rigorous and standardized evaluation of state-of-the-art TSFMs on stellar time series observations (``light curves''). We benchmark on three scientifically-motivated downstream tasks: unsupervised clustering, supervised classification, and out-of-distribution source detection. StarEmbed integrates a catalog of expert-vetted labels with multi-variate light curves from the Zwicky Transient Facility, yielding ~40k hand-labeled light curves spread across seven astrophysical classes. We evaluate the zero-shot representation capabilities of three TSFMs (MOIRAI, Chronos, Chronos-Bolt) and a domain-specific transformer (Astromer) against handcrafted feature extraction, the long-standing baseline in the astrophysics literature. Our results demonstrate that these TSFMs, especially the Chronos models, which are trained on data completely unlike the astronomical observations, can outperform established astrophysics-specific baselines in some tasks and effectively generalize to entirely new data. In particular, TSFMs deliver state-of-the-art performance on our out-of-distribution source detection benchmark. With the first benchmark of TSFMs on astronomical time series data, we test the limits of their generalization and motivate a paradigm shift in time-domain astronomy from using task-specific, fully supervised pipelines toward adopting generic foundation model representations for the analysis of peta-scale datasets from forthcoming observatories.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Large Language Models For Irregular Time Series Classification In Critical Care](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16516v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series data from the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) provides critical information for patient monitoring. While recent advancements in applying Large Language Models (LLMs) to time series modeling (TSM) have shown great promise, their effectiveness on the irregular ICU data, characterized by particularly high rates of missing values, remains largely unexplored. This work investigates two key components underlying the success of LLMs for TSM: the time series encoder and the multimodal alignment strategy. To this end, we establish a systematic testbed to evaluate their impact across various state-of-the-art LLM-based methods on benchmark ICU datasets against strong supervised and self-supervised baselines. Results reveal that the encoder design is more critical than the alignment strategy. Encoders that explicitly model irregularity achieve substantial performance gains, yielding an average AUPRC increase of $12.8\%$ over the vanilla Transformer. While less impactful, the alignment strategy is also noteworthy, with the best-performing semantically rich, fusion-based strategy achieving a modest $2.9\%$ improvement over cross-attention. However, LLM-based methods require at least 10$\times$ longer training than the best-performing irregular supervised models, while delivering only comparable performance. They also underperform in data-scarce few-shot learning settings. These findings highlight both the promise and current limitations of LLMs for irregular ICU time series. The code is available at https://github.com/mHealthUnimelb/LLMTS.</p></details> | 5 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Timely Machine: Awareness of Time Makes Test-Time Scaling Agentic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16486v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) increasingly tackle complex reasoning tasks, test-time scaling has become critical for enhancing capabilities. However, in agentic scenarios with frequent tool calls, the traditional generation-length-based definition breaks down: tool latency decouples inference time from generation length. We propose Timely Machine, redefining test-time as wall-clock time, where models dynamically adjust strategies based on time budgets. We introduce Timely-Eval, a benchmark spanning high-frequency tool calls, low-frequency tool calls, and time-constrained reasoning. By varying tool latency, we find smaller models excel with fast feedback through more interactions, while larger models dominate high-latency settings via superior interaction quality. Moreover, existing models fail to adapt reasoning to time budgets. We propose Timely-RL to address this gap. After cold-start supervised fine-tuning, we use reinforcement learning to enhance temporal planning. Timely-RL improves time budget awareness and consistently boosts performance across Timely-Eval. We hope our work offers a new perspective on test-time scaling for the agentic era.</p></details> | Under Review |

However, the literature on these measures remains fragmented, with domain-specific terminologies, inconsistent mathematical notation, and disparate visualization conventions that hinder interdisciplinary integration. This work addresses these challenges by unifying key information-theoretic time-series measures through shared semantic definitions, standardized mathematical notation, and cohesive visual representations. We compare these measures in terms of their theoretical foundations, computational formulations, and practical interpretability -- mapping them onto a common conceptual space through an illustrative case study with functional magnetic resonance imaging time series in the brain. This case study exemplifies the complementary insights these measures offer in characterizing the dynamics of complex neural systems, such as signal complexity and information flow. By providing a structured synthesis, our work aims to enhance interdisciplinary dialogue and methodological adoption, which is particularly critical for reproducibility and interoperability in computational neuroscience. More broadly, our framework serves as a resource for researchers seeking to navigate and apply information-theoretic time-series measures to diverse complex systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages (including references), 15 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

However, existing real-time HAR systems face significant challenges, including limited scalability and high computational costs arising from redundant features. To address these issues, the Inception-V3 model was customized with region-based and boundary-aware operations, using average pooling and max pooling, respectively, to enhance region homogeneity, suppress noise, and capture discriminative local features, while improving robustness through down-sampling. Furthermore, to effectively encode motion dynamics, an Attention-Augmented Long Short-Term Memory (AA-LSTM) network was employed to learn temporal dependencies across video frames. Features are extracted from video dataset and are then optimized through a novel proposed dynamic composite feature selection method called Adaptive Dynamic Fitness Sharing and Attention (ADFSA). This ADFSA mechanism is embedded within a genetic algorithm to select a compact, optimized subset of features by dynamically balancing multiple objectives, accuracy, redundancy reduction, feature uniqueness, and complexity minimization. As a result, the selected subset of diverse and discriminative features enables lightweight machine learning classifiers to achieve accurate and robust HAR in heterogeneous environments. Experimental results demonstrate up to 99.65\% accuracy using as few as seven selected features, with improved inference time on the challenging UCF-YouTube dataset, which includes factors such as occlusion, cluttered backgrounds, complex motion dynamics, and poor illumination conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 25 figures, 11 tables</p></details> |

To improve facial pose robustness, explicit geometric features are applied, but this approach remains problematic since it introduces additional dependencies and increases computational cost. Diffusion-based methods have achieved remarkable results; however, they are impractical for real-time processing. We introduce AlphaFace, which leverages an open-source vision-language model and CLIP image and text embeddings to apply novel visual and textual semantic contrastive losses. AlphaFace enables stronger identity representation and more precise attribute preservation, all while maintaining real-time performance. Comprehensive experiments across FF++, MPIE, and LPFF demonstrate that AlphaFace surpasses state-of-the-art methods in pose-challenging cases.

At the same time, many correctness arguments for classic algorithms are epistemic: a thread enters a critical region only when, from its local view, it can rule out that another thread is concurrently in that region. We make such arguments explicit by introducing a past-time temporal epistemic logic interpreted over interleaving executions with perfect-recall local histories. Past-time operators support "since" reasoning, while epistemic modalities capture what a given thread can conclude from its own observation history. We give semantics and a sound proof system, instantiate the logic to a simple shared-memory language with instrumented read/write observations, and illustrate the approach on Peterson's mutual exclusion algorithm by proving a local knowledge condition that implies mutual exclusion.</p></details> |  |
| **[State Space Models Naturally Produce Time Cell and Oscillatory Behaviors and Scale to Abstract Cognitive Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13638v2)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A grand challenge in modern neuroscience is to bridge the gap between the detailed mapping of microscale neural circuits and mechanistic understanding of cognitive functions. While extensive knowledge exists about neuronal connectivity and biophysics, how these low-level phenomena eventually produce abstract behaviors remains largely unresolved. Here, we propose that a framework based on State Space Models, an emerging class of deep learning architectures, can help bridge this gap. We suggest that the differential equations governing elements in a State Space Model are conceptually consistent with the dynamics of biophysical processes, while the model offers a scalable framework to build on the dynamics to produce emergent behaviors observed in experimental neuroscience. We test this framework by training a model employing a diagonal state transition matrix on temporal discrimination tasks with reinforcement learning. Our results suggest that neural behaviors such as time cells naturally emerge from two fundamental principles: optimal pre-configuration and rotational dynamics. These features are shown mathematically to optimize history compression, and naturally generate structured temporal dynamics even prior to training, mirroring recent findings in biological circuits. We show that learning acts primarily as a selection mechanism that fine-tunes these pre-configured oscillatory modes, rather than constructing temporal codes de novo. The model can be readily scaled to abstract cognitive functions such as event counting, supporting the use of State Space Models as a computationally tractable framework for understanding neural activities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Sen L...</summary><p>Sen Lu and Xiaoyu Zhang contributed equally.

The problem incorporates three key compartment-related features: (i) compartment flexibility in the number of compartments, (ii) item-to-compartment compatibility, and (iii) item-to-item compatibility. The problem also accommodates practical operational requirements such as driver breaks. To solve the MCVRPMTW, we develop an exact branch-and-price (B&P) algorithm in which the pricing problem is solved using a labeling algorithm. Several acceleration strategies are introduced to limit symmetry during label extensions, improve the stability of dual solutions in column generation, and enhance the branching process. To handle large-scale instances, we propose a rolling-space B&P algorithm that integrates clustering techniques into the solution framework. Extensive computational experiments on instances inspired by a real-world industrial application demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and provide useful managerial insights for practical implementation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Discover at Test Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16175v1)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>How can we use AI to discover a new state of the art for a scientific problem? Prior work in test-time scaling, such as AlphaEvolve, performs search by prompting a frozen LLM. We perform reinforcement learning at test time, so the LLM can continue to train, but now with experience specific to the test problem. This form of continual learning is quite special, because its goal is to produce one great solution rather than many good ones on average, and to solve this very problem rather than generalize to other problems. Therefore, our learning objective and search subroutine are designed to prioritize the most promising solutions. We call this method Test-Time Training to Discover (TTT-Discover). Following prior work, we focus on problems with continuous rewards. We report results for every problem we attempted, across mathematics, GPU kernel engineering, algorithm design, and biology. TTT-Discover sets the new state of the art in almost all of them: (i) Erdős' minimum overlap problem and an autocorrelation inequality; (ii) a GPUMode kernel competition (up to $2\times$ faster than prior art); (iii) past AtCoder algorithm competitions; and (iv) denoising problem in single-cell analysis. Our solutions are reviewed by experts or the organizers. All our results are achieved with an open model, OpenAI gpt-oss-120b, and can be reproduced with our publicly available code, in contrast to previous best results that required closed frontier models. Our test-time training runs are performed using Tinker, an API by Thinking Machines, with a cost of only a few hundred dollars per problem.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/test-time-training/discover</p></details> |

The generator matrix of $\mathsf{TRM}(r_1,m_1;\dots;r_t,m_t)$ is thus the tensor product of the generator matrices of the Reed-Muller codes $\mathsf{RM}(r_1,m_1),\dots, \mathsf{RM}(r_t,m_t)$. We show that for any constant rate $R$ below capacity, one can construct a Tensor Reed-Muller code $\mathsf{TRM}(r_1,m_1;\dotsc;r_t,m_t)$ of rate $R$ that is decodable in quasilinear time. For any blocklength $n$, we provide two constructions of such codes: 1) Our first construction (with $t=3$) has error probability $n^{-ω(\log n)}$ and decoding time $O(n\log\log n)$. 2) Our second construction, for any $t\geq 4$, has error probability $2^{-n^{\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{2(t-2)}-o(1)}}$ and decoding time $O(n\log n)$. One of our main tools is a polynomial-time algorithm for decoding an arbitrary tensor code $C=C_1\otimes\dotsc\otimes C_t$ from $\frac{d_{\min}(C)}{2\max\{d_{\min}(C_1),\dotsc,d_{\min}(C_t) \}}-1$ adversarial errors. Crucially, this algorithm does not require the codes $C_1,\dotsc,C_t$ to themselves be decodable in polynomial time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamical Mechanisms for Coordinating Long-term Working Memory Based on the Precision of Spike-timing in Cortical Neurons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15891v3)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the last century, most sensorimotor studies of cortical neurons relied on average firing rates. Rate coding is efficient for fast sensorimotor processing that occurs within a few seconds. Much less is known about long-term working memory with a time scale of hours (Ericsson and Kintsch, 1995). The discovery of millisecond-precision spike initiation in cortical neurons was unexpected (Mainen and Sejnowski, 1995). Even more striking was the precision of spiking in vivo, in response to rapidly fluctuating sensory inputs, suggesting that neural circuits could preserve and manipulate sensory information through spike timing. High temporal resolution enables a broader range of neural codes. It could also support spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), which is triggered by the relative timing of spikes between presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons in the millisecond range. What spike-timing mechanisms could regulate STDP in vivo? Cortical traveling waves have been observed across many frequency bands with high temporal precision. Traveling waves have wave fronts that could link spike timing to STDP. As a wave front passes through a cortical column, excitatory synapses on the dendrites of both pyramidal and basket cells are stimulated synchronously. Inhibitory basket cells form a calyx on pyramidal cell bodies, and inhibitory rebound following a strong transient hyperpolarization can trigger a backpropagating action potential, which arrives shortly after the excitatory inputs on pyramidal dendrites. STDP activated in this way could persist for hours, creating a second-tier network. This temporary network could support long-term working memory, a cognitive network riding above the long-term sensorimotor network. On their own, traveling waves and STDP have not yet yielded new insights into cortical function. Together, they could be responsible for how we think (Sejnowski, 2025).</p></details> | 31 pages, 13 figures |

The current works are still limited in their ability to perform reasoning that involves both time-series and the corresponding textual content. We address this gap by introducing Chat-TS, a large language model (LLM) based framework designed to support reasoning over time series and textual data. Unlike traditional models, Chat-TS integrates time-series tokens into LLMs' vocabulary, enhancing its reasoning ability over both modalities without compromising core natural language capabilities. To support learning and evaluation, we contribute new datasets: the TS Instruct Training Dataset (pairing diverse time-series data with relevant text instructions and responses for instruction tuning), the TS Instruct Question and Answer (QA) Gold Dataset (multiple-choice questions to evaluate multimodal reasoning), and a TS Instruct Quantitative Probing Set (a small subset of TS Instruct QA reasoning tasks alongside math and decision-making questions for LLM evaluation). We design a training strategy to preserve the inherent reasoning capabilities of LLMs while augmenting them for time-series reasoning. Experiments show that Chat-TS achieves state-of-the-art performance in multimodal reasoning tasks by maintaining strong natural language proficiency while improving time-series reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Variable Splitting Binary Tree Models Based on Bayesian Context Tree Models for Time Series Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16112v1)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a variable splitting binary tree (VSBT) model based on Bayesian context tree (BCT) models for time series segmentation. Unlike previous applications of BCT models, the tree structure in our model represents interval partitioning on the time domain. Moreover, interval partitioning is represented by recursive logistic regression models. By adjusting logistic regression coefficients, our model can represent split positions at arbitrary locations within each interval. This enables more compact tree representations. For simultaneous estimation of both split positions and tree depth, we develop an effective inference algorithm that combines local variational approximation for logistic regression with the context tree weighting (CTW) algorithm. We present numerical examples on synthetic data demonstrating the effectiveness of our model and algorithm.</p></details> |  |

The former have often been criticized as not being fully functional and losing too much information. On the other hand, unlike the latter, they take the covariance structure of the data into account by weighting the CUSUM statistics obtained after dimension reduction with the inverse covariance matrix. In this paper, as a middle ground between these two approaches, we propose an alternative statistic that includes the covariance structure with an offset parameter to produce a scale-invariant test procedure and to increase power when the change is not aligned with the first components. We obtain the asymptotic distribution under the null hypothesis for this new test statistic, allowing for time dependence of the data. Furthermore, we introduce versions of all three test statistics for gradual change situations, which have not been previously considered for functional data, and derive their limit distribution. Further results shed light on the asymptotic power behavior for all test statistics under various ground truths for the alternatives.</p></details> |  |

While numerous imputation algorithms have been developed to repair these data gaps, existing time series libraries provide limited imputation support. Furthermore, they often lack the ability to simulate realistic time series missingness patterns and fail to account for the impact of the imputed data on subsequent downstream analysis. This paper introduces ImputeGAP, a comprehensive library for time series imputation that supports a diverse range of imputation methods and modular missing data simulation, catering to datasets with varying characteristics.

Existing alignment methods present a difficult trade-off: fine-tuning approaches suffer from loss of diversity with reward over-optimization, while test-time scaling methods introduce significant computational overhead and tend to under-optimize. To address these limitations, we propose HyperAlign, a novel framework that trains a hypernetwork for efficient and effective test-time alignment. Instead of modifying latent states, HyperAlign dynamically generates low-rank adaptation weights to modulate the diffusion model's generation operators. This allows the denoising trajectory to be adaptively adjusted based on input latents, timesteps and prompts for reward-conditioned alignment. We introduce multiple variants of HyperAlign that differ in how frequently the hypernetwork is applied, balancing between performance and efficiency. Furthermore, we optimize the hypernetwork using a reward score objective regularized with preference data to reduce reward hacking. We evaluate HyperAlign on multiple extended generative paradigms, including Stable Diffusion and FLUX. It significantly outperforms existing fine-tuning and test-time scaling baselines in enhancing semantic consistency and visual appeal.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Large Language Models for Time-Series Forecasting via Vector-Injected In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07903v3)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The World Wide Web needs reliable predictive capabilities to respond to changes in user behavior and usage patterns. Time series forecasting (TSF) is a key means to achieve this goal. In recent years, the large language models (LLMs) for TSF (LLM4TSF) have achieved good performance. However, there is a significant difference between pretraining corpora and time series data, making it hard to guarantee forecasting quality when directly applying LLMs to TSF; fine-tuning LLMs can mitigate this issue, but often incurs substantial computational overhead. Thus, LLM4TSF faces a dual challenge of prediction performance and compute overhead. To address this, we aim to explore a method for improving the forecasting performance of LLM4TSF while freezing all LLM parameters to reduce computational overhead. Inspired by in-context learning (ICL), we propose LVICL. LVICL uses our vector-injected ICL to inject example information into a frozen LLM, eliciting its in-context learning ability and thereby enhancing its performance on the example-related task (i.e., TSF). Specifically, we first use the LLM together with a learnable context vector adapter to extract a context vector from multiple examples adaptively. This vector contains compressed, example-related information. Subsequently, during the forward pass, we inject this vector into every layer of the LLM to improve forecasting performance. Compared with conventional ICL that adds examples into the prompt, our vector-injected ICL does not increase prompt length; moreover, adaptively deriving a context vector from examples suppresses components harmful to forecasting, thereby improving model performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |

This task requires a strict latency-accuracy trade-off, with motion-to-photon (MTP) latency kept below 140 ms to maintain contingency. However, most off-the-shelf Deep Learning models prioritize accuracy over the strict timing constraints of commodity hardware. As a first step toward accessible VR therapy, we benchmark State-of-the-Art (SOTA) models for Zero-Shot Facial Expression Recognition (FER) on virtual characters using the UIBVFED dataset. We evaluate Medium and Nano variants of YOLO (v8, v11, and v12) for face detection, alongside general-purpose Vision Transformers including CLIP, SigLIP, and ViT-FER.Our results on CPU-only inference demonstrate that while face detection on stylized avatars is robust (100% accuracy), a "Latency Wall" exists in the classification stage. The YOLOv11n architecture offers the optimal balance for detection (~54 ms). However, general-purpose Transformers like CLIP and SigLIP fail to achieve viable accuracy (<23%) or speed (>150 ms) for real-time loops. This study highlights the necessity for lightweight, domain-specific architectures to enable accessible, real-time AI in therapeutic settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report benchmarking off-the-shelf CV latencies on commodity CPU hardware for therapeutic VR applications</p></details> |

However, such a refined representation for scene understanding incurs prohibitive computation and memory overhead, posing a major barrier to practical real-time deployment. To address this, we propose SUG-Occ, an explicit Semantics and Uncertainty Guided Sparse Learning Enabled 3D Occupancy Prediction Framework, which exploits the inherent sparsity of 3D scenes to reduce redundant computation while maintaining geometric and semantic completeness. Specifically, we first utilize semantic and uncertainty priors to suppress projections from free space during view transformation while employing an explicit unsigned distance encoding to enhance geometric consistency, producing a structurally consistent sparse 3D representation. Secondly, we design an cascade sparse completion module via hyper cross sparse convolution and generative upsampling to enable efficiently coarse-to-fine reasoning. Finally, we devise an object contextual representation (OCR) based mask decoder that aggregates global semantic context from sparse features and refines voxel-wise predictions via lightweight query-context interactions, avoiding expensive attention operations over volumetric features. Extensive experiments on SemanticKITTI benchmark demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the baselines, achieving a 7.34/% improvement in accuracy and a 57.8\% gain in efficiency.</p></details> |  |

Traditional farming methods rely on manual observation and periodic watering, often leading to water wastage, inconsistent plant growth, and delayed response to environmental changes. This paper presents a comprehensive IoT-based smart plant monitoring system that integrates multiple environmental sensors with automated irrigation and cloud analytics. The proposed system utilizes an ESP32 microcontroller to collect real-time data from DHT22 (temperature/humidity), HC-SR04 (water level), and soil moisture sensors, with visual feedback through an OLED display and auditory alerts via a buzzer. All sensor data is wirelessly transmitted to the ThingSpeak cloud platform for remote monitoring, historical analysis, and automated alert generation. Experimental results demonstrate the system's effectiveness in maintaining optimal soil moisture levels (with 92\% accuracy), providing real-time environmental monitoring, and reducing water consumption by approximately 40\% compared to conventional irrigation methods. The integrated web dashboard offers comprehensive visualization of plant health parameters, making it suitable for both small-scale gardening and commercial agriculture applications. With a total implementation cost of \$45.20, this system provides an affordable, scalable solution for precision agriculture and smart farming.</p></details> |  |

A major empirical bottleneck in this area is the shortage of accurate and robust evaluation metrics for many languages, which hinders progress. Recent studies suggest that multilingual language models often use English as an internal pivot language, and that misalignment with this pivot can lead to degraded downstream performance. Motivated by the hypothesis that this mismatch could also apply to multilingual neural metrics, we ask whether steering their activations toward an English pivot can improve correlation with human judgments. We experiment with encoder- and decoder-based metrics and find that test-time intervention methods are effective across the board, increasing metric effectiveness for diverse languages.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ACL 2026</p></details> |

While the majority of existing efforts focus on enhancing policy capabilities via post-training, we propose an alternative paradigm: self-evolving the agent's ability by iteratively verifying the policy model's outputs, guided by meticulously crafted rubrics. This approach gives rise to the inference-time scaling of verification, wherein an agent self-improves by evaluating its generated answers to produce iterative feedback and refinements. We derive the rubrics based on an automatically constructed DRA Failure Taxonomy, which systematically classifies agent failures into five major categories and thirteen sub-categories. We present DeepVerifier, a rubrics-based outcome reward verifier that leverages the asymmetry of verification and outperforms vanilla agent-as-judge and LLM judge baselines by 12%-48% in meta-evaluation F1 score. To enable practical self-evolution, DeepVerifier integrates as a plug-and-play module during test-time inference. The verifier produces detailed rubric-based feedback, which is fed back to the agent for iterative bootstrapping, refining responses without additional training. This test-time scaling delivers 8%-11% accuracy gains on challenging subsets of GAIA and XBench-DeepResearch when powered by capable closed-source LLMs. Finally, to support open-source advancement, we release DeepVerifier-4K, a curated supervised fine-tuning dataset of 4,646 high-quality agent steps focused on DRA verification. These examples emphasize reflection and self-critique, enabling open models to develop robust verification capabilities.</p></details> |  |

Despite its success, the deterministic architecture of xLSTM limits its representational capacity and forecasting performance, especially on challenging real-world time series datasets characterized by inherent uncertainty, stochasticity, and complex hierarchical latent dynamics. In this work, we propose StoxLSTM, a stochastic xLSTM within a designed state space modeling framework, which integrates latent stochastic variables directly into the recurrent units to effectively model deep latent temporal dynamics and uncertainty. The designed state space model follows an efficient non-autoregressive generative approach, achieving strong predictive performance without complex modifications to the original xLSTM architecture. Extensive experiments on publicly available benchmark datasets demonstrate that StoxLSTM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving superior performance and generalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dualformer: Time-Frequency Dual Domain Learning for Long-term Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15669v1)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based models, despite their promise for long-term time series forecasting (LTSF), suffer from an inherent low-pass filtering effect that limits their effectiveness. This issue arises due to undifferentiated propagation of frequency components across layers, causing a progressive attenuation of high-frequency information crucial for capturing fine-grained temporal variations. To address this limitation, we propose Dualformer, a principled dual-domain framework that rethinks frequency modeling from a layer-wise perspective. Dualformer introduces three key components: (1) a dual-branch architecture that concurrently models complementary temporal patterns in both time and frequency domains; (2) a hierarchical frequency sampling module that allocates distinct frequency bands to different layers, preserving high-frequency details in lower layers while modeling low-frequency trends in deeper layers; and (3) a periodicity-aware weighting mechanism that dynamically balances contributions from the dual branches based on the harmonic energy ratio of inputs, supported theoretically by a derived lower bound. This design enables structured frequency modeling and adaptive integration of time-frequency features, effectively preserving high-frequency information and enhancing generalization. Extensive experiments conducted on eight widely used benchmarks demonstrate Dualformer's robustness and superior performance, particularly on heterogeneous or weakly periodic data. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Akira-221/Dualformer.</p></details> |  |

While attack traffic can often be layered into training environments using red-teaming or replay methods, generating authentic benign background traffic remains a core challenge -- particularly in simulating the complex temporal and communication dynamics of real-world networks. This paper introduces TempoNet, a novel generative model that combines multi-task learning with multi-mark temporal point processes to jointly model inter-arrival times and all packet- and flow-header fields. TempoNet captures fine-grained timing patterns and higher-order correlations such as host-pair behavior and seasonal trends, addressing key limitations of GAN-, LLM-, and Bayesian-based methods that fail to reproduce structured temporal variation. TempoNet produces temporally consistent, high-fidelity traces, validated on real-world datasets. Furthermore, we show that intrusion detection models trained on TempoNet-generated background traffic perform comparably to those trained on real data, validating its utility for real-world security applications.</p></details> |  |

Existing streaming systems rely on fixed-interval decoding or cache pruning, which either produce repetitive outputs or discard crucial temporal information. We introduce Event-VStream, an event-aware framework that represents continuous video as a sequence of discrete, semantically coherent events. Our system detects meaningful state transitions by integrating motion, semantic, and predictive cues, and triggers language generation only at those boundaries. Each event embedding is consolidated into a persistent memory bank, enabling long-horizon reasoning while maintaining low latency. Across OVOBench-Realtime, and long-form Ego4D evaluations, Event-VStream achieves competitive performance. It improves over a VideoLLM-Online-8B baseline by +10.4 points on OVOBench-Realtime, achieves performance close to Flash-VStream-7B despite using only a general-purpose LLaMA-3-8B text backbone, and maintains around 70% GPT-5 win rate on 2-hour Ego4D streams.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we extend it with DINOv3 features, resulting in DEIMv2. DEIMv2 spans eight model sizes from X to Atto, covering GPU, edge, and mobile deployment. For the X, L, M, and S variants, we adopt DINOv3-pretrained or distilled backbones and introduce a Spatial Tuning Adapter (STA), which efficiently converts DINOv3's single-scale output into multi-scale features and complements strong semantics with fine-grained details to enhance detection. For ultra-lightweight models (Nano, Pico, Femto, and Atto), we employ HGNetv2 with depth and width pruning to meet strict resource budgets. Together with a simplified decoder and an upgraded Dense O2O, this unified design enables DEIMv2 to achieve a superior performance-cost trade-off across diverse scenarios, establishing new state-of-the-art results. Notably, our largest model, DEIMv2-X, achieves 57.8 AP with only 50.3 million parameters, surpassing prior X-scale models that require over 60 million parameters for just 56.5 AP. On the compact side, DEIMv2-S is the first sub-10 million model (9.71 million) to exceed the 50 AP milestone on COCO, reaching 50.9 AP. Even the ultra-lightweight DEIMv2-Pico, with just 1.5 million parameters, delivers 38.5 AP, matching YOLOv10-Nano (2.3 million) with around 50 percent fewer parameters.

However, for robots to navigate and operate seamlessly, efficiently and reliably, they must have an accurate understanding of both their surrounding environment and the quality of radio signals. Achieving this in highly dynamic and ever-changing environments remains a challenging and largely unsolved problem. In this paper, we introduce MapViT, a two-stage Vision Transformer (ViT)-based framework inspired by the success of pre-train and fine-tune paradigm for Large Language Models (LLMs). MapViT is designed to predict both environmental changes and expected radio signal quality. We evaluate the framework using a set of representative Machine Learning (ML) models, analyzing their respective strengths and limitations across different scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed two-stage pipeline enables real-time prediction, with the ViT-based implementation achieving a strong balance between accuracy and computational efficiency. This makes MapViT a promising solution for energy- and resource-constrained platforms such as mobile robots. Moreover, the geometry foundation model derived from the self-supervised pre-training stage improves data efficiency and transferability, enabling effective downstream predictions even with limited labeled data. Overall, this work lays the foundation for next-generation digital twin ecosystems, and it paves the way for a new class of ML foundation models driving multi-modal intelligence in future 6G-enabled systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication at IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC) 2026</p></details> |

Although prior approaches such as Tent, EATA etc. provide meaningful improvements under short evolving shifts, they struggle when the test distribution changes rapidly or over extremely long horizons. This challenge is exemplified by the CCC benchmark, where models operate over streams of 7.5M samples with continually changing corruption types and severities. We propose RDumb++, a principled extension of RDumb that introduces two drift-detection mechanisms i.e entropy-based drift scoring and KL-divergence drift scoring, together with adaptive reset strategies. These mechanisms allow the model to detect when accumulated adaptation becomes harmful and to recover before prediction collapse occurs. Across CCC-medium with three speeds and three seeds (nine runs, each containing one million samples), RDumb++ consistently surpasses RDumb, yielding approx 3% absolute accuracy gains while maintaining stable adaptation throughout the entire stream. Ablation experiments on drift thresholds and reset strengths further show that drift-aware resetting is essential for preventing collapse and achieving reliable long-horizon CTTA.</p></details> |  |

While domain adaptation and fine-tuning are widely studied, they require either source data or labelled target data, which are often unavailable or raise privacy concerns in SER. Test-time adaptation (TTA) bridges this gap by adapting models at inference using only unlabeled target data. Yet, having been predominantly designed for image classification and speech recognition, the efficacy of TTA for mitigating the unique domain shifts in SER has not been investigated. In this paper, we present the first systematic evaluation and comparison covering 11 TTA methods across three representative SER tasks. The results indicate that backpropagation-free TTA methods are the most promising. Conversely, entropy minimization and pseudo-labeling generally fail, as their core assumption of a single, confident ground-truth label is incompatible with the inherent ambiguity of emotional expression. Further, no single method universally excels, and its effectiveness is highly dependent on the distributional shifts and tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 2026 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP 2026)</p></details> |

T. Parker constructed an orthogonal pair of $10\times10$ Latin squares in 1959, an orthogonal triple of $10\times10$ Latin squares has been one of the most sought-after combinatorial designs. Despite extensive work, the existence of such an orthogonal triple remains an open problem, though some negative results are known. In 1999, W. Myrvold derived some highly restrictive constraints in the special case in which one of the Latin squares in the triple contains a $4\times4$ Latin subsquare. In particular, Myrvold showed there were twenty-eight possible cases for an orthogonal pair in such a triple, twenty of which were removed from consideration. We implement a computational approach that quickly verifies all of Myrvold's nonexistence results and in the remaining eight cases finds explicit examples of orthogonal pairs -- thus explaining for the first time why Myrvold's approach left eight cases unsolved. As a consequence, the eight remaining cases cannot be removed by a strategy of focusing on the existence of an orthogonal pair; the third square in the triple must necessarily be considered as well. Our approach uses a Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solver to derive the nonexistence of twenty of the orthogonal pair types and find explicit examples of orthogonal pairs in the eight remaining cases. To reduce the existence problem into Boolean logic we use a duality between the concepts of transversal representation and orthogonal pair and we provide a formulation of this duality in terms of a composition operation on Latin squares. Using our SAT encoding, we find transversal representations (and equivalently orthogonal pairs) in the remaining eight cases in under two hours of computing on a large computing cluster.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in the Electronic Journal of Combinatorics</p></details> |

We study Secchi Disk Depth (SDD) forecasting on a 30-lake, data-rich subset drawn from three decades of in situ records collected across Maine lakes. Missingness is handled via Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE), and we evaluate performance with a normalized Mean Absolute Error (nMAE) metric for cross-lake comparability. Among six candidates, ridge regression provides the best mean test performance. Using ridge regression, we then quantify the minimal sample size, showing that under a backward, recent-history protocol, the model reaches within 5% of full-history accuracy with approximately 176 training samples per lake on average. We also identify a minimal feature set, where a compact four-feature subset matches the thirteen-feature baseline within the same 5% tolerance. Bringing these results together, we introduce a joint feasibility function that identifies the minimal training history and fewest predictors sufficient to achieve the target of staying within 5% of the complete-history, full-feature baseline. In our study, meeting the 5% accuracy target required about 64 recent samples and just one predictor per lake, highlighting the practicality of targeted monitoring. Hence, our joint feasibility strategy unifies recent-history length and feature choice under a fixed accuracy target, yielding a simple, efficient rule for setting sampling effort and measurement priorities for lake researchers.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Martingale Foresight Sampling: A Principled Approach to Inference-Time LLM Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15482v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Standard autoregressive decoding in large language models (LLMs) is inherently short-sighted, often failing to find globally optimal reasoning paths due to its token-by-token generation process. While inference-time strategies like foresight sampling attempt to mitigate this by simulating future steps, they typically rely on ad-hoc heuristics for valuing paths and pruning the search space. This paper introduces Martingale Foresight Sampling (MFS), a principled framework that reformulates LLM decoding as a problem of identifying an optimal stochastic process. By modeling the quality of a reasoning path as a stochastic process, we leverage Martingale theory to design a theoretically-grounded algorithm. Our approach replaces heuristic mechanisms with principles from probability theory: step valuation is derived from the Doob Decomposition Theorem to measure a path's predictable advantage, path selection uses Optional Stopping Theory for principled pruning of suboptimal candidates, and an adaptive stopping rule based on the Martingale Convergence Theorem terminates exploration once a path's quality has provably converged. Experiments on six reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that MFS surpasses state-of-the-art methods in accuracy while significantly improving computational efficiency. Code will be released at https://github.com/miraclehetech/EACL2026-Martingale-Foresight-Sampling.</p></details> |  |

Selecting appropriate thresholds is a non-trivial task, typically relying on optimizing performance on a validation dataset. However, such greedy threshold selection often leads to suboptimal performance on unseen data, particularly in varying or noisy acoustic environments or few-shot settings. In this work, we investigate detection threshold estimation for template-based open-set few-shot KWS using dynamic time warping on noisy speech data. To mitigate the performance degradation caused by suboptimal thresholds, we propose a score calibration approach that operates at the embedding level by quantizing learned representations and applying quantization error-based normalization prior to DTW-based scoring and thresholding. Experiments on KWS-DailyTalk with simulated high frequency radio channels show that the proposed calibration approach simplifies the selection of robust detection thresholds and significantly improves the resulting performance.</p></details> |  |

While invaluable, repeated tuning on a fixed suite can inflate reported scores and obscure real-world robustness. We introduce the Paraphrasing Text Embedding Benchmark (PTEB), a dynamic protocol that stochastically generates meaning-preserving paraphrases at evaluation time and aggregates results across multiple runs. Using a cost-efficient LLM-based method grounded in gold ratings and human validation, we show that LLMs generate token-diverse but semantically preserving paraphrases. Across 7 MTEB tasks, we validate our hypothesis that the performance of sentence encoders is sensitive to changes in token space even when semantics remain fixed. We also observe that smaller models are not disproportionately affected relative to larger ones. Our results are statistically robust over multiple runs spanning 20 datasets and 25 languages. More generally, we aim to propose a new evaluation paradigm in NLP that relies less on static, pre-defined benchmarks but shifts towards dynamic, stochastic evaluation leveraging eval-time compute.</p></details> |  |

We investigate how real-time facial communication influences cooperation in repeated social dilemmas. In a laboratory experiment, participants play a repeated Prisoner's Dilemma game under two conditions: in one, they observe their counterpart's facial expressions via gender-neutral avatars, and in the other no facial cues are available. Using state-of-the-art biometric technology to capture and display emotions in real-time, we find that facial communication significantly increases overall cooperation and, notably, promotes cooperation following defection. This restorative effect suggests that facial expressions help participants interpret defections less harshly, fostering forgiveness and the resumption of cooperation. While past actions remain the strongest predictor of behavior, our findings highlight the communicative power of facial expressions in shaping strategic outcomes. These results offer practical insights for designing emotionally responsive virtual agents and digital platforms that sustain cooperation in the absence of physical presence.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 12 figures.

Analyzing Review Quality across Venues and Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15172v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Peer review is at the heart of modern science. As submission numbers rise and research communities grow, the decline in review quality is a popular narrative and a common concern. Yet, is it true? Review quality is difficult to measure, and the ongoing evolution of reviewing practices makes it hard to compare reviews across venues and time. To address this, we introduce a new framework for evidence-based comparative study of review quality and apply it to major AI and machine learning conferences: ICLR, NeurIPS and *ACL. We document the diversity of review formats and introduce a new approach to review standardization. We propose a multi-dimensional schema for quantifying review quality as utility to editors and authors, coupled with both LLM-based and lightweight measurements. We study the relationships between measurements of review quality, and its evolution over time. Contradicting the popular narrative, our cross-temporal analysis reveals no consistent decline in median review quality across venues and years. We propose alternative explanations, and outline recommendations to facilitate future empirical studies of review quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Real-Time Error Prevention System for Gaze-Based Interaction in Virtual Reality Based on Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15146v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gaze-based interaction enables intuitive, hands-free control in immersive environments, but remains susceptible to unintended inputs. We present a real-time error prevention system (EPS) that uses a temporal convolutional network autoencoder (TCNAE) to detect anomalies in gaze dynamics during selection tasks. In a visual search task in VR, 41 participants used three gaze-based methods - dwell time, gaze and head direction alignment, and nod - with and without EPS. The system reduced erroneous selections by up to 95% for dwell time and gaze and head, and was positively received by most users. Performance varied for nodding and between individuals, suggesting the need for adaptive systems. Objective metrics and subjective evaluations show that anomaly-based error prevention can improve gaze interfaces without disrupting interaction. These findings demonstrate the potential of anomaly-based error prevention for gaze interfaces and suggest applications in VR, AR, and assistive technologies.</p></details> |  |

In this routing problem, the objective is to maximize the number of customer requests served within a finite time horizon. We present a novel routing network embedding module which creates local node embedding vectors and a context-aware global graph representation. The proposed Markov decision process for the vehicle routing problem incorporates the node features, the network adjacency matrix and the edge features as components of the state space. We incorporate the remaining finite time horizon into the network embedding module to provide a proper routing context to the embedding module. We integrate our embedding module with a policy gradient-based deep Reinforcement Learning framework to solve the vehicle routing problem with finite time horizon. We trained and validated our proposed routing method on real-world routing networks, as well as synthetically generated Euclidean networks. Our experimental results show that our method achieves a higher customer service rate than the existing routing methods. Additionally, the solution time of our method is significantly lower than that of the existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI-26 Workshop on AI for Urban Planning</p></details> |

However, their effectiveness depends critically on the quality and structure of input representations derived from raw multivariate time-series data, particularly as sequence length and data scale increase. This paper proposes a two-stage forecasting framework that explicitly separates local temporal representation learning from global dependency modelling. In the proposed approach, a convolutional neural network operates on fixed-length temporal patches to extract short-range temporal dynamics and non-linear feature interactions, producing compact patch-level token embeddings. Token-level self-attention is applied during representation learning to refine these embeddings, after which a Transformer encoder models inter-patch temporal dependencies to generate forecasts. The method is evaluated on a synthetic multivariate time-series dataset with controlled static and dynamic factors, using an extended sequence length and a larger number of samples. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently outperforms a convolutional baseline under increased temporal context and remains competitive with a strong patch-based Transformer model. These findings indicate that structured patch-level tokenization provides a scalable and effective representation for multivariate time-series forecasting, particularly when longer input sequences are considered.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Polynomial-Time Algorithms for Computing the Nucleolus: An Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16517v2)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Maggiorano et al. (2025) claimed that they have developed a strongly polynomial-time combinatorial algorithm for the nucleolus in convex games that is based on the reduced game approach and submodular function minimization method. Thereby, avoiding the ellipsoid method with its negative side effects in numerical computation completely. However, we shall argue that this is a fallacy based on an incorrect application of the Davis/Maschler reduced game property (RGP). Ignoring the fact that despite the pre-nucleolus, other solutions like the core, pre-kernel, and semi-reactive pre-bargaining set possess this property as well. This causes a severe selection issue, leading to the failure to compute the nucleolus of convex games using the reduced games approach. In order to assess this finding in its context, the ellipsoid method of Faigle et al. (2001) and the Fenchel-Moreau conjugation-based approach from convex analysis of Meinhardt (2013) to compute a pre-kernel element were resumed. In the latter case, it was exploited that for TU games with a single-valued pre-kernel, both solution concepts coincide. Implying that one has computed the pre-nucleolus if one has found the sole pre-kernel element of the game. Though it is a specialized and highly optimized algorithm for the pre-kernel, it assures runtime complexity of O(n^3) for computing the pre-nucleolus whenever the pre-kernel is a single point, which indicates a polynomial-time algorithm for this class of games.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 1 figure, 1 table</p></details> |

| **[Complexity Gaps between Point and Interval Temporal Graphs for some Reachability Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11380v2)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal graphs arise when modeling interactions that evolve over time. They usually come in several flavors, depending on the number of parameters used to describe the temporal aspects of the interactions: time of appearance, duration, delay of transmission. In the point model, edges appear at specific points in time, whereas in the more general interval model, edges can be present over specific time intervals. In both models, the delay for traversing an edge can change with each edge appearance. When time is discrete, the two models are equivalent in the sense that the presence of an edge during an interval is equivalent to a sequence of point-in-time occurrences of the edge. However, this transformation can drastically change the size of the input and has implications for complexity. Indeed, we show a gap between the two models with respect to the complexity of the classical problem of computing a fastest temporal path from a source vertex to a target vertex, i.e. a path where edges can be traversed one after another in time and such that the total duration from source to target is minimized. It can be solved in near-linear time in the point model, while we show that the interval model requires quadratic time under classical assumptions of fine-grained complexity. With respect to linear time, our lower bound implies a factor of the number of vertices, while the best known algorithm has a factor of the number of underlying edges. We also show a similar complexity gap for computing a shortest temporal path, i.e. a temporal path with a minimum number of edges. Here our lower bound matches known upper bounds up to a logarithmic factor. Interestingly, we show that near-linear time for fastest temporal path computation is possible in the interval model when it is restricted to uniform delay zero, i.e., when traversing an edge is instantaneous. However, this special case is not exempt from our lower bound for shortest temporal path computation. These two results should be contrasted with the computation of a foremost temporal path, i.e., a temporal path that arrives as early as possible. It is well known that this computation can be solved in near-linear time in both models. We also show that there is no gap in testing the all-to-all temporal connectivity of a temporal graph. We demonstrate a quadratic lower bound that applies to both the interval and point models and aligns with the existing upper bounds.</p></details> |  |

Effective battery health management is essential for battery system safety, cost-efficiency, and sustainability. In this paper, we propose Pace, a physics-aware attentive temporal convolutional network for battery health estimation. Pace integrates raw sensor measurements with battery physics features derived from the equivalent circuit model. We develop three battery-specific modules, including dilated temporal blocks for efficient temporal encoding, chunked attention blocks for context modeling, and a dual-head output block for fusing short- and long-term battery degradation patterns. Together, the modules enable Pace to predict battery health accurately and efficiently in various battery usage conditions. In a large public dataset, Pace performs much better than existing models, achieving an average performance improvement of 6.5 and 2.0x compared to two best-performing baseline models. We further demonstrate its practical viability with a real-time edge deployment on a Raspberry Pi. These results establish Pace as a practical and high-performance solution for battery health analytics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the ACM Symposium On Applied Computing (SAC), 2026</p></details> |

These approaches suffer from coordination overhead that scales poorly with agent count and task complexity. We propose a fundamentally different paradigm inspired by natural coordination mechanisms: agents operate locally on a shared artifact, guided only by pressure gradients derived from measurable quality signals, with temporal decay preventing premature convergence. We formalize this as optimization over a pressure landscape and prove convergence guarantees under mild conditions. Empirically, on meeting room scheduling across 1,350 trials, pressure-field coordination outperforms all baselines: 48.5% aggregate solve rate versus 12.6% for conversation-based coordination, 1.5% for hierarchical control, and 0.4% for sequential and random baselines (all pairwise comparisons p < 0.001). Temporal decay is essential: disabling it reduces solve rate by 10 percentage points. On easy problems, pressure-field achieves 86.7% solve rate. The approach maintains consistent performance from 1 to 4 agents. Implicit coordination through shared pressure gradients outperforms explicit hierarchical control, suggesting that constraint-driven emergence offers a simpler and more effective foundation for multi-agent AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 5 figures, 12 tables.

| **[Temporal Conformal Prediction (TCP): A Distribution-Free Statistical and Machine Learning Framework for Adaptive Risk Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05470v6)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose \textbf{Temporal Conformal Prediction (TCP)}, a distribution-free framework for constructing well-calibrated prediction intervals in nonstationary time series. TCP couples a modern quantile forecaster with a rolling split-conformal calibration layer; its \textbf{TCP-RM} variant adds an online Robbins-Monro offset to steer coverage in real time. We benchmark TCP against GARCH, Historical Simulation, Quantile Regression (QR), linear QR, and Adaptive Conformal Inference (ACI) across S\&P 500, Bitcoin, and Gold. Three results are consistent. First, QR baselines yield the sharpest intervals but are materially under-calibrated; even ACI remains below the 95\% target. Second, TCP achieves near-nominal coverage, yielding intervals slightly wider than Historical Simulation (e.g., S\&P 500: 5.21 vs.\ 5.06). Third, the RM update changes calibration only marginally at default hyperparameters. Crisis-window visualizations (March 2020) show TCP promptly expanding and contracting intervals as volatility spikes. A sensitivity study confirms robustness to hyperparameters. Overall, TCP bridges statistical inference and machine learning, providing a practical solution for calibrated risk forecasting under distribution shift.</p></details> |  |
| **[Compositional Verification of Concurrency Using Past-Time Temporal Epistemic Logic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18885v2)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Shared-memory concurrency is difficult to reason about because each thread executes under interference from other threads. At the same time, many correctness arguments for classic algorithms are epistemic: a thread enters a critical region only when, from its local view, it can rule out that another thread is concurrently in that region. We make such arguments explicit by introducing a past-time temporal epistemic logic interpreted over interleaving executions with perfect-recall local histories. Past-time operators support "since" reasoning, while epistemic modalities capture what a given thread can conclude from its own observation history. We give semantics and a sound proof system, instantiate the logic to a simple shared-memory language with instrumented read/write observations, and illustrate the approach on Peterson's mutual exclusion algorithm by proving a local knowledge condition that implies mutual exclusion.</p></details> |  |
| **[ActionMesh: Animated 3D Mesh Generation with Temporal 3D Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16148v1)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating animated 3D objects is at the heart of many applications, yet most advanced works are typically difficult to apply in practice because of their limited setup, their long runtime, or their limited quality. We introduce ActionMesh, a generative model that predicts production-ready 3D meshes "in action" in a feed-forward manner. Drawing inspiration from early video models, our key insight is to modify existing 3D diffusion models to include a temporal axis, resulting in a framework we dubbed "temporal 3D diffusion". Specifically, we first adapt the 3D diffusion stage to generate a sequence of synchronized latents representing time-varying and independent 3D shapes. Second, we design a temporal 3D autoencoder that translates a sequence of independent shapes into the corresponding deformations of a pre-defined reference shape, allowing us to build an animation. Combining these two components, ActionMesh generates animated 3D meshes from different inputs like a monocular video, a text description, or even a 3D mesh with a text prompt describing its animation. Besides, compared to previous approaches, our method is fast and produces results that are rig-free and topology consistent, hence enabling rapid iteration and seamless applications like texturing and retargeting. We evaluate our model on standard video-to-4D benchmarks (Consistent4D, Objaverse) and report state-of-the-art performances on both geometric accuracy and temporal consistency, demonstrating that our model can deliver animated 3D meshes with unprecedented speed and quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[MMGRid: Navigating Temporal-aware and Cross-domain Generative Recommendation via Model Merging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15930v1)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model merging (MM) offers an efficient mechanism for integrating multiple specialized models without access to original training data or costly retraining. While MM has demonstrated success in domains like computer vision, its role in recommender systems (RSs) remains largely unexplored. Recently, Generative Recommendation (GR) has emerged as a new paradigm in RSs, characterized by rapidly growing model scales and substantial computational costs, making MM particularly appealing for cost-sensitive deployment scenarios. In this work, we present the first systematic study of MM in GR through a contextual lens. We focus on a fundamental yet underexplored challenge in real-world: how to merge generative recommenders specialized to different real-world contexts, arising from temporal evolving user behaviors and heterogeneous application domains. To this end, we propose a unified framework MMGRid, a structured contextual grid of GR checkpoints that organizes models trained under diverse contexts induced by temporal evolution and domain diversity. All checkpoints are derived from a shared base LLM but fine-tuned on context-specific data, forming a realistic and controlled model space for systematically analyzing MM across GR paradigms and merging algorithms. Our investigation reveals several key insights. First, training GR models from LLMs can introduce parameter conflicts during merging due to token distribution shifts and objective disparities; such conflicts can be alleviated by disentangling task-aware and context-specific parameter changes via base model replacement. Second, incremental training across contexts induces recency bias, which can be effectively balanced through weighted contextual merging. Notably, we observe that optimal merging weights correlate with context-dependent interaction characteristics, offering practical guidance for weight selection in real-world deployments.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/Joinn99/MMGRid</p></details> |

Representative queries over such data include range queries, nearest neighbor queries, and join queries. However, formulating those queries usually requires domain-specific expertise and familiarity with executable query languages, which would be a challenging task for non-expert users. It leads to a great demand for well-supported natural language queries (NLQs) in spatio-temporal databases. To bridge the gap between non-experts and query plans in databases, we present NL4ST, an interactive tool that allows users to query spatio-temporal databases in natural language. NL4ST features a three-layer architecture: (i) knowledge base and corpus for knowledge preparation, (ii) natural language understanding for entity linking, and (iii) generating physical plans. Our demonstration will showcase how NL4ST provides effective spatio-temporal physical plans, verified by using four real and synthetic datasets. We make NL4ST online and provide the demo video at https://youtu.be/-J1R7R5WoqQ.</p></details> |  |
| **[SuperOcc: Toward Cohesive Temporal Modeling for Superquadric-based Occupancy Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15644v1)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D occupancy prediction plays a pivotal role in the realm of autonomous driving, as it provides a comprehensive understanding of the driving environment. Most existing methods construct dense scene representations for occupancy prediction, overlooking the inherent sparsity of real-world driving scenes. Recently, 3D superquadric representation has emerged as a promising sparse alternative to dense scene representations due to the strong geometric expressiveness of superquadrics. However, existing superquadric frameworks still suffer from insufficient temporal modeling, a challenging trade-off between query sparsity and geometric expressiveness, and inefficient superquadric-to-voxel splatting. To address these issues, we propose SuperOcc, a novel framework for superquadric-based 3D occupancy prediction. SuperOcc incorporates three key designs: (1) a cohesive temporal modeling mechanism to simultaneously exploit view-centric and object-centric temporal cues; (2) a multi-superquadric decoding strategy to enhance geometric expressiveness without sacrificing query sparsity; and (3) an efficient superquadric-to-voxel splatting scheme to improve computational efficiency. Extensive experiments on the SurroundOcc and Occ3D benchmarks demonstrate that SuperOcc achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining superior efficiency.

| **[Community-Size Biases in Statistical Inference of Communities in Temporal Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15635v1)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the study of time-dependent (i.e., temporal) networks, researchers often examine the evolution of communities, which are sets of densely connected sets of nodes that are connected sparsely to other nodes. An increasingly prominent approach to studying community structure in temporal networks is statistical inference. In the present paper, we study the performance of a class of statistical-inference methods for community detection in temporal networks. We represent temporal networks as multilayer networks, with each layer encoding a time step, and we illustrate that statistical-inference models that generate community assignments via either a uniform distribution on community assignments or discrete-time Markov processes are biased against generating communities with large or small numbers of nodes. In particular, we demonstrate that statistical-inference methods that use such generative models tend to poorly identify community structure in networks with large or small communities. To rectify this issue, we introduce a novel statistical model that generates the community assignments of the nodes in given layer (i.e., at a given time) using all of the community assignments in the previous layer. We prove results that guarantee that our approach greatly mitigates the bias against large and small communities, so using our generative model is beneficial for studying community structure in networks with large or small communities. Our code is available at https://github.com/tfaust0196/TemporalCommunityComparison.</p></details> | 45 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Constraint Breeds Generalization: Temporal Dynamics as an Inductive Bias](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23916v2)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional deep learning prioritizes unconstrained optimization, yet biological systems operate under strict metabolic constraints. We propose that these physical constraints shape dynamics to function not as limitations, but as a temporal inductive bias that breeds generalization. Through a phase-space analysis of signal propagation, we reveal a fundamental asymmetry: expansive dynamics amplify noise, whereas proper dissipative dynamics compress phase space that aligns with the network's spectral bias, compelling the abstraction of invariant features. This condition can be imposed externally via input encoding, or intrinsically through the network's own temporal dynamics. Both pathways require architectures capable of temporal integration and proper constraints to decode induced invariants, whereas static architectures fail to capitalize on temporal structure. Through comprehensive evaluations across supervised classification, unsupervised reconstruction, and zero-shot reinforcement learning, we demonstrate that a critical "transition" regime maximizes generalization capability. These findings establish dynamical constraints as a distinct class of inductive bias, suggesting that robust AI development requires not only scaling and removing limitations, but computationally mastering the temporal characteristics that naturally promote generalization.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |

We consider the problem of learning LTL formulas for classifying traces; despite a growing interest of the research community, existing solutions suffer from two limitations: they do not scale beyond small formulas, and they may exhaust computational resources without returning any result. We introduce a new algorithm addressing both issues: our algorithm is able to construct formulas an order of magnitude larger than previous methods, and it is anytime, meaning that it in most cases successfully outputs a formula, albeit possibly not of minimal size. We evaluate the performances of our algorithm using an open source implementation against publicly available benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Thus, for accurately generating contextually-relevant images, knowledge and reasoning about time can be crucial (e.g., for generating a landscape in spring vs. in winter). Yet, although substantial work exists on understanding and improving temporal knowledge in natural language processing, research on how temporal phenomena appear and are handled in text-to-image (T2I) models remains scarce. We address this gap with TempViz, the first data set to holistically evaluate temporal knowledge in image generation, consisting of 7.9k prompts and more than 600 reference images. Using TempViz, we study the capabilities of five T2I models across five temporal knowledge categories. Human evaluation shows that temporal competence is generally weak, with no model exceeding 75% accuracy across categories. Towards larger-scale studies, we also examine automated evaluation methods, comparing several established approaches against human judgments. However, none of these approaches provides a reliable assessment of temporal cues - further indicating the pressing need for future research on temporal knowledge in T2I.</p></details> |  |
| **[TIDAL: Temporally Interleaved Diffusion and Action Loop for High-Frequency VLA Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14945v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models offer semantic generalization but suffer from high inference latency, limiting them to low-frequency batch-and-execute paradigm. This frequency mismatch creates an execution blind spot, causing failures in dynamic environments where targets move during the open-loop execution window. We propose TIDAL (Temporally Interleaved Diffusion and Action Loop), a hierarchical framework that decouples semantic reasoning from high-frequency actuation. TIDAL operates as a backbone-agnostic module for diffusion-based VLAs, using a dual-frequency architecture to redistribute the computational budget. Specifically, a low-frequency macro-intent loop caches semantic embeddings, while a high-frequency micro-control loop interleaves single-step flow integration with execution. This design enables approximately 9 Hz control updates on edge hardware (vs. approximately 2.4 Hz baselines) without increasing marginal overhead. To handle the resulting latency shift, we introduce a temporally misaligned training strategy where the policy learns predictive compensation using stale semantic intent alongside real-time proprioception. Additionally, we address the insensitivity of static vision encoders to velocity by incorporating a differential motion predictor. TIDAL is architectural, making it orthogonal to system-level optimizations. Experiments show a 2x performance gain over open-loop baselines in dynamic interception tasks. Despite a marginal regression in static success rates, our approach yields a 4x increase in feedback frequency and extends the effective horizon of semantic embeddings beyond the native action chunk size. Under non-paused inference protocols, TIDAL remains robust where standard baselines fail due to latency.</p></details> |  |
| **[UBATrack: Spatio-Temporal State Space Model for General Multi-Modal Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14799v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-modal object tracking has attracted considerable attention by integrating multiple complementary inputs (e.g., thermal, depth, and event data) to achieve outstanding performance. Although current general-purpose multi-modal trackers primarily unify various modal tracking tasks (i.e., RGB-Thermal infrared, RGB-Depth or RGB-Event tracking) through prompt learning, they still overlook the effective capture of spatio-temporal cues. In this work, we introduce a novel multi-modal tracking framework based on a mamba-style state space model, termed UBATrack. Our UBATrack comprises two simple yet effective modules: a Spatio-temporal Mamba Adapter (STMA) and a Dynamic Multi-modal Feature Mixer. The former leverages Mamba's long-sequence modeling capability to jointly model cross-modal dependencies and spatio-temporal visual cues in an adapter-tuning manner. The latter further enhances multi-modal representation capacity across multiple feature dimensions to improve tracking robustness. In this way, UBATrack eliminates the need for costly full-parameter fine-tuning, thereby improving the training efficiency of multi-modal tracking algorithms. Experiments show that UBATrack outperforms state-of-the-art methods on RGB-T, RGB-D, and RGB-E tracking benchmarks, achieving outstanding results on the LasHeR, RGBT234, RGBT210, DepthTrack, VOT-RGBD22, and VisEvent datasets.</p></details> |  |

While multi-frame detection methods leverages temporal cues to improve upon single-frame approaches, existing methods still struggle with inefficient long-range dependency modeling and insufficient robustness. To overcome these issues, we propose a novel scheme for ISTD, realized through a sparse frames-based spatio-temporal semantic feedback network named FeedbackSTS-Det. The core of our approach is a novel spatio-temporal semantic feedback strategy with a closed-loop semantic association mechanism, which consists of paired forward and backward refinement modules that work cooperatively across the encoder and decoder. Moreover, both modules incorporate an embedded sparse semantic module (SSM), which performs structured sparse temporal modeling to capture long-range dependencies with low computational cost. This integrated design facilitates robust implicit inter-frame registration and continuous semantic refinement, effectively suppressing false alarms. Furthermore, our overall procedure maintains a consistent training-inference pipeline, which ensures reliable performance transfer and increases model robustness. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets confirm the effectiveness of FeedbackSTS-Det.

Since encoding all frames is prohibitively expensive, uniform sampling is the default choice, but it enforces equal temporal coverage while ignoring the uneven events distribution. This motivates a Learnable Frame Selector (LFS) that selects temporally diverse and event-relevant frames. LFS explicitly models temporal importance to balance temporal diversity and event relevance, and employs a stratified strategy to ensure temporal coverage while avoiding clustering. Crucially, LFS leverages caption feedback from frozen video-LLMs to learn frame selection that directly optimizes downstream caption quality. Additionally, we identify the gap between existing benchmark and human's cognition. Thus, we introduce ICH-CC built from carefully designed questions by annotators that reflect human-consistent understanding of video. Experiments indicate that LFS consistently improves detailed video captioning across two representative community benchmarks and ICH-CC, achieving up to 2.0% gains on VDC and over 4% gains on ICH-CC. Moreover, we observe that enhanced captions with LFS leads to improved performance on video question answering. Overall, LFS provides an effective and easy-to-integrate solution for detailed video captioning.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods mainly learn sequential dependencies from raw trajectories, but often fail to capture high-level behavioral semantics and to effectively disentangle long-term habitual preferences from short-term contextual intentions. In this paper, we propose a semantic embedding based dual stream spatiotemporal attention model for next pickup location prediction. Raw trajectories are first transformed into semantically enriched activity sequences to encode users' stay behaviors and movement semantics. A dual stream architecture is then designed to explicitly decouple long-term historical patterns and short-term dynamic intentions, where each stream employs spatiotemporal attention mechanisms to model dependencies at different temporal scales. To integrate heterogeneous contextual information, a context aware dynamic fusion module adaptively balances the contributions of the two streams. Finally, an attention based matching strategy is used to predict the probability distribution over candidate pickup locations. Experiments on real world ride hailing datasets demonstrate that the proposed model consistently outperforms state of the art methods, validating the effectiveness of semantic trajectory abstraction and dual stream spatiotemporal attention for individualized mobility behavior modeling.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing video customization methods rely on reference images or task-specific temporal priors, failing to fully exploit the rich spatio-temporal information inherent in videos, thereby limiting flexibility and generalization in video generation. To address these limitations, we propose OmniTransfer, a unified framework for spatio-temporal video transfer. It leverages multi-view information across frames to enhance appearance consistency and exploits temporal cues to enable fine-grained temporal control. To unify various video transfer tasks, OmniTransfer incorporates three key designs: Task-aware Positional Bias that adaptively leverages reference video information to improve temporal alignment or appearance consistency; Reference-decoupled Causal Learning separating reference and target branches to enable precise reference transfer while improving efficiency; and Task-adaptive Multimodal Alignment using multimodal semantic guidance to dynamically distinguish and tackle different tasks. Extensive experiments show that OmniTransfer outperforms existing methods in appearance (ID and style) and temporal transfer (camera movement and video effects), while matching pose-guided methods in motion transfer without using pose, establishing a new paradigm for flexible, high-fidelity video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Githu...</summary><p>Github Page: https://pangzecheung.github.io/OmniTransfer/</p></details> |

While substantial works continue to rely on the popular but old benchmarks, their temporal misalignment with real-world facts and modern LLMs, and their effects on LLM factuality evaluation remain underexplored. Therefore, in this work, we present a systematic investigation of this issue by examining five popular factuality benchmarks and eight LLMs released across different years. An up-to-date fact retrieval pipeline and three metrics are tailored to quantify benchmark aging and its impact on LLM factuality evaluation. Experimental results and analysis illustrate that a considerable portion of samples in the widely used factuality benchmarks are outdated, leading to unreliable assessments of LLM factuality. We hope our work can provide a testbed to assess the reliability of a benchmark for LLM factuality evaluation and inspire more research on the benchmark aging issue.

This limitation introduces significant geometric distortion when representing real-world graphs with inherent non-Euclidean structures (e.g., hierarchies and cycles), degrading representation quality. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the Riemannian Liquid Spatio-Temporal Graph Network (RLSTG), a framework that unifies continuous-time liquid dynamics with the geometric inductive biases of Riemannian manifolds. RLSTG models graph evolution through an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) formulated directly on a curved manifold, enabling it to faithfully capture the intrinsic geometry of both structurally static and dynamic spatio-temporal graphs. Moreover, we provide rigorous theoretical guarantees for RLSTG, extending stability theorems of LTCs to the Riemannian domain and quantifying its expressive power via state trajectory analysis. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmarks demonstrate that, by combining advanced temporal dynamics with a Riemannian spatial representation, RLSTG achieves superior performance on graphs with complex structures.

Lately, transformer networks, through their self-attention mechanism capabilities, have proved their efficiency in many applications. In this study, we introduce a new two-stream transformer video classifier, which extracts spatio-temporal information from content and optical flow representing movement information. The proposed model identifies self-attention features across the joint optical flow and temporal frame domain and represents their relationships within the transformer encoder mechanism. The experimental results show that our proposed methodology provides excellent classification results on three well-known video datasets of human activities.</p></details> |  |

Such VCSPs will be called temporal, in analogy to the (classical) constraint satisfaction problem: a relational structure is preserved by all order-preserving bijections if and only if all its relations have a first-order definition in $({\mathbb Q};<)$, and the CSPs for such structures are called temporal CSPs. Many optimization problems that have been studied intensively in the literature can be phrased as a temporal VCSP. We prove that a temporal VCSP is in P, or NP-complete. Our analysis uses the concept of fractional polymorphisms. This is the first dichotomy result for VCSPs over infinite domains which is complete in the sense that it treats all valued structures with a given automorphism group.</p></details> |  |
| **[STEC: A Reference-Free Spatio-Temporal Entropy Coverage Metric for Evaluating Sampled Video Frames](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13974v1)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Frame sampling is a fundamental component in video understanding and video--language model pipelines, yet evaluating the quality of sampled frames remains challenging. Existing evaluation metrics primarily focus on perceptual quality or reconstruction fidelity, and are not designed to assess whether a set of sampled frames adequately captures informative and representative video content. We propose Spatio-Temporal Entropy Coverage (STEC), a simple and non-reference metric for evaluating the effectiveness of video frame sampling. STEC builds upon Spatio-Temporal Frame Entropy (STFE), which measures per-frame spatial information via entropy-based structural complexity, and evaluates sampled frames based on their temporal coverage and redundancy. By jointly modeling spatial information strength, temporal dispersion, and non-redundancy, STEC provides a principled and lightweight measure of sampling quality. Experiments on the MSR-VTT test-1k benchmark demonstrate that STEC clearly differentiates common sampling strategies, including random, uniform, and content-aware methods. We further show that STEC reveals robustness patterns across individual videos that are not captured by average performance alone, highlighting its practical value as a general-purpose evaluation tool for efficient video understanding. We emphasize that STEC is not designed to predict downstream task accuracy, but to provide a task-agnostic diagnostic signal for analyzing frame sampling behavior under constrained budgets.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper corresponds to the camera-ready version of a WACV 2026 Workshop paper</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Scenario Highway Lane-Change Intention Prediction: A Temporal Physics-Informed Multi-Modal Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24075v2)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lane-change intention prediction is safety-critical for autonomous driving and ADAS, but remains difficult in naturalistic traffic due to noisy kinematics, severe class imbalance, and limited generalization across heterogeneous highway scenarios. We propose Temporal Physics-Informed AI (TPI-AI), a hybrid framework that fuses deep temporal representations with physics-inspired interaction cues. A two-layer bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) encoder learns compact embeddings from multi-step trajectory histories; we concatenate these embeddings with kinematics-, safety-, and interaction-aware features (e.g., headway, TTC, and safe-gap indicators) and train a LightGBM classifier for three-class intention recognition (No-LC, Left-LC, Right-LC). To improve minority-class reliability, we apply imbalance-aware optimization including resampling/weighting and fold-wise threshold calibration. Experiments on two large-scale drone-based datasets, highD (straight highways) and exiD (ramp-rich environments), use location-based splits and evaluate prediction horizons T = 1, 2, 3 s. TPI-AI outperforms standalone LightGBM and Bi-LSTM baselines, achieving macro-F1 of 0.9562, 0.9124, 0.8345 on highD and 0.9247, 0.8197, 0.7605 on exiD at T = 1, 2, 3 s, respectively. These results show that combining physics-informed interaction features with learned temporal embeddings yields robust multi-scenario lane-change intention prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Counterexample Classification against Signal Temporal Logic Specifications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13743v1)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Signal Temporal Logic (STL) has been widely adopted as a specification language for specifying desirable behaviors of hybrid systems. By monitoring a given STL specification, we can detect the executions that violate it, which are often referred to as counterexamples. In practice, these counterexamples may arise from different causes and thus are relevant to different system defects. To effectively address this, we need a proper criterion for classifying these counterexamples, by which we can comprehend the possible violation patterns and the distributions of these counterexamples with respect to the patterns. In this paper, we propose a classification criterion by using parametric signal temporal logic (PSTL) to represent each class. Due to this formalism, identifying the classes of a counterexample requires finding proper parameter values of PSTL that enable a class to include the counterexample. To improve the efficiency of class identification, we further derive an inclusion relation between different classes, and then propose a binary search-like approach over it that significantly prunes the classes needed to query. We implement a prototype tool and experimentally evaluate its effectiveness on two widely-studied systems.</p></details> |  |

We present ActAvatar, a framework that achieves phase-level precision in action control through textual guidance by capturing both action semantics and temporal context. Our approach introduces three core innovations: (1) Phase-Aware Cross-Attention (PACA), which decomposes prompts into a global base block and temporally-anchored phase blocks, enabling the model to concentrate on phase-relevant tokens for precise temporal-semantic alignment; (2) Progressive Audio-Visual Alignment, which aligns modality influence with the hierarchical feature learning process-early layers prioritize text for establishing action structure while deeper layers emphasize audio for refining lip movements, preventing modality interference; (3) A two-stage training strategy that first establishes robust audio-visual correspondence on diverse data, then injects action control through fine-tuning on structured annotations, maintaining both audio-visual alignment and the model's text-following capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ActAvatar significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both action control and visual quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://ziqiaopeng.github.io/ActAvatar/</p></details> |

Mainstream approaches based on modality-invariant and modality-specific factorization or on complex fusion still rely on spatiotemporal mixed modeling. This ignores spatiotemporal heterogeneity, leading to spatiotemporal information asymmetry and thus limited performance. Hence, we propose TSDA, Temporal-Spatial Decouple before Act, which explicitly decouples each modality into temporal dynamics and spatial structural context before any interaction. For every modality, a temporal encoder and a spatial encoder project signals into separate temporal and spatial body. Factor-Consistent Cross-Modal Alignment then aligns temporal features only with their temporal counterparts across modalities, and spatial features only with their spatial counterparts. Factor specific supervision and decorrelation regularization reduce cross factor leakage while preserving complementarity. A Gated Recouple module subsequently recouples the aligned streams for task. Extensive experiments show that TSDA outperforms baselines. Ablation analysis studies confirm the necessity and interpretability of the design.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This study has been accepted by IEEE ICASSP2026</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Known Facts: Generating Unseen Temporal Knowledge to Address Data Contamination in LLM Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13658v1)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The automatic extraction of information is important for populating large web knowledge bases such as Wikidata. The temporal version of that task, temporal knowledge graph extraction (TKGE), involves extracting temporally grounded facts from text, represented as semantic quadruples (subject, relation, object, timestamp). Many recent systems take advantage of large language models (LLMs), which are becoming a new cornerstone of the web due to their performance on many tasks across the natural language processing (NLP) field. Despite the importance of TKGE, existing datasets for training and evaluation remain scarce, and contamination of evaluation data is an unaddressed issue, potentially inflating LLMs' perceived performance due to overlaps between training and evaluation sets. To mitigate these challenges, we propose a novel synthetic evaluation dataset constructed from predicted future, previously unseen temporal facts, thereby eliminating contamination and enabling robust and unbiased benchmarking. Our dataset creation involves a two-step approach: (1) Temporal Knowledge Graph Forecasting (TKGF) generates plausible future quadruples, which are subsequently filtered to adhere to the original knowledge base schema; (2) LLMs perform quadruple-to-text generation, creating semantically aligned textual descriptions. We benchmark Extract, Define and Canonicalize (EDC), a state-of-the-art LLM-based extraction framework, demonstrating that LLM performance decreases when evaluated on our dataset compared to a dataset of known facts. We publicly release our dataset consisting of 4.2K future quadruples and corresponding textual descriptions, along with the generation methodology, enabling continuous creation of unlimited future temporal datasets to serve as long-term, contamination-free benchmarks for TKGE.</p></details> | 12 pages |

| **[Confidence over Time: Confidence Calibration with Temporal Logic for Large Language Model Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13387v1)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on long-form, multi-step reasoning to solve complex tasks such as mathematical problem solving and scientific question answering. Despite strong performance, existing confidence estimation methods typically reduce an entire reasoning process to a single scalar score, ignoring how confidence evolves throughout the generation. As a result, these methods are often sensitive to superficial factors such as response length or verbosity, and struggle to distinguish correct reasoning from confidently stated errors. We propose to characterize the stepwise confidence signal using Signal Temporal Logic (STL). Using a discriminative STL mining procedure, we discover temporal formulas that distinguish confidence signals of correct and incorrect responses. Our analysis found that the STL patterns generalize across tasks, and numeric parameters exhibit sensitivity to individual questions. Based on these insights, we develop a confidence estimation approach that informs STL blocks with parameter hypernetworks. Experiments on multiple reasoning tasks show our confidence scores are more calibrated than the baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Recurrent Confidence Chain: Temporal-Aware Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13368v1)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As reasoning modules, such as the chain-of-thought mechanism, are applied to large language models, they achieve strong performance on various tasks such as answering common-sense questions and solving math problems. The main challenge now is to assess the uncertainty of answers, which can help prevent misleading or serious hallucinations for users. Although current methods analyze long reasoning sequences by filtering unrelated tokens and examining potential connections between nearby tokens or sentences, the temporal spread of confidence is often overlooked. This oversight can lead to inflated overall confidence, even when earlier steps exhibit very low confidence. To address this issue, we propose a novel method that incorporates inter-step attention to analyze semantic correlations across steps. For handling long-horizon responses, we introduce a hidden confidence mechanism to retain historical confidence information, which is then combined with stepwise confidence to produce a more accurate overall estimate. We evaluate our method on the GAOKAO math benchmark and the CLadder causal reasoning dataset using mainstream open-source large language models. Our approach is shown to outperform state-of-the-art methods by achieving a superior balance between predictive quality and calibration, demonstrated by strong performance on both Negative Log-Likelihood and Expected Calibration Error.</p></details> |  |
| **[Verifying First-Order Temporal Properties of Infinite-State Systems via Timers and Rankings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13325v1)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a unified deductive verification framework for first-order temporal properties based on well-founded rankings, where verification conditions are discharged using SMT solvers. To that end, we introduce a novel reduction from verification of arbitrary temporal properties to verification of termination. Our reduction augments the system with prophecy timer variables that predict the number of steps along a trace until the next time certain temporal formulas, including the negated property, hold. In contrast to standard tableaux-based reductions, which reduce the problem to fair termination, our reduction does not introduce fairness assumptions. To verify termination of the augmented system, we follow the traditional approach of assigning each state a rank from a well-founded set and showing that the rank decreases in every transition. We leverage the recently proposed formalism of implicit rankings to express and automatically verify the decrease of rank using SMT solvers, even when the rank is not expressible in first-order logic. We extend implicit rankings from finite to infinite domains, enabling verification of more general systems and making them applicable to the augmented systems generated by our reduction, which allows us to exploit the decrease of timers in termination proofs. We evaluate our technique on a range of temporal verification tasks from previous works, giving simple, intuitive proofs for them within our framework.</p></details> |  |

Current LLM architectures and evaluation protocols rarely test for temporal awareness under real-time deadlines. We use simulated negotiations between paired agents under strict deadlines to investigate how LLMs adjust their behavior in time-sensitive settings. In a control condition, agents know only the global time limit. In a time-aware condition, they receive remaining-time updates at each turn. Deal closure rates are substantially higher (32\% vs. 4\% for GPT-5.1) and offer acceptances are sixfold higher in the time-aware condition than in the control, suggesting LLMs struggle to internally track elapsed time. However, the same LLMs achieve near-perfect deal closure rates ($\geq$95\%) under turn-based limits, revealing the failure is in temporal tracking rather than strategic reasoning. These effects replicate across negotiation scenarios and models, illustrating a systematic lack of LLM time awareness that will constrain LLM deployment in many time-sensitive applications.</p></details> |  |

Despite long-standing concerns, there are limited methods that can efficiently and accurately detect and segment leaks due to their concealed appearance and random shapes. In this paper, we propose a Fine-grained Spatial-Temporal Perception (FGSTP) algorithm for gas leak segmentation. FGSTP captures critical motion clues across frames and integrates them with refined object features in an end-to-end network. Specifically, we first construct a correlation volume to capture motion information between consecutive frames. Then, the fine-grained perception progressively refines the object-level features using previous outputs. Finally, a decoder is employed to optimize boundary segmentation. Because there is no highly precise labeled dataset for gas leak segmentation, we manually label a gas leak video dataset, GasVid. Experimental results on GasVid demonstrate that our model excels in segmenting non-rigid objects such as gas leaks, generating the most accurate mask compared to other state-of-the-art (SOTA) models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 2025 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)</p></details> |

We propose a Bayesian hierarchical model with a Dirichlet process prior to automatically detect space-time clusters of the events and adopt a convolution kernel estimator to account for the network structure in the city. From the fitted model, we provide crime hotspot visualizations that can inform social interventions to prevent crime incidents. Furthermore, we study the relationships between the detected cluster centers and the city's amenities, which provides an intuitive explanation of criminal contagion.</p></details> |  |

However, it faces two major challenges: (1) demographic-based targeting creates segment-specific LTV distributions with large value variations across user groups; and (2) dynamic marketing strategies generate irregular behavioral sequences where engagement patterns evolve rapidly. We propose a Hyper-Temporal Graph Neural Network (HT-GNN), which jointly models demographic heterogeneity and temporal dynamics through three key components: (i) a hypergraph-supervised module capturing inter-segment relationships; (ii) a transformer-based temporal encoder with adaptive weighting; and (iii) a task-adaptive mixture-of-experts with dynamic prediction towers for multi-horizon LTV forecasting. Experiments on \textit{Baidu Ads} with 15 million users demonstrate that HT-GNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across all metrics and prediction horizons.</p></details> |  |

While advances in semantic scene representations have enriched robotic scene understanding, current approaches lack a connection between spatial features and dynamic events; e.g., connecting the blue mug to the event washing a mug. In this work, we introduce the event-grounding graph (EGG), a framework grounding event interactions to spatial features of a scene. This representation allows robots to perceive, reason, and respond to complex spatio-temporal queries. Experiments using real robotic data demonstrate EGG's capability to retrieve relevant information and respond accurately to human inquiries concerning the environment and events within.

To address these challenges, we propose a comprehensive benchmark, called BenchTGC. Specially, we design a BenchTGC Framework to illustrate the paradigm of temporal graph clustering and improve existing clustering techniques to fit temporal graphs. In addition, we also discuss problems with public temporal graph datasets and develop multiple datasets suitable for TGC task, called BenchTGC Datasets. According to extensive experiments, we not only verify the advantages of BenchTGC, but also demonstrate the necessity and importance of TGC task. We wish to point out that the dynamically changing and complex scenarios in real world are the foundation of temporal graph clustering.

We investigate Temporal Envy-Freeness Up to One Good (TEF1) and Up to Any Good (TEFX), its approximation $α$-TEFX, and Temporal Maximin Share (TMMS). Motivated by known impossibilities in standard settings, we consider the model in various restricted settings and extend it by introducing scheduling. Our main contributions draw the boundary between possibility and impossibility. First, regarding temporal fair division without scheduling, we prove that while constant-factor $α$-TEFX is impossible in general, a $1/2$-approximation is achievable for generalized binary valuations and identical days with two agents. Second, regarding temporal fair division with scheduling, we demonstrate that a scheduling buffer of size at least $n/2$ enables TEF1 for identical days. However, we establish that TEFX and TMMS remain largely impossible even with scheduling or restricted domains. These results highlight the inherent difficulty of strict temporal fairness and quantify the trade-offs required to achieve approximation guarantees.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IJCAI 2026</p></details> |

However, while these approaches primarily focus on enhancing in-frame regions, they often struggle to reconstruct critical out-of-frame areas near the sides of the ego-vehicle, although previous frames commonly contain valuable contextual information about these unseen regions. To address this limitation, we propose the Current-Centric Contextual 3D Fusion (C3DFusion) module, which generates hidden region-aware 3D feature geometry by explicitly aligning 3D-lifted point features from both current and historical frames. C3DFusion performs enhanced temporal fusion through two complementary techniques-historical context blurring and current-centric feature densification-which suppress noise from inaccurately warped historical point features by attenuating their scale, and enhance current point features by increasing their volumetric contribution. Simply integrated into standard SSC architectures, C3DFusion demonstrates strong effectiveness, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods on the SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 datasets. Furthermore, it exhibits robust generalization, achieving notable performance gains when applied to other baseline models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026</p></details> |

Existing anomaly detection methods in multi-temporal modal data scenarios have the problems of insufficient extraction of spatio-temporal correlation features, high cost of anomaly sample category annotation, and imbalance of anomaly samples. In this paper, a graph neural network anomaly detection backbone network incorporating spatio-temporal correlation features and a multi-task self-supervised training strategy of "pre-training - graph prompting - fine-tuning" are designed for the characteristics of WSN graph structure data. First, the anomaly detection backbone network is designed by improving the Mamba model based on a multi-scale strategy and inter-modal fusion method, and combining it with a variational graph convolution module, which is capable of fully extracting spatio-temporal correlation features in the multi-node, multi-temporal modal scenarios of WSNs. Secondly, we design a three-subtask learning "pre-training" method with no-negative comparative learning, prediction, and reconstruction to learn generic features of WSN data samples from unlabeled data, and design a "graph prompting-fine-tuning" mechanism to guide the pre-trained self-supervised learning. The model is fine-tuned through the "graph prompting-fine-tuning" mechanism to guide the pre-trained self-supervised learning model to complete the parameter fine-tuning, thereby reducing the training cost and enhancing the detection generalization performance. The F1 metrics obtained from experiments on the public dataset and the actual collected dataset are up to 91.30% and 92.31%, respectively, which provides better detection performance and generalization ability than existing methods designed by the method.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Identification of Temporally Causal Representation with Instantaneous Dependence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15325v4)** | 2026-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporally causal representation learning aims to identify the latent causal process from time series observations, but most methods require the assumption that the latent causal processes do not have instantaneous relations. Although some recent methods achieve identifiability in the instantaneous causality case, they require either interventions on the latent variables or grouping of the observations, which are in general difficult to obtain in real-world scenarios. To fill this gap, we propose an \textbf{ID}entification framework for instantane\textbf{O}us \textbf{L}atent dynamics (\textbf{IDOL}) by imposing a sparse influence constraint that the latent causal processes have sparse time-delayed and instantaneous relations. Specifically, we establish identifiability results of the latent causal process based on sufficient variability and the sparse influence constraint by employing contextual information of time series data. Based on these theories, we incorporate a temporally variational inference architecture to estimate the latent variables and a gradient-based sparsity regularization to identify the latent causal process. Experimental results on simulation datasets illustrate that our method can identify the latent causal process. Furthermore, evaluations on multiple human motion forecasting benchmarks with instantaneous dependencies indicate the effectiveness of our method in real-world settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Traffic Collisions: Temporal Patterns and Severity-Weighted Hotspot Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12548v1)** | 2026-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding traffic collision patterns is of high importance for effective road safety planning in fast-growing urban environments. This study examines the temporal and spatial patterns of traffic collisions in Dubai, UAE, with a particular focus on collision severity. To this end, traffic collision records from November 2024 to June 2025 were analyzed to examine hourly, daily, and monthly variations in collision frequency and severity for both overall traffic collisions and pedestrian-related accidents. Temporal associations with severity were evaluated using chi-square tests and Cramer's V, while spatial patterns were analyzed using severity-weighted hotspot analysis based on the Getis-Ord Gi* statistic, complemented by inverse distance weighting (IDW) interpolation. The results show a clear temporal variation in overall collision frequency and severity, with higher collision frequencies during evening and nighttime periods with 44% higher probability of high-severity outcomes at night compared to the afternoon. On the other hand, pedestrian-related accidents showed a distinct temporal profile, characterized by higher occurrence during late-evening hours and relatively limited variation across days of the week and months. Spatial analysis identified statistically significant severity hotspots for overall collisions in the northern and northwestern parts of Dubai and along the Al Ain-Dubai Highway, while pedestrian severity hotspots were concentrated near industrial areas in the southwestern region. Several policy measures are proposed based on the findings including, reducing nighttime speed limits, enhancing automated enforcement, improving roadway lighting, and implementing pedestrian-focused treatments in statistically significant hotspots.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Data and Short-Time Averages Improve Multiphase Mass Flow Metering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12433v1)** | 2026-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reliable flow measurements are essential in many industries, but current instruments often fail to accurately estimate multiphase flows, which are frequently encountered in real-world operations. Combining machine learning (ML) algorithms with accurate single-phase flowmeters has therefore received extensive research attention in recent years. The Coriolis mass flowmeter is a widely used single-phase meter that provides direct mass flow measurements, which ML models can be trained to correct, thereby reducing measurement errors in multiphase conditions. This paper demonstrates that preserving temporal information significantly improves model performance in such scenarios. We compare a multilayer perceptron, a windowed multilayer perceptron, and a convolutional neural network (CNN) on three-phase air-water-oil flow data from 342 experiments. Whereas prior work typically compresses each experiment into a single averaged sample, we instead compute short-time averages from within each experiment and train models that preserve temporal information at several downsampling intervals. The CNN performed best at 0.25 Hz with approximately 95 % of relative errors below 13 %, a normalized root mean squared error of 0.03, and a mean absolute percentage error of approximately 4.3 %, clearly outperforming the best single-averaged model and demonstrating that short-time averaging within individual experiments is preferable. Results are consistent across multiple data splits and random seeds, demonstrating robustness.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |
| **[CurConMix+: A Unified Spatio-Temporal Framework for Hierarchical Surgical Workflow Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12312v1)** | 2026-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Surgical action triplet recognition aims to understand fine-grained surgical behaviors by modeling the interactions among instruments, actions, and anatomical targets. Despite its clinical importance for workflow analysis and skill assessment, progress has been hindered by severe class imbalance, subtle visual variations, and the semantic interdependence among triplet components. Existing approaches often address only a subset of these challenges rather than tackling them jointly, which limits their ability to form a holistic understanding. This study builds upon CurConMix, a spatial representation framework. At its core, a curriculum-guided contrastive learning strategy learns discriminative and progressively correlated features, further enhanced by structured hard-pair sampling and feature-level mixup. Its temporal extension, CurConMix+, integrates a Multi-Resolution Temporal Transformer (MRTT) that achieves robust, context-aware understanding by adaptively fusing multi-scale temporal features and dynamically balancing spatio-temporal cues. Furthermore, we introduce LLS48, a new, hierarchically annotated benchmark for complex laparoscopic left lateral sectionectomy, providing step-, task-, and action-level annotations. Extensive experiments on CholecT45 and LLS48 demonstrate that CurConMix+ not only outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in triplet recognition, but also exhibits strong cross-level generalization, as its fine-grained features effectively transfer to higher-level phase and step recognition tasks. Together, the framework and dataset provide a unified foundation for hierarchy-aware, reproducible, and interpretable surgical workflow understanding. The code and dataset will be publicly released on GitHub to facilitate reproducibility and further research.</p></details> |  |
| **[FTSCommDetector: Discovering Behavioral Communities through Temporal Synchronization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00014v3)** | 2026-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Why do trillion-dollar tech giants AAPL and MSFT diverge into different response patterns during market disruptions despite identical sector classifications? This paradox reveals a fundamental limitation: traditional community detection methods fail to capture synchronization-desynchronization patterns where entities move independently yet align during critical moments. To this end, we introduce FTSCommDetector, implementing our Temporal Coherence Architecture (TCA) to discover similar and dissimilar communities in continuous multivariate time series. Unlike existing methods that process each timestamp independently, causing unstable community assignments and missing evolving relationships, our approach maintains coherence through dual-scale encoding and static topology with dynamic attention. Furthermore, we establish information-theoretic foundations demonstrating how scale separation maximizes complementary information and introduce Normalized Temporal Profiles (NTP) for scale-invariant evaluation. As a result, FTSCommDetector achieves consistent improvements across four diverse financial markets (SP100, SP500, SP1000, Nikkei 225), with gains ranging from 3.5% to 11.1% over the strongest baselines. The method demonstrates remarkable robustness with only 2% performance variation across window sizes from 60 to 120 days, making dataset-specific tuning unnecessary, providing practical insights for portfolio construction and risk management.</p></details> |  |

Current robustness testing methods require excessive computational resources through exhaustive frame-by-frame processing and full-image perturbations, proving impractical for large-scale deployments where massive image streams demand immediate processing. This paper presents DDSA (Dual-Domain Strategic Attack), a resource-efficient adversarial robustness testing framework that optimizes testing through temporal selectivity and spatial precision. We introduce a scenario-aware trigger function that identifies critical frames requiring robustness evaluation based on class priority and model uncertainty, and employ explainable AI techniques to locate influential pixel regions for targeted perturbation. Our dual-domain approach achieves substantial temporal-spatial resource conservation while maintaining attack effectiveness. The framework enables practical deployment of comprehensive adversarial robustness testing in resource-constrained real-time applications where computational efficiency directly impacts mission success.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint accepted by ICASSP 2026 with minor revisions</p></details> |
| **[TIDE: A Trace-Informed Depth-First Exploration for Planning with Temporally Extended Goals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12141v1)** | 2026-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Task planning with temporally extended goals (TEGs) is a critical challenge in AI and robotics, enabling agents to achieve complex sequences of objectives over time rather than addressing isolated, immediate tasks. Linear Temporal Logic on finite traces (LTLf ) provides a robust formalism for encoding these temporal goals. Traditional LTLf task planning approaches often transform the temporal planning problem into a classical planning problem with reachability goals, which are then solved using off-the-shelf planners. However, these methods often lack informed heuristics to provide a guided search for temporal goals. We introduce TIDE (Trace-Informed Depth-first Exploration), a novel approach that addresses this limitation by decomposing a temporal problem into a sequence of smaller, manageable reach-avoid sub-problems, each solvable using an off-the-shelf planner. TIDE identifies and prioritizes promising automaton traces within the domain graph, using cost-driven heuristics to guide exploration. Its adaptive backtracking mechanism systematically recovers from failed plans by recalculating costs and penalizing infeasible transitions, ensuring completeness and efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that TIDE achieves promising performance and is a valuable addition to the portfolio of planning methods for temporally extended goals.</p></details> |  |

ChronoRoot 2.0 builds upon established low-cost hardware while significantly enhancing software capabilities and usability. The system employs nnUNet architecture for multi-class segmentation, demonstrating significant accuracy improvements while simultaneously tracking six distinct plant structures encompassing root, shoot, and seed components: main root, lateral roots, seed, hypocotyl, leaves, and petiole. This architecture enables easy retraining and incorporation of additional training data without requiring machine learning expertise. The platform introduces dual specialized graphical interfaces: a Standard Interface for detailed architectural analysis with novel gravitropic response parameters, and a Screening Interface enabling high-throughput analysis of multiple plants through automated tracking. Functional Principal Component Analysis integration enables discovery of novel phenotypic parameters through temporal pattern comparison. We demonstrate multi-species analysis, with Arabidopsis thaliana and Solanum lycopersicum, both morphologically distinct plant species. Three use cases in Arabidopsis thaliana and validation with tomato seedlings demonstrate enhanced capabilities: circadian growth pattern characterization, gravitropic response analysis in transgenic plants, and high-throughput etiolation screening across multiple genotypes.ChronoRoot 2.0 maintains the low-cost, modular hardware advantages of its predecessor while dramatically improving accessibility through intuitive graphical interfaces and expanded analytical capabilities. The open-source platform makes sophisticated temporal plant phenotyping more accessible to researchers without computational expertise.</p></details> |  |

Substantially extending our preliminary conference version, we present FactoST-v2, an enhanced factorized framework redesigned for full weight transfer and arbitrary-length generalization. FactoST-v2 decouples universal temporal learning from domain-specific spatial adaptation. The first stage pretrains a minimalist encoder-only backbone using randomized sequence masking to capture invariant temporal dynamics, enabling probabilistic quantile prediction across variable horizons. The second stage employs a streamlined adapter to rapidly inject spatial awareness via meta adaptive learning and prompting. Comprehensive evaluations across diverse domains demonstrate that FactoST-v2 achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with linear efficiency - significantly outperforming existing foundation models in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios while rivaling domain-specific expert baselines. This factorized paradigm offers a practical, scalable path toward truly universal STFMs. Code is available at https://github.com/CityMind-Lab/FactoST.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is an extended version of the paper presented at NeurIPS 2025.

To address these limitations, this paper proposes a topology-enhanced spatio-temporal feature fusion anomaly detection method, TE-MSTAD. First, building upon the RWKV model with linear attention mechanisms, a Cross-modal Feature Extraction (CFE) module is introduced to fully extract spatial correlation features among multiple nodes while reducing computational resource consumption. Second, a strategy is designed to construct an adjacency matrix by jointly learning spatial correlation from time-frequency domain features. Different graph neural networks are integrated to enhance spatial correlation feature extraction, thereby fully capturing spatial relationships among multiple nodes. Finally, a dual-branch network TE-MSTAD is designed for time-frequency domain feature fusion, overcoming the limitations of relying solely on the time or frequency domain to improve WSN anomaly detection performance. Testing on both public and real-world datasets demonstrates that the TE-MSTAD model achieves F1 scores of 92.52% and 93.28%, respectively, exhibiting superior detection performance and generalization capabilities compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Nixie: Efficient, Transparent Temporal Multiplexing for Consumer GPUs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11743v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Consumer machines are increasingly running large ML workloads such as large language models (LLMs), text-to-image generation, and interactive image editing. Unlike datacenter GPUs, consumer GPUs serve single-user, rapidly changing workloads, and each model's working set often nearly fills the GPU memory. As a result, existing sharing mechanisms (e.g., NVIDIA Unified Virtual Memory) perform poorly due to memory thrashing and excessive use of CPU pinned memory when multiple applications are active. We design and implement Nixie, a system that enables efficient and transparent temporal multiplexing on consumer GPUs without requiring any application or driver changes. Nixie is a system service that coordinates GPU memory allocation and kernel launch behavior to efficiently utilize the CPU-GPU bi-directional bandwidth and CPU pinned memory. A lightweight scheduler in Nixie further improves responsiveness by automatically prioritizing latency-sensitive interactive jobs using MLFQ-inspired techniques. Our evaluations show that Nixie improves latency of real interactive code-completion tasks by up to $3.8\times$ and saves up to 66.8% CPU pinned memory usage given the same latency requirement.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReScene4D: Temporally Consistent Semantic Instance Segmentation of Evolving Indoor 3D Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11508v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Indoor environments evolve as objects move, appear, or disappear. Capturing these dynamics requires maintaining temporally consistent instance identities across intermittently captured 3D scans, even when changes are unobserved. We introduce and formalize the task of temporally sparse 4D indoor semantic instance segmentation (SIS), which jointly segments, identifies, and temporally associates object instances. This setting poses a challenge for existing 3DSIS methods, which require a discrete matching step due to their lack of temporal reasoning, and for 4D LiDAR approaches, which perform poorly due to their reliance on high-frequency temporal measurements that are uncommon in the longer-horizon evolution of indoor environments. We propose ReScene4D, a novel method that adapts 3DSIS architectures for 4DSIS without needing dense observations. It explores strategies to share information across observations, demonstrating that this shared context not only enables consistent instance tracking but also improves standard 3DSIS quality. To evaluate this task, we define a new metric, t-mAP, that extends mAP to reward temporal identity consistency. ReScene4D achieves state-of-the-art performance on the 3RScan dataset, establishing a new benchmark for understanding evolving indoor scenes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Complexity and Self-Organization in an Exponential Dense Associative Memory Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11478v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dense Associative Memory (DAM) models generalize the classical Hopfield model by incorporating n-body or exponential interactions that greatly enhance storage capacity. While the criticality of DAM models has been largely investigated, mainly within a statistical equilibrium picture, little attention has been devoted to the temporal self-organizing behavior induced by learning. In this work, we investigate the behavior of a stochastic exponential DAM (SEDAM) model through the lens of Temporal Complexity (TC), a framework that characterizes complex systems by intermittent transition events between order and disorder and by scale-free temporal statistics. Transition events associated with birth-death of neural avalanche structures are exploited for the TC analyses and compared with analogous transition events based on coincidence structures. We systematically explore how TC indicators depend on control parameters, i.e., noise intensity and memory load. Our results reveal that the SEDAM model exhibits regimes of complex intermittency characterized by nontrivial temporal correlations and scale-free behavior, indicating the spontaneous emergence of self-organizing dynamics. These regimes emerge in small intervals of noise intensity values, which, in agreement with the extended criticality concept, never shrink to a single critical point. Further, the noise intensity range needed to reach the critical region, where self-organizing behavior emerges, slightly decreases as the memory load increases. This study highlights the relevance of TC as a complementary framework for understanding learning and information processing in artificial and biological neural systems, revealing the link between the memory load and the self-organizing capacity of the network.</p></details> |  |
| **[Wetland mapping from sparse annotations with satellite image time series and temporal-aware segment anything model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11400v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate wetland mapping is essential for ecosystem monitoring, yet dense pixel-level annotation is prohibitively expensive and practical applications usually rely on sparse point labels, under which existing deep learning models perform poorly, while strong seasonal and inter-annual wetland dynamics further render single-date imagery inadequate and lead to significant mapping errors; although foundation models such as SAM show promising generalization from point prompts, they are inherently designed for static images and fail to model temporal information, resulting in fragmented masks in heterogeneous wetlands. To overcome these limitations, we propose WetSAM, a SAM-based framework that integrates satellite image time series for wetland mapping from sparse point supervision through a dual-branch design, where a temporally prompted branch extends SAM with hierarchical adapters and dynamic temporal aggregation to disentangle wetland characteristics from phenological variability, and a spatial branch employs a temporally constrained region-growing strategy to generate reliable dense pseudo-labels, while a bidirectional consistency regularization jointly optimizes both branches. Extensive experiments across eight global regions of approximately 5,000 km2 each demonstrate that WetSAM substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average F1-score of 85.58%, and delivering accurate and structurally consistent wetland segmentation with minimal labeling effort, highlighting its strong generalization capability and potential for scalable, low-cost, high-resolution wetland mapping.</p></details> |  |

As systems evolve toward automation, models must operate on edge devices (e.g., PLCs, microcontrollers) with strict constraints on latency and memory, limiting parameters to a few thousand. Conventional deep architectures are often impractical here. We propose the Fourier-Efficient Adaptive Temporal Hierarchy Forecaster (FEATHer) for accurate long-term forecasting under severe limits. FEATHer introduces: (i) ultra-lightweight multiscale decomposition into frequency pathways; (ii) a shared Dense Temporal Kernel using projection-depthwise convolution-projection without recurrence or attention; (iii) frequency-aware branch gating that adaptively fuses representations based on spectral characteristics; and (iv) a Sparse Period Kernel reconstructing outputs via period-wise downsampling to capture seasonality. FEATHer maintains a compact architecture (as few as 400 parameters) while outperforming baselines. Across eight benchmarks, it achieves the best ranking, recording 60 first-place results with an average rank of 2.05. These results demonstrate that reliable long-range forecasting is achievable on constrained edge hardware, offering a practical direction for industrial real-time inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (TPAMI)</p></details> |
| **[FTDMamba: Frequency-Assisted Temporal Dilation Mamba for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Video Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11254v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in video anomaly detection (VAD) mainly focus on ground-based surveillance or unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) videos with static backgrounds, whereas research on UAV videos with dynamic backgrounds remains limited. Unlike static scenarios, dynamically captured UAV videos exhibit multi-source motion coupling, where the motion of objects and UAV-induced global motion are intricately intertwined. Consequently, existing methods may misclassify normal UAV movements as anomalies or fail to capture true anomalies concealed within dynamic backgrounds. Moreover, many approaches do not adequately address the joint modeling of inter-frame continuity and local spatial correlations across diverse temporal scales. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Frequency-Assisted Temporal Dilation Mamba (FTDMamba) network for UAV VAD, including two core components: (1) a Frequency Decoupled Spatiotemporal Correlation Module, which disentangles coupled motion patterns and models global spatiotemporal dependencies through frequency analysis; and (2) a Temporal Dilation Mamba Module, which leverages Mamba's sequence modeling capability to jointly learn fine-grained temporal dynamics and local spatial structures across multiple temporal receptive fields. Additionally, unlike existing UAV VAD datasets which focus on static backgrounds, we construct a large-scale Moving UAV VAD dataset (MUVAD), comprising 222,736 frames with 240 anomaly events across 12 anomaly types. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FTDMamba achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on two public static benchmarks and the new MUVAD dataset. The code and MUVAD dataset will be available at: https://github.com/uavano/FTDMamba.</p></details> |  |
| **[TANDEM: Temporal-Aware Neural Detection for Multimodal Hate Speech](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11178v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social media platforms are increasingly dominated by long-form multimodal content, where harmful narratives are constructed through a complex interplay of audio, visual, and textual cues. While automated systems can flag hate speech with high accuracy, they often function as "black boxes" that fail to provide the granular, interpretable evidence, such as precise timestamps and target identities, required for effective human-in-the-loop moderation. In this work, we introduce TANDEM, a unified framework that transforms audio-visual hate detection from a binary classification task into a structured reasoning problem. Our approach employs a novel tandem reinforcement learning strategy where vision-language and audio-language models optimize each other through self-constrained cross-modal context, stabilizing reasoning over extended temporal sequences without requiring dense frame-level supervision. Experiments across three benchmark datasets demonstrate that TANDEM significantly outperforms zero-shot and context-augmented baselines, achieving 0.73 F1 in target identification on HateMM (a 30% improvement over state-of-the-art) while maintaining precise temporal grounding. We further observe that while binary detection is robust, differentiating between offensive and hateful content remains challenging in multi-class settings due to inherent label ambiguity and dataset imbalance. More broadly, our findings suggest that structured, interpretable alignment is achievable even in complex multimodal settings, offering a blueprint for the next generation of transparent and actionable online safety moderation tools.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review at ICWSM 2026</p></details> |

| **[Communication-Efficient Federated Learning by Exploiting Spatio-Temporal Correlations of Gradients](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10491v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Communication overhead is a critical challenge in federated learning, particularly in bandwidth-constrained networks. Although many methods have been proposed to reduce communication overhead, most focus solely on compressing individual gradients, overlooking the temporal correlations among them. Prior studies have shown that gradients exhibit spatial correlations, typically reflected in low-rank structures. Through empirical analysis, we further observe a strong temporal correlation between client gradients across adjacent rounds. Based on these observations, we propose GradESTC, a compression technique that exploits both spatial and temporal gradient correlations. GradESTC exploits spatial correlations to decompose each full gradient into a compact set of basis vectors and corresponding combination coefficients. By exploiting temporal correlations, only a small portion of the basis vectors need to be dynamically updated in each round. GradESTC significantly reduces communication overhead by transmitting lightweight combination coefficients and a limited number of updated basis vectors instead of the full gradients. Extensive experiments show that, upon reaching a target accuracy level near convergence, GradESTC reduces uplink communication by an average of 39.79% compared to the strongest baseline, while maintaining comparable convergence speed and final accuracy to uncompressed FedAvg. By effectively leveraging spatio-temporal gradient structures, GradESTC offers a practical and scalable solution for communication-efficient federated learning.</p></details> |  |

We present a unique computational framework that integrates information from multiple time-resolved frames into a single high-quality image, while preserving the underlying biological content of the original video. We evaluate the proposed method through an extensive number of configurations (n = 111) and on a challenging dataset comprising dynamic, heterogeneous, and morphologically complex 2D monolayers of cardiac cells. Results show that our framework, which consists of a combination of explainable techniques from different computer vision application fields, is capable of generating composite images that preserve and enhance the quality and information of individual microscopy frames, yielding 44% average increase in cell count compared to previous methods. The proposed pipeline is applicable to other imaging domains that require the fusion of multi-temporal image stacks into high-quality 2D images, thereby facilitating annotation and downstream segmentation.</p></details> |  |
| **[AgriFM: A Multi-source Temporal Remote Sensing Foundation Model for Agriculture Mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21357v3)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate crop mapping fundamentally relies on modeling multi-scale spatiotemporal patterns, where spatial scales range from individual field textures to landscape-level context, and temporal scales capture both short-term phenological transitions and full growing-season dynamics. Transformer-based remote sensing foundation models (RSFMs) offer promising potential for crop mapping due to their innate ability for unified spatiotemporal processing. However, current RSFMs remain suboptimal for crop mapping: they either employ fixed spatiotemporal windows that ignore the multi-scale nature of crop systems or completely disregard temporal information by focusing solely on spatial patterns. To bridge these gaps, we present AgriFM, a multi-source remote sensing foundation model specifically designed for agricultural crop mapping. Our approach begins by establishing the necessity of simultaneous hierarchical spatiotemporal feature extraction, leading to the development of a modified Video Swin Transformer architecture where temporal down-sampling is synchronized with spatial scaling operations. This modified backbone enables efficient unified processing of long time-series satellite inputs. AgriFM leverages temporally rich data streams from three satellite sources including MODIS, Landsat-8/9 and Sentinel-2, and is pre-trained on a global representative dataset comprising over 25 million image samples supervised by land cover products. The resulting framework incorporates a versatile decoder architecture that dynamically fuses these learned spatiotemporal representations, supporting diverse downstream tasks. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate AgriFM's superior performance over conventional deep learning approaches and state-of-the-art general-purpose RSFMs across all downstream tasks. Codes will be available at https://github.com/flyakon/AgriFM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Jump-teaching: Combating Sample Selection Bias via Temporal Disagreement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17137v5)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sample selection is a straightforward technique to combat noisy labels, aiming to prevent mislabeled samples from degrading the robustness of neural networks. However, existing methods mitigate compounding selection bias either by leveraging dual-network disagreement or additional forward propagations, leading to multiplied training overhead. To address this challenge, we introduce $\textit{Jump-teaching}$, an efficient sample selection framework for debiased model update and simplified selection criterion. Based on a key observation that a neural network exhibits significant disagreement across different training iterations, Jump-teaching proposes a jump-manner model update strategy to enable self-correction of selection bias by harnessing temporal disagreement, eliminating the need for multi-network or multi-round training. Furthermore, we employ a sample-wise selection criterion building on the intra variance of a decomposed single loss for a fine-grained selection without relying on batch-wise ranking or dataset-wise modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Jump-teaching outperforms state-of-the-art counterparts while achieving a nearly overhead-free selection procedure, which boosts training speed by up to $4.47\times$ and reduces peak memory footprint by $54\%$.</p></details> |  |

To better respond real-time user feedback, we have deployed an interactive recommender system (IRS) alongside our core homepage recommender system. This IRS is triggered by user click on homepage, and generates a series of highly relevant recommendations based on the clicked item to meet focused browsing demands. Different from traditional e-commerce RecSys, the full-screen UI and immersive swiping down functionality present two distinct challenges for regular ranking system. First, there exists explicit interference (overlap or conflicts) between ranking objectives, i.e., conversion, view and swipe down. This is because there are intrinsic behavioral co-occurrences under the premise of immersive browsing and swiping down functionality. Second, the ranking system is prone to temporal greedy traps in sequential recommendation slot transitions, which is caused by full-screen UI design. To alleviate these challenges, we propose a novel Spatio-temporal collaborative ranking (STCRank) framework to achieve collaboration between multi-objectives within one slot (spatial) and between multiple sequential recommondation slots. In multi-objective collaboration (MOC) module, we push Pareto frontier by mitigating the objective overlaps and conflicts. In multi-slot collaboration (MSC) module, we achieve global optima on overall sequential slots by dual-stage look-ahead ranking mechanism.

| **[Enhancing Federated Class-Incremental Learning via Spatial-Temporal Statistics Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01327v2)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Class-Incremental Learning (FCIL) enables Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) from distributed data. Existing FCIL methods typically integrate old knowledge preservation into local client training. However, these methods cannot avoid spatial-temporal client drift caused by data heterogeneity and often incur significant computational and communication overhead, limiting practical deployment. To address these challenges simultaneously, we propose a novel approach, Spatial-Temporal Statistics Aggregation (STSA), which provides a unified framework to aggregate feature statistics both spatially (across clients) and temporally (across stages). The aggregated feature statistics are unaffected by data heterogeneity and can be used to update the classifier in closed form at each stage. Additionally, we introduce STSA-E, a communication-efficient variant with theoretical guarantees, achieving similar performance to STSA-E with much lower communication overhead. Extensive experiments on three widely used FCIL datasets, with varying degrees of data heterogeneity, show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art FCIL methods in terms of performance, flexibility, and both communication and computation efficiency.

However, real-world information needs often require reasoning about temporal evolution and synthesizing evidence across time periods. We introduce TEMPO, the first benchmark combining temporal reasoning with reasoning-intensive retrieval across 13 domains. TEMPO features: (1) 1,730 complex queries requiring deep temporal reasoning such as tracking changes, identifying trends, or comparing cross-period evidence; (2) step-wise retrieval planning with 3,976 decomposed steps and gold documents mapped to each step for multi-hop evaluation; and (3) novel temporal metrics including Temporal Coverage@k and Temporal Precision@k measuring whether results span required time periods. Evaluation of 12 retrieval systems reveals substantial challenges: the best model (DiVeR) achieves only 32.0 NDCG@10 and 71.4\% Temporal Coverage@10, demonstrating difficulty in retrieving temporally complete evidence. We believe TEMPO provides a challenging benchmark for improving temporal reasoning in retrieval and RAG systems. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/tempo-bench/Tempo.

| **[Structured yet Bounded Temporal Understanding in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16685v2)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) increasingly show strong performance on temporally grounded tasks, such as timeline construction, temporal question answering, and event ordering. However, it remains unclear how their behavior depends on the way time is anchored in language. In this work, we study LLMs' temporal understanding through temporal frames of reference (t-FoRs), contrasting deictic framing (past-present-future) and sequential framing (before-after). Using a large-scale dataset of real-world events from Wikidata and similarity judgement task, we examine how LLMs' outputs vary with temporal distance, interval relations, and event duration. Our results show that LLMs systematically adapt to both t-FoRs, but the resulting similarity patterns differ significantly. Under deictic t-FoR, the similarity judgement scores form graded and asymmetric structures centered on the present, with sharper decline for future events and higher variance in the past. Under sequential t-FoR, similarity becomes strongly negative once events are temporally separated. Temporal judgements are also shaped by interval algebra and duration, with instability concentrated in overlap- and containment-based relations, and duration influencing only past events under deictic t-FoR. Overall, these findings characterize how LLMs organize temporal representation under different reference structures and identify the factors that most strongly shape their temporal understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review.

Recently, we have witnessed the rise of variational autoencoder-based latent factor models, which learn latent factors self-adaptively. While these models focus on modeling overall market conditions, they often fail to effectively capture the temporal patterns of individual stocks. Additionally, representing multiple factors as single values simplifies the model but limits its ability to capture complex relationships and dependencies. As a result, the learned factors are of low quality and lack diversity, reducing their effectiveness and robustness across different trading periods. To address these issues, we propose a Spatio-Temporal factOR Model based on dual vector quantized variational autoencoders, named STORM, which extracts features of stocks from temporal and spatial perspectives, then fuses and aligns these features at the fine-grained and semantic level, and represents the factors as multi-dimensional embeddings. The discrete codebooks cluster similar factor embeddings, ensuring orthogonality and diversity, which helps distinguish between different factors and enables factor selection in financial trading. To show the performance of the proposed factor model, we apply it to two downstream experiments: portfolio management on two stock datasets and individual trading tasks on six specific stocks. The extensive experiments demonstrate STORM's flexibility in adapting to downstream tasks and superior performance over baseline models.</p></details> |  |

Recently, the evolving dynamics of knowledge have attracted a growing interest in Temporal Knowledge Graph Question Answering (TKGQA), an emerging task to answer temporal questions. However, this field grapples with ambiguities in defining temporal questions and lacks a systematic categorization of existing methods for TKGQA. In response, this paper provides a thorough survey from two perspectives: the taxonomy of temporal questions and the methodological categorization for TKGQA. Specifically, we first establish a detailed taxonomy of temporal questions engaged in prior studies. Subsequently, we provide a comprehensive review of TKGQA techniques of two categories: semantic parsing-based and TKG embedding-based. Building on this review, the paper outlines potential research directions aimed at advancing the field of TKGQA. This work aims to serve as a comprehensive reference for TKGQA and to stimulate further research.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures.

| **[Point Tracking as a Temporal Cue for Robust Myocardial Segmentation in Echocardiography Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09207v1)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Purpose: Myocardium segmentation in echocardiography videos is a challenging task due to low contrast, noise, and anatomical variability. Traditional deep learning models either process frames independently, ignoring temporal information, or rely on memory-based feature propagation, which accumulates error over time. Methods: We propose Point-Seg, a transformer-based segmentation framework that integrates point tracking as a temporal cue to ensure stable and consistent segmentation of myocardium across frames. Our method leverages a point-tracking module trained on a synthetic echocardiography dataset to track key anatomical landmarks across video sequences. These tracked trajectories provide an explicit motion-aware signal that guides segmentation, reducing drift and eliminating the need for memory-based feature accumulation. Additionally, we incorporate a temporal smoothing loss to further enhance temporal consistency across frames. Results: We evaluate our approach on both public and private echocardiography datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that Point-Seg has statistically similar accuracy in terms of Dice to state-of-the-art segmentation models in high quality echo data, while it achieves better segmentation accuracy in lower quality echo with improved temporal stability. Furthermore, Point-Seg has the key advantage of pixel-level myocardium motion information as opposed to other segmentation methods. Such information is essential in the computation of other downstream tasks such as myocardial strain measurement and regional wall motion abnormality detection. Conclusion: Point-Seg demonstrates that point tracking can serve as an effective temporal cue for consistent video segmentation, offering a reliable and generalizable approach for myocardium segmentation in echocardiography videos.

| **[Temporal Smoothness-Aware Rate-Distortion Optimized 4D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17336v3)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) effectively extends the high-speed rendering capabilities of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to represent volumetric videos. However, the large number of Gaussians, substantial temporal redundancies, and especially the absence of an entropy-aware compression framework result in large storage requirements. Consequently, this poses significant challenges for practical deployment, efficient edge-device processing, and data transmission. In this paper, we introduce a novel end-to-end RD-optimized compression framework tailored for 4DGS, aiming to enable flexible, high-fidelity rendering across varied computational platforms. Leveraging Fully Explicit Dynamic Gaussian Splatting (Ex4DGS), one of the state-of-the-art 4DGS methods, as our baseline, we start from the existing 3DGS compression methods for compatibility while effectively addressing additional challenges introduced by the temporal axis. In particular, instead of storing motion trajectories independently per point, we employ a wavelet transform to reflect the real-world smoothness prior, significantly enhancing storage efficiency. This approach yields significantly improved compression ratios and provides a user-controlled balance between compression efficiency and rendering quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving up to 91$\times$ compression compared to the original Ex4DGS model while maintaining high visual fidelity. These results highlight the applicability of our framework for real-time dynamic scene rendering in diverse scenarios, from resource-constrained edge devices to high-performance environments.

| **[TrackNetV5: Residual-Driven Spatio-Temporal Refinement and Motion Direction Decoupling for Fast Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02789v4)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The TrackNet series has established a strong baseline for fast-moving small object tracking in sports. However, existing iterations face significant limitations: V1-V3 struggle with occlusions due to a reliance on purely visual cues, while TrackNetV4, despite introducing motion inputs, suffers from directional ambiguity as its absolute difference method discards motion polarity. To overcome these bottlenecks, we propose TrackNetV5, a robust architecture integrating two novel mechanisms. First, to recover lost directional priors, we introduce the Motion Direction Decoupling (MDD) module. Unlike V4, MDD decomposes temporal dynamics into signed polarity fields, explicitly encoding both movement occurrence and trajectory direction. Second, we propose the Residual-Driven Spatio-Temporal Refinement (R-STR) head. Operating on a coarse-to-fine paradigm, this Transformer-based module leverages factorized spatio-temporal contexts to estimate a corrective residual, effectively recovering occluded targets. Extensive experiments on the TrackNetV2 dataset demonstrate that TrackNetV5 achieves a new state-of-the-art F1-score of 0.9859 and an accuracy of 0.9733, significantly outperforming previous versions. Notably, this performance leap is achieved with a marginal 3.7% increase in FLOPs compared to V4, maintaining real-time inference capabilities while delivering superior tracking precision.</p></details> |  |

We analysed TFN in post-kidney transplant (KTx) care, with a retrospective cohort of 3382 patients, on three key outcomes: graft loss, graft rejection, and mortality. Compared to state-of-the-art model in post KTx care, TFN achieved higher performance for graft loss (AUC 0.96 vs. 0.94) and graft rejection (AUC 0.84 vs. 0.74). In mortality prediction, TFN yielded an AUC of 0.86. TFN outperformed unimodal baselines (approx 10% AUC improvement over time series only baseline, approx 5% AUC improvement over time series with static patient data). Integrating clinical text improved performance across all tasks. Disentanglement metrics confirmed robust and interpretable latent factors in the embedding space, and SHAP-based attributions confirmed alignment with clinical reasoning. TFN has potential application in clinical tasks beyond KTx, where heterogeneous data sources, irregular longitudinal data, and rich narrative documentation are available.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 9 figures, 3 tables.

| **[Measuring Iterative Temporal Reasoning with Time Puzzles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07148v2)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Time Puzzles, a constraint-based date inference task for evaluating iterative temporal reasoning. Each puzzle combines factual temporal anchors with (cross-cultural) calendar relations, admits one or multiple valid solution dates, and is algorithmically generated for controlled, dynamic, and continual evaluation. Across 13 diverse LLMs, Time Puzzles well distinguishes their iterative temporal reasoning capabilities and remains challenging without tools: GPT-5 reaches only 49.3% accuracy and all other models stay below 31%, despite the dataset's simplicity. Web search consistently yields substantial gains and using code interpreter shows mixed effects, but all models perform much better when constraints are rewritten with explicit dates, revealing a gap in reliable tool use. Overall, Time Puzzles presents a simple, cost-effective diagnostic for tool-augmented iterative temporal reasoning.</p></details> |  |

Diagnostic complexity arises from visual symptom overlap with conditions like age-related macular degeneration and hypertensive retinopathy, exacerbated by high misdiagnosis rates in underserved regions. This study introduces TIMM-ProRS, a novel deep learning framework integrating Vision Transformer (ViT), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Graph Neural Network (GNN) with multi-modal fusion. TIMM-ProRS uniquely leverages both retinal images and temporal biomarkers (HbA1c, retinal thickness) to capture multi-modal and temporal dynamics. Evaluated comprehensively across diverse datasets including APTOS 2019 (trained), Messidor-2, RFMiD, EyePACS, and Messidor-1 (validated), the model achieves 97.8\% accuracy and an F1-score of 0.96, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance and outperforming existing methods like RSG-Net and DeepDR. This approach enables early, precise, and interpretable diagnosis, supporting scalable telemedical management and enhancing global eye health sustainability.</p></details> |  |
| **[STO-RL: Offline RL under Sparse Rewards via LLM-Guided Subgoal Temporal Order](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08107v1)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline reinforcement learning (RL) enables policy learning from pre-collected datasets, avoiding costly and risky online interactions, but it often struggles with long-horizon tasks involving sparse rewards. Existing goal-conditioned and hierarchical offline RL methods decompose such tasks and generate intermediate rewards to mitigate limitations of traditional offline RL, but usually overlook temporal dependencies among subgoals and rely on imprecise reward shaping, leading to suboptimal policies. To address these issues, we propose STO-RL (Offline RL using LLM-Guided Subgoal Temporal Order), an offline RL framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate temporally ordered subgoal sequences and corresponding state-to-subgoal-stage mappings. Using this temporal structure, STO-RL applies potential-based reward shaping to transform sparse terminal rewards into dense, temporally consistent signals, promoting subgoal progress while avoiding suboptimal solutions. The resulting augmented dataset with shaped rewards enables efficient offline training of high-performing policies. Evaluations on four discrete and continuous sparse-reward benchmarks demonstrate that STO-RL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art offline goal-conditioned and hierarchical RL baselines, achieving faster convergence, higher success rates, and shorter trajectories. Ablation studies further confirm STO-RL's robustness to imperfect or noisy LLM-generated subgoal sequences, demonstrating that LLM-guided subgoal temporal structures combined with theoretically grounded reward shaping provide a practical and scalable solution for long-horizon offline RL.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (AAMAS 2026)</p></details> |
| **[Temporal-Aligned Meta-Learning for Risk Management: A Stacking Approach for Multi-Source Credit Scoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07588v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a meta-learning framework for credit risk assessment of Italian Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) that explicitly addresses the temporal misalignment of credit scoring models. The approach aligns financial statement reference dates with evaluation dates, mitigating bias arising from publication delays and asynchronous data sources. It is based on a two-step temporal decomposition that at first estimates annual probabilities of default (PDs) anchored to balance-sheet reference dates (December 31st) through a static model. Then it models the monthly evolution of PDs using higher-frequency behavioral data. Finally, we employ stacking-based architecture to aggregate multiple scoring systems, each capturing complementary aspects of default risk, into a unified predictive model. In this way, first level model outputs are treated as learned representations that encode non-linear relationships in financial and behavioral indicators, allowing integration of new expert-based features without retraining base models. This design provides a coherent and interpretable solution to challenges typical of low-default environments, including heterogeneous default definitions and reporting delays. Empirical validation shows that the framework effectively captures credit risk evolution over time, improving temporal consistency and predictive stability relative to standard ensemble methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[TFEC: Multivariate Time-Series Clustering via Temporal-Frequency Enhanced Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07550v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate Time-Series (MTS) clustering is crucial for signal processing and data analysis. Although deep learning approaches, particularly those leveraging Contrastive Learning (CL), are prominent for MTS representation, existing CL-based models face two key limitations: 1) neglecting clustering information during positive/negative sample pair construction, and 2) introducing unreasonable inductive biases, e.g., destroying time dependence and periodicity through augmentation strategies, compromising representation quality. This paper, therefore, proposes a Temporal-Frequency Enhanced Contrastive (TFEC) learning framework. To preserve temporal structure while generating low-distortion representations, a temporal-frequency Co-EnHancement (CoEH) mechanism is introduced. Accordingly, a synergistic dual-path representation and cluster distribution learning framework is designed to jointly optimize cluster structure and representation fidelity. Experiments on six real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate TFEC's superiority, achieving 4.48% average NMI gains over SOTA methods, with ablation studies validating the design.

| **[Beyond Dialogue Time: Temporal Semantic Memory for Personalized LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07468v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Memory enables Large Language Model (LLM) agents to perceive, store, and use information from past dialogues, which is essential for personalization. However, existing methods fail to properly model the temporal dimension of memory in two aspects: 1) Temporal inaccuracy: memories are organized by dialogue time rather than their actual occurrence time; 2) Temporal fragmentation: existing methods focus on point-wise memory, losing durative information that captures persistent states and evolving patterns. To address these limitations, we propose Temporal Semantic Memory (TSM), a memory framework that models semantic time for point-wise memory and supports the construction and utilization of durative memory. During memory construction, it first builds a semantic timeline rather than a dialogue one. Then, it consolidates temporally continuous and semantically related information into a durative memory. During memory utilization, it incorporates the query's temporal intent on the semantic timeline, enabling the retrieval of temporally appropriate durative memories and providing time-valid, duration-consistent context to support response generation. Experiments on LongMemEval and LoCoMo show that TSM consistently outperforms existing methods and achieves up to 12.2% absolute improvement in accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Convolutional Forward Model for Passive Acoustic Mapping and Temporal Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07356v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Passive acoustic mapping (PAM) is a key imaging technique for characterizing cavitation activity in therapeutic ultrasound applications. Recent model-based beamforming algorithms offer high reconstruction quality and strong physical interpretability. However, their computational burden and limited temporal resolution restrict their use in applications with time-evolving cavitation. To address these challenges, we introduce a PAM beamforming framework based on a novel convolutional formulation in the time domain, which enables efficient computation. In this framework, PAM is formulated as an inverse problem in which the forward operator maps spatiotemporal cavitation activity to recorded radio-frequency signals accounting for time-of-flight delays defined by the acquisition geometry. We then formulate a regularized inversion algorithm that incorporates prior knowledge on cavitation activity. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms classical beamforming methods, providing higher temporal resolution than frequency-domain techniques while substantially reducing computational burden compared with iterative time-domain formulations.</p></details> |  |
| **[BEAT-Net: Injecting Biomimetic Spatio-Temporal Priors for Interpretable ECG Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07316v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although deep learning has advanced automated electrocardiogram (ECG) diagnosis, prevalent supervised methods typically treat recordings as undifferentiated one-dimensional (1D) signals or two-dimensional (2D) images. This formulation compels models to learn physiological structures implicitly, resulting in data inefficiency and opacity that diverge from medical reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose BEAT-Net, a Biomimetic ECG Analysis with Tokenization framework that reformulates the problem as a language modeling task. Utilizing a QRS tokenization strategy to transform continuous signals into biologically aligned heartbeat sequences, the architecture explicitly decomposes cardiac physiology through specialized encoders that extract local beat morphology while normalizing spatial lead perspectives and modeling temporal rhythm dependencies. Evaluations across three large-scale benchmarks demonstrate that BEAT-Net matches the diagnostic accuracy of dominant convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures while substantially improving robustness. The framework exhibits exceptional data efficiency, recovering fully supervised performance using only 30 to 35 percent of annotated data. Moreover, learned attention mechanisms provide inherent interpretability by spontaneously reproducing clinical heuristics, such as Lead II prioritization for rhythm analysis, without explicit supervision. These findings indicate that integrating biological priors offers a computationally efficient and interpretable alternative to data-intensive large-scale pre-training.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures and 2 tables</p></details> |

With this, VideoLoom achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance across a variety of spatial and temporal benchmarks (e.g., 63.1 J&F on ReVOS for referring video object segmentation, and 48.3 R1@0.7 on Charades-STA for temporal grounding). In addition, we introduce LoomBench, a novel benchmark consisting of temporal, spatial, and compositional video-question pairs, enabling a comprehensive evaluation of Video LLMs from diverse aspects. Collectively, these contributions offer a universal and effective suite for joint spatial-temporal video understanding, setting a new standard in multimodal intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[SIGNL: A Label-Efficient Audio Deepfake Detection System via Spectral-Temporal Graph Non-Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04942v2)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Audio deepfake detection is increasingly important as synthetic speech becomes more realistic and accessible. Recent methods, including those using graph neural networks (GNNs) to model frequency and temporal dependencies, show strong potential but need large amounts of labeled data, which limits their practical use. Label-efficient alternatives like graph-based non-contrastive learning offer a potential solution, as they can learn useful representations from unlabeled data without using negative samples. However, current graph non-contrastive approaches are built for single-view graph representations and cannot be directly used for audio, which has unique spectral and temporal structures. Bridging this gap requires dual-view graph modeling suited to audio signals. In this work, we introduce SIGNL (Spectral-temporal vIsion Graph Non-contrastive Learning), a label-efficient expert system for detecting audio deepfakes. SIGNL operates on the visual representation of audio, such as spectrograms or other time-frequency encodings, transforming them into spectral and temporal graphs for structured feature extraction. It then employs graph convolutional encoders to learn complementary frequency-time features, effectively capturing the unique characteristics of audio. These encoders are pre-trained using a non-contrastive self-supervised learning strategy on augmented graph pairs, enabling effective representation learning without labeled data. The resulting encoders are then fine-tuned on minimal labelled data for downstream deepfake detection. SIGNL achieves strong performance on multiple audio deepfake detection benchmarks, including 7.88% EER on ASVspoof 2021 DF and 3.95% EER on ASVspoof 5 using only 5% labeled data. It also generalizes well to unseen conditions, reaching 10.16% EER on the In-The-Wild dataset when trained on CFAD.</p></details> |  |

The framework is built on two key designs: (1) decoupled semantic and speaker streams fine-tuned via Serialized Output Training (SOT) to learn turn-taking dynamics; and (2) an interleaved time anchor mechanism that not only supports fine-grained timestamp prediction but also acts as a synchronization signal between semantic understanding and speaker tracking. Compared to previous works that primarily focus on speaker-attributed ASR or implicit diarization, TagSpeech addresses the challenge of fine-grained speaker-content alignment and explicitly models "who spoke what and when" in an end-to-end manner. Experiments on AMI and AliMeeting benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves consistent improvements in Diarization Error Rate (DER) over strong end-to-end baselines, including Qwen-Omni and Gemini, particularly in handling complex speech overlaps. Moreover, TagSpeech employs a parameter-efficient training paradigm in which the LLM backbone is frozen and only lightweight projectors are trained, resulting in strong performance with low computational cost.</p></details> |  |
| **[U-MASK: User-adaptive Spatio-Temporal Masking for Personalized Mobile AI Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06867v1)** | 2026-01-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Personalized mobile artificial intelligence applications are widely deployed, yet they are expected to infer user behavior from sparse and irregular histories under a continuously evolving spatio-temporal context. This setting induces a fundamental tension among three requirements, i.e., immediacy to adapt to recent behavior, stability to resist transient noise, and generalization to support long-horizon prediction and cold-start users. Most existing approaches satisfy at most two of these requirements, resulting in an inherent impossibility triangle in data-scarce, non-stationary personalization. To address this challenge, we model mobile behavior as a partially observed spatio-temporal tensor and unify short-term adaptation, long-horizon forecasting, and cold-start recommendation as a conditional completion problem, where a user- and task-specific mask specifies which coordinates are treated as evidence. We propose U-MASK, a user-adaptive spatio-temporal masking method that allocates evidence budgets based on user reliability and task sensitivity. To enable mask generation under sparse observations, U-MASK learns a compact, task-agnostic user representation from app and location histories via U-SCOPE, which serves as the sole semantic conditioning signal. A shared diffusion transformer then performs mask-guided generative completion while preserving observed evidence, so personalization and task differentiation are governed entirely by the mask and the user representation. Experiments on real-world mobile datasets demonstrate consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods across short-term prediction, long-horizon forecasting, and cold-start settings, with the largest gains under severe data sparsity. The code and dataset will be available at https://github.com/NICE-HKU/U-MASK.</p></details> | 18 pages, 9 figures |

The challenge of registering time-series images often lies in the occurrence of large motions, especially when images differ significantly from a reference (e.g., the start of a cardiac cycle compared to the peak stretching phase). To achieve accurate and robust registration results, we leverage the nature of motion continuity and exploit the temporal smoothness in consecutive image frames. Our proposed TLRN highlights a temporal residual network with residual blocks carefully designed in latent deformation spaces, which are parameterized by time-sequential initial velocity fields. We treat a sequence of residual blocks over time as a dynamic training system, where each block is designed to learn the residual function between desired deformation features and current input accumulated from previous time frames. We validate the effectivenss of TLRN on both synthetic data and real-world cine cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) image videos. Our experimental results shows that TLRN is able to achieve substantially improved registration accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art.

| **[Predictive inference for time series: why is split conformal effective despite temporal dependence?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02471v2)** | 2026-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of uncertainty quantification for prediction in a time series: if we use past data to forecast the next time point, can we provide valid prediction intervals around our forecasts? To avoid placing distributional assumptions on the data, in recent years the conformal prediction method has been a popular approach for predictive inference, since it provides distribution-free coverage for any iid or exchangeable data distribution. However, in the time series setting, the strong empirical performance of conformal prediction methods is not well understood, since even short-range temporal dependence is a strong violation of the exchangeability assumption. Using predictors with "memory" -- i.e., predictors that utilize past observations, such as autoregressive models -- further exacerbates this problem. In this work, we examine the theoretical properties of split conformal prediction in the time series setting, including the case where predictors may have memory. Our results bound the loss of coverage of these methods in terms of a new "switch coefficient", measuring the extent to which temporal dependence within the time series creates violations of exchangeability. Our characterization of the coverage probability is sharp over the class of stationary, $β$-mixing processes. Along the way, we introduce tools that may prove useful in analyzing other predictive inference methods for dependent data.</p></details> | <details><summary>v2 ha...</summary><p>v2 has minor changes to the presentation</p></details> |

| **[The Trajectory Alignment Coefficient in Two Acts: From Reward Tuning to Reward Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16906v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The success of reinforcement learning (RL) is fundamentally tied to having a reward function that accurately reflects the task objective. Yet, designing reward functions is notoriously time-consuming and prone to misspecification. To address this issue, our first goal is to understand how to support RL practitioners in specifying appropriate weights for a reward function. We leverage the Trajectory Alignment Coefficient (TAC), a metric that evaluates how closely a reward function's induced preferences match those of a domain expert. To evaluate whether TAC provides effective support in practice, we conducted a human-subject study in which RL practitioners tuned reward weights for Lunar Lander. We found that providing TAC during reward tuning led participants to produce more performant reward functions and report lower cognitive workload relative to standard tuning without TAC. However, the study also underscored that manual reward design, even with TAC, remains labor-intensive. This limitation motivated our second goal: to learn a reward model that maximizes TAC directly. Specifically, we propose Soft-TAC, a differentiable approximation of TAC that can be used as a loss function to train reward models from human preference data. Validated in the racing simulator Gran Turismo 7, reward models trained using Soft-TAC successfully captured preference-specific objectives, resulting in policies with qualitatively more distinct behaviors than models trained with standard Cross-Entropy loss. This work demonstrates that TAC can serve as both a practical tool for guiding reward tuning and a reward learning objective in complex domains.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents HumanDiffusion, a lightweight image-conditioned diffusion planner that generates human-aware navigation trajectories directly from RGB imagery. The system combines YOLO-11 based human detection with diffusion-driven trajectory generation, enabling a quadrotor to approach a target person and deliver medical assistance without relying on prior maps or computationally intensive planning pipelines. Trajectories are predicted in pixel space, ensuring smooth motion and a consistent safety margin around humans. We evaluate HumanDiffusion in simulation and real-world indoor mock-disaster scenarios. On a 300-sample test set, the model achieves a mean squared error of 0.02 in pixel-space trajectory reconstruction. Real-world experiments demonstrate an overall mission success rate of 80% across accident-response and search-and-locate tasks with partial occlusions. These results indicate that human-conditioned diffusion planning offers a practical and robust solution for human-aware UAV navigation in time-critical assistance settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted at HRI, Late Breaking Report, 2026</p></details> |
| **[MoE-Enhanced Multi-Domain Feature Selection and Fusion for Fast Map-Free Trajectory Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02368v2)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is crucial for the reliability and safety of autonomous driving systems, yet it remains a challenging task in complex interactive scenarios due to noisy trajectory observations and intricate agent interactions. Existing methods often struggle to filter redundant scene data for discriminative information extraction, directly impairing trajectory prediction accuracy especially when handling outliers and dynamic multi-agent interactions. In response to these limitations, we present a novel map-free trajectory prediction method which adaptively eliminates redundant information and selects discriminative features across the temporal, spatial, and frequency domains, thereby enabling precise trajectory prediction in real-world driving environments. First, we design a MoE based frequency domain filter to adaptively weight distinct frequency components of observed trajectory data and suppress outlier related noise; then a selective spatiotemporal attention module that reallocates weights across temporal nodes (sequential dependencies), temporal trends (evolution patterns), and spatial nodes to extract salient information is proposed. Finally, our multimodal decoder-supervised by joint patch level and point-level losses generates reasonable and temporally consistent trajectories, and comprehensive experiments on the large-scale NuScenes and Argoverse dataset demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance and low-latency inference performance compared with recently proposed methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[R$^2$PO: Decoupling Training Trajectories from Inference Responses for LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11960v2)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning has become a central paradigm for improving LLM reasoning. However, existing methods use a single policy to produce both inference responses and training optimization trajectories. The objective conflict between generating stable inference responses and diverse training trajectories leads to insufficient exploration, which harms reasoning capability. In this paper, to address the problem, we propose R$^2$PO (Residual Rollout Policy Optimization), which introduces a lightweight Residual Rollout-Head atop the policy to decouple training trajectories from inference responses, enabling controlled trajectory diversification during training while keeping inference generation stable. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms baselines, achieving average accuracy gains of 3.4% on MATH-500 and 1.3% on APPS, while also reducing formatting errors and mitigating length bias for stable optimization. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/RRPO-ARR/Code.</p></details> |  |
| **[Life Sequence Transformer: Generative Modelling of Socio-Economic Trajectories from Administrative Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01874v2)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative modelling with Transformer architectures can simulate complex sequential structures across various applications. We extend this line of work to the social sciences by introducing a Transformer-based generative model tailored to longitudinal socio-economic data. Our contributions are: (i) we design a novel encoding method that represents socio-economic life histories as sequences, including overlapping events across life domains; and (ii) we adapt generative modelling techniques to simulate plausible alternative life trajectories conditioned on past histories. Using large-scale data from the Italian social security administration (INPS), we show that the model can be trained at scale, reproduces realistic labour market patterns consistent with known causal relationships, and generates coherent hypothetical life paths. This work demonstrates the feasibility of generative modelling for socio-economic trajectories and opens new opportunities for policy-oriented research, with counterfactual generation as a particularly promising application.</p></details> |  |
| **[Universal Refusal Circuits Across LLMs: Cross-Model Transfer via Trajectory Replay and Concept-Basis Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16034v1)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Refusal behavior in aligned LLMs is often viewed as model-specific, yet we hypothesize it stems from a universal, low-dimensional semantic circuit shared across models. To test this, we introduce Trajectory Replay via Concept-Basis Reconstruction, a framework that transfers refusal interventions from donor to target models, spanning diverse architectures (e.g., Dense to MoE) and training regimes, without using target-side refusal supervision. By aligning layers via concept fingerprints and reconstructing refusal directions using a shared ``recipe'' of concept atoms, we map the donor's ablation trajectory into the target's semantic space. To preserve capabilities, we introduce a weight-SVD stability guard that projects interventions away from high-variance weight subspaces to prevent collateral damage. Our evaluation across 8 model pairs (including GPT-OSS-20B and GLM-4) confirms that these transferred recipes consistently attenuate refusal while maintaining performance, providing strong evidence for the semantic universality of safety alignment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Emerging from Ground: Addressing Intent Deviation in Tool-Using Agents via Deriving Real Calls into Virtual Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15120v2)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs have advanced tool-using agents for real-world applications, yet they often lead to unexpected behaviors or results. Beyond obvious failures, the subtle issue of "intent deviation" severely hinders reliable evaluation and performance improvement. Existing post-training methods generally leverage either real system samples or virtual data simulated by LLMs. However, the former is costly due to reliance on hand-crafted user requests, while the latter suffers from distribution shift from the real tools in the wild. Additionally, both methods lack negative samples tailored to intent deviation scenarios, hindering effective guidance on preference learning. We introduce RISE, a "Real-to-Virtual" method designed to mitigate intent deviation. Anchoring on verified tool primitives, RISE synthesizes virtual trajectories and generates diverse negative samples through mutation on critical parameters. With synthetic data, RISE fine-tunes backbone LLMs via the two-stage training for intent alignment. Evaluation results demonstrate that data synthesized by RISE achieve promising results in eight metrics covering user requires, execution trajectories and agent responses. Integrating with training, RISE achieves an average 35.28% improvement in Acctask (task completion) and 23.27% in Accintent (intent alignment), outperforming SOTA baselines by 1.20--42.09% and 1.17--54.93% respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamics of Agentic Loops in Large Language Models: A Geometric Theory of Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10350v3)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agentic systems built on large language models operate through recursive feedback loops, where each output becomes the next input. Yet the geometric behavior of these agentic loops (whether they converge, diverge, or exhibit more complex dynamics) remains poorly understood. This paper introduces a geometric framework for analyzing agentic trajectories in semantic embedding space, treating iterative transformations as discrete dynamical systems. We distinguish the artifact space, where linguistic transformations occur, from the embedding space, where geometric measurements are performed. Because cosine similarity is biased by embedding anisotropy, we introduce an isotonic calibration that eliminates systematic bias and aligns similarities with human semantic judgments while preserving high local stability. This enables rigorous measurement of trajectories, clusters and attractors. Through controlled experiments on singular agentic loops, we identify two fundamental regimes. A contractive rewriting loop converges toward a stable attractor with decreasing dispersion, while an exploratory summarize and negate loop produces unbounded divergence with no cluster formation. These regimes display qualitatively distinct geometric signatures of contraction and expansion. Our results show that prompt design directly governs the dynamical regime of an agentic loop, enabling systematic control of convergence, divergence and trajectory structure in iterative LLM transformations.</p></details> |  |
| **[PAD-TRO: Projection-Augmented Diffusion for Direct Trajectory Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04436v2)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, diffusion models have gained popularity and attention in trajectory optimization due to their capability of modeling multi-modal probability distributions. However, addressing nonlinear equality constraints, i.e, dynamic feasibility, remains a great challenge in diffusion-based trajectory optimization. Recent diffusion-based trajectory optimization frameworks rely on a single-shooting style approach where the denoised control sequence is applied to forward propagate the dynamical system, which cannot explicitly enforce constraints on the states and frequently leads to sub-optimal solutions. In this work, we propose a novel direct trajectory optimization approach via model-based diffusion, which directly generates a sequence of states. To ensure dynamic feasibility, we propose a gradient-free projection mechanism that is incorporated into the reverse diffusion process. Our results show that, compared to a recent state-of-the-art baseline, our approach leads to zero dynamic feasibility error and approximately 4x higher success rate in a quadrotor waypoint navigation scenario involving dense static obstacles.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the 2026 American Control Conference</p></details> |
| **[CLEANER: Self-Purified Trajectories Boost Agentic Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15141v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agentic Reinforcement Learning (RL) has empowered Large Language Models (LLMs) to utilize tools like Python interpreters for complex problem-solving. However, for parameter-constrained models (e.g., 4B--7B), the exploration phase is often plagued by frequent execution failures, creating noisy trajectories that hinder policy optimization. Under standard outcome-based reward settings, this noise leads to a critical credit assignment issue, where erroneous actions are inadvertently reinforced alongside successful outcomes. Existing mitigations face a dilemma: dense rewards often trigger reward hacking, while supersampling incurs prohibitive computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose CLEANER. Distinct from external filtering methods, CLEANER exploits the model's intrinsic self-correction capabilities to eliminate error-contaminated context directly during data collection. At its core, the Similarity-Aware Adaptive Rollback (SAAR) mechanism autonomously constructs clean, purified trajectories by retrospectively replacing failures with successful self-corrections. Based on semantic similarity, SAAR adaptively regulates replacement granularity from shallow execution repairs to deep reasoning substitutions. By training on these self-purified paths, the model internalizes correct reasoning patterns rather than error-recovery loops. Empirical results on AIME24/25, GPQA, and LiveCodeBench show average accuracy gains of 6%, 3%, and 5% over baselines. Notably, CLEANER matches state-of-the-art performance using only one-third of the training steps, highlighting trajectory purification as a scalable solution for efficient agentic RL. Our models and code are available at GitHub</p></details> |  |
| **[Context-aware Learned Mesh-based Simulation via Trajectory-Level Meta-Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05234v2)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulating object deformations is a critical challenge across many scientific domains, including robotics, manufacturing, and structural mechanics. Learned Graph Network Simulators (GNSs) offer a promising alternative to traditional mesh-based physics simulators. Their speed and inherent differentiability make them particularly well suited for applications that require fast and accurate simulations, such as robotic manipulation or manufacturing optimization. However, existing learned simulators typically rely on single-step observations, which limits their ability to exploit temporal context. Without this information, these models fail to infer, e.g., material properties. Further, they rely on auto-regressive rollouts, which quickly accumulate error for long trajectories. We instead frame mesh-based simulation as a trajectory-level meta-learning problem. Using Conditional Neural Processes, our method enables rapid adaptation to new simulation scenarios from limited initial data while capturing their latent simulation properties. We utilize movement primitives to directly predict fast, stable and accurate simulations from a single model call. The resulting approach, Movement-primitive Meta-MeshGraphNet (M3GN), provides higher simulation accuracy at a fraction of the runtime cost compared to state-of-the-art GNSs across several tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages.

| **[Trajectory-Driven Multi-Product Influence Maximization in Billboard Advertising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14737v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Billboard Advertising has emerged as an effective out-of-home advertising technique, where the goal is to select a limited number of slots and play advertisement content there, with the hope that it will be observed by many people and, effectively, a significant number of them will be influenced towards the brand. Given a trajectory and a billboard database and a positive integer $k$, how can we select $k$ highly influential slots to maximize influence? In this paper, we study a variant of this problem where a commercial house wants to make a promotion of multiple products, and there is an influence demand for each product. We have studied two variants of the problem. In the first variant, our goal is to select $k$ slots such that the respective influence demand of each product is satisfied. In the other variant of the problem, we are given with $\ell$ integers $k_1,k_2, \ldots, k_{\ell}$, the goal here is to search for $\ell$ many set of slots $S_1, S_2, \ldots, S_{\ell}$ such that for all $i \in [\ell]$, $|S_{i}| \leq k_i$ and for all $i \neq j$, $S_i \cap S_j=\emptyset$ and the influence demand of each of the products gets satisfied. We model the first variant of the problem as a multi-submodular cover problem and the second variant as its generalization. To solve the common-slot variant, we formulate the problem as a multi-submodular cover problem and design a bi-criteria approximation algorithm based on the continuous greedy framework and randomized rounding. For the disjoint-slot variant, we proposed a sampling-based approximation approach along with an efficient primal-dual greedy algorithm that enforces disjointness naturally. Extensive experiments with real-world trajectory and billboard datasets highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed solution approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 Pa...</summary><p>31 Pages. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2510.09050</p></details> |
| **[LaVR: Scene Latent Conditioned Generative Video Trajectory Re-Rendering using Large 4D Reconstruction Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14674v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given a monocular video, the goal of video re-rendering is to generate views of the scene from a novel camera trajectory. Existing methods face two distinct challenges. Geometrically unconditioned models lack spatial awareness, leading to drift and deformation under viewpoint changes. On the other hand, geometrically-conditioned models depend on estimated depth and explicit reconstruction, making them susceptible to depth inaccuracies and calibration errors. We propose to address these challenges by using the implicit geometric knowledge embedded in the latent space of a large 4D reconstruction model to condition the video generation process. These latents capture scene structure in a continuous space without explicit reconstruction. Therefore, they provide a flexible representation that allows the pretrained diffusion prior to regularize errors more effectively. By jointly conditioning on these latents and source camera poses, we demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art results on the video re-rendering task.

| **[Which Reasoning Trajectories Teach Students to Reason Better? A Simple Metric of Informative Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14249v1)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long chain-of-thought (CoT) trajectories provide rich supervision signals for distilling reasoning from teacher to student LLMs. However, both prior work and our experiments show that trajectories from stronger teachers do not necessarily yield better students, highlighting the importance of data-student suitability in distillation. Existing methods assess suitability primarily through student likelihood, favoring trajectories that closely align with the model's current behavior but overlooking more informative ones. Addressing this, we propose Rank-Surprisal Ratio (RSR), a simple metric that captures both alignment and informativeness to assess the suitability of a reasoning trajectory. RSR is motivated by the observation that effective trajectories typically combine low absolute probability with relatively high-ranked tokens under the student model, balancing learning signal strength and behavioral alignment. Concretely, RSR is defined as the ratio of a trajectory's average token-wise rank to its average negative log-likelihood, and is straightforward to compute and interpret. Across five student models and reasoning trajectories from 11 diverse teachers, RSR strongly correlates with post-training performance (average Spearman 0.86), outperforming existing metrics. We further demonstrate its practical utility in both trajectory selection and teacher selection.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages.

| **[Can the Waymo Open Motion Dataset Support Realistic Behavioral Modeling? A Validation Study with Naturalistic Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03515v2)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) has become a popular resource for data-driven modeling of autonomous vehicles (AVs) behavior. However, its validity for behavioral analysis remains uncertain due to proprietary post-processing, the absence of error quantification, and the segmentation of trajectories into 20-second clips. This study examines whether WOMD accurately captures the dynamics and interactions observed in real-world AV operations. Leveraging an independently collected naturalistic dataset from Level 4 AV operations in Phoenix, Arizona (PHX), we perform comparative analyses across three representative urban driving scenarios: discharging at signalized intersections, car-following, and lane-changing behaviors. For the discharging analysis, headways are manually extracted from aerial video to ensure negligible measurement error. For the car-following and lane-changing cases, we apply the Simulation-Extrapolation (SIMEX) method to account for empirically estimated error in the PHX data and use Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distances to quantify behavioral differences. Results across all scenarios consistently show that behavior in PHX falls outside the behavioral envelope of WOMD. Notably, WOMD underrepresents short headways and abrupt decelerations. These findings suggest that behavioral models calibrated solely on WOMD may systematically underestimate the variability, risk, and complexity of naturalistic driving. Caution is therefore warranted when using WOMD for behavior modeling without proper validation against independently collected data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fast Surrogate Models for Adaptive Aircraft Trajectory Prediction in En route Airspace](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03075v2)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction (TP) is crucial for ensuring safety and efficiency in modern air traffic management systems. It is, for example, a core component of conflict detection and resolution tools, arrival sequencing algorithms, capacity planning, as well as several future concepts. However, TP accuracy within operational systems is hampered by a range of epistemic uncertainties such as the mass and performance settings of aircraft and the effect of meteorological conditions on aircraft performance. It can also require considerable computational resources. This paper proposes a method for adaptive TP that has two components: first, a fast surrogate TP model based on linear state space models (LSSM)s with an execution time that was 6.7 times lower on average than an implementation of the Base of Aircraft Data (BADA) in Python. It is demonstrated that such models can effectively emulate the BADA aircraft performance model, which is based on the numerical solution of a partial differential equation (PDE), and that the LSSMs can be fitted to trajectories in a dataset of historic flight data. Secondly, the paper proposes an algorithm to assimilate radar observations using particle filtering to adaptively refine TP accuracy. Comparison with baselines using BADA and Kalman filtering demonstrate that the proposed framework improves system identification and state estimation for both climb and descent phases, with 46.3% and 64.7% better estimates for time to top of climb and bottom of descent compared to the best performing benchmark model. In particular, the particle filtering approach provides the flexibility to capture non-linear performance effects including the CAS-Mach transition.</p></details> |  |

The method integrates probabilistic reasoning and self-learning to enable distributed mission allocation, route ordering, and motion planning. Expert trajectories generated using a Genetic Algorithm with Repulsion Forces (GA-RF) are employed to train a hierarchical World Model capturing swarm behavior across mission, route, and motion levels. During online operation, UAVs infer actions by minimizing divergence between current beliefs and model-predicted states, enabling adaptive responses to dynamic environments. Simulation results show faster convergence, higher stability, and safer navigation than Q-Learning, demonstrating the scalability and cognitive grounding of the proposed framework for intelligent UAV swarm control.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for presentation at the 2026 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (IEEE ICASSP 2026) Workshop: 'Multi-Modal Signal Processing and AI for Communications and Sensing in 6G and Beyond (MuSiC-6GB)'</p></details> |
| **[Post-Training as Reweighting: A Stochastic View of Reasoning Trajectories in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07368v2)** | 2026-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models encode rich structural knowledge but often rely on post-training procedures to adapt their reasoning behavior to specific tasks. Popular approaches such as reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) and inference-time reward aggregation are typically analyzed from a performance perspective, leaving their effects on the underlying reasoning distribution less understood. In this work, we study post-training reasoning from a stochastic trajectory viewpoint. Following Kim et al. (2025), we model reasoning steps of varying difficulty as Markov transitions with different probabilities, and formalize reasoning processes using tree-structured Markov chains. Within this framework, pretraining corresponds to discovering the reasoning structure, while post-training primarily reweights existing chains of thought. We show that both RLVR and inference-time reward aggregation concentrate probability mass on a small number of high-probability trajectories, leading to the suppression of rare but essential reasoning paths. As a consequence, solving hard instances often depends on low-probability trajectories already present in the base model. We further prove that exploration-oriented mechanisms, such as rejecting easy instances and applying KL regularization, help preserve these rare trajectories. Empirical simulations support our theoretical analysis.</p></details> |  |

Developing accurate prediction algorithms relies on reliable, multimodal, and realistic datasets; however, such datasets for roundabout scenarios are scarce, as real-world data collection is often limited by incomplete observations and entangled factors that are difficult to isolate. We present CARLA-Round, a systematically designed simulation dataset for roundabout trajectory prediction. The dataset varies weather conditions (five types) and traffic density levels (spanning Level-of-Service A-E) in a structured manner, resulting in 25 controlled scenarios. Each scenario incorporates realistic mixtures of driving behaviors and provides explicit annotations that are largely absent from existing datasets. Unlike randomly sampled simulation data, this structured design enables precise analysis of how different conditions influence trajectory prediction performance. Validation experiments using standard baselines (LSTM, GCN, GRU+GCN) reveal traffic density dominates prediction difficulty with strong monotonic effects, while weather shows non-linear impacts. The best model achieves 0.312m ADE on real-world rounD dataset, demonstrating effective sim-to-real transfer. This systematic approach quantifies factor impacts impossible to isolate in confounded real-world datasets. Our CARLA-Round dataset is available at https://github.com/Rebecca689/CARLA-Round.</p></details> |  |

This approach enables exploration of the utility function's distribution tail and treats the utility function of the design as a black box, making it applicable to linear and nonlinear inverse problems and beyond experimental design.

Yet existing self-evolving frameworks mainly reward final outcomes, leaving intermediate reasoning weakly constrained despite its importance for visually grounded decision making. We propose iReasoner, a self-evolving framework that improves an LMM's implicit reasoning by explicitly eliciting chain-of-thought (CoT) and rewarding its internal agreement. In a Proposer--Solver loop over unlabeled images, iReasoner augments outcome-level intrinsic rewards with a trajectory-aware signal defined over intermediate reasoning steps, providing learning signals that distinguish reasoning paths leading to the same answer without ground-truth labels or external judges. Starting from Qwen2.5-VL-7B, iReasoner yields up to $+2.1$ points across diverse multimodal reasoning benchmarks under fully unsupervised post-training. We hope this work serves as a starting point for reasoning-aware self-improvement in LMMs in purely unsupervised settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attesting Model Lineage by Consisted Knowledge Evolution with Fine-Tuning Trajectory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11683v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The fine-tuning technique in deep learning gives rise to an emerging lineage relationship among models. This lineage provides a promising perspective for addressing security concerns such as unauthorized model redistribution and false claim of model provenance, which are particularly pressing in \textcolor{blue}{open-weight model} libraries where robust lineage verification mechanisms are often lacking. Existing approaches to model lineage detection primarily rely on static architectural similarities, which are insufficient to capture the dynamic evolution of knowledge that underlies true lineage relationships. Drawing inspiration from the genetic mechanism of human evolution, we tackle the problem of model lineage attestation by verifying the joint trajectory of knowledge evolution and parameter modification. To this end, we propose a novel model lineage attestation framework. In our framework, model editing is first leveraged to quantify parameter-level changes introduced by fine-tuning. Subsequently, we introduce a novel knowledge vectorization mechanism that refines the evolved knowledge within the edited models into compact representations by the assistance of probe samples. The probing strategies are adapted to different types of model families. These embeddings serve as the foundation for verifying the arithmetic consistency of knowledge relationships across models, thereby enabling robust attestation of model lineage. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness and resilience of our approach in a variety of adversarial scenarios in the real world. Our method consistently achieves reliable lineage verification across a broad spectrum of model types, including classifiers, diffusion models, and large language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 35th USENIX Security Symposium (USENIX Security 2026)</p></details> |
| **[DeepUrban: Interaction-Aware Trajectory Prediction and Planning for Automated Driving by Aerial Imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10554v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The efficacy of autonomous driving systems hinges critically on robust prediction and planning capabilities. However, current benchmarks are impeded by a notable scarcity of scenarios featuring dense traffic, which is essential for understanding and modeling complex interactions among road users. To address this gap, we collaborated with our industrial partner, DeepScenario, to develop DeepUrban-a new drone dataset designed to enhance trajectory prediction and planning benchmarks focusing on dense urban settings. DeepUrban provides a rich collection of 3D traffic objects, extracted from high-resolution images captured over urban intersections at approximately 100 meters altitude. The dataset is further enriched with comprehensive map and scene information to support advanced modeling and simulation tasks. We evaluate state-of-the-art (SOTA) prediction and planning methods, and conducted experiments on generalization capabilities. Our findings demonstrate that adding DeepUrban to nuScenes can boost the accuracy of vehicle predictions and planning, achieving improvements up to 44.1 % / 44.3% on the ADE / FDE metrics.

We used GAMs to evaluate trends over time and the role of sociodemographic variables, i.e., age, sex, ethnicity, country of residence (in UK), job status (employment), household income, living with a partner, living with children under age 16, and living with a long-term illness, on the variation of mental health during the study period. Results: Statistically significant differences in mental health were observed for age, sex,ethnicity, country of residence (in UK), job status (employment), household income, living with a partner, living with children under age 16, and living with a long-term illness. Women experienced higher GHQ36 scores relative to men with the GHQ36 score expected to increase by 1.260 (95%CI: 1.176, 1.345). Individuals living without a partner were expected to have higher GHQ36 scores, of 1.050 (95%CI: 0.949, 1.148) more than those living with a partner, and age groups 16-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64 experienced higher GHQ36 scores relative to those who were 65+. Individuals with relatively lower household income were likely to have poorer mental health relative to those who were more well off. Conclusion: This study identifies key demographic determinants shaping mental health trajectories during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK. Policies aiming to reduce mental health inequalities should target women, youth, individuals living without a partner, individuals living with children under 16, individuals with a long-term illness, and lower income families.</p></details> | 5 figures |

Current visual navigation methods are typically limited to simulated or off-street environments, and often rely on precise goal formats, such as specific coordinates or images. This limits their effectiveness for autonomous agents like last-mile delivery robots navigating unfamiliar cities. To address these limitations, we introduce UrbanNav, a scalable framework that trains embodied agents to follow free-form language instructions in diverse urban settings. Leveraging web-scale city walking videos, we develop an scalable annotation pipeline that aligns human navigation trajectories with language instructions grounded in real-world landmarks. UrbanNav encompasses over 1,500 hours of navigation data and 3 million instruction-trajectory-landmark triplets, capturing a wide range of urban scenarios. Our model learns robust navigation policies to tackle complex urban scenarios, demonstrating superior spatial reasoning, robustness to noisy instructions, and generalization to unseen urban settings. Experimental results show that UrbanNav significantly outperforms existing methods, highlighting the potential of large-scale web video data to enable language-guided, real-world urban navigation for embodied agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, accepted to AAAI 2026.

However, acquiring diverse and realistic multi-turn tool-use data remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose a novel text-based paradigm. We observe that textual corpora naturally contain rich, multi-step problem-solving experiences, which can serve as an untapped, scalable, and authentic data source for multi-turn tool-use tasks. Based on this insight, we introduce GEM, a data synthesis pipeline that enables the generation and extraction of multi-turn tool-use trajectories from text corpora through a four-stage process: relevance filtering, workflow & tool extraction, trajectory grounding, and complexity refinement. To reduce the computational cost, we further train a specialized Trajectory Synthesizer via supervised fine-tuning. This model distills the complex generation pipeline into an efficient, end-to-end trajectory generator. Experiments demonstrate that our GEM-32B achieve a 16.5% improvement on the BFCL V3 Multi-turn benchmark. Our models partially surpass the performance of models trained on τ - bench (Airline and Retail) in-domain data, highlighting the superior generalization capability derived from our text-based synthesis paradigm. Notably, our Trajectory Synthesizer matches the quality of the full pipeline while significantly reducing inference latency and costs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Training-Trajectory-Aware Token Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10348v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient distillation is a key pathway for converting expensive reasoning capability into deployable efficiency, yet in the frontier regime where the student already has strong reasoning ability, naive continual distillation often yields limited gains or even degradation. We observe a characteristic training phenomenon: even as loss decreases monotonically, all performance metrics can drop sharply at almost the same bottleneck, before gradually recovering. We further uncover a token-level mechanism: confidence bifurcates into steadily increasing Imitation-Anchor Tokens that quickly anchor optimization and other yet-to-learn tokens whose confidence is suppressed until after the bottleneck. And the characteristic that these two types of tokens cannot coexist is the root cause of the failure in continual distillation. To this end, we propose Training-Trajectory-Aware Token Selection (T3S) to reconstruct the training objective at the token level, clearing the optimization path for yet-to-learn tokens. T3 yields consistent gains in both AR and dLLM settings: with only hundreds of examples, Qwen3-8B surpasses DeepSeek-R1 on competitive reasoning benchmarks, Qwen3-32B approaches Qwen3-235B, and T3-trained LLaDA-2.0-Mini exceeds its AR baseline, achieving state-of-the-art performance among all of 16B-scale no-think models.</p></details> |  |

With consideration of this, a number of recent neural network models leverage inductive biases from classical mechanics to encourage model interpretability and ensure forecasted states are physical. However, in general, these models are designed to capture the dynamics of a single system with fixed physical parameters, from state-space measurements of a known configuration space. In this paper we introduce Symplectic Phase Space GAN (SPS-GAN) which can capture the dynamics of multiple systems, and generalize to unseen physical parameters from. Moreover, SPS-GAN does not require prior knowledge of the system configuration space. In fact, SPS-GAN can discover the configuration space structure of the system from arbitrary measurement types (e.g., state-space measurements, video frames). To achieve physically plausible generation, we introduce a novel architecture which embeds a Hamiltonian neural network recurrent module in a conditional GAN backbone. To discover the structure of the configuration space, we optimize the conditional time-series GAN objective with an additional physically motivated term to encourages a sparse representation of the configuration space. We demonstrate the utility of SPS-GAN for trajectory prediction, video generation and symmetry discovery. Our approach captures multiple systems and achieves performance on par with supervised models designed for single systems.</p></details> |  |

Existing trajectory planners exhibit systematic failures in these scenarios due to data imbalance. This results in insufficient modelling of vehicle dynamics, road geometry, and environmental constraints in high-risk situations, leading to suboptimal or unsafe trajectory prediction when vehicles operate near their physical limits. In this paper, we introduce ReflexDiffusion, a novel inference-stage framework that enhances diffusion-based trajectory planners through reflective adjustment. Our method introduces a gradient-based adjustment mechanism during the iterative denoising process: after each standard trajectory update, we compute the gradient between the conditional and unconditional noise predictions to explicitly amplify critical conditioning signals, including road curvature and lateral vehicle dynamics. This amplification enforces strict adherence to physical constraints, particularly improving stability during high-lateral-acceleration maneuvers where precise vehicle-road interaction is paramount. Evaluated on the nuPlan Test14-hard benchmark, ReflexDiffusion achieves a 14.1% improvement in driving score for high-lateral-acceleration scenarios over the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. This demonstrates that inference-time trajectory optimization can effectively compensate for training data sparsity by dynamically reinforcing safety-critical constraints near handling limits. The framework's architecture-agnostic design enables direct deployment to existing diffusion-based planners, offering a practical solution for improving autonomous vehicle safety in challenging driving conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |

Existing Large Language Models (LLMs) unlearning approaches that typically focus on modifying only final answers are insufficient for LRMs, as they fail to remove sensitive content from intermediate steps, leading to persistent privacy leakage and degraded security. To address these challenges, we propose Sensitive Trajectory Regulation (STaR), a parameter-free, inference-time unlearning framework that achieves robust privacy protection throughout the reasoning process. Specifically, we first identify sensitive content via semantic-aware detection. Then, we inject global safety constraints through secure prompt prefix. Next, we perform trajectory-aware suppression to dynamically block sensitive content across the entire reasoning chain. Finally, we apply token-level adaptive filtering to prevent both exact and paraphrased sensitive tokens during generation. Furthermore, to overcome the inadequacies of existing evaluation protocols, we introduce two metrics: Multi-Decoding Consistency Assessment (MCS), which measures the consistency of unlearning across diverse decoding strategies, and Multi-Granularity Membership Inference Attack (MIA) Evaluation, which quantifies privacy protection at both answer and reasoning-chain levels. Experiments on the R-TOFU benchmark demonstrate that STaR achieves comprehensive and stable unlearning with minimal utility loss, setting a new standard for privacy-preserving reasoning in LRMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Online Trajectory Optimization for Arbitrary-Shaped Mobile Robots via Polynomial Separating Hypersurfaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09231v1)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An emerging class of trajectory optimization methods enforces collision avoidance by jointly optimizing the robot's configuration and a separating hyperplane. However, as linear separators only apply to convex sets, these methods require convex approximations of both the robot and obstacles, which becomes an overly conservative assumption in cluttered and narrow environments. In this work, we unequivocally remove this limitation by introducing nonlinear separating hypersurfaces parameterized by polynomial functions. We first generalize the classical separating hyperplane theorem and prove that any two disjoint bounded closed sets in Euclidean space can be separated by a polynomial hypersurface, serving as the theoretical foundation for nonlinear separation of arbitrary geometries. Building on this result, we formulate a nonlinear programming (NLP) problem that jointly optimizes the robot's trajectory and the coefficients of the separating polynomials, enabling geometry-aware collision avoidance without conservative convex simplifications. The optimization remains efficiently solvable using standard NLP solvers. Simulation and real-world experiments with nonconvex robots demonstrate that our method achieves smooth, collision-free, and agile maneuvers in environments where convex-approximation baselines fail.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiffMM: Efficient Method for Accurate Noisy and Sparse Trajectory Map Matching via One Step Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08482v1)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Map matching for sparse trajectories is a fundamental problem for many trajectory-based applications, e.g., traffic scheduling and traffic flow analysis. Existing methods for map matching are generally based on Hidden Markov Model (HMM) or encoder-decoder framework. However, these methods continue to face significant challenges when handling noisy or sparsely sampled GPS trajectories. To address these limitations, we propose DiffMM, an encoder-diffusion-based map matching framework that produces effective yet efficient matching results through a one-step diffusion process. We first introduce a road segment-aware trajectory encoder that jointly embeds the input trajectory and its surrounding candidate road segments into a shared latent space through an attention mechanism. Next, we propose a one step diffusion method to realize map matching through a shortcut model by leveraging the joint embedding of the trajectory and candidate road segments as conditioning context. We conduct extensive experiments on large-scale trajectory datasets, demonstrating that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art map matching methods in terms of both accuracy and efficiency, particularly for sparse trajectories and complex road network topologies.</p></details> | AAAI-26 |

Repeated sampling over the same input often produces divergent reasoning trajectories and inconsistent final predictions. To address this, we introduce two complementary approaches inspired by test-time scaling: (1) CASHEW, an inference-time framework that stabilizes reasoning by iteratively aggregating multiple candidate trajectories into higher-quality reasoning traces, with explicit visual verification filtering hallucinated steps and grounding reasoning in visual evidence, and (2) CASHEW-RL, a learned variant that internalizes this aggregation behavior within a single model. CASHEW-RL is trained using Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO) with a composite reward that encourages correct answers grounded in minimal yet sufficient visual evidence, while adaptively allocating reasoning effort based on task difficulty. This training objective enables robust self-aggregation at inference. Extensive experiments on 13 image understanding, video understanding, and video reasoning benchmarks show significant performance improvements, including gains of up to +23.6 percentage points on ScienceQA and +8.1 percentage points on EgoSchema.</p></details> |  |
| **[d3LLM: Ultra-Fast Diffusion LLM using Pseudo-Trajectory Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07568v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) offer capabilities beyond those of autoregressive (AR) LLMs, such as parallel decoding and random-order generation. However, realizing these benefits in practice is non-trivial, as dLLMs inherently face an accuracy-parallelism trade-off. Despite increasing interest, existing methods typically focus on only one-side of the coin, targeting either efficiency or performance. To address this limitation, we propose d3LLM (Pseudo-Distilled Diffusion Large Language Model), striking a balance between accuracy and parallelism: (i) during training, we introduce pseudo-trajectory distillation to teach the model which tokens can be decoded confidently at early steps, thereby improving parallelism; (ii) during inference, we employ entropy-based multi-block decoding with a KV-cache refresh mechanism to achieve high parallelism while maintaining accuracy. To better evaluate dLLMs, we also introduce AUP (Accuracy Under Parallelism), a new metric that jointly measures accuracy and parallelism. Experiments demonstrate that our d3LLM achieves up to 10$\times$ speedup over vanilla LLaDA/Dream and 5$\times$ speedup over AR models without much accuracy drop.

| **[BiTrajDiff: Bidirectional Trajectory Generation with Diffusion Models for Offline Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05762v4)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) have proven that effective policy learning can benefit from imposing conservative constraints on pre-collected datasets. However, such static datasets often exhibit distribution bias, resulting in limited generalizability. To address this limitation, a straightforward solution is data augmentation (DA), which leverages generative models to enrich data distribution. Despite the promising results, current DA techniques focus solely on reconstructing future trajectories from given states, while ignoring the exploration of history transitions that reach them. This single-direction paradigm inevitably hinders the discovery of diverse behavior patterns, especially those leading to critical states that may have yielded high-reward outcomes. In this work, we introduce Bidirectional Trajectory Diffusion (BiTrajDiff), a novel DA framework for offline RL that models both future and history trajectories from any intermediate states. Specifically, we decompose the trajectory generation task into two independent yet complementary diffusion processes: one generating forward trajectories to predict future dynamics, and the other generating backward trajectories to trace essential history transitions.BiTrajDiff can efficiently leverage critical states as anchors to expand into potentially valuable yet underexplored regions of the state space, thereby facilitating dataset diversity. Extensive experiments on the D4RL benchmark suite demonstrate that BiTrajDiff achieves superior performance compared to other advanced DA methods across various offline RL backbones.</p></details> |  |
| **[PsyCLIENT: Client Simulation via Conversational Trajectory Modeling for Trainee Practice and Model Evaluation in Mental Health Counseling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07312v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-based client simulation has emerged as a promising tool for training novice counselors and evaluating automated counseling systems. However, existing client simulation approaches face three key challenges: (1) limited diversity and realism in client profiles, (2) the lack of a principled framework for modeling realistic client behaviors, and (3) a scarcity in Chinese-language settings. To address these limitations, we propose PsyCLIENT, a novel simulation framework grounded in conversational trajectory modeling. By conditioning LLM generation on predefined real-world trajectories that incorporate explicit behavior labels and content constraints, our approach ensures diverse and realistic interactions. We further introduce PsyCLIENT-CP, the first open-source Chinese client profile dataset, covering 60 distinct counseling topics. Comprehensive evaluations involving licensed professional counselors demonstrate that PsyCLIENT significantly outperforms baselines in terms of authenticity and training effectiveness. Notably, the simulated clients are nearly indistinguishable from human clients, achieving an about 95\% expert confusion rate in discrimination tasks. These findings indicate that conversational trajectory modeling effectively bridges the gap between theoretical client profiles and dynamic, realistic simulations, offering a robust solution for mental health education and research. Code and data will be released to facilitate future research in mental health counseling.</p></details> |  |

Existing imputation methods emphasize trajectory recovery, paying limited attention to interpretability and failing to provide underlying knowledge that benefits downstream tasks such as anomaly detection and route planning. We propose knowledge-driven interpretable vessel trajectory imputation (VISTA), the first trajectory imputation framework that offers interpretability while simultaneously providing underlying knowledge to support downstream analysis. Specifically, we first define underlying knowledge as a combination of Structured Data-derived Knowledge (SDK) distilled from AIS data and Implicit LLM Knowledge acquired from large-scale Internet corpora. Second, to manage and leverage the SDK effectively at scale, we develop a data-knowledge-data loop that employs a Structured Data-derived Knowledge Graph for SDK extraction and knowledge-driven trajectory imputation. Third, to efficiently process large-scale AIS data, we introduce a workflow management layer that coordinates the end-to-end pipeline, enabling parallel knowledge extraction and trajectory imputation with anomaly handling and redundancy elimination. Experiments on two large AIS datasets show that VISTA is capable of state-of-the-art imputation accuracy and computational efficiency, improving over state-of-the-art baselines by 5%-94% and reducing time cost by 51%-93%, while producing interpretable knowledge cues that benefit downstream tasks. The source code and implementation details of VISTA are publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 13 figures, 3 algorithms, 5 tables.

| **[Mobility Trajectories from Network-Driven Markov Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06020v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a generative model of human mobility in which trajectories arise as realizations of a prescribed, time-dependent Markov dynamics defined on a spatial interaction network. The model constructs a hierarchical routing structure with hubs, corridors, feeder paths, and metro links, and specifies transition matrices using gravity-type distance decay combined with externally imposed temporal schedules and directional biases. Population mass evolves as indistinguishable, memoryless movers performing a single transition per time step. When aggregated, the resulting trajectories reproduce structured origin-destination flows that reflect network geometry, temporal modulation, and connectivity constraints. By applying the Perron-Frobenius theorem to the daily evolution operator, we identify a unique periodic invariant population distribution that serves as a natural non-transient reference state. We verify consistency between trajectory-level realizations and multi-step Markov dynamics, showing that discrepancies are entirely attributable to finite-population sampling. The framework provides a network-centric, privacy-preserving approach to generating mobility trajectories and studying time-elapsed flow structure without invoking individual-level behavioral assumptions.</p></details> | 22 pages, 6 figures |

This pattern is also often observed within-seasons, as an athlete aims for their performance to peak at key events such as the Olympic Games or World Championships. A Bayesian hierarchical model is developed to analyse the evolution of athletic sporting performance throughout an athlete's career and separate these effects whilst allowing for confounding factors such as environmental conditions. Our model works in continuous time and estimates both $g(t)$, the average performance level of the population at age $t$, and $f_i(t)$, the difference of the $i$-th athlete from this average. We further decompose $f_i(t)$ into a season-to-season trajectory and a within-season trajectory, which is modelled by a restricted Bernstein polynomial. The model is fitted using an adaptive Metropolis-within-Gibbs algorithm with a carefully chosen blocking scheme. The model allows us to understand seasonal patterns in athlete performance, how these differ between athletes, and provides individual fitted and trend performance trajectories. The properties of the model are illustrated using a simulation study and an application to 100 metres and 200 metres freestyle swimming for both female and male athletes.</p></details> |  |

However, we find that directly applying these techniques to image-to-video (I2V) models often fails to yield consistent reward improvements. To address this limitation, we present TAGRPO, a robust post-training framework for I2V models inspired by contrastive learning. Our approach is grounded in the observation that rollout videos generated from identical initial noise provide superior guidance for optimization. Leveraging this insight, we propose a novel GRPO loss applied to intermediate latents, encouraging direct alignment with high-reward trajectories while maximizing distance from low-reward counterparts. Furthermore, we introduce a memory bank for rollout videos to enhance diversity and reduce computational overhead. Despite its simplicity, TAGRPO achieves significant improvements over DanceGRPO in I2V generation.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures |

Here we analyzed 97,564 longitudinal PASC assessments from 13,511 participants with linked vaccination histories to disentangle passive temporal progression from vaccine-associated change. Using a clinically validated threshold (PASC $\geq 12$), trajectories separated into three phenotypes: Protected (persistently sub-threshold), Refractory (persistently symptomatic), and Responders (transitioning from symptomatic to recovered). Across the full cohort, symptom severity increased modestly with elapsed time ($r=0.0521$, $P=1.26\times10^{-59}$), whereas cumulative vaccination showed an inverse association with severity ($r=-0.0434$, $P=5.95\times10^{-42}$). In summary, baseline Long COVID severity appears clinically deterministic. In the absence of intervention, symptoms typically persist without spontaneous resolution. Recovery is primarily associated with repeated immunization.</p></details> |  |

Despite performance improvements from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs), current models lack a mechanism to trace how small targets trigger directional, layer-wise perturbations in the feature space, which is an essential cue for distinguishing signal from structured noise in infrared scenes. To address this limitation, we propose the Trajectory-Aware Mamba Propagation Network (TAPM-Net), which explicitly models the spatial diffusion behavior of target-induced feature disturbances. TAPM-Net is built upon two novel components: a Perturbation-guided Path Module (PGM) and a Trajectory-Aware State Block (TASB). The PGM constructs perturbation energy fields from multi-level features and extracts gradient-following feature trajectories that reflect the directionality of local responses. The resulting feature trajectories are fed into the TASB, a Mamba-based state-space unit that models dynamic propagation along each trajectory while incorporating velocity-constrained diffusion and semantically aligned feature fusion from word-level and sentence-level embeddings. Unlike existing attention-based methods, TAPM-Net enables anisotropic, context-sensitive state transitions along spatial trajectories while maintaining global coherence at low computational cost. Experiments on NUAA-SIRST and IRSTD-1K demonstrate that TAPM-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance in ISTD.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in BMVC 2025 see: https://bmva-archive.org.uk/bmvc/2025/assets/papers/Paper_709/paper.pdf.

We aim to endow computational systems with a similar ability to predict plausible future object motions directly from passive visual observation. We introduce ObjectForesight, a 3D object-centric dynamics model that predicts future 6-DoF poses and trajectories of rigid objects from short egocentric video sequences. Unlike conventional world or dynamics models that operate in pixel or latent space, ObjectForesight represents the world explicitly in 3D at the object level, enabling geometrically grounded and temporally coherent predictions that capture object affordances and trajectories. To train such a model at scale, we leverage recent advances in segmentation, mesh reconstruction, and 3D pose estimation to curate a dataset of 2 million plus short clips with pseudo-ground-truth 3D object trajectories.

Remote assistance concepts, where operators provide discrete inputs to aid specific automation modules like planning, is gaining interest due to its reduced workload on the human remote operator and improved safety. However, these concepts are challenging to implement and maintain due to their deep integration and interaction with the automated driving system. In this paper, we propose a solution to facilitate the implementation of remote assistance concepts that intervene on planning level and extend the operational design domain of the vehicle at runtime. Using arbitration graphs, a modular decision-making framework, we integrate remote assistance into an existing automated driving system without modifying the original software components. Our simulative implementation demonstrates this approach in two use cases, allowing operators to adjust planner constraints and enable trajectory generation beyond nominal operational design domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 8 figures, presented at IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium 2025, video demonstration available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVSO-YOeGMk</p></details> |

This study extends the scope to online refinement of the entire capacity fade trajectory (CFT) through EntroLnn, a framework based on entropy-guided transformable liquid neural networks (LNNs). EntroLnn treats CFT refinement as an integrated process rather than two independent tasks for pointwise SoH and EoL. We introduce entropy-based features derived from online temperature fields, applied for the first time in battery analytics, and combine them with customized LNNs that model temporal battery dynamics effectively. The framework enhances both static and dynamic adaptability of LNNs and achieves robust and generalizable CFT refinement across different batteries and operating conditions. The approach provides a high fidelity battery health model with lightweight computation, achieving mean absolute errors of only 0.004577 for CFT and 18 cycles for EoL prediction. This work establishes a foundation for entropy-informed learning in battery analytics and enables self-adaptive, lightweight, and interpretable battery health prediction in practical battery management systems.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

In this study, we provide a multilinguistic, large-scale assessment of this similarity by systematically comparing 16 publicly available pretrained LLMs with human brain responses during natural language processing tasks in both English and Chinese. Specifically, we use ridge regression to assess the representational similarity between LLM embeddings and electroencephalography (EEG) signals, and analyze the similarity between the "neural trajectory" and the "LLM latent trajectory." This method captures key dynamic patterns, such as magnitude, angle, uncertainty, and confidence. Our findings highlight both similarities and crucial differences in processing strategies: (1) We show that middle-to-high layers of LLMs are central to semantic integration and correspond to the N400 component observed in EEG; (2) The brain exhibits continuous and iterative processing during reading, whereas LLMs often show discrete, stage-end bursts of activity, which suggests a stark contrast in their real-time semantic processing dynamics. This study could offer new insights into LLMs and neural processing, and also establish a critical framework for future investigations into the alignment between artificial intelligence and biological intelligence.</p></details> |  |

However, existing pruning methods typically rely on sequential revisions driven by unreliable critique signals, often failing to detect the loss of answer-critical data. To address this limitation, we propose TabTrim, a novel table pruning framework which transforms table pruning from sequential revisions to gold trajectory-supervised parallel search. TabTrim derives a gold pruning trajectory using the intermediate sub-tables in the execution process of gold SQL queries, and trains a pruner and a verifier to make the step-wise pruning result align with the gold pruning trajectory. During inference, TabTrim performs parallel search to explore multiple candidate pruning trajectories and identify the optimal sub-table. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TabTrim achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse tabular reasoning tasks: TabTrim-8B reaches 73.5% average accuracy, outperforming the strongest baseline by 3.2%, including 79.4% on WikiTQ and 61.2% on TableBench.</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures |

Starting with a small number of embodiment-flexible human demonstrations collected in a virtual reality simulation environment, the pipeline refines these demonstrations using optimization-based kinematic retargeting and trajectory optimization to adapt them across various robot embodiments and physical parameters. This process yields a diverse, physically consistent dataset that enables cross-embodiment data transfer, and offers the potential to reuse legacy datasets collected under different hardware configurations or physical parameters. We validate the pipeline's effectiveness by training diffusion policies from the generated datasets for challenging contact-rich manipulation tasks across multiple robot embodiments, including a floating Allegro hand and bimanual robot arms. The trained policies are deployed zero-shot on hardware for bimanual iiwa arms, achieving high success rates with minimal human input.

While text-based affect inference has become increasingly feasible, prior approaches often treat sentiment as a deterministic point estimate for individual speakers, failing to capture the inherent subjectivity, latent ambiguity, and sequential coupling found in mutual exchanges. We introduce LLM-MC-Affect, a probabilistic framework that characterizes emotion not as a static label, but as a continuous latent probability distribution defined over an affective space. By leveraging stochastic LLM decoding and Monte Carlo estimation, the methodology approximates these distributions to derive high-fidelity sentiment trajectories that explicitly quantify both central affective tendencies and perceptual ambiguity. These trajectories enable a structured analysis of interpersonal coupling through sequential cross-correlation and slope-based indicators, identifying leading or lagging influences between interlocutors. To validate the interpretive capacity of this approach, we utilize teacher-student instructional dialogues as a representative case study, where our quantitative indicators successfully distill high-level interaction insights such as effective scaffolding. This work establishes a scalable and deployable pathway for understanding interpersonal dynamics, offering a generalizable solution that extends beyond education to broader social and behavioral research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting Continuous-Time Trajectory Estimation via Gaussian Processes and the Magnus Expansion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03360v1)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continuous-time state estimation has been shown to be an effective means of (i) handling asynchronous and high-rate measurements, (ii) introducing smoothness to the estimate, (iii) post hoc querying the estimate at times other than those of the measurements, and (iv) addressing certain observability issues related to scanning-while-moving sensors. A popular means of representing the trajectory in continuous time is via a Gaussian process (GP) prior, with the prior's mean and covariance functions generated by a linear time-varying (LTV) stochastic differential equation (SDE) driven by white noise. When the state comprises elements of Lie groups, previous works have resorted to a patchwork of local GPs each with a linear time-invariant SDE kernel, which while effective in practice, lacks theoretical elegance. Here we revisit the full LTV GP approach to continuous-time trajectory estimation, deriving a global GP prior on Lie groups via the Magnus expansion, which offers a more elegant and general solution. We provide a numerical comparison between the two approaches and discuss their relative merits.</p></details> | 21 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Dual-quaternion learning control for autonomous vehicle trajectory tracking with safety guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03097v1)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a learning-based trajectory tracking controller for autonomous robotic platforms whose motion can be described kinematically on $\mathrm{SE}(3)$. The controller is formulated in the dual quaternion framework and operates at the velocity level, assuming direct command of angular and linear velocities, as is standard in many aerial vehicles and omnidirectional mobile robots. Gaussian Process (GP) regression is integrated into a geometric feedback law to learn and compensate online for unknown, state-dependent disturbances and modeling imperfections affecting both attitude and position, while preserving the algebraic structure and coupling properties inherent to rigid-body motion. The proposed approach does not rely on explicit parametric models of the unknown effects, making it well-suited for robotic systems subject to sensor-induced disturbances, unmodeled actuation couplings, and environmental uncertainties. A Lyapunov-based analysis establishes probabilistic ultimate boundedness of the pose tracking error under bounded GP uncertainty, providing formal stability guarantees for the learning-based controller. Simulation results demonstrate accurate and smooth trajectory tracking in the presence of realistic, localized disturbances, including correlated rotational and translational effects arising from magnetometer perturbations. These results illustrate the potential of combining geometric modeling and probabilistic learning to achieve robust, data-efficient pose control for autonomous robotic systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Chain-of-Action: Trajectory Autoregressive Modeling for Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09990v2)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Chain-of-Action (CoA), a novel visuo-motor policy paradigm built upon Trajectory Autoregressive Modeling. Unlike conventional approaches that predict next step action(s) forward, CoA generates an entire trajectory by explicit backward reasoning with task-specific goals through an action-level Chain-of-Thought (CoT) process. This process is unified within a single autoregressive structure: (1) the first token corresponds to a stable keyframe action that encodes the task-specific goals; and (2) subsequent action tokens are generated autoregressively, conditioned on the initial keyframe and previously predicted actions. This backward action reasoning enforces a global-to-local structure, allowing each local action to be tightly constrained by the final goal. To further realize the action reasoning structure, CoA incorporates four complementary designs: continuous action token representation; dynamic stopping for variable-length trajectory generation; reverse temporal ensemble; and multi-token prediction to balance action chunk modeling with global structure. As a result, CoA gives strong spatial generalization capabilities while preserving the flexibility and simplicity of a visuo-motor policy. Empirically, we observe CoA achieves the state-of-the-art performance across 60 RLBench tasks and 8 real-world manipulation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Swept Volume-Based Trajectory Generation for Arbitrary-Shaped Ground Robot Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07554v2)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Navigating an arbitrary-shaped ground robot safely in cluttered environments remains a challenging problem. The existing trajectory planners that account for the robot's physical geometry severely suffer from the intractable runtime. To achieve both computational efficiency and Continuous Collision Avoidance (CCA) of arbitrary-shaped ground robot planning, we proposed a novel coarse-to-fine navigation framework that significantly accelerates planning. In the first stage, a sampling-based method selectively generates distinct topological paths that guarantee a minimum inflated margin. In the second stage, a geometry-aware front-end strategy is designed to discretize these topologies into full-state robot motion sequences while concurrently partitioning the paths into SE(2) sub-problems and simpler R2 sub-problems for back-end optimization. In the final stage, an SVSDF-based optimizer generates trajectories tailored to these sub-problems and seamlessly splices them into a continuous final motion plan. Extensive benchmark comparisons show that the proposed method is one to several orders of magnitude faster than the cutting-edge methods in runtime while maintaining a high planning success rate and ensuring CCA.</p></details> |  |
| **[Q-Regularized Generative Auto-Bidding: From Suboptimal Trajectories to Optimal Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02754v1)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of e-commerce, auto-bidding has become a key asset in optimizing advertising performance under diverse advertiser environments. The current approaches focus on reinforcement learning (RL) and generative models. These efforts imitate offline historical behaviors by utilizing a complex structure with expensive hyperparameter tuning. The suboptimal trajectories further exacerbate the difficulty of policy learning. To address these challenges, we proposes QGA, a novel Q-value regularized Generative Auto-bidding method. In QGA, we propose to plug a Q-value regularization with double Q-learning strategy into the Decision Transformer backbone. This design enables joint optimization of policy imitation and action-value maximization, allowing the learned bidding policy to both leverage experience from the dataset and alleviate the adverse impact of the suboptimal trajectories. Furthermore, to safely explore the policy space beyond the data distribution, we propose a Q-value guided dual-exploration mechanism, in which the DT model is conditioned on multiple return-to-go targets and locally perturbed actions. This entire exploration process is dynamically guided by the aforementioned Q-value module, which provides principled evaluation for each candidate action. Experiments on public benchmarks and simulation environments demonstrate that QGA consistently achieves superior or highly competitive results compared to existing alternatives. Notably, in large-scale real-world A/B testing, QGA achieves a 3.27% increase in Ad GMV and a 2.49% improvement in Ad ROI.</p></details> | <details><summary>11pag...</summary><p>11pages, 5figures, In Proceedings of the 32nd ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining</p></details> |
| **[Optimizing Control-Friendly Trajectories with Self-Supervised Residual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02738v1)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world physics can only be analytically modeled with a certain level of precision for modern intricate robotic systems. As a result, tracking aggressive trajectories accurately could be challenging due to the existence of residual physics during controller synthesis. This paper presents a self-supervised residual learning and trajectory optimization framework to address the aforementioned challenges. At first, unknown dynamic effects on the closed-loop model are learned and treated as residuals of the nominal dynamics, jointly forming a hybrid model. We show that learning with analytic gradients can be achieved using only trajectory-level data while enjoying accurate long-horizon prediction with an arbitrary integration step size. Subsequently, a trajectory optimizer is developed to compute the optimal reference trajectory with the residual physics along it minimized. It ends up with trajectories that are friendly to the following control level. The agile flight of quadrotors illustrates that by utilizing the hybrid dynamics, the proposed optimizer outputs aggressive motions that can be precisely tracked.</p></details> | 10 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Automated Model Tuning for Multifidelity Uncertainty Propagation in Trajectory Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16007v2)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multifidelity uncertainty propagation combines the efficiency of low-fidelity models with the accuracy of a high-fidelity model to construct statistical estimators of quantities of interest. It is well known that the effectiveness of such methods depends crucially on the relative correlations and computational costs of the available computational models. However, the question of how to automatically tune low-fidelity models to maximize performance remains an open area of research. This work investigates automated model tuning, which optimizes model hyperparameters to minimize estimator variance within a target computational budget. Focusing on multifidelity trajectory simulation estimators, the cost-versus-precision tradeoff enabled by this approach is demonstrated in a practical, online setting where upfront tuning costs cannot be amortized. Using a real-world entry, descent, and landing example, it is shown that automated model tuning largely outperforms hand-tuned models even when the overall computational budget is relatively low. Furthermore, for scenarios where the computational budget is large, model tuning solutions can approach the best-case multifidelity estimator performance where optimal model hyperparameters are known a priori. Recommendations for applying model tuning in practice are provided and avenues for enabling adoption of such approaches for budget-constrained problems are highlighted.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages with 15 figures in main text</p></details> |

A recurring practical issue is that standard mini-batch training can be unstable when trajectory lengths are highly heterogeneous, which in turn degrades \emph{distribution matching} for trajectory-derived statistics. We propose \textbf{length-aware sampling (LAS)}, a simple batching strategy that groups trajectories by length and samples batches from a single length bucket, reducing within-batch length heterogeneity (and making updates more consistent) without changing the model class. We integrate LAS into a conditional trajectory GAN with auxiliary time-alignment losses and provide (i) a distribution-level guarantee for derived variables under mild boundedness assumptions, and (ii) an IPM/Wasserstein mechanism explaining why LAS improves distribution matching by removing length-only shortcut critics and targeting within-bucket discrepancies. Empirically, LAS consistently improves matching of derived-variable distributions on a multi-mall dataset of shopper trajectories and on diverse public sequence datasets (GPS, education, e-commerce, and movies), outperforming random sampling across dataset-specific metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Classification Network Guided Trajectory Planning for Four-Wheel Independent Steering Autonomous Parking Considering Obstacle Attributes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18836v2)** | 2026-01-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Four-wheel Independent Steering (4WIS) vehicles have attracted increasing attention for their superior maneuverability. Human drivers typically choose to cross or drive over the low-profile obstacles (e.g., plastic bags) to efficiently navigate through narrow spaces, while existing planners neglect obstacle attributes, leading to suboptimal efficiency or planning failures. To address this issue, we propose a novel multimodal trajectory planning framework that employs a neural network for scene perception, combines 4WIS hybrid A* search to generate a warm start, and utilizes an optimal control problem (OCP) for trajectory optimization. Specifically, a multimodal perception network fusing visual information and vehicle states is employed to capture semantic and contextual scene understanding, enabling the planner to adapt the strategy according to scene complexity (hard or easy task). For hard tasks, guided points are introduced to decompose complex tasks into local subtasks, improving the search efficiency. The multiple steering modes of 4WIS vehicles, Ackermann, diagonal, and zero-turn, are also incorporated as kinematically feasible motion primitives. Moreover, a hierarchical obstacle handling strategy, which categorizes obstacles as "non-traversable", "crossable", and "drive-over", is incorporated into the node expansion process, explicitly linking obstacle attributes to planning actions to enable efficient decisions. Furthermore, to address dynamic obstacles with motion uncertainty, we introduce a probabilistic risk field model, constructing risk-aware driving corridors that serve as linear collision constraints in OCP. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed framework's effectiveness in generating safe, efficient, and smooth trajectories for 4WIS vehicles, especially in constrained environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sample-Efficient Online Learning in LM Agents via Hindsight Trajectory Rewriting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10304v2)** | 2026-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language model (LM) agents deployed in novel environments often exhibit poor sample efficiency when learning from sequential interactions. This significantly hinders the usefulness of such agents in environments where interaction is costly (for example, when they interact with humans or reset physical systems). While a number of existing LM agent architectures incorporate various mechanisms for experience storage and reflection, they make limited use of LMs' abilities to directly generate or reason about full counterfactual trajectories. We introduce ECHO (Experience Consolidation via Hindsight Optimization), a prompting framework that adapts hindsight experience replay from reinforcement learning for language model agents. ECHO generates optimized trajectories for alternative goals that could have been achieved during failed attempts, effectively creating synthetic positive examples from unsuccessful interactions. Our approach consists of two components: a hindsight rule that uses the language model itself to identify relevant subgoals and generate optimized trajectories, and an update rule that maintains compressed trajectory representations in memory. We evaluate ECHO on stateful versions of XMiniGrid, a text-based navigation and planning benchmark, and PeopleJoinQA, a collaborative information-gathering enterprise simulation. Across both domains, ECHO outperforms vanilla language agent baselines by up to 80%; in XMiniGrid, it also outperforms a number of sophisticated agent architectures including Reflexion and AWM, demonstrating faster adaptation to novel environments through more effective utilization of past experiences.</p></details> |  |

Existing anomaly detection methods are ill-suited for this challenge: mean-pooling embeddings dilutes anomalous steps, while contrastive-only approaches ignore sequential structure. Standard unsupervised methods on pre-trained embeddings achieve F1-scores no higher than 0.69. We introduce Trajectory Guard, a Siamese Recurrent Autoencoder with a hybrid loss function that jointly learns task-trajectory alignment via contrastive learning and sequential validity via reconstruction. This dual objective enables unified detection of both "wrong plan for this task" and "malformed plan structure." On benchmarks spanning synthetic perturbations and real-world failures from security audits (RAS-Eval) and multi-agent systems (Who\&When), we achieve F1-scores of 0.88-0.94 on balanced sets and recall of 0.86-0.92 on imbalanced external benchmarks. At 32 ms inference latency, our approach runs 17-27$\times$ faster than LLM Judge baselines, enabling real-time safety verification in production deployments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI Trustagent 2026</p></details> |

Many existing distribution-matching approaches struggle in this regime because they impose strict support constraints and rely on brittle one-step models, making it hard to extract useful signal from imperfect data. To tackle this challenge, we propose TGE, a trajectory-level generative embedding for offline LfO that constructs a dense, smooth surrogate reward by estimating expert state density in the latent space of a temporal diffusion model trained on offline trajectory data. By leveraging the smooth geometry of the learned diffusion embedding, TGE captures long-horizon temporal dynamics and effectively bridges the gap between disjoint supports, ensuring a robust learning signal even when offline data is distributionally distinct from the expert. Empirically, the proposed approach consistently matches or outperforms prior offline LfO methods across a range of D4RL locomotion and manipulation benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 6 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

In this study, we propose a model-free clustering framework that groups baskets based on transition probabilities derived from the trajectories of treatment response, rather than relying solely on a single efficacy endpoint such as the objective response rate. The number of clusters is not predetermined but is automatically determined in a data-driven manner based on the similarity structure among baskets. After clustering, baskets within the same cluster are analyzed using a hierarchical Bayesian model. This framework aims to improve the estimation precision of efficacy endpoints and enhance statistical power while maintaining the type~I error rate at the nominal level. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated through simulation studies. The results demonstrated that the proposed method can accurately identify cluster structures in heterogeneous settings and, even under such conditions, maintain the type~I error rate at the nominal level while improving statistical power.</p></details> |  |

Traditional modular pipelines separate perception, prediction, and planning, while recent end-to-end (E2E) systems learn them jointly. Vision-language models (VLMs) further enrich this paradigm by introducing cross-modal priors and commonsense reasoning, yet current VLM-based planners face three key challenges: (i) a mismatch between discrete text reasoning and continuous control, (ii) high latency from autoregressive chain-of-thought decoding, and (iii) inefficient or non-causal planners that limit real-time deployment. We propose ColaVLA, a unified vision-language-action framework that transfers reasoning from text to a unified latent space and couples it with a hierarchical, parallel trajectory decoder. The Cognitive Latent Reasoner compresses scene understanding into compact, decision-oriented meta-action embeddings through ego-adaptive selection and only two VLM forward passes. The Hierarchical Parallel Planner then generates multi-scale, causality-consistent trajectories in a single forward pass. Together, these components preserve the generalization and interpretability of VLMs while enabling efficient, accurate and safe trajectory generation. Experiments on the nuScenes benchmark show that ColaVLA achieves state-of-the-art performance in both open-loop and closed-loop settings with favorable efficiency and robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 4 figures.

In this paper, we enhance high-frequency features of GEO targets while suppressing background noise at the single-frame level through wavelet transform. Building on this, we propose a multi-frame temporal trajectory completion scheme centered on the Hungarian algorithm for globally optimal cross-frame matching. To effectively mitigate missing and false detections, a series of key steps including temporal matching and interpolation completion, temporal-consistency-based noise filtering, and progressive trajectory refinement are designed in the post-processing pipeline. Experimental results on the public SpotGEO dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving an F_1 score of 90.14%.</p></details> |  |

Taking a historically informed outlook on the future, we treated successive OpenAI models as an evolving lineage and compared them with humans in a gambling task with repeated happiness ratings. Computational analyses showed that some aspects became more human-like: newer models took more risks and displayed more human-like patterns of Pavlovian approach and avoidance. At the same time, distinctly non-human signatures emerged: loss aversion dropped below neutral levels, choices became more deterministic than in humans, affective decay increased across versions and exceeded human levels, and baseline mood remained chronically higher than in humans. These "developmental" trajectories reveal an emerging psychology of machines and have direct implications for AI ethics and for thinking about how LLMs might be integrated into clinical decision support and other high-stakes domains.</p></details> |  |

In the one-shot setting, the agent generates a policy after observing a single expert demonstration without additional fine-tuning. Existing approaches typically train and evaluate on the same set of tasks, varying only object configurations, and struggle to generalize to unseen tasks with different semantic or structural requirements. While some recent methods attempt to address this, they exhibit low success rates on hard test tasks that, despite being visually similar to some training tasks, differ in context and require distinct responses. Additionally, most existing methods lack an explicit model of environment dynamics, limiting their ability to reason about future states. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework for one-shot visual imitation learning via world-model-guided trajectory generation. Given an expert demonstration video and the agent's initial observation, our method leverages a learned world model to predict a sequence of latent states and actions. This latent trajectory is then decoded into physical waypoints that guide the agent's execution. Our method is evaluated on two simulated benchmarks and three real-world robotic platforms, where it consistently outperforms prior approaches, with over 30% improvement in some cases.

However, conventional control algorithms for trajectory tracking often exhibit limited performance due to the underactuated, nonlinear, and highly coupled dynamics of quadrotor systems. To address these challenges, we propose HBO-PID, a novel control algorithm that integrates the Heteroscedastic Bayesian Optimization (HBO) framework with the classical PID controller to achieve accurate and robust trajectory tracking. By explicitly modeling input-dependent noise variance, the proposed method can better adapt to dynamic and complex environments, and therefore improve the accuracy and robustness of trajectory tracking. To accelerate the convergence of optimization, we adopt a two-stage optimization strategy that allow us to more efficiently find the optimal controller parameters. Through experiments in both simulation and real-world scenarios, we demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Compared to SOTA methods, it improves the position accuracy by 24.7% to 42.9%, and the angular accuracy by 40.9% to 78.4%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IROS 2025 (2025 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems)</p></details> |

Existing methods mainly rely on historical spatiotemporal trajectory data to train sequence models that directly forecast future locations. However, they often overlook the importance of the future spatiotemporal contexts, which are highly informative for the future locations. For example, knowing how much time and distance a user will travel could serve as a critical clue for predicting the user's next location. Against this background, we propose \textbf{STRelay}, a universal \textbf{\underline{S}}patio\textbf{\underline{T}}emporal \textbf{\underline{Relay}}ing framework explicitly modeling the future spatiotemporal context given a human trajectory, to boost the performance of different location prediction models. Specifically, STRelay models future spatiotemporal contexts in a relaying manner, which is subsequently integrated with the encoded historical representation from a base location prediction model, enabling multi-task learning by simultaneously predicting the next time interval, next moving distance interval, and finally the next location. We evaluate STRelay integrated with five state-of-the-art location prediction base models on four real-world trajectory datasets. Results demonstrate that STRelay consistently improves prediction performance across all cases by 2.49\%-11.30\%. Additionally, we find that the future spatiotemporal contexts are particularly helpful for entertainment-related locations and also for user groups who prefer traveling longer distances. The performance gain on such non-daily-routine activities, which often suffer from higher uncertainty, is indeed complementary to the base location prediction models that often excel at modeling regular daily routine patterns.</p></details> |  |

However, current iterative solving approaches which alternate between diffusion sampling and data consistency steps typically require hundreds or thousands of steps to achieve high quality reconstruction due to accumulated errors. We address this challenge with SURE Guided Posterior Sampling (SGPS), a method that corrects sampling trajectory deviations using Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimate (SURE) gradient updates and PCA based noise estimation. By mitigating noise induced errors during the critical early and middle sampling stages, SGPS enables more accurate posterior sampling and reduces error accumulation. This allows our method to maintain high reconstruction quality with fewer than 100 Neural Function Evaluations (NFEs). Our extensive evaluation across diverse inverse problems demonstrates that SGPS consistently outperforms existing methods at low NFE counts.</p></details> |  |

To mitigate overfitting to restoration behaviors when conditioned on 3DGS renderings, ReCamDriving adopts a two-stage training paradigm: the first stage uses camera poses for coarse control, while the second stage incorporates 3DGS renderings for fine-grained viewpoint and geometric guidance. Furthermore, we present a 3DGS-based cross-trajectory data curation strategy to eliminate the train-test gap in camera transformation patterns, enabling scalable multi-trajectory supervision from monocular videos.

| **[Accelerating Diffusion Planners in Offline RL via Reward-Aware Consistency Trajectory Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07822v2)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although diffusion models have achieved strong results in decision-making tasks, their slow inference speed remains a key limitation. While consistency models offer a potential solution, existing applications to decision-making either struggle with suboptimal demonstrations under behavior cloning or rely on complex concurrent training of multiple networks under the actor-critic framework. In this work, we propose a novel approach to consistency distillation for offline reinforcement learning that directly incorporates reward optimization into the distillation process. Our method achieves single-step sampling while generating higher-reward action trajectories through decoupled training and noise-free reward signals. Empirical evaluations on the Gym MuJoCo, FrankaKitchen, and long horizon planning benchmarks demonstrate that our approach can achieve a 9.7% improvement over previous state-of-the-art while offering up to 142x speedup over diffusion counterparts in inference time.</p></details> |  |

While experimental techniques like spatial transcriptomics now enable high-resolution mapping of tissue organization across space and time, current methods that model cellular evolution operate at the single-cell level, overlooking the coordinated development of cellular states in a tissue. We introduce NicheFlow, a flow-based generative model that infers the temporal trajectory of cellular microenvironments across sequential spatial slides. By representing local cell neighborhoods as point clouds, NicheFlow jointly models the evolution of cell states and spatial coordinates using optimal transport and Variational Flow Matching. Our approach successfully recovers both global spatial architecture and local microenvironment composition across diverse spatiotemporal datasets, from embryonic to brain development.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages, 15 figures, to appear in NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

Yet, designing reward functions is notoriously time-consuming and prone to misspecification. To address this issue, our first goal is to understand how to support RL practitioners in specifying appropriate weights for a reward function. We leverage the Trajectory Alignment Coefficient (TAC), a metric that evaluates how closely a reward function's induced preferences match those of a domain expert. To evaluate whether TAC provides effective support in practice, we conducted a human-subject study in which RL practitioners tuned reward weights for Lunar Lander. We found that providing TAC during reward tuning led participants to produce more performant reward functions and report lower cognitive workload relative to standard tuning without TAC. However, the study also underscored that manual reward design, even with TAC, remains labor-intensive. This limitation motivated our second goal: to learn a reward model that maximizes TAC directly. Specifically, we propose Soft-TAC, a differentiable approximation of TAC that can be used as a loss function to train reward models from human preference data. Validated in the racing simulator Gran Turismo 7, reward models trained using Soft-TAC successfully captured preference-specific objectives, resulting in policies with qualitatively more distinct behaviors than models trained with standard Cross-Entropy loss. This work demonstrates that TAC can serve as both a practical tool for guiding reward tuning and a reward learning objective in complex domains.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents HumanDiffusion, a lightweight image-conditioned diffusion planner that generates human-aware navigation trajectories directly from RGB imagery. The system combines YOLO-11 based human detection with diffusion-driven trajectory generation, enabling a quadrotor to approach a target person and deliver medical assistance without relying on prior maps or computationally intensive planning pipelines. Trajectories are predicted in pixel space, ensuring smooth motion and a consistent safety margin around humans. We evaluate HumanDiffusion in simulation and real-world indoor mock-disaster scenarios. On a 300-sample test set, the model achieves a mean squared error of 0.02 in pixel-space trajectory reconstruction. Real-world experiments demonstrate an overall mission success rate of 80% across accident-response and search-and-locate tasks with partial occlusions. These results indicate that human-conditioned diffusion planning offers a practical and robust solution for human-aware UAV navigation in time-critical assistance settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted at HRI, Late Breaking Report, 2026</p></details> |
| **[MoE-Enhanced Multi-Domain Feature Selection and Fusion for Fast Map-Free Trajectory Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02368v2)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is crucial for the reliability and safety of autonomous driving systems, yet it remains a challenging task in complex interactive scenarios due to noisy trajectory observations and intricate agent interactions. Existing methods often struggle to filter redundant scene data for discriminative information extraction, directly impairing trajectory prediction accuracy especially when handling outliers and dynamic multi-agent interactions. In response to these limitations, we present a novel map-free trajectory prediction method which adaptively eliminates redundant information and selects discriminative features across the temporal, spatial, and frequency domains, thereby enabling precise trajectory prediction in real-world driving environments. First, we design a MoE based frequency domain filter to adaptively weight distinct frequency components of observed trajectory data and suppress outlier related noise; then a selective spatiotemporal attention module that reallocates weights across temporal nodes (sequential dependencies), temporal trends (evolution patterns), and spatial nodes to extract salient information is proposed. Finally, our multimodal decoder-supervised by joint patch level and point-level losses generates reasonable and temporally consistent trajectories, and comprehensive experiments on the large-scale NuScenes and Argoverse dataset demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance and low-latency inference performance compared with recently proposed methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[R$^2$PO: Decoupling Training Trajectories from Inference Responses for LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11960v2)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning has become a central paradigm for improving LLM reasoning. However, existing methods use a single policy to produce both inference responses and training optimization trajectories. The objective conflict between generating stable inference responses and diverse training trajectories leads to insufficient exploration, which harms reasoning capability. In this paper, to address the problem, we propose R$^2$PO (Residual Rollout Policy Optimization), which introduces a lightweight Residual Rollout-Head atop the policy to decouple training trajectories from inference responses, enabling controlled trajectory diversification during training while keeping inference generation stable. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms baselines, achieving average accuracy gains of 3.4% on MATH-500 and 1.3% on APPS, while also reducing formatting errors and mitigating length bias for stable optimization. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/RRPO-ARR/Code.</p></details> |  |
| **[Life Sequence Transformer: Generative Modelling of Socio-Economic Trajectories from Administrative Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01874v2)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative modelling with Transformer architectures can simulate complex sequential structures across various applications. We extend this line of work to the social sciences by introducing a Transformer-based generative model tailored to longitudinal socio-economic data. Our contributions are: (i) we design a novel encoding method that represents socio-economic life histories as sequences, including overlapping events across life domains; and (ii) we adapt generative modelling techniques to simulate plausible alternative life trajectories conditioned on past histories. Using large-scale data from the Italian social security administration (INPS), we show that the model can be trained at scale, reproduces realistic labour market patterns consistent with known causal relationships, and generates coherent hypothetical life paths. This work demonstrates the feasibility of generative modelling for socio-economic trajectories and opens new opportunities for policy-oriented research, with counterfactual generation as a particularly promising application.</p></details> |  |
| **[Universal Refusal Circuits Across LLMs: Cross-Model Transfer via Trajectory Replay and Concept-Basis Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16034v1)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Refusal behavior in aligned LLMs is often viewed as model-specific, yet we hypothesize it stems from a universal, low-dimensional semantic circuit shared across models. To test this, we introduce Trajectory Replay via Concept-Basis Reconstruction, a framework that transfers refusal interventions from donor to target models, spanning diverse architectures (e.g., Dense to MoE) and training regimes, without using target-side refusal supervision. By aligning layers via concept fingerprints and reconstructing refusal directions using a shared ``recipe'' of concept atoms, we map the donor's ablation trajectory into the target's semantic space. To preserve capabilities, we introduce a weight-SVD stability guard that projects interventions away from high-variance weight subspaces to prevent collateral damage. Our evaluation across 8 model pairs (including GPT-OSS-20B and GLM-4) confirms that these transferred recipes consistently attenuate refusal while maintaining performance, providing strong evidence for the semantic universality of safety alignment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Emerging from Ground: Addressing Intent Deviation in Tool-Using Agents via Deriving Real Calls into Virtual Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15120v2)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs have advanced tool-using agents for real-world applications, yet they often lead to unexpected behaviors or results. Beyond obvious failures, the subtle issue of "intent deviation" severely hinders reliable evaluation and performance improvement. Existing post-training methods generally leverage either real system samples or virtual data simulated by LLMs. However, the former is costly due to reliance on hand-crafted user requests, while the latter suffers from distribution shift from the real tools in the wild. Additionally, both methods lack negative samples tailored to intent deviation scenarios, hindering effective guidance on preference learning. We introduce RISE, a "Real-to-Virtual" method designed to mitigate intent deviation. Anchoring on verified tool primitives, RISE synthesizes virtual trajectories and generates diverse negative samples through mutation on critical parameters. With synthetic data, RISE fine-tunes backbone LLMs via the two-stage training for intent alignment. Evaluation results demonstrate that data synthesized by RISE achieve promising results in eight metrics covering user requires, execution trajectories and agent responses. Integrating with training, RISE achieves an average 35.28% improvement in Acctask (task completion) and 23.27% in Accintent (intent alignment), outperforming SOTA baselines by 1.20--42.09% and 1.17--54.93% respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamics of Agentic Loops in Large Language Models: A Geometric Theory of Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10350v3)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agentic systems built on large language models operate through recursive feedback loops, where each output becomes the next input. Yet the geometric behavior of these agentic loops (whether they converge, diverge, or exhibit more complex dynamics) remains poorly understood. This paper introduces a geometric framework for analyzing agentic trajectories in semantic embedding space, treating iterative transformations as discrete dynamical systems. We distinguish the artifact space, where linguistic transformations occur, from the embedding space, where geometric measurements are performed. Because cosine similarity is biased by embedding anisotropy, we introduce an isotonic calibration that eliminates systematic bias and aligns similarities with human semantic judgments while preserving high local stability. This enables rigorous measurement of trajectories, clusters and attractors. Through controlled experiments on singular agentic loops, we identify two fundamental regimes. A contractive rewriting loop converges toward a stable attractor with decreasing dispersion, while an exploratory summarize and negate loop produces unbounded divergence with no cluster formation. These regimes display qualitatively distinct geometric signatures of contraction and expansion. Our results show that prompt design directly governs the dynamical regime of an agentic loop, enabling systematic control of convergence, divergence and trajectory structure in iterative LLM transformations.</p></details> |  |
| **[PAD-TRO: Projection-Augmented Diffusion for Direct Trajectory Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04436v2)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, diffusion models have gained popularity and attention in trajectory optimization due to their capability of modeling multi-modal probability distributions. However, addressing nonlinear equality constraints, i.e, dynamic feasibility, remains a great challenge in diffusion-based trajectory optimization. Recent diffusion-based trajectory optimization frameworks rely on a single-shooting style approach where the denoised control sequence is applied to forward propagate the dynamical system, which cannot explicitly enforce constraints on the states and frequently leads to sub-optimal solutions. In this work, we propose a novel direct trajectory optimization approach via model-based diffusion, which directly generates a sequence of states. To ensure dynamic feasibility, we propose a gradient-free projection mechanism that is incorporated into the reverse diffusion process. Our results show that, compared to a recent state-of-the-art baseline, our approach leads to zero dynamic feasibility error and approximately 4x higher success rate in a quadrotor waypoint navigation scenario involving dense static obstacles.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the 2026 American Control Conference</p></details> |
| **[CLEANER: Self-Purified Trajectories Boost Agentic Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15141v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agentic Reinforcement Learning (RL) has empowered Large Language Models (LLMs) to utilize tools like Python interpreters for complex problem-solving. However, for parameter-constrained models (e.g., 4B--7B), the exploration phase is often plagued by frequent execution failures, creating noisy trajectories that hinder policy optimization. Under standard outcome-based reward settings, this noise leads to a critical credit assignment issue, where erroneous actions are inadvertently reinforced alongside successful outcomes. Existing mitigations face a dilemma: dense rewards often trigger reward hacking, while supersampling incurs prohibitive computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose CLEANER. Distinct from external filtering methods, CLEANER exploits the model's intrinsic self-correction capabilities to eliminate error-contaminated context directly during data collection. At its core, the Similarity-Aware Adaptive Rollback (SAAR) mechanism autonomously constructs clean, purified trajectories by retrospectively replacing failures with successful self-corrections. Based on semantic similarity, SAAR adaptively regulates replacement granularity from shallow execution repairs to deep reasoning substitutions. By training on these self-purified paths, the model internalizes correct reasoning patterns rather than error-recovery loops. Empirical results on AIME24/25, GPQA, and LiveCodeBench show average accuracy gains of 6%, 3%, and 5% over baselines. Notably, CLEANER matches state-of-the-art performance using only one-third of the training steps, highlighting trajectory purification as a scalable solution for efficient agentic RL.

| **[Context-aware Learned Mesh-based Simulation via Trajectory-Level Meta-Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05234v2)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulating object deformations is a critical challenge across many scientific domains, including robotics, manufacturing, and structural mechanics. Learned Graph Network Simulators (GNSs) offer a promising alternative to traditional mesh-based physics simulators. Their speed and inherent differentiability make them particularly well suited for applications that require fast and accurate simulations, such as robotic manipulation or manufacturing optimization. However, existing learned simulators typically rely on single-step observations, which limits their ability to exploit temporal context. Without this information, these models fail to infer, e.g., material properties. Further, they rely on auto-regressive rollouts, which quickly accumulate error for long trajectories. We instead frame mesh-based simulation as a trajectory-level meta-learning problem. Using Conditional Neural Processes, our method enables rapid adaptation to new simulation scenarios from limited initial data while capturing their latent simulation properties. We utilize movement primitives to directly predict fast, stable and accurate simulations from a single model call. The resulting approach, Movement-primitive Meta-MeshGraphNet (M3GN), provides higher simulation accuracy at a fraction of the runtime cost compared to state-of-the-art GNSs across several tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages.

| **[Trajectory-Driven Multi-Product Influence Maximization in Billboard Advertising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14737v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Billboard Advertising has emerged as an effective out-of-home advertising technique, where the goal is to select a limited number of slots and play advertisement content there, with the hope that it will be observed by many people and, effectively, a significant number of them will be influenced towards the brand. Given a trajectory and a billboard database and a positive integer $k$, how can we select $k$ highly influential slots to maximize influence? In this paper, we study a variant of this problem where a commercial house wants to make a promotion of multiple products, and there is an influence demand for each product. We have studied two variants of the problem. In the first variant, our goal is to select $k$ slots such that the respective influence demand of each product is satisfied. In the other variant of the problem, we are given with $\ell$ integers $k_1,k_2, \ldots, k_{\ell}$, the goal here is to search for $\ell$ many set of slots $S_1, S_2, \ldots, S_{\ell}$ such that for all $i \in [\ell]$, $|S_{i}| \leq k_i$ and for all $i \neq j$, $S_i \cap S_j=\emptyset$ and the influence demand of each of the products gets satisfied. We model the first variant of the problem as a multi-submodular cover problem and the second variant as its generalization. To solve the common-slot variant, we formulate the problem as a multi-submodular cover problem and design a bi-criteria approximation algorithm based on the continuous greedy framework and randomized rounding. For the disjoint-slot variant, we proposed a sampling-based approximation approach along with an efficient primal-dual greedy algorithm that enforces disjointness naturally. Extensive experiments with real-world trajectory and billboard datasets highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed solution approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 Pa...</summary><p>31 Pages. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2510.09050</p></details> |
| **[LaVR: Scene Latent Conditioned Generative Video Trajectory Re-Rendering using Large 4D Reconstruction Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14674v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given a monocular video, the goal of video re-rendering is to generate views of the scene from a novel camera trajectory. Existing methods face two distinct challenges. Geometrically unconditioned models lack spatial awareness, leading to drift and deformation under viewpoint changes. On the other hand, geometrically-conditioned models depend on estimated depth and explicit reconstruction, making them susceptible to depth inaccuracies and calibration errors. We propose to address these challenges by using the implicit geometric knowledge embedded in the latent space of a large 4D reconstruction model to condition the video generation process. These latents capture scene structure in a continuous space without explicit reconstruction. Therefore, they provide a flexible representation that allows the pretrained diffusion prior to regularize errors more effectively. By jointly conditioning on these latents and source camera poses, we demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art results on the video re-rendering task.

| **[Which Reasoning Trajectories Teach Students to Reason Better? A Simple Metric of Informative Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14249v1)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long chain-of-thought (CoT) trajectories provide rich supervision signals for distilling reasoning from teacher to student LLMs. However, both prior work and our experiments show that trajectories from stronger teachers do not necessarily yield better students, highlighting the importance of data-student suitability in distillation. Existing methods assess suitability primarily through student likelihood, favoring trajectories that closely align with the model's current behavior but overlooking more informative ones. Addressing this, we propose Rank-Surprisal Ratio (RSR), a simple metric that captures both alignment and informativeness to assess the suitability of a reasoning trajectory. RSR is motivated by the observation that effective trajectories typically combine low absolute probability with relatively high-ranked tokens under the student model, balancing learning signal strength and behavioral alignment. Concretely, RSR is defined as the ratio of a trajectory's average token-wise rank to its average negative log-likelihood, and is straightforward to compute and interpret. Across five student models and reasoning trajectories from 11 diverse teachers, RSR strongly correlates with post-training performance (average Spearman 0.86), outperforming existing metrics. We further demonstrate its practical utility in both trajectory selection and teacher selection.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages.

| **[Can the Waymo Open Motion Dataset Support Realistic Behavioral Modeling? A Validation Study with Naturalistic Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03515v2)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) has become a popular resource for data-driven modeling of autonomous vehicles (AVs) behavior. However, its validity for behavioral analysis remains uncertain due to proprietary post-processing, the absence of error quantification, and the segmentation of trajectories into 20-second clips. This study examines whether WOMD accurately captures the dynamics and interactions observed in real-world AV operations. Leveraging an independently collected naturalistic dataset from Level 4 AV operations in Phoenix, Arizona (PHX), we perform comparative analyses across three representative urban driving scenarios: discharging at signalized intersections, car-following, and lane-changing behaviors. For the discharging analysis, headways are manually extracted from aerial video to ensure negligible measurement error. For the car-following and lane-changing cases, we apply the Simulation-Extrapolation (SIMEX) method to account for empirically estimated error in the PHX data and use Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distances to quantify behavioral differences. Results across all scenarios consistently show that behavior in PHX falls outside the behavioral envelope of WOMD. Notably, WOMD underrepresents short headways and abrupt decelerations. These findings suggest that behavioral models calibrated solely on WOMD may systematically underestimate the variability, risk, and complexity of naturalistic driving. Caution is therefore warranted when using WOMD for behavior modeling without proper validation against independently collected data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fast Surrogate Models for Adaptive Aircraft Trajectory Prediction in En route Airspace](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03075v2)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction (TP) is crucial for ensuring safety and efficiency in modern air traffic management systems. It is, for example, a core component of conflict detection and resolution tools, arrival sequencing algorithms, capacity planning, as well as several future concepts. However, TP accuracy within operational systems is hampered by a range of epistemic uncertainties such as the mass and performance settings of aircraft and the effect of meteorological conditions on aircraft performance. It can also require considerable computational resources. This paper proposes a method for adaptive TP that has two components: first, a fast surrogate TP model based on linear state space models (LSSM)s with an execution time that was 6.7 times lower on average than an implementation of the Base of Aircraft Data (BADA) in Python. It is demonstrated that such models can effectively emulate the BADA aircraft performance model, which is based on the numerical solution of a partial differential equation (PDE), and that the LSSMs can be fitted to trajectories in a dataset of historic flight data. Secondly, the paper proposes an algorithm to assimilate radar observations using particle filtering to adaptively refine TP accuracy. Comparison with baselines using BADA and Kalman filtering demonstrate that the proposed framework improves system identification and state estimation for both climb and descent phases, with 46.3% and 64.7% better estimates for time to top of climb and bottom of descent compared to the best performing benchmark model. In particular, the particle filtering approach provides the flexibility to capture non-linear performance effects including the CAS-Mach transition.</p></details> |  |

Popular approaches such as reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) and inference-time reward aggregation are typically analyzed from a performance perspective, leaving their effects on the underlying reasoning distribution less understood. In this work, we study post-training reasoning from a stochastic trajectory viewpoint. Following Kim et al. (2025), we model reasoning steps of varying difficulty as Markov transitions with different probabilities, and formalize reasoning processes using tree-structured Markov chains. Within this framework, pretraining corresponds to discovering the reasoning structure, while post-training primarily reweights existing chains of thought. We show that both RLVR and inference-time reward aggregation concentrate probability mass on a small number of high-probability trajectories, leading to the suppression of rare but essential reasoning paths. As a consequence, solving hard instances often depends on low-probability trajectories already present in the base model. We further prove that exploration-oriented mechanisms, such as rejecting easy instances and applying KL regularization, help preserve these rare trajectories. Empirical simulations support our theoretical analysis.</p></details> |  |

Developing accurate prediction algorithms relies on reliable, multimodal, and realistic datasets; however, such datasets for roundabout scenarios are scarce, as real-world data collection is often limited by incomplete observations and entangled factors that are difficult to isolate. We present CARLA-Round, a systematically designed simulation dataset for roundabout trajectory prediction. The dataset varies weather conditions (five types) and traffic density levels (spanning Level-of-Service A-E) in a structured manner, resulting in 25 controlled scenarios. Each scenario incorporates realistic mixtures of driving behaviors and provides explicit annotations that are largely absent from existing datasets. Unlike randomly sampled simulation data, this structured design enables precise analysis of how different conditions influence trajectory prediction performance. Validation experiments using standard baselines (LSTM, GCN, GRU+GCN) reveal traffic density dominates prediction difficulty with strong monotonic effects, while weather shows non-linear impacts. The best model achieves 0.312m ADE on real-world rounD dataset, demonstrating effective sim-to-real transfer. This systematic approach quantifies factor impacts impossible to isolate in confounded real-world datasets.

Yet existing self-evolving frameworks mainly reward final outcomes, leaving intermediate reasoning weakly constrained despite its importance for visually grounded decision making. We propose iReasoner, a self-evolving framework that improves an LMM's implicit reasoning by explicitly eliciting chain-of-thought (CoT) and rewarding its internal agreement. In a Proposer--Solver loop over unlabeled images, iReasoner augments outcome-level intrinsic rewards with a trajectory-aware signal defined over intermediate reasoning steps, providing learning signals that distinguish reasoning paths leading to the same answer without ground-truth labels or external judges. Starting from Qwen2.5-VL-7B, iReasoner yields up to $+2.1$ points across diverse multimodal reasoning benchmarks under fully unsupervised post-training. We hope this work serves as a starting point for reasoning-aware self-improvement in LMMs in purely unsupervised settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attesting Model Lineage by Consisted Knowledge Evolution with Fine-Tuning Trajectory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11683v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The fine-tuning technique in deep learning gives rise to an emerging lineage relationship among models. This lineage provides a promising perspective for addressing security concerns such as unauthorized model redistribution and false claim of model provenance, which are particularly pressing in \textcolor{blue}{open-weight model} libraries where robust lineage verification mechanisms are often lacking. Existing approaches to model lineage detection primarily rely on static architectural similarities, which are insufficient to capture the dynamic evolution of knowledge that underlies true lineage relationships. Drawing inspiration from the genetic mechanism of human evolution, we tackle the problem of model lineage attestation by verifying the joint trajectory of knowledge evolution and parameter modification. To this end, we propose a novel model lineage attestation framework. In our framework, model editing is first leveraged to quantify parameter-level changes introduced by fine-tuning. Subsequently, we introduce a novel knowledge vectorization mechanism that refines the evolved knowledge within the edited models into compact representations by the assistance of probe samples. The probing strategies are adapted to different types of model families. These embeddings serve as the foundation for verifying the arithmetic consistency of knowledge relationships across models, thereby enabling robust attestation of model lineage. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness and resilience of our approach in a variety of adversarial scenarios in the real world. Our method consistently achieves reliable lineage verification across a broad spectrum of model types, including classifiers, diffusion models, and large language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 35th USENIX Security Symposium (USENIX Security 2026)</p></details> |

However, current benchmarks are impeded by a notable scarcity of scenarios featuring dense traffic, which is essential for understanding and modeling complex interactions among road users. To address this gap, we collaborated with our industrial partner, DeepScenario, to develop DeepUrban-a new drone dataset designed to enhance trajectory prediction and planning benchmarks focusing on dense urban settings. DeepUrban provides a rich collection of 3D traffic objects, extracted from high-resolution images captured over urban intersections at approximately 100 meters altitude. The dataset is further enriched with comprehensive map and scene information to support advanced modeling and simulation tasks. We evaluate state-of-the-art (SOTA) prediction and planning methods, and conducted experiments on generalization capabilities. Our findings demonstrate that adding DeepUrban to nuScenes can boost the accuracy of vehicle predictions and planning, achieving improvements up to 44.1 % / 44.3% on the ADE / FDE metrics.

| **[Modeling mental health trajectories during the COVID-19 pandemic using UK-wide data in the presence of sociodemographic variables](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10445v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: The negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health and well-being of populations are an important public health issue. Our study aims to determine the underlying factors shaping mental health trajectories during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK. Methods: Data from the Understanding Society COVID-19 Study were utilized and the core analysis focussed on GHQ36 scores as the outcome variable. We used GAMs to evaluate trends over time and the role of sociodemographic variables, i.e., age, sex, ethnicity, country of residence (in UK), job status (employment), household income, living with a partner, living with children under age 16, and living with a long-term illness, on the variation of mental health during the study period. Results: Statistically significant differences in mental health were observed for age, sex,ethnicity, country of residence (in UK), job status (employment), household income, living with a partner, living with children under age 16, and living with a long-term illness. Women experienced higher GHQ36 scores relative to men with the GHQ36 score expected to increase by 1.260 (95%CI: 1.176, 1.345). Individuals living without a partner were expected to have higher GHQ36 scores, of 1.050 (95%CI: 0.949, 1.148) more than those living with a partner, and age groups 16-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64 experienced higher GHQ36 scores relative to those who were 65+. Individuals with relatively lower household income were likely to have poorer mental health relative to those who were more well off. Conclusion: This study identifies key demographic determinants shaping mental health trajectories during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK. Policies aiming to reduce mental health inequalities should target women, youth, individuals living without a partner, individuals living with children under 16, individuals with a long-term illness, and lower income families.</p></details> | 5 figures |

Current visual navigation methods are typically limited to simulated or off-street environments, and often rely on precise goal formats, such as specific coordinates or images. This limits their effectiveness for autonomous agents like last-mile delivery robots navigating unfamiliar cities. To address these limitations, we introduce UrbanNav, a scalable framework that trains embodied agents to follow free-form language instructions in diverse urban settings. Leveraging web-scale city walking videos, we develop an scalable annotation pipeline that aligns human navigation trajectories with language instructions grounded in real-world landmarks. UrbanNav encompasses over 1,500 hours of navigation data and 3 million instruction-trajectory-landmark triplets, capturing a wide range of urban scenarios. Our model learns robust navigation policies to tackle complex urban scenarios, demonstrating superior spatial reasoning, robustness to noisy instructions, and generalization to unseen urban settings. Experimental results show that UrbanNav significantly outperforms existing methods, highlighting the potential of large-scale web video data to enable language-guided, real-world urban navigation for embodied agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, accepted to AAAI 2026.

However, acquiring diverse and realistic multi-turn tool-use data remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose a novel text-based paradigm. We observe that textual corpora naturally contain rich, multi-step problem-solving experiences, which can serve as an untapped, scalable, and authentic data source for multi-turn tool-use tasks. Based on this insight, we introduce GEM, a data synthesis pipeline that enables the generation and extraction of multi-turn tool-use trajectories from text corpora through a four-stage process: relevance filtering, workflow & tool extraction, trajectory grounding, and complexity refinement. To reduce the computational cost, we further train a specialized Trajectory Synthesizer via supervised fine-tuning. This model distills the complex generation pipeline into an efficient, end-to-end trajectory generator. Experiments demonstrate that our GEM-32B achieve a 16.5% improvement on the BFCL V3 Multi-turn benchmark. Our models partially surpass the performance of models trained on τ - bench (Airline and Retail) in-domain data, highlighting the superior generalization capability derived from our text-based synthesis paradigm. Notably, our Trajectory Synthesizer matches the quality of the full pipeline while significantly reducing inference latency and costs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Training-Trajectory-Aware Token Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10348v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient distillation is a key pathway for converting expensive reasoning capability into deployable efficiency, yet in the frontier regime where the student already has strong reasoning ability, naive continual distillation often yields limited gains or even degradation. We observe a characteristic training phenomenon: even as loss decreases monotonically, all performance metrics can drop sharply at almost the same bottleneck, before gradually recovering. We further uncover a token-level mechanism: confidence bifurcates into steadily increasing Imitation-Anchor Tokens that quickly anchor optimization and other yet-to-learn tokens whose confidence is suppressed until after the bottleneck. And the characteristic that these two types of tokens cannot coexist is the root cause of the failure in continual distillation. To this end, we propose Training-Trajectory-Aware Token Selection (T3S) to reconstruct the training objective at the token level, clearing the optimization path for yet-to-learn tokens. T3 yields consistent gains in both AR and dLLM settings: with only hundreds of examples, Qwen3-8B surpasses DeepSeek-R1 on competitive reasoning benchmarks, Qwen3-32B approaches Qwen3-235B, and T3-trained LLaDA-2.0-Mini exceeds its AR baseline, achieving state-of-the-art performance among all of 16B-scale no-think models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Physically Plausible Multi-System Trajectory Generation and Symmetry Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23003v2)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>From metronomes to celestial bodies, mechanics underpins how the world evolves in time and space. With consideration of this, a number of recent neural network models leverage inductive biases from classical mechanics to encourage model interpretability and ensure forecasted states are physical. However, in general, these models are designed to capture the dynamics of a single system with fixed physical parameters, from state-space measurements of a known configuration space. In this paper we introduce Symplectic Phase Space GAN (SPS-GAN) which can capture the dynamics of multiple systems, and generalize to unseen physical parameters from. Moreover, SPS-GAN does not require prior knowledge of the system configuration space. In fact, SPS-GAN can discover the configuration space structure of the system from arbitrary measurement types (e.g., state-space measurements, video frames). To achieve physically plausible generation, we introduce a novel architecture which embeds a Hamiltonian neural network recurrent module in a conditional GAN backbone. To discover the structure of the configuration space, we optimize the conditional time-series GAN objective with an additional physically motivated term to encourages a sparse representation of the configuration space. We demonstrate the utility of SPS-GAN for trajectory prediction, video generation and symmetry discovery. Our approach captures multiple systems and achieves performance on par with supervised models designed for single systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReflexDiffusion: Reflection-Enhanced Trajectory Planning for High-lateral-acceleration Scenarios in Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09377v1)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating safe and reliable trajectories for autonomous vehicles in long-tail scenarios remains a significant challenge, particularly for high-lateral-acceleration maneuvers such as sharp turns, which represent critical safety situations. Existing trajectory planners exhibit systematic failures in these scenarios due to data imbalance. This results in insufficient modelling of vehicle dynamics, road geometry, and environmental constraints in high-risk situations, leading to suboptimal or unsafe trajectory prediction when vehicles operate near their physical limits. In this paper, we introduce ReflexDiffusion, a novel inference-stage framework that enhances diffusion-based trajectory planners through reflective adjustment. Our method introduces a gradient-based adjustment mechanism during the iterative denoising process: after each standard trajectory update, we compute the gradient between the conditional and unconditional noise predictions to explicitly amplify critical conditioning signals, including road curvature and lateral vehicle dynamics. This amplification enforces strict adherence to physical constraints, particularly improving stability during high-lateral-acceleration maneuvers where precise vehicle-road interaction is paramount. Evaluated on the nuPlan Test14-hard benchmark, ReflexDiffusion achieves a 14.1% improvement in driving score for high-lateral-acceleration scenarios over the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. This demonstrates that inference-time trajectory optimization can effectively compensate for training data sparsity by dynamically reinforcing safety-critical constraints near handling limits. The framework's architecture-agnostic design enables direct deployment to existing diffusion-based planners, offering a practical solution for improving autonomous vehicle safety in challenging driving conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |

Existing Large Language Models (LLMs) unlearning approaches that typically focus on modifying only final answers are insufficient for LRMs, as they fail to remove sensitive content from intermediate steps, leading to persistent privacy leakage and degraded security. To address these challenges, we propose Sensitive Trajectory Regulation (STaR), a parameter-free, inference-time unlearning framework that achieves robust privacy protection throughout the reasoning process. Specifically, we first identify sensitive content via semantic-aware detection. Then, we inject global safety constraints through secure prompt prefix. Next, we perform trajectory-aware suppression to dynamically block sensitive content across the entire reasoning chain. Finally, we apply token-level adaptive filtering to prevent both exact and paraphrased sensitive tokens during generation. Furthermore, to overcome the inadequacies of existing evaluation protocols, we introduce two metrics: Multi-Decoding Consistency Assessment (MCS), which measures the consistency of unlearning across diverse decoding strategies, and Multi-Granularity Membership Inference Attack (MIA) Evaluation, which quantifies privacy protection at both answer and reasoning-chain levels. Experiments on the R-TOFU benchmark demonstrate that STaR achieves comprehensive and stable unlearning with minimal utility loss, setting a new standard for privacy-preserving reasoning in LRMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Online Trajectory Optimization for Arbitrary-Shaped Mobile Robots via Polynomial Separating Hypersurfaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09231v1)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An emerging class of trajectory optimization methods enforces collision avoidance by jointly optimizing the robot's configuration and a separating hyperplane. However, as linear separators only apply to convex sets, these methods require convex approximations of both the robot and obstacles, which becomes an overly conservative assumption in cluttered and narrow environments. In this work, we unequivocally remove this limitation by introducing nonlinear separating hypersurfaces parameterized by polynomial functions. We first generalize the classical separating hyperplane theorem and prove that any two disjoint bounded closed sets in Euclidean space can be separated by a polynomial hypersurface, serving as the theoretical foundation for nonlinear separation of arbitrary geometries. Building on this result, we formulate a nonlinear programming (NLP) problem that jointly optimizes the robot's trajectory and the coefficients of the separating polynomials, enabling geometry-aware collision avoidance without conservative convex simplifications. The optimization remains efficiently solvable using standard NLP solvers. Simulation and real-world experiments with nonconvex robots demonstrate that our method achieves smooth, collision-free, and agile maneuvers in environments where convex-approximation baselines fail.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiffMM: Efficient Method for Accurate Noisy and Sparse Trajectory Map Matching via One Step Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08482v1)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Map matching for sparse trajectories is a fundamental problem for many trajectory-based applications, e.g., traffic scheduling and traffic flow analysis. Existing methods for map matching are generally based on Hidden Markov Model (HMM) or encoder-decoder framework. However, these methods continue to face significant challenges when handling noisy or sparsely sampled GPS trajectories. To address these limitations, we propose DiffMM, an encoder-diffusion-based map matching framework that produces effective yet efficient matching results through a one-step diffusion process. We first introduce a road segment-aware trajectory encoder that jointly embeds the input trajectory and its surrounding candidate road segments into a shared latent space through an attention mechanism. Next, we propose a one step diffusion method to realize map matching through a shortcut model by leveraging the joint embedding of the trajectory and candidate road segments as conditioning context. We conduct extensive experiments on large-scale trajectory datasets, demonstrating that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art map matching methods in terms of both accuracy and efficiency, particularly for sparse trajectories and complex road network topologies.</p></details> | AAAI-26 |

Repeated sampling over the same input often produces divergent reasoning trajectories and inconsistent final predictions. To address this, we introduce two complementary approaches inspired by test-time scaling: (1) CASHEW, an inference-time framework that stabilizes reasoning by iteratively aggregating multiple candidate trajectories into higher-quality reasoning traces, with explicit visual verification filtering hallucinated steps and grounding reasoning in visual evidence, and (2) CASHEW-RL, a learned variant that internalizes this aggregation behavior within a single model. CASHEW-RL is trained using Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO) with a composite reward that encourages correct answers grounded in minimal yet sufficient visual evidence, while adaptively allocating reasoning effort based on task difficulty. This training objective enables robust self-aggregation at inference. Extensive experiments on 13 image understanding, video understanding, and video reasoning benchmarks show significant performance improvements, including gains of up to +23.6 percentage points on ScienceQA and +8.1 percentage points on EgoSchema.</p></details> |  |

However, realizing these benefits in practice is non-trivial, as dLLMs inherently face an accuracy-parallelism trade-off. Despite increasing interest, existing methods typically focus on only one-side of the coin, targeting either efficiency or performance. To address this limitation, we propose d3LLM (Pseudo-Distilled Diffusion Large Language Model), striking a balance between accuracy and parallelism: (i) during training, we introduce pseudo-trajectory distillation to teach the model which tokens can be decoded confidently at early steps, thereby improving parallelism; (ii) during inference, we employ entropy-based multi-block decoding with a KV-cache refresh mechanism to achieve high parallelism while maintaining accuracy. To better evaluate dLLMs, we also introduce AUP (Accuracy Under Parallelism), a new metric that jointly measures accuracy and parallelism. Experiments demonstrate that our d3LLM achieves up to 10$\times$ speedup over vanilla LLaDA/Dream and 5$\times$ speedup over AR models without much accuracy drop.

| **[BiTrajDiff: Bidirectional Trajectory Generation with Diffusion Models for Offline Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05762v4)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) have proven that effective policy learning can benefit from imposing conservative constraints on pre-collected datasets. However, such static datasets often exhibit distribution bias, resulting in limited generalizability. To address this limitation, a straightforward solution is data augmentation (DA), which leverages generative models to enrich data distribution. Despite the promising results, current DA techniques focus solely on reconstructing future trajectories from given states, while ignoring the exploration of history transitions that reach them. This single-direction paradigm inevitably hinders the discovery of diverse behavior patterns, especially those leading to critical states that may have yielded high-reward outcomes. In this work, we introduce Bidirectional Trajectory Diffusion (BiTrajDiff), a novel DA framework for offline RL that models both future and history trajectories from any intermediate states. Specifically, we decompose the trajectory generation task into two independent yet complementary diffusion processes: one generating forward trajectories to predict future dynamics, and the other generating backward trajectories to trace essential history transitions.BiTrajDiff can efficiently leverage critical states as anchors to expand into potentially valuable yet underexplored regions of the state space, thereby facilitating dataset diversity. Extensive experiments on the D4RL benchmark suite demonstrate that BiTrajDiff achieves superior performance compared to other advanced DA methods across various offline RL backbones.</p></details> |  |
| **[PsyCLIENT: Client Simulation via Conversational Trajectory Modeling for Trainee Practice and Model Evaluation in Mental Health Counseling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07312v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-based client simulation has emerged as a promising tool for training novice counselors and evaluating automated counseling systems. However, existing client simulation approaches face three key challenges: (1) limited diversity and realism in client profiles, (2) the lack of a principled framework for modeling realistic client behaviors, and (3) a scarcity in Chinese-language settings. To address these limitations, we propose PsyCLIENT, a novel simulation framework grounded in conversational trajectory modeling. By conditioning LLM generation on predefined real-world trajectories that incorporate explicit behavior labels and content constraints, our approach ensures diverse and realistic interactions. We further introduce PsyCLIENT-CP, the first open-source Chinese client profile dataset, covering 60 distinct counseling topics. Comprehensive evaluations involving licensed professional counselors demonstrate that PsyCLIENT significantly outperforms baselines in terms of authenticity and training effectiveness. Notably, the simulated clients are nearly indistinguishable from human clients, achieving an about 95\% expert confusion rate in discrimination tasks. These findings indicate that conversational trajectory modeling effectively bridges the gap between theoretical client profiles and dynamic, realistic simulations, offering a robust solution for mental health education and research. Code and data will be released to facilitate future research in mental health counseling.</p></details> |  |
| **[VISTA: Knowledge-Driven Interpretable Vessel Trajectory Imputation via Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06940v1)** | 2026-01-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Automatic Identification System provides critical information for maritime navigation and safety, yet its trajectories are often incomplete due to signal loss or deliberate tampering. Existing imputation methods emphasize trajectory recovery, paying limited attention to interpretability and failing to provide underlying knowledge that benefits downstream tasks such as anomaly detection and route planning. We propose knowledge-driven interpretable vessel trajectory imputation (VISTA), the first trajectory imputation framework that offers interpretability while simultaneously providing underlying knowledge to support downstream analysis. Specifically, we first define underlying knowledge as a combination of Structured Data-derived Knowledge (SDK) distilled from AIS data and Implicit LLM Knowledge acquired from large-scale Internet corpora. Second, to manage and leverage the SDK effectively at scale, we develop a data-knowledge-data loop that employs a Structured Data-derived Knowledge Graph for SDK extraction and knowledge-driven trajectory imputation. Third, to efficiently process large-scale AIS data, we introduce a workflow management layer that coordinates the end-to-end pipeline, enabling parallel knowledge extraction and trajectory imputation with anomaly handling and redundancy elimination. Experiments on two large AIS datasets show that VISTA is capable of state-of-the-art imputation accuracy and computational efficiency, improving over state-of-the-art baselines by 5%-94% and reducing time cost by 51%-93%, while producing interpretable knowledge cues that benefit downstream tasks. The source code and implementation details of VISTA are publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 13 figures, 3 algorithms, 5 tables.

| **[Mobility Trajectories from Network-Driven Markov Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06020v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a generative model of human mobility in which trajectories arise as realizations of a prescribed, time-dependent Markov dynamics defined on a spatial interaction network. The model constructs a hierarchical routing structure with hubs, corridors, feeder paths, and metro links, and specifies transition matrices using gravity-type distance decay combined with externally imposed temporal schedules and directional biases. Population mass evolves as indistinguishable, memoryless movers performing a single transition per time step. When aggregated, the resulting trajectories reproduce structured origin-destination flows that reflect network geometry, temporal modulation, and connectivity constraints. By applying the Perron-Frobenius theorem to the daily evolution operator, we identify a unique periodic invariant population distribution that serves as a natural non-transient reference state. We verify consistency between trajectory-level realizations and multi-step Markov dynamics, showing that discrepancies are entirely attributable to finite-population sampling. The framework provides a network-centric, privacy-preserving approach to generating mobility trajectories and studying time-elapsed flow structure without invoking individual-level behavioral assumptions.</p></details> | 22 pages, 6 figures |

This pattern is also often observed within-seasons, as an athlete aims for their performance to peak at key events such as the Olympic Games or World Championships. A Bayesian hierarchical model is developed to analyse the evolution of athletic sporting performance throughout an athlete's career and separate these effects whilst allowing for confounding factors such as environmental conditions. Our model works in continuous time and estimates both $g(t)$, the average performance level of the population at age $t$, and $f_i(t)$, the difference of the $i$-th athlete from this average. We further decompose $f_i(t)$ into a season-to-season trajectory and a within-season trajectory, which is modelled by a restricted Bernstein polynomial. The model is fitted using an adaptive Metropolis-within-Gibbs algorithm with a carefully chosen blocking scheme. The model allows us to understand seasonal patterns in athlete performance, how these differ between athletes, and provides individual fitted and trend performance trajectories. The properties of the model are illustrated using a simulation study and an application to 100 metres and 200 metres freestyle swimming for both female and male athletes.</p></details> |  |

However, we find that directly applying these techniques to image-to-video (I2V) models often fails to yield consistent reward improvements. To address this limitation, we present TAGRPO, a robust post-training framework for I2V models inspired by contrastive learning. Our approach is grounded in the observation that rollout videos generated from identical initial noise provide superior guidance for optimization. Leveraging this insight, we propose a novel GRPO loss applied to intermediate latents, encouraging direct alignment with high-reward trajectories while maximizing distance from low-reward counterparts. Furthermore, we introduce a memory bank for rollout videos to enhance diversity and reduce computational overhead. Despite its simplicity, TAGRPO achieves significant improvements over DanceGRPO in I2V generation.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures |

Here we analyzed 97,564 longitudinal PASC assessments from 13,511 participants with linked vaccination histories to disentangle passive temporal progression from vaccine-associated change. Using a clinically validated threshold (PASC $\geq 12$), trajectories separated into three phenotypes: Protected (persistently sub-threshold), Refractory (persistently symptomatic), and Responders (transitioning from symptomatic to recovered). Across the full cohort, symptom severity increased modestly with elapsed time ($r=0.0521$, $P=1.26\times10^{-59}$), whereas cumulative vaccination showed an inverse association with severity ($r=-0.0434$, $P=5.95\times10^{-42}$). In summary, baseline Long COVID severity appears clinically deterministic. In the absence of intervention, symptoms typically persist without spontaneous resolution. Recovery is primarily associated with repeated immunization.</p></details> |  |

Despite performance improvements from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs), current models lack a mechanism to trace how small targets trigger directional, layer-wise perturbations in the feature space, which is an essential cue for distinguishing signal from structured noise in infrared scenes. To address this limitation, we propose the Trajectory-Aware Mamba Propagation Network (TAPM-Net), which explicitly models the spatial diffusion behavior of target-induced feature disturbances. TAPM-Net is built upon two novel components: a Perturbation-guided Path Module (PGM) and a Trajectory-Aware State Block (TASB). The PGM constructs perturbation energy fields from multi-level features and extracts gradient-following feature trajectories that reflect the directionality of local responses. The resulting feature trajectories are fed into the TASB, a Mamba-based state-space unit that models dynamic propagation along each trajectory while incorporating velocity-constrained diffusion and semantically aligned feature fusion from word-level and sentence-level embeddings. Unlike existing attention-based methods, TAPM-Net enables anisotropic, context-sensitive state transitions along spatial trajectories while maintaining global coherence at low computational cost. Experiments on NUAA-SIRST and IRSTD-1K demonstrate that TAPM-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance in ISTD.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in BMVC 2025 see: https://bmva-archive.org.uk/bmvc/2025/assets/papers/Paper_709/paper.pdf.

We aim to endow computational systems with a similar ability to predict plausible future object motions directly from passive visual observation. We introduce ObjectForesight, a 3D object-centric dynamics model that predicts future 6-DoF poses and trajectories of rigid objects from short egocentric video sequences. Unlike conventional world or dynamics models that operate in pixel or latent space, ObjectForesight represents the world explicitly in 3D at the object level, enabling geometrically grounded and temporally coherent predictions that capture object affordances and trajectories. To train such a model at scale, we leverage recent advances in segmentation, mesh reconstruction, and 3D pose estimation to curate a dataset of 2 million plus short clips with pseudo-ground-truth 3D object trajectories.

Remote assistance concepts, where operators provide discrete inputs to aid specific automation modules like planning, is gaining interest due to its reduced workload on the human remote operator and improved safety. However, these concepts are challenging to implement and maintain due to their deep integration and interaction with the automated driving system. In this paper, we propose a solution to facilitate the implementation of remote assistance concepts that intervene on planning level and extend the operational design domain of the vehicle at runtime. Using arbitration graphs, a modular decision-making framework, we integrate remote assistance into an existing automated driving system without modifying the original software components.

This study extends the scope to online refinement of the entire capacity fade trajectory (CFT) through EntroLnn, a framework based on entropy-guided transformable liquid neural networks (LNNs). EntroLnn treats CFT refinement as an integrated process rather than two independent tasks for pointwise SoH and EoL. We introduce entropy-based features derived from online temperature fields, applied for the first time in battery analytics, and combine them with customized LNNs that model temporal battery dynamics effectively. The framework enhances both static and dynamic adaptability of LNNs and achieves robust and generalizable CFT refinement across different batteries and operating conditions. The approach provides a high fidelity battery health model with lightweight computation, achieving mean absolute errors of only 0.004577 for CFT and 18 cycles for EoL prediction. This work establishes a foundation for entropy-informed learning in battery analytics and enables self-adaptive, lightweight, and interpretable battery health prediction in practical battery management systems.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Exploring Similarity between Neural and LLM Trajectories in Language Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24307v2)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the similarity between large language models (LLMs) and human brain activity is crucial for advancing both AI and cognitive neuroscience. In this study, we provide a multilinguistic, large-scale assessment of this similarity by systematically comparing 16 publicly available pretrained LLMs with human brain responses during natural language processing tasks in both English and Chinese. Specifically, we use ridge regression to assess the representational similarity between LLM embeddings and electroencephalography (EEG) signals, and analyze the similarity between the "neural trajectory" and the "LLM latent trajectory." This method captures key dynamic patterns, such as magnitude, angle, uncertainty, and confidence. Our findings highlight both similarities and crucial differences in processing strategies: (1) We show that middle-to-high layers of LLMs are central to semantic integration and correspond to the N400 component observed in EEG; (2) The brain exhibits continuous and iterative processing during reading, whereas LLMs often show discrete, stage-end bursts of activity, which suggests a stark contrast in their real-time semantic processing dynamics. This study could offer new insights into LLMs and neural processing, and also establish a critical framework for future investigations into the alignment between artificial intelligence and biological intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Table Pruning in TableQA: From Sequential Revisions to Gold Trajectory-Supervised Parallel Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03851v1)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Table Question Answering (TableQA) benefits significantly from table pruning, which extracts compact sub-tables by eliminating redundant cells to streamline downstream reasoning. However, existing pruning methods typically rely on sequential revisions driven by unreliable critique signals, often failing to detect the loss of answer-critical data. To address this limitation, we propose TabTrim, a novel table pruning framework which transforms table pruning from sequential revisions to gold trajectory-supervised parallel search. TabTrim derives a gold pruning trajectory using the intermediate sub-tables in the execution process of gold SQL queries, and trains a pruner and a verifier to make the step-wise pruning result align with the gold pruning trajectory. During inference, TabTrim performs parallel search to explore multiple candidate pruning trajectories and identify the optimal sub-table. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TabTrim achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse tabular reasoning tasks: TabTrim-8B reaches 73.5% average accuracy, outperforming the strongest baseline by 3.2%, including 79.4% on WikiTQ and 61.2% on TableBench.</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures |

Starting with a small number of embodiment-flexible human demonstrations collected in a virtual reality simulation environment, the pipeline refines these demonstrations using optimization-based kinematic retargeting and trajectory optimization to adapt them across various robot embodiments and physical parameters. This process yields a diverse, physically consistent dataset that enables cross-embodiment data transfer, and offers the potential to reuse legacy datasets collected under different hardware configurations or physical parameters. We validate the pipeline's effectiveness by training diffusion policies from the generated datasets for challenging contact-rich manipulation tasks across multiple robot embodiments, including a floating Allegro hand and bimanual robot arms. The trained policies are deployed zero-shot on hardware for bimanual iiwa arms, achieving high success rates with minimal human input.

While text-based affect inference has become increasingly feasible, prior approaches often treat sentiment as a deterministic point estimate for individual speakers, failing to capture the inherent subjectivity, latent ambiguity, and sequential coupling found in mutual exchanges. We introduce LLM-MC-Affect, a probabilistic framework that characterizes emotion not as a static label, but as a continuous latent probability distribution defined over an affective space. By leveraging stochastic LLM decoding and Monte Carlo estimation, the methodology approximates these distributions to derive high-fidelity sentiment trajectories that explicitly quantify both central affective tendencies and perceptual ambiguity. These trajectories enable a structured analysis of interpersonal coupling through sequential cross-correlation and slope-based indicators, identifying leading or lagging influences between interlocutors. To validate the interpretive capacity of this approach, we utilize teacher-student instructional dialogues as a representative case study, where our quantitative indicators successfully distill high-level interaction insights such as effective scaffolding. This work establishes a scalable and deployable pathway for understanding interpersonal dynamics, offering a generalizable solution that extends beyond education to broader social and behavioral research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting Continuous-Time Trajectory Estimation via Gaussian Processes and the Magnus Expansion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03360v1)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continuous-time state estimation has been shown to be an effective means of (i) handling asynchronous and high-rate measurements, (ii) introducing smoothness to the estimate, (iii) post hoc querying the estimate at times other than those of the measurements, and (iv) addressing certain observability issues related to scanning-while-moving sensors. A popular means of representing the trajectory in continuous time is via a Gaussian process (GP) prior, with the prior's mean and covariance functions generated by a linear time-varying (LTV) stochastic differential equation (SDE) driven by white noise. When the state comprises elements of Lie groups, previous works have resorted to a patchwork of local GPs each with a linear time-invariant SDE kernel, which while effective in practice, lacks theoretical elegance. Here we revisit the full LTV GP approach to continuous-time trajectory estimation, deriving a global GP prior on Lie groups via the Magnus expansion, which offers a more elegant and general solution. We provide a numerical comparison between the two approaches and discuss their relative merits.</p></details> | 21 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Dual-quaternion learning control for autonomous vehicle trajectory tracking with safety guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03097v1)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a learning-based trajectory tracking controller for autonomous robotic platforms whose motion can be described kinematically on $\mathrm{SE}(3)$. The controller is formulated in the dual quaternion framework and operates at the velocity level, assuming direct command of angular and linear velocities, as is standard in many aerial vehicles and omnidirectional mobile robots. Gaussian Process (GP) regression is integrated into a geometric feedback law to learn and compensate online for unknown, state-dependent disturbances and modeling imperfections affecting both attitude and position, while preserving the algebraic structure and coupling properties inherent to rigid-body motion. The proposed approach does not rely on explicit parametric models of the unknown effects, making it well-suited for robotic systems subject to sensor-induced disturbances, unmodeled actuation couplings, and environmental uncertainties. A Lyapunov-based analysis establishes probabilistic ultimate boundedness of the pose tracking error under bounded GP uncertainty, providing formal stability guarantees for the learning-based controller. Simulation results demonstrate accurate and smooth trajectory tracking in the presence of realistic, localized disturbances, including correlated rotational and translational effects arising from magnetometer perturbations. These results illustrate the potential of combining geometric modeling and probabilistic learning to achieve robust, data-efficient pose control for autonomous robotic systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Chain-of-Action: Trajectory Autoregressive Modeling for Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09990v2)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Chain-of-Action (CoA), a novel visuo-motor policy paradigm built upon Trajectory Autoregressive Modeling. Unlike conventional approaches that predict next step action(s) forward, CoA generates an entire trajectory by explicit backward reasoning with task-specific goals through an action-level Chain-of-Thought (CoT) process. This process is unified within a single autoregressive structure: (1) the first token corresponds to a stable keyframe action that encodes the task-specific goals; and (2) subsequent action tokens are generated autoregressively, conditioned on the initial keyframe and previously predicted actions. This backward action reasoning enforces a global-to-local structure, allowing each local action to be tightly constrained by the final goal. To further realize the action reasoning structure, CoA incorporates four complementary designs: continuous action token representation; dynamic stopping for variable-length trajectory generation; reverse temporal ensemble; and multi-token prediction to balance action chunk modeling with global structure. As a result, CoA gives strong spatial generalization capabilities while preserving the flexibility and simplicity of a visuo-motor policy. Empirically, we observe CoA achieves the state-of-the-art performance across 60 RLBench tasks and 8 real-world manipulation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Swept Volume-Based Trajectory Generation for Arbitrary-Shaped Ground Robot Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07554v2)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Navigating an arbitrary-shaped ground robot safely in cluttered environments remains a challenging problem. The existing trajectory planners that account for the robot's physical geometry severely suffer from the intractable runtime. To achieve both computational efficiency and Continuous Collision Avoidance (CCA) of arbitrary-shaped ground robot planning, we proposed a novel coarse-to-fine navigation framework that significantly accelerates planning. In the first stage, a sampling-based method selectively generates distinct topological paths that guarantee a minimum inflated margin. In the second stage, a geometry-aware front-end strategy is designed to discretize these topologies into full-state robot motion sequences while concurrently partitioning the paths into SE(2) sub-problems and simpler R2 sub-problems for back-end optimization. In the final stage, an SVSDF-based optimizer generates trajectories tailored to these sub-problems and seamlessly splices them into a continuous final motion plan. Extensive benchmark comparisons show that the proposed method is one to several orders of magnitude faster than the cutting-edge methods in runtime while maintaining a high planning success rate and ensuring CCA.</p></details> |  |
| **[Q-Regularized Generative Auto-Bidding: From Suboptimal Trajectories to Optimal Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02754v1)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of e-commerce, auto-bidding has become a key asset in optimizing advertising performance under diverse advertiser environments. The current approaches focus on reinforcement learning (RL) and generative models. These efforts imitate offline historical behaviors by utilizing a complex structure with expensive hyperparameter tuning. The suboptimal trajectories further exacerbate the difficulty of policy learning. To address these challenges, we proposes QGA, a novel Q-value regularized Generative Auto-bidding method. In QGA, we propose to plug a Q-value regularization with double Q-learning strategy into the Decision Transformer backbone. This design enables joint optimization of policy imitation and action-value maximization, allowing the learned bidding policy to both leverage experience from the dataset and alleviate the adverse impact of the suboptimal trajectories. Furthermore, to safely explore the policy space beyond the data distribution, we propose a Q-value guided dual-exploration mechanism, in which the DT model is conditioned on multiple return-to-go targets and locally perturbed actions. This entire exploration process is dynamically guided by the aforementioned Q-value module, which provides principled evaluation for each candidate action. Experiments on public benchmarks and simulation environments demonstrate that QGA consistently achieves superior or highly competitive results compared to existing alternatives. Notably, in large-scale real-world A/B testing, QGA achieves a 3.27% increase in Ad GMV and a 2.49% improvement in Ad ROI.</p></details> | <details><summary>11pag...</summary><p>11pages, 5figures, In Proceedings of the 32nd ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining</p></details> |

As a result, tracking aggressive trajectories accurately could be challenging due to the existence of residual physics during controller synthesis. This paper presents a self-supervised residual learning and trajectory optimization framework to address the aforementioned challenges. At first, unknown dynamic effects on the closed-loop model are learned and treated as residuals of the nominal dynamics, jointly forming a hybrid model. We show that learning with analytic gradients can be achieved using only trajectory-level data while enjoying accurate long-horizon prediction with an arbitrary integration step size. Subsequently, a trajectory optimizer is developed to compute the optimal reference trajectory with the residual physics along it minimized. It ends up with trajectories that are friendly to the following control level. The agile flight of quadrotors illustrates that by utilizing the hybrid dynamics, the proposed optimizer outputs aggressive motions that can be precisely tracked.</p></details> | 10 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Automated Model Tuning for Multifidelity Uncertainty Propagation in Trajectory Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16007v2)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multifidelity uncertainty propagation combines the efficiency of low-fidelity models with the accuracy of a high-fidelity model to construct statistical estimators of quantities of interest. It is well known that the effectiveness of such methods depends crucially on the relative correlations and computational costs of the available computational models. However, the question of how to automatically tune low-fidelity models to maximize performance remains an open area of research. This work investigates automated model tuning, which optimizes model hyperparameters to minimize estimator variance within a target computational budget. Focusing on multifidelity trajectory simulation estimators, the cost-versus-precision tradeoff enabled by this approach is demonstrated in a practical, online setting where upfront tuning costs cannot be amortized. Using a real-world entry, descent, and landing example, it is shown that automated model tuning largely outperforms hand-tuned models even when the overall computational budget is relatively low. Furthermore, for scenarios where the computational budget is large, model tuning solutions can approach the best-case multifidelity estimator performance where optimal model hyperparameters are known a priori. Recommendations for applying model tuning in practice are provided and avenues for enabling adoption of such approaches for budget-constrained problems are highlighted.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages with 15 figures in main text</p></details> |

A recurring practical issue is that standard mini-batch training can be unstable when trajectory lengths are highly heterogeneous, which in turn degrades \emph{distribution matching} for trajectory-derived statistics. We propose \textbf{length-aware sampling (LAS)}, a simple batching strategy that groups trajectories by length and samples batches from a single length bucket, reducing within-batch length heterogeneity (and making updates more consistent) without changing the model class. We integrate LAS into a conditional trajectory GAN with auxiliary time-alignment losses and provide (i) a distribution-level guarantee for derived variables under mild boundedness assumptions, and (ii) an IPM/Wasserstein mechanism explaining why LAS improves distribution matching by removing length-only shortcut critics and targeting within-bucket discrepancies. Empirically, LAS consistently improves matching of derived-variable distributions on a multi-mall dataset of shopper trajectories and on diverse public sequence datasets (GPS, education, e-commerce, and movies), outperforming random sampling across dataset-specific metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Classification Network Guided Trajectory Planning for Four-Wheel Independent Steering Autonomous Parking Considering Obstacle Attributes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18836v2)** | 2026-01-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Four-wheel Independent Steering (4WIS) vehicles have attracted increasing attention for their superior maneuverability. Human drivers typically choose to cross or drive over the low-profile obstacles (e.g., plastic bags) to efficiently navigate through narrow spaces, while existing planners neglect obstacle attributes, leading to suboptimal efficiency or planning failures. To address this issue, we propose a novel multimodal trajectory planning framework that employs a neural network for scene perception, combines 4WIS hybrid A* search to generate a warm start, and utilizes an optimal control problem (OCP) for trajectory optimization. Specifically, a multimodal perception network fusing visual information and vehicle states is employed to capture semantic and contextual scene understanding, enabling the planner to adapt the strategy according to scene complexity (hard or easy task). For hard tasks, guided points are introduced to decompose complex tasks into local subtasks, improving the search efficiency. The multiple steering modes of 4WIS vehicles, Ackermann, diagonal, and zero-turn, are also incorporated as kinematically feasible motion primitives. Moreover, a hierarchical obstacle handling strategy, which categorizes obstacles as "non-traversable", "crossable", and "drive-over", is incorporated into the node expansion process, explicitly linking obstacle attributes to planning actions to enable efficient decisions. Furthermore, to address dynamic obstacles with motion uncertainty, we introduce a probabilistic risk field model, constructing risk-aware driving corridors that serve as linear collision constraints in OCP. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed framework's effectiveness in generating safe, efficient, and smooth trajectories for 4WIS vehicles, especially in constrained environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sample-Efficient Online Learning in LM Agents via Hindsight Trajectory Rewriting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10304v2)** | 2026-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language model (LM) agents deployed in novel environments often exhibit poor sample efficiency when learning from sequential interactions. This significantly hinders the usefulness of such agents in environments where interaction is costly (for example, when they interact with humans or reset physical systems). While a number of existing LM agent architectures incorporate various mechanisms for experience storage and reflection, they make limited use of LMs' abilities to directly generate or reason about full counterfactual trajectories. We introduce ECHO (Experience Consolidation via Hindsight Optimization), a prompting framework that adapts hindsight experience replay from reinforcement learning for language model agents. ECHO generates optimized trajectories for alternative goals that could have been achieved during failed attempts, effectively creating synthetic positive examples from unsuccessful interactions. Our approach consists of two components: a hindsight rule that uses the language model itself to identify relevant subgoals and generate optimized trajectories, and an update rule that maintains compressed trajectory representations in memory. We evaluate ECHO on stateful versions of XMiniGrid, a text-based navigation and planning benchmark, and PeopleJoinQA, a collaborative information-gathering enterprise simulation. Across both domains, ECHO outperforms vanilla language agent baselines by up to 80%; in XMiniGrid, it also outperforms a number of sophisticated agent architectures including Reflexion and AWM, demonstrating faster adaptation to novel environments through more effective utilization of past experiences.</p></details> |  |

Existing anomaly detection methods are ill-suited for this challenge: mean-pooling embeddings dilutes anomalous steps, while contrastive-only approaches ignore sequential structure. Standard unsupervised methods on pre-trained embeddings achieve F1-scores no higher than 0.69. We introduce Trajectory Guard, a Siamese Recurrent Autoencoder with a hybrid loss function that jointly learns task-trajectory alignment via contrastive learning and sequential validity via reconstruction. This dual objective enables unified detection of both "wrong plan for this task" and "malformed plan structure." On benchmarks spanning synthetic perturbations and real-world failures from security audits (RAS-Eval) and multi-agent systems (Who\&When), we achieve F1-scores of 0.88-0.94 on balanced sets and recall of 0.86-0.92 on imbalanced external benchmarks. At 32 ms inference latency, our approach runs 17-27$\times$ faster than LLM Judge baselines, enabling real-time safety verification in production deployments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI Trustagent 2026</p></details> |

Many existing distribution-matching approaches struggle in this regime because they impose strict support constraints and rely on brittle one-step models, making it hard to extract useful signal from imperfect data. To tackle this challenge, we propose TGE, a trajectory-level generative embedding for offline LfO that constructs a dense, smooth surrogate reward by estimating expert state density in the latent space of a temporal diffusion model trained on offline trajectory data. By leveraging the smooth geometry of the learned diffusion embedding, TGE captures long-horizon temporal dynamics and effectively bridges the gap between disjoint supports, ensuring a robust learning signal even when offline data is distributionally distinct from the expert. Empirically, the proposed approach consistently matches or outperforms prior offline LfO methods across a range of D4RL locomotion and manipulation benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 6 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

In this study, we propose a model-free clustering framework that groups baskets based on transition probabilities derived from the trajectories of treatment response, rather than relying solely on a single efficacy endpoint such as the objective response rate. The number of clusters is not predetermined but is automatically determined in a data-driven manner based on the similarity structure among baskets. After clustering, baskets within the same cluster are analyzed using a hierarchical Bayesian model. This framework aims to improve the estimation precision of efficacy endpoints and enhance statistical power while maintaining the type~I error rate at the nominal level. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated through simulation studies. The results demonstrated that the proposed method can accurately identify cluster structures in heterogeneous settings and, even under such conditions, maintain the type~I error rate at the nominal level while improving statistical power.</p></details> |  |

Traditional modular pipelines separate perception, prediction, and planning, while recent end-to-end (E2E) systems learn them jointly. Vision-language models (VLMs) further enrich this paradigm by introducing cross-modal priors and commonsense reasoning, yet current VLM-based planners face three key challenges: (i) a mismatch between discrete text reasoning and continuous control, (ii) high latency from autoregressive chain-of-thought decoding, and (iii) inefficient or non-causal planners that limit real-time deployment. We propose ColaVLA, a unified vision-language-action framework that transfers reasoning from text to a unified latent space and couples it with a hierarchical, parallel trajectory decoder. The Cognitive Latent Reasoner compresses scene understanding into compact, decision-oriented meta-action embeddings through ego-adaptive selection and only two VLM forward passes. The Hierarchical Parallel Planner then generates multi-scale, causality-consistent trajectories in a single forward pass. Together, these components preserve the generalization and interpretability of VLMs while enabling efficient, accurate and safe trajectory generation. Experiments on the nuScenes benchmark show that ColaVLA achieves state-of-the-art performance in both open-loop and closed-loop settings with favorable efficiency and robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 4 figures.

In this paper, we enhance high-frequency features of GEO targets while suppressing background noise at the single-frame level through wavelet transform. Building on this, we propose a multi-frame temporal trajectory completion scheme centered on the Hungarian algorithm for globally optimal cross-frame matching. To effectively mitigate missing and false detections, a series of key steps including temporal matching and interpolation completion, temporal-consistency-based noise filtering, and progressive trajectory refinement are designed in the post-processing pipeline. Experimental results on the public SpotGEO dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving an F_1 score of 90.14%.</p></details> |  |

Taking a historically informed outlook on the future, we treated successive OpenAI models as an evolving lineage and compared them with humans in a gambling task with repeated happiness ratings. Computational analyses showed that some aspects became more human-like: newer models took more risks and displayed more human-like patterns of Pavlovian approach and avoidance. At the same time, distinctly non-human signatures emerged: loss aversion dropped below neutral levels, choices became more deterministic than in humans, affective decay increased across versions and exceeded human levels, and baseline mood remained chronically higher than in humans. These "developmental" trajectories reveal an emerging psychology of machines and have direct implications for AI ethics and for thinking about how LLMs might be integrated into clinical decision support and other high-stakes domains.</p></details> |  |

In the one-shot setting, the agent generates a policy after observing a single expert demonstration without additional fine-tuning. Existing approaches typically train and evaluate on the same set of tasks, varying only object configurations, and struggle to generalize to unseen tasks with different semantic or structural requirements. While some recent methods attempt to address this, they exhibit low success rates on hard test tasks that, despite being visually similar to some training tasks, differ in context and require distinct responses. Additionally, most existing methods lack an explicit model of environment dynamics, limiting their ability to reason about future states. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework for one-shot visual imitation learning via world-model-guided trajectory generation. Given an expert demonstration video and the agent's initial observation, our method leverages a learned world model to predict a sequence of latent states and actions. This latent trajectory is then decoded into physical waypoints that guide the agent's execution. Our method is evaluated on two simulated benchmarks and three real-world robotic platforms, where it consistently outperforms prior approaches, with over 30% improvement in some cases.

However, conventional control algorithms for trajectory tracking often exhibit limited performance due to the underactuated, nonlinear, and highly coupled dynamics of quadrotor systems. To address these challenges, we propose HBO-PID, a novel control algorithm that integrates the Heteroscedastic Bayesian Optimization (HBO) framework with the classical PID controller to achieve accurate and robust trajectory tracking. By explicitly modeling input-dependent noise variance, the proposed method can better adapt to dynamic and complex environments, and therefore improve the accuracy and robustness of trajectory tracking. To accelerate the convergence of optimization, we adopt a two-stage optimization strategy that allow us to more efficiently find the optimal controller parameters. Through experiments in both simulation and real-world scenarios, we demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Compared to SOTA methods, it improves the position accuracy by 24.7% to 42.9%, and the angular accuracy by 40.9% to 78.4%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IROS 2025 (2025 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems)</p></details> |

Existing methods mainly rely on historical spatiotemporal trajectory data to train sequence models that directly forecast future locations. However, they often overlook the importance of the future spatiotemporal contexts, which are highly informative for the future locations. For example, knowing how much time and distance a user will travel could serve as a critical clue for predicting the user's next location. Against this background, we propose \textbf{STRelay}, a universal \textbf{\underline{S}}patio\textbf{\underline{T}}emporal \textbf{\underline{Relay}}ing framework explicitly modeling the future spatiotemporal context given a human trajectory, to boost the performance of different location prediction models. Specifically, STRelay models future spatiotemporal contexts in a relaying manner, which is subsequently integrated with the encoded historical representation from a base location prediction model, enabling multi-task learning by simultaneously predicting the next time interval, next moving distance interval, and finally the next location. We evaluate STRelay integrated with five state-of-the-art location prediction base models on four real-world trajectory datasets. Results demonstrate that STRelay consistently improves prediction performance across all cases by 2.49\%-11.30\%. Additionally, we find that the future spatiotemporal contexts are particularly helpful for entertainment-related locations and also for user groups who prefer traveling longer distances. The performance gain on such non-daily-routine activities, which often suffer from higher uncertainty, is indeed complementary to the base location prediction models that often excel at modeling regular daily routine patterns.</p></details> |  |
| **[SURE Guided Posterior Sampling: Trajectory Correction for Diffusion-Based Inverse Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23232v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have emerged as powerful learned priors for solving inverse problems. However, current iterative solving approaches which alternate between diffusion sampling and data consistency steps typically require hundreds or thousands of steps to achieve high quality reconstruction due to accumulated errors. We address this challenge with SURE Guided Posterior Sampling (SGPS), a method that corrects sampling trajectory deviations using Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimate (SURE) gradient updates and PCA based noise estimation. By mitigating noise induced errors during the critical early and middle sampling stages, SGPS enables more accurate posterior sampling and reduces error accumulation. This allows our method to maintain high reconstruction quality with fewer than 100 Neural Function Evaluations (NFEs). Our extensive evaluation across diverse inverse problems demonstrates that SGPS consistently outperforms existing methods at low NFE counts.</p></details> |  |

While repair-based methods fail to restore complex artifacts and LiDAR-based approaches rely on sparse and incomplete cues, ReCamDriving leverages dense and scene-complete 3DGS renderings for explicit geometric guidance, achieving precise camera-controllable generation. To mitigate overfitting to restoration behaviors when conditioned on 3DGS renderings, ReCamDriving adopts a two-stage training paradigm: the first stage uses camera poses for coarse control, while the second stage incorporates 3DGS renderings for fine-grained viewpoint and geometric guidance. Furthermore, we present a 3DGS-based cross-trajectory data curation strategy to eliminate the train-test gap in camera transformation patterns, enabling scalable multi-trajectory supervision from monocular videos. Based on this strategy, we construct the ParaDrive dataset, containing over 110K parallel-trajectory video pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReCamDriving achieves state-of-the-art camera controllability and structural consistency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://recamdriving.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Accelerating Diffusion Planners in Offline RL via Reward-Aware Consistency Trajectory Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07822v2)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although diffusion models have achieved strong results in decision-making tasks, their slow inference speed remains a key limitation. While consistency models offer a potential solution, existing applications to decision-making either struggle with suboptimal demonstrations under behavior cloning or rely on complex concurrent training of multiple networks under the actor-critic framework. In this work, we propose a novel approach to consistency distillation for offline reinforcement learning that directly incorporates reward optimization into the distillation process. Our method achieves single-step sampling while generating higher-reward action trajectories through decoupled training and noise-free reward signals. Empirical evaluations on the Gym MuJoCo, FrankaKitchen, and long horizon planning benchmarks demonstrate that our approach can achieve a 9.7% improvement over previous state-of-the-art while offering up to 142x speedup over diffusion counterparts in inference time.</p></details> |  |

While experimental techniques like spatial transcriptomics now enable high-resolution mapping of tissue organization across space and time, current methods that model cellular evolution operate at the single-cell level, overlooking the coordinated development of cellular states in a tissue. We introduce NicheFlow, a flow-based generative model that infers the temporal trajectory of cellular microenvironments across sequential spatial slides. By representing local cell neighborhoods as point clouds, NicheFlow jointly models the evolution of cell states and spatial coordinates using optimal transport and Variational Flow Matching. Our approach successfully recovers both global spatial architecture and local microenvironment composition across diverse spatiotemporal datasets, from embryonic to brain development.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages, 15 figures, to appear in NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

We investigate oblivious load-balancing schemes for a $N\times N$ torus network under sparse traffic where there are at most $k$ active source-destination pairs. We are motivated by the problem of load-balancing in large-scale LEO satellite networks, which can be modelled as a torus, where the traffic is known to be sparse and localized to certain hotspot areas. We formulate the problem as a linear program and show that no oblivious routing scheme can achieve a worst-case load lower than approximately $\frac{\sqrt{2k}}{4}$ when $1<k \leq N^2/2$ and $\frac{N}{4}$ when $N^2/2\leq k\leq N^2$. Moreover, we demonstrate that the celebrated Valiant Load Balancing scheme is suboptimal under sparse traffic and construct an optimal oblivious load-balancing scheme that achieves the lower bound. Further, we discover a $\sqrt{2}$ multiplicative gap between the worst-case load of a non-oblivious routing and the worst-case load of any oblivious routing. The results can also be extended to general $N\times M$ tori with unequal link capacities along the vertical and horizontal directions.</p></details> | <details><summary>To Ap...</summary><p>To Appear in IEEE INFOCOM 2026</p></details> |
| **[Strategies for Span Labeling with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16946v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for text analysis tasks, such as named entity recognition or error detection. Unlike encoder-based models, however, generative architectures lack an explicit mechanism to refer to specific parts of their input. This leads to a variety of ad-hoc prompting strategies for span labeling, often with inconsistent results. In this paper, we categorize these strategies into three families: tagging the input text, indexing numerical positions of spans, and matching span content. To address the limitations of content matching, we introduce LogitMatch, a new constrained decoding method that forces the model's output to align with valid input spans. We evaluate all methods across four diverse tasks. We find that while tagging remains a robust baseline, LogitMatch improves upon competitive matching-based methods by eliminating span matching issues and outperforms other strategies in some setups.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating Large Vision-language Models for Surgical Tool Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16895v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Surgery is a highly complex process, and artificial intelligence has emerged as a transformative force in supporting surgical guidance and decision-making. However, the unimodal nature of most current AI systems limits their ability to achieve a holistic understanding of surgical workflows. This highlights the need for general-purpose surgical AI systems capable of comprehensively modeling the interrelated components of surgical scenes. Recent advances in large vision-language models that integrate multimodal data processing offer strong potential for modeling surgical tasks and providing human-like scene reasoning and understanding. Despite their promise, systematic investigations of VLMs in surgical applications remain limited. In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of large VLMs for the fundamental surgical vision task of detecting surgical tools. Specifically, we investigate three state-of-the-art VLMs, Qwen2.5, LLaVA1.5, and InternVL3.5, on the GraSP robotic surgery dataset under both zero-shot and parameter-efficient LoRA fine-tuning settings. Our results demonstrate that Qwen2.5 consistently achieves superior detection performance in both configurations among the evaluated VLMs. Furthermore, compared with the open-set detection baseline Grounding DINO, Qwen2.5 exhibits stronger zero-shot generalization and comparable fine-tuned performance. Notably, Qwen2.5 shows superior instrument recognition, while Grounding DINO demonstrates stronger localization.</p></details> |  |

Recent advancements in Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (VGGT) models have shown great promise in camera pose estimation and 3D reconstruction. However, these models typically rely on ground truth labels for training, posing challenges when adapting to unlabeled and unseen scenes. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised framework to train VGGT with unlabeled data, thereby enhancing its localization capability in large-scale environments. To achieve this, we extend conventional pair-wise relations to sequence-wise geometric constraints for self-supervised learning. Specifically, in each sequence, we sample multiple source frames and geometrically project them onto different target frames, which improves temporal feature consistency. We formulate physical photometric consistency and geometric constraints as a joint optimization loss to circumvent the requirement for hard labels. By training the model with this proposed method, not only the local and global cross-view attention layers but also the camera and depth heads can effectively capture the underlying multi-view geometry. Experiments demonstrate that the model converges within hundreds of iterations and achieves significant improvements in large-scale localization. Our code will be released at https://github.com/X-yangfan/GPA-VGGT.</p></details> |  |
| **[Assessing the Feasibility of Selective Instrumentation for Runtime Code Coverage in Large C++ Game Engines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16881v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code coverage is a valuable guide for testing, but in AAA games the overhead of instrumentation conflicts with strict performance requirements and can destabilize automated tests. We propose and assess a selective instrumentation approach tailored to large game engines written in \texttt{C++}, which reduces the scope of instrumentation while preserving relevant coverage data to developer commits. Our framework integrates into an industrial game testing pipeline, enabling developers to receive immediate coverage feedback on tests run against their changes. The compilation overhead of our approach is minimal, allowing instrumentation of over 2,000 commits before doubling build time. In performance evaluations, even the worst-case scenario maintains frame rates above 50\% of the non-instrumented baseline. Across two production test suites maintained by our industry partner, our framework caused no automated test failures, avoiding the instability observed under full instrumentation. Our work shows that commit-level or build-level coverage of large \texttt{C++} game engines can be achieved with minimal overhead and without compromising test stability.</p></details> |  |

Disentangling fluid and crystallized intelligence of large language models using chess](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16823v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities, yet it remains unclear to what extent these reflect sophisticated recall (crystallized intelligence) or reasoning ability (fluid intelligence). We introduce chess as a controlled testbed for disentangling these faculties. Leveraging the game's structure and scalable engine evaluations, we construct a taxonomy of positions varying in training corpus proximity--ranging from common states solvable by memorization to novel ones requiring first-principles reasoning. We systematically evaluate multiple GPT generations under varying reasoning intensities. Our analysis reveals a clear gradient: performance consistently degrades as fluid intelligence demands increase. Notably, in out-of-distribution tasks, performance collapses to random levels. While newer models improve, progress slows significantly for tasks outside the training distribution. Furthermore, while reasoning-augmented inference improves performance, its marginal benefit per token decreases with distributional proximity. These results suggest current architectures remain limited in systematic generalization, highlighting the need for mechanisms beyond scale to achieve robust fluid intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Curse of Depth in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05795v4)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce the Curse of Depth, a concept that highlights, explains, and addresses the recent observation in modern Large Language Models (LLMs) where nearly half of the layers are less effective than expected. We first confirm the wide existence of this phenomenon across the most popular families of LLMs such as Llama, Mistral, DeepSeek, and Qwen. Our analysis, theoretically and empirically, identifies that the underlying reason for the ineffectiveness of deep layers in LLMs is the widespread usage of Pre-Layer Normalization (Pre-LN). While Pre-LN stabilizes the training of Transformer LLMs, its output variance exponentially grows with the model depth, which undesirably causes the derivative of the deep Transformer blocks to be an identity matrix, and therefore barely contributes to the training. To resolve this training pitfall, we propose LayerNorm Scaling (LNS), which scales the variance of output of the layer normalization inversely by the square root of its depth. This simple modification mitigates the output variance explosion of deeper Transformer layers, improving their contribution. Across a wide range of model sizes (130M to 7B), our experiments show that LNS consistently outperforms previous normalization and scaling techniques in enhancing LLM pre-training performance. Moreover, this improvement seamlessly carries over to supervised fine-tuning. All these gains can be attributed to the fact that LayerNorm Scaling enables deeper layers to contribute more effectively during training. Our code is available at \href{https://github.com/lmsdss/LayerNorm-Scaling}{LayerNorm-Scaling}.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Faster and Memory-Efficient Training of Sequential Recommendation Models for Large Catalogs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09682v5)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential recommendations (SR) with transformer-based architectures are widely adopted in real-world applications, where SR models require frequent retraining to adapt to ever-changing user preferences. However, training transformer-based SR models often encounters a high computational cost associated with scoring extensive item catalogs, often exceeding thousands of items. This occurs mainly due to the use of cross-entropy loss, where peak memory scales proportionally to catalog size, batch size, and sequence length. Recognizing this, practitioners in the field of recommendation systems typically address memory consumption by integrating the cross-entropy (CE) loss with negative sampling, thereby reducing the explicit memory demands of the final layer. However, a small number of negative samples would degrade model performance, and as we demonstrate in our work, increasing the number of negative samples and the batch size further improves the model's performance, but rapidly starts to exceed industrial GPUs' size (~40Gb). In this work, we introduce the CCE- method, which offers a GPU-efficient implementation of the CE loss with negative sampling. Our method accelerates training by up to two times while reducing memory consumption by more than 10 times. Leveraging the memory savings afforded by using CCE- for model training, it becomes feasible to enhance its accuracy on datasets with a large item catalog compared to those trained with original PyTorch-implemented loss functions. Finally, we perform an analysis of key memory-related hyperparameters and highlight the necessity of a delicate balance among these factors. We demonstrate that scaling both the number of negative samples and batch size leads to better results rather than maximizing only one of them. To facilitate further adoption of CCE-, we release a Triton kernel that efficiently implements the proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Standardizing Longitudinal Radiology Report Evaluation via Large Language Model Annotation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16753v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Longitudinal information in radiology reports refers to the sequential tracking of findings across multiple examinations over time, which is crucial for monitoring disease progression and guiding clinical decisions. Many recent automated radiology report generation methods are designed to capture longitudinal information; however, validating their performance is challenging. There is no proper tool to consistently label temporal changes in both ground-truth and model-generated texts for meaningful comparisons. Existing annotation methods are typically labor-intensive, relying on the use of manual lexicons and rules. Complex rules are closed-source, domain specific and hard to adapt, whereas overly simple ones tend to miss essential specialised information. Large language models (LLMs) offer a promising annotation alternative, as they are capable of capturing nuanced linguistic patterns and semantic similarities without extensive manual intervention. They also adapt well to new contexts. In this study, we therefore propose an LLM-based pipeline to automatically annotate longitudinal information in radiology reports. The pipeline first identifies sentences containing relevant information and then extracts the progression of diseases. We evaluate and compare five mainstream LLMs on these two tasks using 500 manually annotated reports. Considering both efficiency and performance, Qwen2.5-32B was subsequently selected and used to annotate another 95,169 reports from the public MIMIC-CXR dataset. Our Qwen2.5-32B-annotated dataset provided us with a standardized benchmark for evaluating report generation models. Using this new benchmark, we assessed seven state-of-the-art report generation models. Our LLM-based annotation method outperforms existing annotation solutions, achieving 11.3\% and 5.3\% higher F1-scores for longitudinal information detection and disease tracking, respectively.</p></details> |  |

While some existing real-world datasets incorporate both vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure interactions, they are typically limited to a single intersection or a single vehicle. A comprehensive perception dataset featuring multiple connected vehicles and infrastructure sensors across several intersections remains unavailable, limiting the benchmarking of algorithms in diverse traffic environments. Consequently, overfitting can occur, and models may demonstrate misleadingly high performance due to similar intersection layouts and traffic participant behavior. To address this gap, we introduce UrbanIng-V2X, the first large-scale, multi-modal dataset supporting cooperative perception involving vehicles and infrastructure sensors deployed across three urban intersections in Ingolstadt, Germany. UrbanIng-V2X consists of 34 temporally aligned and spatially calibrated sensor sequences, each lasting 20 seconds. All sequences contain recordings from one of three intersections, involving two vehicles and up to three infrastructure-mounted sensor poles operating in coordinated scenarios. In total, UrbanIng-V2X provides data from 12 vehicle-mounted RGB cameras, 2 vehicle LiDARs, 17 infrastructure thermal cameras, and 12 infrastructure LiDARs. All sequences are annotated at a frequency of 10 Hz with 3D bounding boxes spanning 13 object classes, resulting in approximately 712k annotated instances across the dataset. We provide comprehensive evaluations using state-of-the-art cooperative perception methods and publicly release the codebase, dataset, HD map, and a digital twin of the complete data collection environment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025.

| **[Who Does This Name Remind You of ? Nationality Prediction via Large Language Model Associative Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12771v2)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) possess extensive world knowledge, yet methods for effectively eliciting this knowledge remain underexplored. Nationality and region prediction tasks require understanding of not only linguistic features but also cultural and historical background, making LLM world knowledge particularly valuable. However, conventional LLM prompting methods rely on direct reasoning approaches, which have limitations in applying abstract linguistic rules. We propose LLM Associative Memory Agents (LAMA), a novel framework that leverages LLM world knowledge as associative memory. Rather than directly inferring nationality from names, LAMA recalls famous individuals with the same name and aggregates their nationalities through indirect reasoning. A dual-agent architecture comprising a Person Agent and a Media Agent, specialized in different knowledge domains, recalls famous individuals in parallel, generating Top-1 predictions through voting and Top-K predictions through conditional completion. On a 99-country nationality prediction task, LAMA achieved 0.817 accuracy, substantially outperforming conventional LLM prompting methods and neural models. Our experiments reveal that LLMs exhibit higher reliability in recalling concrete examples than in abstract reasoning, that recall-based approaches are robust to low-frequency nationalities independent of data frequency distributions, and that the dual-agent architecture functions complementarily to produce synergistic effects. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of a new multi-agent system that retrieves and aggregates LLM knowledge rather than prompting reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[AuroraEdge-V-2B: A Faster And Stronger Edge Visual Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16615v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, due to the advancement of multimodal technology, people are attempting to use visual large language models (VLLMs) in industrial production. Many deep learning models (DLMs) deployed in the production environment are gradually being replaced by VLLMs. Compared with DLMs, VLLMs have some advantages in industrial applications: (1) Their strong generalization ability enables them to perform well across a wide range of tasks. (2) They are flexible and can deal with unfamiliar samples through context learning quickly. However, VLLMs also have obvious drawbacks: (1) VLLMs do not perform as well as custom-developed DLMs in specific domains. (2) The number of parameters in VLLMs is generally quite large, and their deployment requires substantial computational resources. (3) VLLMs generally operate much slower than DLMs, making real-time response challenging to achieve. To better utilize VLLMs in industrial applications, we introduce AuroraEdge-V-2B in this work, a compact, robust, and high-speed VLLM designed for edge deployment. To make the model run faster, we also propose a compression-fusion method to improve inference efficiency. AuroraEdge-V-2B has the following notable features: (1) Easy deployment and faster: It has only 2B parameters and is highly suitable for edge deployment, offering better real-time performance. (2) Fewer visual tokens and cheaper: It significantly reduces the number of visual tokens in the decoding process, thereby reducing the floating-point operations by half during inference and making it cheaper to use. (3) Strong performance: It gets a higher score on 9 benchmarks than models with the same number of parameter (e.g., Qwen2-VL-2B, Qwen2.5-VL-3B, InternVL-2.5-2B).</p></details> |  |
| **[Predicting Startup Success Using Large Language Models: A Novel In-Context Learning Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16568v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Venture capital (VC) investments in early-stage startups that end up being successful can yield high returns. However, predicting early-stage startup success remains challenging due to data scarcity (e.g., many VC firms have information about only a few dozen of early-stage startups and whether they were successful). This limits the effectiveness of traditional machine learning methods that rely on large labeled datasets for model training. To address this challenge, we propose an in-context learning framework for startup success prediction using large language models (LLMs) that requires no model training and leverages only a small set of labeled startups as demonstration examples. Specifically, we propose a novel k-nearest-neighbor-based in-context learning framework, called kNN-ICL, which selects the most relevant past startups as examples based on similarity. Using real-world profiles from Crunchbase, we find that the kNN-ICL approach achieves higher prediction accuracy than supervised machine learning baselines and vanilla in-context learning. Further, we study how performance varies with the number of in-context examples and find that a high balanced accuracy can be achieved with as few as 50 examples. Together, we demonstrate that in-context learning can serve as a decision-making tool for VC firms operating in data-scarce environments.</p></details> |  |

While recent vision-language large models demonstrate strong reasoning abilities, they often underperform task-specific panoramic small models in VLN tasks. To address this, we propose CLASH (Collaborative Large-Small Hierarchy), a VLN-CE framework that integrates a reactive small-model planner (RSMP) with a reflective large-model reasoner (RLMR). RSMP adopts a causal-learning-based dual-branch architecture to enhance generalization, while RLMR leverages panoramic visual prompting with chain-of-thought reasoning to support interpretable spatial understanding and navigation. We further introduce an uncertainty-aware collaboration mechanism (UCM) that adaptively fuses decisions from both models. For obstacle avoidance, in simulation, we replace the rule-based controller with a fully learnable point-goal policy, and in real-world deployment, we design a LiDAR-based clustering module for generating navigable waypoints and pair it with an online SLAM-based local controller. CLASH achieves state-of-the-art (SoTA) results (ranking 1-st) on the VLN-CE leaderboard, significantly improving SR and SPL on the test-unseen set over the previous SoTA methods. Real-world experiments demonstrate CLASH's strong robustness, validating its effectiveness in both simulation and deployment scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Existing parameter regularization methods (e.g., O-LoRA, N-LoRA) mitigate interference via low-rank subspace orthogonality, but additive updates distort the intrinsic geometry of model parameters. We propose \textbf{OLieRA}, a Lie group based fine-tuning framework that preserves parameter geometry through multiplicative updates while enforcing orthogonality across task subspaces. OLieRA achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Standard CL benchmark and remains highly competitive under large task sequences. It further inherits the replay-free and task-ID free inference properties of O-LoRA, establishing a principled paradigm for continual learning in LLMs.</p></details> | 13 pages, 3 figures |

However, most existing methods overlook the importance of the ability to continuously work in an ever-changing world, and lack the possibility of deployment on embodied systems in real-world environments. In this work, we introduce OnlineSI, a framework that can continuously improve its spatial understanding of its surroundings given a video stream. Our core idea is to maintain a finite spatial memory to retain past observations, ensuring the computation required for each inference does not increase as the input accumulates. We further integrate 3D point cloud information with semantic information, helping MLLM to better locate and identify objects in the scene. To evaluate our method, we introduce the Fuzzy $F_1$-Score to mitigate ambiguity, and test our method on two representative datasets. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, paving the way towards real-world embodied systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://onlinesi.github.io/</p></details> |

We introduce SycoEval-EM, a multi-agent simulation framework evaluating LLM robustness through adversarial patient persuasion in emergency medicine. Across 20 LLMs and 1,875 encounters spanning three Choosing Wisely scenarios, acquiescence rates ranged from 0-100\%. Models showed higher vulnerability to imaging requests (38.8\%) than opioid prescriptions (25.0\%), with model capability poorly predicting robustness. All persuasion tactics proved equally effective (30.0-36.0\%), indicating general susceptibility rather than tactic-specific weakness. Our findings demonstrate that static benchmarks inadequately predict safety under social pressure, necessitating multi-turn adversarial testing for clinical AI certification.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |

In this paper, we present a large-scale measurement study of the Starlink network, the largest LEO satellite constellation to date. We first propose an efficient method for discovering active Starlink user routers, identifying approximately 5.98 million IPv6 addresses across 208 regions in 165 countries. Compared to general-purpose IPv6 target generation algorithms, our router-centric approach achieves near-complete coverage and, to the best of our knowledge, yields the most comprehensive known set of active IPv6 addresses for Starlink user routers. Based on the discovered user routers, we further propose an efficient method for mapping the Starlink backbone network and uncover a topology consisting of 49 Points of Presence (PoPs) interconnected by 98 links. We conduct a detailed statistical analysis of active Starlink user routers and PoPs, and further characterize the IPv6 address assignment strategy adopted by the Starlink network.

| **[Unlocking Scaling Law in Industrial Recommendation Systems with a Three-step Paradigm based Large User Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08309v2)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in autoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant milestones, largely attributed to their scalability, often referred to as the "scaling law". Inspired by these achievements, there has been a growing interest in adapting LLMs for Recommendation Systems (RecSys) by reformulating RecSys tasks into generative problems. However, these End-to-End Generative Recommendation (E2E-GR) methods tend to prioritize idealized goals, often at the expense of the practical advantages offered by traditional Deep Learning based Recommendation Models (DLRMs) in terms of in features, architecture, and practices. This disparity between idealized goals and practical needs introduces several challenges and limitations, locking the scaling law in industrial RecSys. In this paper, we introduce a large user model (LUM) that addresses these limitations through a three-step paradigm, designed to meet the stringent requirements of industrial settings while unlocking the potential for scalable recommendations. Our extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that LUM outperforms both state-of-the-art DLRMs and E2E-GR approaches. Notably, LUM exhibits excellent scalability, with performance improvements observed as the model scales up to 7 billion parameters. Additionally, we have successfully deployed LUM in an industrial application, where it achieved significant gains in an A/B test, further validating its effectiveness and practicality.</p></details> | <details><summary>WSDM ...</summary><p>WSDM 2026, 10 pages; The first three authors contributed equally to this work</p></details> |

Nevertheless, their ability to perform precise compositional spatial reasoning remains largely unexplored. Existing benchmarks often involve relatively simple tasks and rely on semantic approximations or coarse relative positioning, while their evaluation metrics are typically limited and lack rigorous mathematical formulations. To bridge this gap, we introduce TangramPuzzle, a geometry-grounded benchmark designed to evaluate compositional spatial reasoning through the lens of the classic Tangram game. We propose the Tangram Construction Expression (TCE), a symbolic geometric framework that grounds tangram assemblies in exact, machine-verifiable coordinate specifications, to mitigate the ambiguity of visual approximation. We design two complementary tasks: Outline Prediction, which demands inferring global shapes from local components, and End-to-End Code Generation, which requires solving inverse geometric assembly problems. We conduct extensive evaluation experiments on advanced open-source and proprietary models, revealing an interesting insight: MLLMs tend to prioritize matching the target silhouette while neglecting geometric constraints, leading to distortions or deformations of the pieces.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Large Language Models For Irregular Time Series Classification In Critical Care](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16516v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series data from the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) provides critical information for patient monitoring. While recent advancements in applying Large Language Models (LLMs) to time series modeling (TSM) have shown great promise, their effectiveness on the irregular ICU data, characterized by particularly high rates of missing values, remains largely unexplored. This work investigates two key components underlying the success of LLMs for TSM: the time series encoder and the multimodal alignment strategy. To this end, we establish a systematic testbed to evaluate their impact across various state-of-the-art LLM-based methods on benchmark ICU datasets against strong supervised and self-supervised baselines. Results reveal that the encoder design is more critical than the alignment strategy. Encoders that explicitly model irregularity achieve substantial performance gains, yielding an average AUPRC increase of $12.8\%$ over the vanilla Transformer. While less impactful, the alignment strategy is also noteworthy, with the best-performing semantically rich, fusion-based strategy achieving a modest $2.9\%$ improvement over cross-attention. However, LLM-based methods require at least 10$\times$ longer training than the best-performing irregular supervised models, while delivering only comparable performance. They also underperform in data-scarce few-shot learning settings. These findings highlight both the promise and current limitations of LLMs for irregular ICU time series. The code is available at https://github.com/mHealthUnimelb/LLMTS.</p></details> | 5 pages, 3 figures |

While anonymous pricing can be $Θ(\log k)$ worse than optimal in general multi-unit environments, we show that this pessimism disappears in large markets, where no single buyer accounts for a non-negligible share of optimal revenue. Under (quasi-)regularity, anonymous pricing achieves a $2+O(1/\sqrt{k})$ approximation to the optimal mechanism; the worst-case ratio is maximized at about $2.47$ when $k=1$ and converges to $2$ as $k$ grows. This indicates that the gains from third-degree price discrimination are mild in large markets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Persona Jailbreaking in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16466v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in domains such as education, mental health and customer support, where stable and consistent personas are critical for reliability. Yet, existing studies focus on narrative or role-playing tasks and overlook how adversarial conversational history alone can reshape induced personas. Black-box persona manipulation remains unexplored, raising concerns for robustness in realistic interactions. In response, we introduce the task of persona editing, which adversarially steers LLM traits through user-side inputs under a black-box, inference-only setting. To this end, we propose PHISH (Persona Hijacking via Implicit Steering in History), the first framework to expose a new vulnerability in LLM safety that embeds semantically loaded cues into user queries to gradually induce reverse personas. We also define a metric to quantify attack success. Across 3 benchmarks and 8 LLMs, PHISH predictably shifts personas, triggers collateral changes in correlated traits, and exhibits stronger effects in multi-turn settings. In high-risk domains mental health, tutoring, and customer support, PHISH reliably manipulates personas, validated by both human and LLM-as-Judge evaluations. Importantly, PHISH causes only a small reduction in reasoning benchmark performance, leaving overall utility largely intact while still enabling significant persona manipulation. While current guardrails offer partial protection, they remain brittle under sustained attack. Our findings expose new vulnerabilities in personas and highlight the need for context-resilient persona in LLMs. Our codebase and dataset is available at: https://github.com/Jivnesh/PHISH</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EACL26 (Findings)</p></details> |
| **[REG4Rec: Reasoning-Enhanced Generative Model for Large-Scale Recommendation Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15308v3)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential recommendation aims to predict a user's next action in large-scale recommender systems. While traditional methods often suffer from insufficient information interaction, recent generative recommendation models partially address this issue by directly generating item predictions. To better capture user intents, recent studies have introduced a reasoning process into generative recommendation, significantly improving recommendation performance. However, these approaches are constrained by the singularity of item semantic representations, facing challenges such as limited diversity in reasoning pathways and insufficient reliability in the reasoning process. To tackle these issues, we introduce REG4Rec, a reasoning-enhanced generative model that constructs multiple dynamic semantic reasoning paths alongside a self-reflection process, ensuring high-confidence recommendations. Specifically, REG4Rec utilizes an MoE-based parallel quantization codebook (MPQ) to generate multiple unordered semantic tokens for each item, thereby constructing a larger-scale diverse reasoning space. Furthermore, to enhance the reliability of reasoning, we propose a training reasoning enhancement stage, which includes Preference Alignment for Reasoning (PARS) and a Multi-Step Reward Augmentation (MSRA) strategy. PARS uses reward functions tailored for recommendation to enhance reasoning and reflection, while MSRA introduces future multi-step actions to improve overall generalization. During inference, Consistency-Oriented Self-Reflection for Pruning (CORP) is proposed to discard inconsistent reasoning paths, preventing the propagation of erroneous reasoning. Lastly, we develop an efficient offline training strategy for large-scale recommendation. Experiments on real-world datasets and online evaluations show that REG4Rec delivers outstanding performance and substantial practical value.</p></details> |  |
| **[LUMOS: Large User MOdels for User Behavior Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08957v2)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>User behavior prediction at scale remains a critical challenge for online B2C platforms. Traditional approaches rely heavily on task-specific models and domain-specific feature engineering. This is time-consuming, computationally expensive, and requires domain expertise and therefore, not scalable. We present LUMOS (Large User MOdel Series), a transformer-based architecture that eliminates task-specific models and manual feature engineering by learning multiple tasks jointly using only raw user activity data. LUMOS introduces a novel cross-attention mechanism that conditions predictions on future known events (e.g., holidays, sales, etc.), enabling the model to predict complex behavior patterns like "how will upcoming holidays affect user engagement?" The architecture also employs multi-modal tokenization, combining user activities, event context, and static user demographic attributes into rich representations processed through specialized embedding pathways. Through extensive experiments on a production dataset spanning 1.7 trillion user activity tokens from 250 million users, we demonstrate that LUMOS achieves superior performance compared to traditional task-specific models. Across 5 tasks with established baselines, we achieve an average improvement of 0.025 in ROC-AUC for binary classification tasks and 4.6\% reduction in MAPE for regression tasks. Online A/B testing validates these improvements translate to measurable business impact with a 3.15\% increase in Daily Active Users.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Role of Mixed-Language Documents for Multilingual Large Language Model Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00364v2)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multilingual large language models achieve impressive cross-lingual performance despite largely monolingual pretraining. While bilingual data in pretraining corpora is widely believed to enable these abilities, details of its contributions remain unclear. We investigate this question by pretraining models from scratch under controlled conditions, comparing the standard web corpus with a monolingual-only version that removes all multilingual documents. Despite constituting only 2% of the corpus, removing bilingual data causes translation performance to drop 56% in BLEU, while behaviour on cross-lingual QA and general reasoning tasks remains stable, with training curves largely overlapping the baseline. To understand this asymmetry, we categorize bilingual data into parallel (14%), code-switching (72%), and miscellaneous documents (14%) based on the semantic relevance of content in different languages. We then conduct granular ablations by reintroducing parallel or code-switching data into the monolingual-only corpus. Our experiments reveal that parallel data almost fully restores translation performance (91% of the unfiltered baseline), whereas code-switching contributes minimally. Other cross-lingual tasks remain largely unaffected by either type. These findings reveal that translation critically depends on systematic token-level alignments from parallel data, whereas cross-lingual understanding and reasoning appear to be achievable even without bilingual data.</p></details> | under review |
| **[Exploring the Effects of Alignment on Numerical Bias in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16444v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>``LLM-as-a-judge,'' which utilizes large language models (LLMs) as evaluators, has proven effective in many evaluation tasks. However, evaluator LLMs exhibit numerical bias, a phenomenon where certain evaluation scores are generated disproportionately often, leading reduced evaluation performance. This study investigates the cause of this bias. Given that most evaluator LLMs are aligned through instruction tuning and preference tuning, and that prior research suggests alignment reduces output diversity, we hypothesize that numerical bias arises from alignment. To test this, we compare outputs from pre- and post-alignment LLMs, and observe that alignment indeed increases numerical bias. We also explore mitigation strategies for post-alignment LLMs, including temperature scaling, distribution calibration, and score range adjustment. Among these, score range adjustment is most effective in reducing bias and improving performance, though still heuristic. Our findings highlight the need for further work on optimal score range selection and more robust mitigation strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AIBSD 2026 (Workshop at AAAI 2026)</p></details> |
| **[An Evolutionary Framework for Automatic Optimization Benchmark Generation via Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12723v2)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimization benchmarks play a fundamental role in assessing algorithm performance; however, existing artificial benchmarks often fail to capture the diversity and irregularity of real-world problem structures, while benchmarks derived from real-world problems are costly and difficult to construct. To address these challenges, we propose an evolutionary automatic benchmark generation framework that leverages a large language model (LLM) as a generative operator, termed the LLM-driven evolutionary benchmark generator (LLM-EBG). In this framework, the LLM serves as an evolutionary operator that generates and evolves benchmark problems within a flexible, expressive representation space. As a case study, we generate unconstrained single-objective continuous minimization problems represented as mathematical expressions designed to induce significant performance differences between a genetic algorithm (GA) and differential evolution (DE). Experimental results show that LLM-EBG successfully produces benchmark problems in which the designated target algorithm consistently outperforms the comparative algorithm in more than 80\% of trials. Furthermore, exploratory landscape analysis reveals that benchmarks favoring GA are highly sensitive to variable scaling, demonstrating that the proposed framework can generate problems with distinct geometric characteristics that reflect the intrinsic search behaviors of different optimization algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[EmbedAgent: Benchmarking Large Language Models in Embedded System Development](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11003v3)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in various tasks, yet few benchmarks assess their capabilities in embedded system development. In this paper, we introduce EmbedAgent, a paradigm designed to simulate real-world roles in embedded system development, such as Embedded System Programmer, Architect, and Integrator. This paradigm enables LLMs to be tested in tasks that bridge the gap between digital and physical systems, allowing for a more comprehensive assessment of their capabilities. To evaluate LLMs on these tasks, we propose Embedbench, the first comprehensive benchmark for embedded system programming, circuit design, and cross-platform migration. Embedbench consists of 126 cases, covering 9 electronic components across 3 hardware platforms. Through extensive experiments on 10 mainstream LLMs, we uncover several key findings. Surprisingly, despite the simplicity of the cases, DeepSeek-R1 achieves only a 55.6% pass@1 rate when provided with schematic information, and 50.0% when tasked with generating the schematics itself. In the cross-platform migration tasks, LLMs show relatively strong performance with MicroPython on the Raspberry Pi Pico (with the top model achieving 73.8% pass@1), but perform poorly on ESP-IDF, where the best model reaches only 29.4% pass@1. Interestingly, we observe that general-purpose chat LLMs like DeepSeek-V3 often fail to utilize relevant pre-trained knowledge in this domain, while reasoning LLMs tend to overthink and overlook efficient knowledge during pretraining. Based on these insights, we propose two strategies: retrieval augmented generation and compiler feedback-to enhance LLM performance. These strategies result in significant improvements, with Deepseek-R1 reaching a 65.1% pass@1 with correct schematics, and 53.1% without. Additionally, the accuracy of the Arduino to ESP32 migration task improves from 21.4% to 27.8%.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, accepted by International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE)</p></details> |
| **[Learning Domain Knowledge in Multimodal Large Language Models through Reinforcement Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16419v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in multimodal perception and understanding tasks. However, their effectiveness in specialized domains, such as remote sensing and medical imaging, remains limited. A natural approach to domain adaptation is to inject domain knowledge through textual instructions, prompts, or auxiliary captions. Surprisingly, we find that such input-level domain knowledge injection yields little to no improvement on scientific multimodal tasks, even when the domain knowledge is explicitly provided. This observation suggests that current MLLMs fail to internalize domain-specific priors through language alone, and that domain knowledge must be integrated at the optimization level. Motivated by this insight, we propose a reinforcement fine-tuning framework that incorporates domain knowledge directly into the learning objective. Instead of treating domain knowledge as descriptive information, we encode it as domain-informed constraints and reward signals, shaping the model's behavior in the output space. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets in remote sensing and medical domains consistently demonstrate good performance gains, achieving state-of-the-art results on multimodal domain tasks. Our results highlight the necessity of optimization-level domain knowledge integration and reveal a fundamental limitation of textual domain conditioning in current MLLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Information Capacity: Evaluating the Efficiency of Large Language Models via Text Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08066v6)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have witnessed the rapid advancements of large language models (LLMs) and their expanding applications, leading to soaring demands for computational resources. The widespread adoption of test-time scaling further intensifies the tension between model capability and resource consumption, highlighting the importance of inference efficiency. However, a unified metric that accurately reflects an LLM's efficiency across diverse model sizes and architectures remains absent. Motivated by the correlation between compression and intelligence, we introduce information capacity, a measure of model efficiency based on text compression performance relative to computational complexity. A distinctive feature of information capacity is its incorporation of tokenizer efficiency, which affects inference costs but is often neglected in LLM evaluations. We assess the information capacity of 52 open-source models and observe a consistent information capacity among different-sized models within a series. Experiments on 5 heterogeneous datasets reveal strong linguistic biases in mainstream LLMs. Three major factors of information capacity include tokenizer efficiency, pretraining data, and the mixture-of-experts architecture. Empirical results verify the accuracy of performance prediction across model sizes based on information capacity and show the correlation between information capacity and benchmark scores.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/TeleAI-AI-Flow/InformationCapacity.

We evaluate ten prominent LLMs: GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Flash, Gemini 1.0 Pro, Claude 3 Opus, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Llama 3, Gemma 7B, Mistral 7B, and Vicuna-13B using a dataset of 100 carefully designed prompts that probe forced-choice decisions between regions under contextually neutral scenarios. We introduce FAZE, a prompt-based evaluation framework that measures regional bias on a 10-point scale, where higher scores indicate a stronger tendency to favor specific regions. Experimental results reveal substantial variation in bias levels across models, with GPT-3.5 exhibiting the highest bias score (9.5) and Claude 3.5 Sonnet scoring the lowest (2.5). These findings indicate that regional bias can meaningfully undermine the reliability, fairness, and inclusivity of LLM outputs in real-world, cross-cultural applications. This work contributes to AI fairness research by highlighting the importance of inclusive evaluation frameworks and systematic approaches for identifying and mitigating geographic biases in language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 1 figure.

Given its importance and the exponentially growing volumes of genomic sequence data, there are extensive efforts to accelerate genome sequence analysis. In this work, we demonstrate a major bottleneck that greatly limits and diminishes the benefits of state-of-the-art genome sequence analysis accelerators: the data preparation bottleneck, where genomic sequence data is stored in compressed form and needs to be first decompressed and formatted before an accelerator can operate on it. To mitigate this bottleneck, we propose SAGe, an algorithm-architecture co-design for highly-compressed storage and high-performance access of large-scale genomic sequence data. The key challenge is to improve data preparation performance while maintaining high compression ratios (comparable to genomic-specific compression algorithms) at low hardware cost. We address this challenge by leveraging key properties of genomic datasets to co-design (i) a lossless (de)compression algorithm, (ii) hardware that decompresses data with lightweight operations and efficient streaming accesses, (iii) storage data layout, and (iv) interface commands to access data. SAGe is highly versatile, as it supports datasets from different sequencing technologies and species. Due to its lightweight design, SAGe can be seamlessly integrated with a broad range of hardware accelerators for genome sequence analysis to mitigate their data preparation bottlenecks. Our results demonstrate that SAGe improves the average end-to-end performance and energy efficiency of two state-of-the-art genome sequence analysis accelerators by 3.0x-32.1x and 13.0x-34.0x, respectively, compared to when the accelerators rely on state-of-the-art software and hardware decompression tools.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in HPCA 2026</p></details> |

In this work, we answer an important question -- how many labelled samples are required for the specialised small models to outperform general large models, while taking the performance variance into consideration. By observing the behaviour of fine-tuning, instruction-tuning, prompting and in-context learning on 8 language models, we identify such performance break-even points across 8 representative text classification tasks of varying characteristics. We show that the specialised models often need only few samples (on average $100$) to be on par or better than the general ones. At the same time, the number of required labels strongly depends on the dataset or task characteristics, with fine-tuning on binary datasets requiring significantly more samples. When performance variance is taken into consideration, the number of required labels increases on average by $100 - 200\%$. Finally, larger models do not consistently lead to better performance and lower variance, with 4-bit quantisation having negligible impact.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the EMNLP 2025 conference</p></details> |

To address this vulnerability, we propose the Feature-space Smoothing (FS) and theoretically prove that FS offers certified robustness on the feature representations of MLLMs. Specifically, FS transforms any feature encoder into a smoothed variant that is guaranteed to maintain a certified lower bound on the feature cosine similarity between clean and adversarial representations under $\ell_2$-bounded attacks. Moreover, we indicate that the value of this Feature Cosine Similarity Bound (FCSB) derived from FS can be improved by enlarging the defined Gaussian robustness score on the vanilla encoder. Building upon this, we introduce the Purifier and Smoothness Mapper (PSM), a plug-and-play module that improves the Gaussian robustness score of MLLMs and thus enhances their certified robustness under FS, without requiring any retraining on MLLMs. We demonstrate that the FS with PSM not only provides a strong theoretical robustness guarantee but also exhibits superior empirical performance compared to adversarial training. Extensive experiments across diverse MLLMs and downstream tasks indicate the effectiveness of the FS-PSM, reducing the Attack Success Rate (ASR) of various white-box attacks from nearly 90\% to about 1\%.</p></details> | Under review |

Existing geospatial representation learning approaches typically aggregate Points of Interest(POI) into pre-defined administrative regions such as census units or ZIP code areas, assigning a single embedding to each region. However, POIs often form semantically meaningful groups that extend across, within, or beyond these boundaries, defining places that better reflect human activity and urban function. To address this limitation, we propose PlaceRep, a training-free geospatial representation learning method that constructs place-level representations by clustering spatially and semantically related POIs. PlaceRep summarizes large-scale POI graphs from U.S. Foursquare data to produce general-purpose urban region embeddings while automatically identifying places across multiple spatial scales. By eliminating model pre-training, PlaceRep provides a scalable and efficient solution for multi-granular geospatial analysis. Experiments using the tasks of population density estimation and housing price prediction as downstream tasks show that PlaceRep outperforms most state-of-the-art graph-based geospatial representation learning methods and achieves up to a 100x speedup in generating region-level representations on large-scale POI graphs. The implementation of PlaceRep is available at https://github.com/mohammadhashemii/PlaceRep.</p></details> |  |

We compare zero-shot prompting to one-shot variants using static, random, and embedding-based exemplar selection, and assess a checklist-driven validator/corrector loop. To evaluate our framework, we consider query validity and retrieval accuracy. We find that one-shot prompting with aligned exemplars consistently performs best. Our checklist-style self-correction loop mainly improves executability in zero-shot settings and offers limited additional retrieval gains once a good exemplar is present.

We investigate these questions in the high-stakes context of undergraduate admissions at a selective university by comparing lexical and sentence variation between essays written by 30,000 applicants to two types of LLM-generated essays: one prompted with only the essay question used by the human applicants; and another with additional demographic information about each applicant. We consistently find that both types of LLM-generated essays are linguistically distinct from human-authored essays, regardless of the specific model and analytical approach. Further, prompting a specific sociodemographic identity is remarkably ineffective in aligning the model with the linguistic patterns observed in human writing from this identity group. This holds along the key dimensions of sex, race, first-generation status, and geographic location. The demographically prompted and unprompted synthetic texts were also more similar to each other than to the human text, meaning that prompting did not alleviate homogenization. These issues of model alignment and steerability in current LLMs raise concerns about the use of LLMs in high-stakes contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>48 pa...</summary><p>48 pages, 10 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

Time series forecasting (TSF) is a key means to achieve this goal. In recent years, the large language models (LLMs) for TSF (LLM4TSF) have achieved good performance. However, there is a significant difference between pretraining corpora and time series data, making it hard to guarantee forecasting quality when directly applying LLMs to TSF; fine-tuning LLMs can mitigate this issue, but often incurs substantial computational overhead. Thus, LLM4TSF faces a dual challenge of prediction performance and compute overhead. To address this, we aim to explore a method for improving the forecasting performance of LLM4TSF while freezing all LLM parameters to reduce computational overhead. Inspired by in-context learning (ICL), we propose LVICL. LVICL uses our vector-injected ICL to inject example information into a frozen LLM, eliciting its in-context learning ability and thereby enhancing its performance on the example-related task (i.e., TSF). Specifically, we first use the LLM together with a learnable context vector adapter to extract a context vector from multiple examples adaptively. This vector contains compressed, example-related information. Subsequently, during the forward pass, we inject this vector into every layer of the LLM to improve forecasting performance. Compared with conventional ICL that adds examples into the prompt, our vector-injected ICL does not increase prompt length; moreover, adaptively deriving a context vector from examples suppresses components harmful to forecasting, thereby improving model performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Why Inference in Large Models Becomes Decomposable After Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15871v1)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inference in large-scale AI models is typically performed on dense parameter matrices, leading to inference cost and system complexity that scale unsustainably with model size. This limitation does not arise from insufficient model capacity, but from treating post-training inference systems as monolithic operators while ignoring internal structures formed during learning. We show that gradient update events in large models are highly localized and selective, leaving many parameter dependencies statistically indistinguishable from their initialization distribution after training. As a result, post-training inference systems are structurally non-uniform and inherently decomposable. Based on this observation, we introduce a post-training statistical criterion and a structural annealing procedure that removes unsupported dependencies and reveals stable, independent substructures. This work establishes a post-training, model-agnostic structural view of inference systems and enables structured, parallel inference without modifying model functionality or interfaces.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |

The tree-independence number of a graph $G$ is the minimum independence number of a tree decomposition of $G$. As shown recently by Lima et al. [ESA~2024], a large family of optimization problems asking for a maximum-weight induced subgraph of bounded treewidth, satisfying a given \textsf{CMSO}$_2$ property, can be solved in polynomial time in graphs whose tree-independence number is bounded by some constant~$k$. However, the complexity of the algorithm of Lima et al. grows rapidly with $k$, making it useless if the tree-independence number is superconstant. In this paper we present a refined version of the algorithm. We show that the same family of problems can be solved in time~$n^{\mathcal{O}(k)}$, where $n$ is the number of vertices of the instance, $k$ is the tree-independence number, and the $\mathcal{O}(\cdot)$-notation hides factors depending on the treewidth bound of the solution and the considered \textsf{CMSO}$_2$ property. This running time is quasipolynomial for classes of graphs with polylogarithmic tree-independence number; several such classes were recently discovered. Furthermore, the running time is subexponential for many natural classes of geometric intersection graphs -- namely, ones that admit balanced clique-based separators of sublinear size.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adversarial Alignment: Ensuring Value Consistency in Large Language Models for Sensitive Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13137v2)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the wide application of large language models (LLMs), the problems of bias and value inconsistency in sensitive domains have gradually emerged, especially in terms of race, society and politics. In this paper, we propose an adversarial alignment framework, which enhances the value consistency of the model in sensitive domains through continued pre-training, instruction fine-tuning and adversarial training. In adversarial training, we use the Attacker to generate controversial queries, the Actor to generate responses with value consistency, and the Critic to filter and ensure response quality. Furthermore, we train a Value-Consistent Large Language Model, VC-LLM, for sensitive domains, and construct a bilingual evaluation dataset in Chinese and English. The experimental results show that VC-LLM performs better than the existing mainstream models in both Chinese and English tests, verifying the effectiveness of the method. Warning: This paper contains examples of LLMs that are offensive or harmful in nature.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Virtual Traffic Police: Large Language Model-Augmented Traffic Signal Control for Unforeseen Incidents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15816v1)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adaptive traffic signal control (TSC) has demonstrated strong effectiveness in managing dynamic traffic flows. However, conventional methods often struggle when unforeseen traffic incidents occur (e.g., accidents and road maintenance), which typically require labor-intensive and inefficient manual interventions by traffic police officers. Large Language Models (LLMs) appear to be a promising solution thanks to their remarkable reasoning and generalization capabilities. Nevertheless, existing works often propose to replace existing TSC systems with LLM-based systems, which can be (i) unreliable due to the inherent hallucinations of LLMs and (ii) costly due to the need for system replacement. To address the issues of existing works, we propose a hierarchical framework that augments existing TSC systems with LLMs, whereby a virtual traffic police agent at the upper level dynamically fine-tunes selected parameters of signal controllers at the lower level in response to real-time traffic incidents. To enhance domain-specific reliability in response to unforeseen traffic incidents, we devise a self-refined traffic language retrieval system (TLRS), whereby retrieval-augmented generation is employed to draw knowledge from a tailored traffic language database that encompasses traffic conditions and controller operation principles. Moreover, we devise an LLM-based verifier to update the TLRS continuously over the reasoning process. Our results show that LLMs can serve as trustworthy virtual traffic police officers that can adapt conventional TSC methods to unforeseen traffic incidents with significantly improved operational efficiency and reliability.</p></details> |  |
| **[ErrorMap and ErrorAtlas: Charting the Failure Landscape of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15812v1)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLM) benchmarks tell us when models fail, but not why they fail. A wrong answer on a reasoning dataset may stem from formatting issues, calculation errors, or dataset noise rather than weak reasoning. Without disentangling such causes, benchmarks remain incomplete and cannot reliably guide model improvement. We introduce ErrorMap, the first method to chart the sources of LLM failure. It extracts a model's unique "failure signature", clarifies what benchmarks measure, and broadens error identification to reduce blind spots. This helps developers debug models, aligns benchmark goals with outcomes, and supports informed model selection. ErrorMap works on any model or dataset with the same logic. Applying our method to 35 datasets and 83 models we generate ErrorAtlas, a taxonomy of model errors, revealing recurring failure patterns. ErrorAtlas highlights error types that are currently underexplored in LLM research, such as omissions of required details in the output and question misinterpretation. By shifting focus from where models succeed to why they fail, ErrorMap and ErrorAtlas enable advanced evaluation - one that exposes hidden weaknesses and directs progress. Unlike success, typically measured by task-level metrics, our approach introduces a deeper evaluation layer that can be applied globally across models and tasks, offering richer insights into model behavior and limitations. We make the taxonomy and code publicly available with plans to periodically update ErrorAtlas as new benchmarks and models emerge.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attributing and Exploiting Safety Vectors through Global Optimization in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15801v1)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Language Models (LLMs) are aligned to mitigate risks, their safety guardrails remain fragile against jailbreak attacks. This reveals limited understanding of components governing safety. Existing methods rely on local, greedy attribution that assumes independent component contributions. However, they overlook the cooperative interactions between different components in LLMs, such as attention heads, which jointly contribute to safety mechanisms. We propose \textbf{G}lobal \textbf{O}ptimization for \textbf{S}afety \textbf{V}ector Extraction (GOSV), a framework that identifies safety-critical attention heads through global optimization over all heads simultaneously. We employ two complementary activation repatching strategies: Harmful Patching and Zero Ablation. These strategies identify two spatially distinct sets of safety vectors with consistently low overlap, termed Malicious Injection Vectors and Safety Suppression Vectors, demonstrating that aligned LLMs maintain separate functional pathways for safety purposes. Through systematic analyses, we find that complete safety breakdown occurs when approximately 30\% of total heads are repatched across all models. Building on these insights, we develop a novel inference-time white-box jailbreak method that exploits the identified safety vectors through activation repatching. Our attack substantially outperforms existing white-box attacks across all test models, providing strong evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed GOSV framework on LLM safety interpretability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Crafting Adversarial Inputs for Large Vision-Language Models Using Black-Box Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01747v4)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown groundbreaking capabilities across diverse multimodal tasks. However, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial jailbreak attacks, where adversaries craft subtle perturbations to bypass safety mechanisms and trigger harmful outputs. Existing white-box attacks methods require full model accessibility, suffer from computing costs and exhibit insufficient adversarial transferability, making them impractical for real-world, black-box settings. To address these limitations, we propose a black-box jailbreak attack on LVLMs via Zeroth-Order optimization using Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (ZO-SPSA). ZO-SPSA provides three key advantages: (i) gradient-free approximation by input-output interactions without requiring model knowledge, (ii) model-agnostic optimization without the surrogate model and (iii) lower resource requirements with reduced GPU memory consumption. We evaluate ZO-SPSA on three LVLMs, including InstructBLIP, LLaVA and MiniGPT-4, achieving the highest jailbreak success rate of 83.0% on InstructBLIP, while maintaining imperceptible perturbations comparable to white-box methods. Moreover, adversarial examples generated from MiniGPT-4 exhibit strong transferability to other LVLMs, with ASR reaching 64.18%. These findings underscore the real-world feasibility of black-box jailbreaks and expose critical weaknesses in the safety mechanisms of current LVLMs</p></details> | EACL |

However, existing reviews primarily treat MI as an observational science, summarizing analytical insights while lacking a systematic framework for actionable intervention. To bridge this gap, we present a practical survey structured around the pipeline: "Locate, Steer, and Improve." We formally categorize Localizing (diagnosis) and Steering (intervention) methods based on specific Interpretable Objects to establish a rigorous intervention protocol. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this framework enables tangible improvements in Alignment, Capability, and Efficiency, effectively operationalizing MI as an actionable methodology for model optimization.

| **[Online Operator Design in Evolutionary Optimization for Flexible Job Shop Scheduling via Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16485v3)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Customized static operator design has enabled widespread application of Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), but their search effectiveness often deteriorates as evolutionary progresses. Dynamic operator configuration approaches attempt to alleviate this issue, but they typically rely on predefined operator structures and localized parameter control, lacking sustained adaptive optimization throughout evolution. To overcome these limitations, this work leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to perceive evolutionary dynamics and enable operator-level meta-evolution. The proposed framework, LLMs for online operator design in Evolutionary Optimization, named LLM4EO, comprises three components: knowledge-transfer-based operator design, evolution perception and analysis, and adaptive operator evolution. Firstly, operators are initialized by leveraging LLMs to distill and transfer knowledge from well-established operators. Then, search behaviors and potential limitations of operators are analyzed by integrating fitness performance with evolutionary features, accompanied by suggestions for improvement. Upon stagnation of population evolution, an LLM-driven meta-operator dynamically optimizes gene selection of operators by prompt-guided improvement strategies. This approach achieves co-evolution of solutions and operators within a unified optimization framework, introducing a novel paradigm for enhancing the efficiency and adaptability of EAs. Finally, extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks of flexible job shop scheduling problem demonstrate that LLM4EO accelerates population evolution and outperforms tailored EAs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamics of Agentic Loops in Large Language Models: A Geometric Theory of Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10350v3)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agentic systems built on large language models operate through recursive feedback loops, where each output becomes the next input. Yet the geometric behavior of these agentic loops (whether they converge, diverge, or exhibit more complex dynamics) remains poorly understood. This paper introduces a geometric framework for analyzing agentic trajectories in semantic embedding space, treating iterative transformations as discrete dynamical systems. We distinguish the artifact space, where linguistic transformations occur, from the embedding space, where geometric measurements are performed. Because cosine similarity is biased by embedding anisotropy, we introduce an isotonic calibration that eliminates systematic bias and aligns similarities with human semantic judgments while preserving high local stability. This enables rigorous measurement of trajectories, clusters and attractors. Through controlled experiments on singular agentic loops, we identify two fundamental regimes. A contractive rewriting loop converges toward a stable attractor with decreasing dispersion, while an exploratory summarize and negate loop produces unbounded divergence with no cluster formation. These regimes display qualitatively distinct geometric signatures of contraction and expansion. Our results show that prompt design directly governs the dynamical regime of an agentic loop, enabling systematic control of convergence, divergence and trajectory structure in iterative LLM transformations.</p></details> |  |

While existing schemes have explored the security vulnerabilities of MLLMs, the investigation into their visual safety boundaries remains insufficient. In this paper, we propose Beyond Visual Safety (BVS), a novel image-text pair jailbreaking framework specifically designed to probe the visual safety boundaries of MLLMs. BVS employs a "reconstruction-then-generation" strategy, leveraging neutralized visual splicing and inductive recomposition to decouple malicious intent from raw inputs, thereby leading MLLMs to be induced into generating harmful images. Experimental results demonstrate that BVS achieves a remarkable jailbreak success rate of 98.21\% against GPT-5 (12 January 2026 release). Our findings expose critical vulnerabilities in the visual safety alignment of current MLLMs.</p></details> |  |

This survey charts a functional evolution in addressing this challenge: the evolution of uncertainty from a passive diagnostic metric to an active control signal guiding real-time model behavior. We demonstrate how uncertainty is leveraged as an active control signal across three frontiers: in \textbf{advanced reasoning} to optimize computation and trigger self-correction; in \textbf{autonomous agents} to govern metacognitive decisions about tool use and information seeking; and in \textbf{reinforcement learning} to mitigate reward hacking and enable self-improvement via intrinsic rewards. By grounding these advancements in emerging theoretical frameworks like Bayesian methods and Conformal Prediction, we provide a unified perspective on this transformative trend. This survey provides a comprehensive overview, critical analysis, and practical design patterns, arguing that mastering the new trend of uncertainty is essential for building the next generation of scalable, reliable, and trustworthy AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 4 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

However, there has been no comprehensive empirical study of their performance for this increasingly important LLM-based Software Engineering application. To address this, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study evaluating BugFarm and LLMorpheus (the two state-of-the-art LLM-based approaches), alongside seven LLMs using our newly designed prompt, including both leading open- and closed-source models, on 851 real bugs from two Java real-world bug benchmarks. Our results reveal that, compared to existing rule-based approaches, LLMs generate more diverse mutants, that are behaviorally closer to real bugs and, most importantly, with 111.29% higher fault detection. That is, 87.98% (for LLMs) vs. 41.64% (for rule-based); an increase of 46.34 percentage points. Nevertheless, our results also reveal that these impressive results for improved effectiveness come at a cost: the LLM-generated mutants have worse non-compilability, duplication, and equivalent mutant rates by 26.60, 10.14, and 3.51 percentage points, respectively. These findings are immediately actionable for both research and practice. They allow practitioners to have greater confidence in deploying LLM-based mutation, while researchers now have a baseline for the state-of-the-art, with which they can research techniques to further improve effectiveness and reduce cost.</p></details> | 39 pages, 4 figures |
| **[AtomWorld: A Benchmark for Evaluating Spatial Reasoning in Large Language Models on Crystalline Materials](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04704v3)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at textual reasoning and are beginning to develop spatial understanding, prompting the question of whether these abilities can be combined for complex, domain-specific tasks. This question is essential in fields like materials science, where deep understanding of 3D atomic structures is fundamental. While initial studies have successfully applied LLMs to tasks involving pure crystal generation or coordinate understandings, a standardized benchmark to systematically evaluate their core reasoning abilities across diverse atomic structures has been notably absent. To address this gap, we introduce the AtomWorld benchmark to evaluate LLMs on tasks based in Crystallographic Information Files (CIFs), a standard structure representation format. These tasks, including structural editing, CIF perception, and property-guided modeling, reveal a critical limitation: current models, despite establishing promising baselines, consistently fail in structural understanding and spatial reasoning. Our experiments show that these models make frequent errors on structure modification tasks, and even in the basic CIF format understandings, potentially leading to cumulative errors in subsequent analysis and materials insights. By defining these standardized tasks, AtomWorld lays the ground for advancing LLMs toward robust atomic-scale modeling, crucial for accelerating materials research and automating scientific workflows.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predictive Coding and Information Bottleneck for Hallucination Detection in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15652v1)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) -- generations that are plausible but factually unfaithful -- remain a critical barrier to high-stakes deployment. Current detection methods typically rely on computationally expensive external retrieval loops or opaque black-box LLM judges requiring 70B+ parameters. In this work, we introduce [Model Name], a hybrid detection framework that combines neuroscience-inspired signal design with supervised machine learning. We extract interpretable signals grounded in Predictive Coding (quantifying surprise against internal priors) and the Information Bottleneck (measuring signal retention under perturbation). Through systematic ablation, we demonstrate three key enhancements: Entity-Focused Uptake (concentrating on high-value tokens), Context Adherence (measuring grounding strength), and Falsifiability Score (detecting confident but contradictory claims). Evaluating on HaluBench (n=200, perfectly balanced), our theory-guided baseline achieves 0.8017 AUROC. BASE supervised models reach 0.8274 AUROC, while IMPROVED features boost performance to 0.8669 AUROC (4.95% gain), demonstrating consistent improvements across architectures. This competitive performance is achieved while using 75x less training data than Lynx (200 vs 15,000 samples), 1000x faster inference (5ms vs 5s), and remaining fully interpretable. Crucially, we report a negative result: the Rationalization signal fails to distinguish hallucinations, suggesting that LLMs generate coherent reasoning for false premises ("Sycophancy"). This work demonstrates that domain knowledge encoded in signal architecture provides superior data efficiency compared to scaling LLM judges, achieving strong performance with lightweight (less than 1M parameter), explainable models suitable for production deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Reliable Medical LLMs: Benchmarking and Enhancing Confidence Estimation of Large Language Models in Medical Consultation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15645v1)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale language models (LLMs) often offer clinical judgments based on incomplete information, increasing the risk of misdiagnosis. Existing studies have primarily evaluated confidence in single-turn, static settings, overlooking the coupling between confidence and correctness as clinical evidence accumulates during real consultations, which limits their support for reliable decision-making. We propose the first benchmark for assessing confidence in multi-turn interaction during realistic medical consultations. Our benchmark unifies three types of medical data for open-ended diagnostic generation and introduces an information sufficiency gradient to characterize the confidence-correctness dynamics as evidence increases. We implement and compare 27 representative methods on this benchmark; two key insights emerge: (1) medical data amplifies the inherent limitations of token-level and consistency-level confidence methods, and (2) medical reasoning must be evaluated for both diagnostic accuracy and information completeness. Based on these insights, we present MedConf, an evidence-grounded linguistic self-assessment framework that constructs symptom profiles via retrieval-augmented generation, aligns patient information with supporting, missing, and contradictory relations, and aggregates them into an interpretable confidence estimate through weighted integration. Across two LLMs and three medical datasets, MedConf consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both AUROC and Pearson correlation coefficient metrics, maintaining stable performance under conditions of information insufficiency and multimorbidity. These results demonstrate that information adequacy is a key determinant of credible medical confidence modeling, providing a new pathway toward building more reliable and interpretable large medical models.</p></details> |  |

We therefore propose a graph-centric attention acquisition pipeline that enhances LLMs' ability to localize malicious behavior. The approach parses a project into a code graph, uses an LLM to encode nodes with semantic and structural signals, and trains a Graph Neural Network (GNN) under sparse supervision. The GNN performs an initial detection, and by interpreting these predictions, identifies key code sections that are most likely to contain malicious behavior. These influential regions are then used to guide the LLM's attention for in-depth analysis. This strategy significantly reduces interference from irrelevant context while maintaining low annotation costs. Extensive experiments show that the method consistently outperforms existing approaches on multiple public and custom datasets, highlighting its potential for practical deployment in software security scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, existing solutions often rely on rapid classification schemes or post-hoc rules, resulting in limited transparency, inflexible policies, or prohibitive inference costs. To this end, we present YuFeng-XGuard, a reasoning-centric guardrail model family designed to perform multi-dimensional risk perception for LLM interactions. Instead of producing opaque binary judgments, YuFeng-XGuard generates structured risk predictions, including explicit risk categories and configurable confidence scores, accompanied by natural language explanations that expose the underlying reasoning process. This formulation enables safety decisions that are both actionable and interpretable. To balance decision latency and explanatory depth, we adopt a tiered inference paradigm that performs an initial risk decision based on the first decoded token, while preserving ondemand explanatory reasoning when required. In addition, we introduce a dynamic policy mechanism that decouples risk perception from policy enforcement, allowing safety policies to be adjusted without model retraining. Extensive experiments on a diverse set of public safety benchmarks demonstrate that YuFeng-XGuard achieves stateof-the-art performance while maintaining strong efficiency-efficacy trade-offs. We release YuFeng-XGuard as an open model family, including both a full-capacity variant and a lightweight version, to support a wide range of deployment scenarios.</p></details> |  |

The study begins with an in-depth analysis of the pSA process, focusing on the issues resulting from unexpected oscillations among p-bits. These oscillations hinder the energy reduction of the Ising model and thus obstruct the successful execution of pSA in complex tasks. Through detailed simulations, we unravel the root cause of this energy stagnation, identifying the feedback mechanism inherent to the pSA operation as the primary contributor to these disruptive oscillations. To address this challenge, we propose two novel algorithms, time average pSA (TApSA) and stalled pSA (SpSA). These algorithms are designed based on partial deactivation of p-bits and are thoroughly tested using Python simulations on maximum cut benchmarks that are typical combinatorial optimization problems. On the 16 benchmarks from 800 to 5,000 nodes, the proposed methods improve the normalized cut value from 0.8% to 98.4% on average in comparison with the conventional pSA.</p></details> | 17 pages |

Their scale, however, limits deployment in resource-constrained settings, and existing compression approaches often either degrade after domain adaptation or require substantial additional computation. We introduce EfficientXpert, a lightweight framework for domain pruning that integrates ForeSight Mask, a propagation-aware criterion for selecting weights to prune without backpropagation, and Partial Brain Surgeon, an efficient closed-form update for low-rank adapters under a fixed sparsity pattern. With fine-tuning cost comparable to standard LoRA, EfficientXpert converts a general pretrained model into a sparse, domain-adapted expert in a single pruning step. Across health and legal benchmarks, EfficientXpert reaches up to 98 percent of dense performance at 40 percent sparsity, improving over prior pruning baselines while matching LoRA training time and staying within 1 percent of LoRA peak GPU memory in our experiments.</p></details> |  |

Instead of representing text or video as sequences of discrete tokens processed by attention, SGFMs treat generation as the evolution of a continuous field governed by constrained stochastic dynamics in a multiscale wavelet basis. This formulation replaces global attention with local operators, spectral projections, and Navier--Stokes-like transport, yielding a generative mechanism grounded in continuity, geometry, and physical structure. Our framework provides three key innovations: (i) a field-theoretic ontology in which text and video are unified as trajectories of a stochastic partial differential equation; (ii) a wavelet-domain representation that induces sparsity, scale separation, and computational efficiency; and (iii) a constrained stochastic flow that enforces stability, coherence, and uncertainty propagation. Together, these components define a generative architecture that departs fundamentally from autoregressive modeling and diffusion-based approaches. SGFMs offer a principled path toward long-range coherence, multimodal generality, and physically structured inductive bias in next-generation generative models.</p></details> |  |

An important, albeit implicit, assumption of these labels is that they accurately capture what any human would think, effectively treating human common sense as homogeneous. However, recent empirical work has shown that humans vary enormously in what they consider commonsensical; thus what appears self-evident to one benchmark designer may not be so to another. Here, we propose a method for assessing commonsense knowledge in AI, specifically in large language models (LLMs), that incorporates empirically observed heterogeneity among humans by measuring the correspondence between a model's judgment and that of a human population. We first find that, when treated as independent survey respondents, most LLMs remain below the human median in their individual commonsense competence. Second, when used as simulators of a hypothetical population, LLMs correlate with real humans only modestly in the extent to which they agree on the same set of statements. In both cases, smaller, open-weight models are surprisingly more competitive than larger, proprietary frontier models. Our evaluation framework, which ties commonsense knowledge to its cultural basis, contributes to the growing call for adapting AI models to human collectivities that possess different, often incompatible, social stocks of knowledge.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and data: https://github.com/Watts-Lab/commonsense-llm-eval</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Persona Thinking for Bias Mitigation in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15488v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit significant social biases that can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and unfair outcomes. In this paper, we propose Multi-Persona Thinking (MPT), a novel inference-time framework that leverages dialectical reasoning from multiple perspectives to reduce bias. MPT guides models to adopt contrasting social identities (e.g., male and female) along with a neutral viewpoint, and then engages these personas iteratively to expose and correct biases. Through a dialectical reasoning process, the framework transforms the potential weakness of persona assignment into a strength for bias mitigation. We evaluate MPT on two widely used bias benchmarks across both open-source and closed-source models of varying scales. Our results demonstrate substantial improvements over existing prompting-based strategies: MPT achieves the lowest bias while maintaining core reasoning ability.</p></details> | 13 pages, 3 figures |

Large language models (LLMs) can be advantageous if trained at scale on general knowledge, but especially and in particular when the training data includes information such as detailed map geography topology of the entire planet, as well as the ability to access real time situational data such as weather. However, challenges remain in the interface between drones and LLMs in general, with each application requiring a tedious, labor intensive effort to connect the LLM trained knowledge to drone command and control. Here, we solve that problem, using an interface strategy that is LLM agnostic and drone agnostic, providing the first universal, versatile, comprehensive and easy to use drone control interface. We do this using the new model context protocol (MCP) standard, an open standard that provides a universal way for AI systems to access external data, tools, and services. We develop and deploy a cloud based Linux machine hosting an MCP server that supports the Mavlink protocol, an ubiquitous drone control language used almost universally by millions of drones including Ardupilot and PX4 framework.We demonstrate flight control of a real unmanned aerial vehicle. In further testing, we demonstrate extensive flight planning and control capability in a simulated drone, integrated with a Google Maps MCP server for up to date, real time navigation information. This demonstrates a universal approach to integration of LLMs with drone command and control, a paradigm that leverages and exploits virtually all of modern AI industry with drone technology in an easy to use interface that translates natural language to drone control.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Rise of Large Language Models and the Direction and Impact of US Federal Research Funding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15485v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federal research funding shapes the direction, diversity, and impact of the US scientific enterprise. Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly diffusing into scientific practice, holding substantial promise while raising widespread concerns. Despite growing attention to AI use in scientific writing and evaluation, little is known about how the rise of LLMs is reshaping the public funding landscape. Here, we examine LLM involvement at key stages of the federal funding pipeline by combining two complementary data sources: confidential National Science Foundation (NSF) and National Institutes of Health (NIH) proposal submissions from two large US R1 universities, including funded, unfunded, and pending proposals, and the full population of publicly released NSF and NIH awards. We find that LLM use rises sharply beginning in 2023 and exhibits a bimodal distribution, indicating a clear split between minimal and substantive use. Across both private submissions and public awards, higher LLM involvement is consistently associated with lower semantic distinctiveness, positioning projects closer to recently funded work within the same agency. The consequences of this shift are agency-dependent. LLM use is positively associated with proposal success and higher subsequent publication output at NIH, whereas no comparable associations are observed at NSF. Notably, the productivity gains at NIH are concentrated in non-hit papers rather than the most highly cited work. Together, these findings provide large-scale evidence that the rise of LLMs is reshaping how scientific ideas are positioned, selected, and translated into publicly funded research, with implications for portfolio governance, research diversity, and the long-run impact of science.</p></details> | <details><summary>41 pa...</summary><p>41 pages, 23 figures, 12 tables</p></details> |
| **[Exploring Implicit Perspectives on Autism in Large Language Models Through Multi-Agent Simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15437v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT offer potential support for autistic people, but this potential requires understanding the implicit perspectives these models might carry, including their biases and assumptions about autism. Moving beyond single-agent prompting, we utilized LLM-based multi-agent systems to investigate complex social scenarios involving autistic and non-autistic agents. In our study, agents engaged in group-task conversations and answered structured interview questions, which we analyzed to examine ChatGPT's biases and how it conceptualizes autism. We found that ChatGPT assumes autistic people are socially dependent, which may affect how it interacts with autistic users or conveys information about autism. To address these challenges, we propose adopting the double empathy problem, which reframes communication breakdowns as a mutual challenge. We describe how future LLMs could address the biases we observed and improve interactions involving autistic people by incorporating the double empathy problem into their design.</p></details> |  |
| **[Not Your Typical Sycophant: The Elusive Nature of Sycophancy in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15436v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel way to evaluate sycophancy of LLMs in a direct and neutral way, mitigating various forms of uncontrolled bias, noise, or manipulative language, deliberately injected to prompts in prior works. A key novelty in our approach is the use of LLM-as-a-judge, evaluation of sycophancy as a zero-sum game in a bet setting. Under this framework, sycophancy serves one individual (the user) while explicitly incurring cost on another. Comparing four leading models - Gemini 2.5 Pro, ChatGpt 4o, Mistral-Large-Instruct-2411, and Claude Sonnet 3.7 - we find that while all models exhibit sycophantic tendencies in the common setting, in which sycophancy is self-serving to the user and incurs no cost on others, Claude and Mistral exhibit "moral remorse" and over-compensate for their sycophancy in case it explicitly harms a third party. Additionally, we observed that all models are biased toward the answer proposed last. Crucially, we find that these two phenomena are not independent; sycophancy and recency bias interact to produce `constructive interference' effect, where the tendency to agree with the user is exacerbated when the user's opinion is presented last.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models for Heterogeneous Face Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15406v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently demonstrated strong performance on a wide range of vision-language tasks, raising interest in their potential use for biometric applications. In this paper, we conduct a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs for heterogeneous face recognition (HFR), where enrollment and probe images are from different sensing modalities, including visual (VIS), near infrared (NIR), short-wave infrared (SWIR), and thermal camera. We benchmark multiple open-source MLLMs across several cross-modality scenarios, including VIS-NIR, VIS-SWIR, and VIS-THERMAL face recognition. The recognition performance of MLLMs is evaluated using biometric protocols and based on different metrics, including Acquire Rate, Equal Error Rate (EER), and True Accept Rate (TAR). Our results reveal substantial performance gaps between MLLMs and classical face recognition systems, particularly under challenging cross-spectral conditions, in spite of recent advances in MLLMs. Our findings highlight the limitations of current MLLMs for HFR and also the importance of rigorous biometric evaluation when considering their deployment in face recognition systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Fake News Detection using Large Language Models under Adversarial Sentiment Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15277v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Misinformation and fake news have become a pressing societal challenge, driving the need for reliable automated detection methods. Prior research has highlighted sentiment as an important signal in fake news detection, either by analyzing which sentiments are associated with fake news or by using sentiment and emotion features for classification. However, this poses a vulnerability since adversaries can manipulate sentiment to evade detectors especially with the advent of large language models (LLMs). A few studies have explored adversarial samples generated by LLMs, but they mainly focus on stylistic features such as writing style of news publishers. Thus, the crucial vulnerability of sentiment manipulation remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we investigate the robustness of state-of-the-art fake news detectors under sentiment manipulation. We introduce AdSent, a sentiment-robust detection framework designed to ensure consistent veracity predictions across both original and sentiment-altered news articles. Specifically, we (1) propose controlled sentiment-based adversarial attacks using LLMs, (2) analyze the impact of sentiment shifts on detection performance. We show that changing the sentiment heavily impacts the performance of fake news detection models, indicating biases towards neutral articles being real, while non-neutral articles are often classified as fake content. (3) We introduce a novel sentiment-agnostic training strategy that enhances robustness against such perturbations. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that AdSent significantly outperforms competitive baselines in both accuracy and robustness, while also generalizing effectively to unseen datasets and adversarial scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluation of Large Language Models in Legal Applications: Challenges, Methods, and Future Directions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15267v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are being increasingly integrated into legal applications, including judicial decision support, legal practice assistance, and public-facing legal services. While LLMs show strong potential in handling legal knowledge and tasks, their deployment in real-world legal settings raises critical concerns beyond surface-level accuracy, involving the soundness of legal reasoning processes and trustworthy issues such as fairness and reliability. Systematic evaluation of LLM performance in legal tasks has therefore become essential for their responsible adoption. This survey identifies key challenges in evaluating LLMs for legal tasks grounded in real-world legal practice. We analyze the major difficulties involved in assessing LLM performance in the legal domain, including outcome correctness, reasoning reliability, and trustworthiness. Building on these challenges, we review and categorize existing evaluation methods and benchmarks according to their task design, datasets, and evaluation metrics. We further discuss the extent to which current approaches address these challenges, highlight their limitations, and outline future research directions toward more realistic, reliable, and legally grounded evaluation frameworks for LLMs in legal domains.</p></details> |  |

Developing robust perception algorithms requires large-scale, high-quality datasets that cover diverse driving conditions and support thorough evaluation. Existing datasets often lack a high-fidelity digital twin, limiting systematic testing, edge-case simulation, sensor modification, and sim-to-real evaluations. To address this gap, we present DrivIng, a large-scale multimodal dataset with a complete geo-referenced digital twin of a ~18 km route spanning urban, suburban, and highway segments. Our dataset provides continuous recordings from six RGB cameras, one LiDAR, and high-precision ADMA-based localization, captured across day, dusk, and night. All sequences are annotated at 10 Hz with 3D bounding boxes and track IDs across 12 classes, yielding ~1.2 million annotated instances. Alongside the benefits of a digital twin, DrivIng enables a 1-to-1 transfer of real traffic into simulation, preserving agent interactions while enabling realistic and flexible scenario testing. To support reproducible research and robust validation, we benchmark DrivIng with state-of-the-art perception models and publicly release the dataset, digital twin, HD map, and codebase.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium 2026.

| **[Metadata Conditioned Large Language Models for Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15236v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models are typically trained by treating text as a single global distribution, often resulting in geographically homogenized behavior. We study metadata conditioning as a lightweight approach for localization, pre-training 31 models (at 0.5B and 1B parameter scales) from scratch on large-scale English news data annotated with verified URLs, country tags, and continent tags, covering 4 continents and 17 countries. Across four controlled experiments, we show that metadata conditioning consistently improves in-region performance without sacrificing cross-region generalization, enables global models to recover localization comparable to region-specific models, and improves learning efficiency. Our ablation studies demonstrate that URL-level metadata alone captures much of the geographic signal, while balanced regional data coverage remains essential, as metadata cannot fully compensate for missing regions. Finally, we introduce a downstream benchmark of 800 localized news MCQs and show that after instruction tuning, metadata conditioned global models achieve accuracy comparable to LLaMA-3.2-1B-Instruct, despite being trained on substantially less data. Together, these results establish metadata conditioning as a practical and compute-efficient approach for localization of language models.</p></details> | under review |

A Systematic Benchmark on High-Stakes Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08134v2)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The miscalibration of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) undermines their reliability in high-stakes domains, necessitating methods to accurately estimate the confidence of their long-form, multi-step outputs. To address this gap, we introduce the Reasoning Model Confidence estimation Benchmark (RMCB), a public resource of 347,496 reasoning traces from six popular LRMs across different architectural families. The benchmark is constructed from a diverse suite of datasets spanning high-stakes domains, including clinical, financial, legal, and mathematical reasoning, alongside complex general reasoning benchmarks, with correctness annotations provided for all samples. Using RMCB, we conduct a large-scale empirical evaluation of over ten distinct representation-based methods, spanning sequential, graph-based, and text-based architectures. Our central finding is a persistent trade-off between discrimination (AUROC) and calibration (ECE): text-based encoders achieve the best AUROC (0.672), while structurally-aware models yield the best ECE (0.148), with no single method dominating both. Furthermore, we find that increased architectural complexity does not reliably outperform simpler sequential baselines, suggesting a performance ceiling for methods relying solely on chunk-level hidden states. This work provides the most comprehensive benchmark for this task to date, establishing rigorous baselines and demonstrating the limitations of current representation-based paradigms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 19th Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (EACL 2026) main conference</p></details> |
| **[From Construction to Injection: Edit-Based Fingerprints for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03122v3)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Establishing reliable and verifiable fingerprinting mechanisms is fundamental to controlling the unauthorized redistribution of large language models (LLMs). However, existing approaches face two major challenges: (a) ensuring imperceptibility, including resistance to statistical identification and avoidance of accidental activation during fingerprint construction, and (b) preserving both model utility and fingerprint detectability under subsequent model modifications. To address these challenges, we propose an end-to-end fingerprinting framework with two components. First, we design a rule-based code-mixing fingerprint (CF) that maps natural-query-like prompts to multi-candidate targets, reducing accidental triggering via high-complexity code-mixing formulations. Second, we introduce Multi-Candidate Editing (MCEdit), which jointly optimizes multi-candidate targets and enforces margins between target and non-target outputs to improve post-modification detectability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework provides a robust and practical solution for fingerprinting LLMs.</p></details> | preprint |
| **[Modeling and Statistical Characterization of Large-Scale Automotive Radar Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13645v3)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The impact of discrete clutter and co-channel interference on the performance of automotive radar networks has been studied using stochastic geometry, in particular, by leveraging two-dimensional Poisson point processes (PPPs). However, such characterization does not take into account the impact of street geometry and the fact that the location of the automotive radars are restricted to the streets as their domain rather than the entire Euclidean plane. In addition, the structure of the streets may change drastically as a vehicle moves out of a city center towards the outskirts. Consequently, not only the radar performance change but also the radar parameters and protocols must be adapted for optimum performance. In this paper, we propose and characterize line and Cox process-based street and point models to analyze large-scale automotive radar networks. We consider the classical Poisson line process (PLP) and the newly introduced Binomial line process (BLP) model to emulate the streets and the corresponding PPP-based Cox process to emulate the vehicular nodes. In particular, the BLP model effectively considers the spatial variation of street geometry across different parts of the city. We derive the effective interference set experienced by an automotive radar, the statistics of distance to interferers, and characterize the detection probability of the ego radar as a function of street and vehicle density. Finally, leveraging the real-world data on urban streets and vehicle density across different cities of the world, we present how the radar performance varies in different parts of the city as well as across different times of the day. Thus, our study equips network operators and automotive manufacturers with essential system design insights to plan and optimize automotive radar networks.</p></details> |  |

Despite successful applications of generative AI in many programming languages, there are hardly any systematic analyses of ABAP code generation to date. The aim of the study is to empirically analyze to what extent various LLMs can generate syntactically correct and functional ABAP code, how effectively they use compiler feedback for iterative improvement, and which task types pose special challenges. For this purpose, a benchmark with 180 tasks is conducted, consisting of adapted HumanEval tasks and practical SAP scenarios. The results show significant performance differences between the models: more powerful LLMs achieve success rates of around 75% after several iterations and benefit greatly from compiler feedback, while smaller models perform significantly weaker. Overall, the study highlights the high potential of powerful LLMs for ABAP development processes, especially in iterative error correction.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 10 figures, Author: Hartmut Westenberger (ORCID: 0009-0009-9063-8318)</p></details> |

However, to develop clinically useful multimodal LLM tools, high-quality benchmarks curated by domain experts are essential. To curate released and holdout datasets of 100 chest radiographic studies each and propose an artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted expert labeling procedure to allow radiologists to label studies more efficiently. A total of 13,735 deidentified chest radiographs and their corresponding reports from the MIDRC were used. GPT-4o extracted abnormal findings from the reports, which were then mapped to 12 benchmark labels with a locally hosted LLM (Phi-4-Reasoning). From these studies, 1,000 were sampled on the basis of the AI-suggested benchmark labels for expert review; the sampling algorithm ensured that the selected studies were clinically relevant and captured a range of difficulty levels. Seventeen chest radiologists participated, and they marked "Agree all", "Agree mostly" or "Disagree" to indicate their assessment of the correctness of the LLM suggested labels. Each chest radiograph was evaluated by three experts. Of these, at least two radiologists selected "Agree All" for 381 radiographs. From this set, 200 were selected, prioritizing those with less common or multiple finding labels, and divided into 100 released radiographs and 100 reserved as the holdout dataset. The holdout dataset is used exclusively by RSNA to independently evaluate different models. A benchmark of 200 chest radiographic studies with 12 benchmark labels was created and made publicly available https://imaging.rsna.org, with each chest radiograph verified by three radiologists. In addition, an AI-assisted labeling procedure was developed to help radiologists label at scale, minimize unnecessary omissions, and support a semicollaborative environment.</p></details> |  |

This study assessed the visual and cognitive demands associated with an advanced Large Language Model (LLM) conversational agent (Gemini Live) during on-road driving, comparing it against handsfree phone calls, visual turn-by-turn guidance (low load baseline), and the Operation Span (OSPAN) task (high load anchor). Thirty-two licensed drivers completed five secondary tasks while visual and cognitive demands were measured using the Detection Response Task (DRT) for cognitive load, eye-tracking for visual attention, and subjective workload ratings. Results indicated that Gemini Live interactions (both single-turn and multi-turn) and hands-free phone calls shared similar levels of cognitive load, between that of visual turn-by-turn guidance and OSPAN. Exploratory analysis showed that cognitive load remained stable across extended multi-turn conversations. All tasks maintained mean glance durations well below the well-established 2-second safety threshold, confirming low visual demand. Furthermore, drivers consistently dedicated longer glances to the roadway between brief off-road glances toward the device during task completion, particularly during voice-based interactions, rendering longer total-eyes-off-road time findings less consequential. Subjective ratings mirrored objective data, with participants reporting low effort, demands, and perceived distraction for Gemini Live. These findings demonstrate that advanced LLM conversational agents, when implemented via voice interfaces, impose cognitive and visual demands comparable to established, low-risk hands-free benchmarks, supporting their safe deployment in the driving environment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Whitening Spherical Gaussian Mixtures in the Large-Dimensional Regime](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17636v2)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whitening is a classical technique in unsupervised learning that can facilitate estimation tasks by standardizing data. An important application is the estimation of latent variable models via the decomposition of tensors built from high-order moments. In particular, whitening orthogonalizes the means of a spherical Gaussian mixture model (GMM), thereby making the corresponding moment tensor orthogonally decomposable, hence easier to decompose. However, in the large-dimensional regime (LDR) where data are high-dimensional and scarce, the standard whitening matrix built from the sample covariance becomes ineffective because the latter is spectrally distorted. Consequently, whitened means of a spherical GMM are no longer orthogonal. Using random matrix theory, we derive exact limits for their dot products, which are generally nonzero in the LDR. As our main contribution, we then construct a corrected whitening matrix that restores asymptotic orthogonality, allowing for performance gains in spherical GMM estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at ICASSP 2026</p></details> |

However, this raises concerns about sensitive data leakage. Prior methods, relying on differential privacy within device-cloud collaboration frameworks, struggle to balance privacy and utility, exposing users to inference attacks or degrading fine-tuning performance. To address this, we propose PrivTune, an efficient and privacy-preserving fine-tuning framework via Split Learning (SL). The key idea of PrivTune is to inject crafted noise into token representations from the SL bottom model, making each token resemble the $n$-hop indirect neighbors. PrivTune formulates this as an optimization problem to compute the optimal noise vector, aligning with defense-utility goals. On this basis, it then adjusts the parameters (i.e., mean) of the $d_χ$-Privacy noise distribution to align with the optimization direction and scales the noise according to token importance to minimize distortion. Experiments on five datasets (covering both classification and generation tasks) against three embedding inversion and three attribute inference attacks show that, using RoBERTa on the Stanford Sentiment Treebank dataset, PrivTune reduces the attack success rate to 10% with only a 3.33% drop in utility performance, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE INFOCOM 2026 (full version).

While PDE foundation models have shown much promise for simulating such complex spatio-temporal phenomena, existing models remain constrained by the pretraining datasets and struggle with auto-regressive rollout performance, especially in out-of-distribution (OOD) cases. Furthermore, they have significant compute and training data requirements which hamper their use in many critical applications. Inspired by recent advances in ``thinking" strategies used in large language models (LLMs), we introduce the first test-time computing (TTC) strategy for PDEs that utilizes computational resources during inference to achieve more accurate predictions with fewer training samples and smaller models. We accomplish this with two types of reward models that evaluate predictions of a stochastic based model for spatio-temporal consistency. We demonstrate this method on compressible Euler-equation simulations from the PDEGym benchmark and show that TTC captures improved predictions relative to standard non-adaptive auto-regressive inference. This TTC framework marks a foundational step towards more advanced reasoning algorithms or PDE modeling, inluding building reinforcement-learning-based approaches, potentially transforming computational workflows in physics and engineering.</p></details> |  |

Image registration, a foundational task in neuroimaging, has similarly advanced through the Learn2Reg initiative. Building on this, we introduce the Large-scale Unsupervised Brain MRI Image Registration (LUMIR) challenge, a next-generation benchmark for unsupervised brain MRI registration. Previous challenges relied upon anatomical label maps, however LUMIR provides 4,014 unlabeled T1-weighted MRIs for training, encouraging biologically plausible deformation modeling through self-supervision. Evaluation includes 590 in-domain test subjects and extensive zero-shot tasks across disease populations, imaging protocols, and species. Deep learning methods consistently achieved state-of-the-art performance and produced anatomically plausible, diffeomorphic deformation fields. They outperformed several leading optimization-based methods and remained robust to most domain shifts. These findings highlight the growing maturity of deep learning in neuroimaging registration and its potential to serve as a foundation model for general-purpose medical image registration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Theoretical Foundations of Scaling Law in Familial Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23407v2)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural scaling laws have become foundational for optimizing large language model (LLM) training, yet they typically assume a single dense model output. This limitation effectively overlooks "Familial models, a transformative paradigm essential for realizing ubiquitous intelligence across heterogeneous device-edge-cloud hierarchies. Transcending static architectures, familial models integrate early exits with relay-style inference to spawn G deployable sub-models from a single shared backbone. In this work, we theoretically and empirically extend the scaling law to capture this "one-run, many-models" paradigm by introducing Granularity (G) as a fundamental scaling variable alongside model size (N) and training tokens (D). To rigorously quantify this relationship, we propose a unified functional form L(N, D, G) and parameterize it using large-scale empirical runs. Specifically, we employ a rigorous IsoFLOP experimental design to strictly isolate architectural impact from computational scale. Across fixed budgets, we systematically sweep model sizes (N) and granularities (G) while dynamically adjusting tokens (D). This approach effectively decouples the marginal cost of granularity from the benefits of scale, ensuring high-fidelity parameterization of our unified scaling law. Our results reveal that the granularity penalty follows a multiplicative power law with an extremely small exponent. Theoretically, this bridges fixed-compute training with dynamic architectures. Practically, it validates the "train once, deploy many" paradigm, demonstrating that deployment flexibility is achievable without compromising the compute-optimality of dense baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Variability-Aware Detection and Repair of Compilation Errors Using Foundation Models in Configurable Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16755v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern software systems often rely on conditional compilation to support optional features and multiple deployment scenarios. In configurable systems, compilation errors may arise only under specific combinations of features, remaining hidden during development and testing. Such variability-induced errors are difficult to detect in practice, as traditional compilers analyze only a single configuration at a time, while existing variability-aware tools typically require complex setup and incur high analysis costs. In this article, we present an empirical study on the use of foundation models to detect and fix compilation errors caused by feature variability in configurable C systems. We evaluate GPT-OSS-20B and GEMINI 3 PRO, and compare them with TYPECHEF, a state-of-the-art variability-aware parser. Our evaluation considers two complementary settings: 5,000 small configurable systems designed to systematically exercise variability-induced compilation behavior, comprising both systems with and without compilation errors, and 14 real-world GitHub commits, as well as an additional set of mutation testing scenarios (42). Our results show that foundation models can effectively identify variability-induced compilation errors. On small configurable systems, GPT-OSS-20B achieved a precision of 0.97, recall of 0.90, and accuracy of 0.94, substantially increasing detection coverage compared to TYPECHEF, and exhibiting performance comparable to GEMINI 3. For compilation error repair, GPT-OSS-20B produced compilable fixes in over 70% of the cases. In the analysis of real commits, CHATGPT-5.2 detected all injected faults except for two cases and identified a potential real compilation bug in a Linux commit with more than 1,000 modified lines. Our findings indicate that current state-of-the-art foundation models provide a practical and low-effort complement to traditional variability-aware analyses.</p></details> |  |

However, a fundamental cognitive inconsistency exists between general visual representation and remote sensing image interpretation: remote sensing images couple topography, terrain, and spatial structure, thereby inherently requiring models to possess deep geoscientific understanding. This cognitive difference is further amplified in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery: while SAR possesses irreplaceable all-weather, all-day observation capabilities, it is constrained by coherent imaging mechanisms, exhibiting significant modal heterogeneity with general images. To address this inconsistency, we propose FUSAR-KLIP, the first knowledge-guided general multimodal foundational model for SAR, along with reusable data and evaluation baselines. Specifically: (1) FUSAR-GEOVL-1M (the first large-scale SAR dataset with complete geographic projection attributes) was constructed, covering multiple satellite platforms, 120,000 images, and 135 cities; (2) Aligned structured text was generated through hierarchical cognitive thought chains, accurately encoding more than 1 million multidimensional semantic information from geomorphological environment and regional attributes to spatial relationships; (3) A self-consistent iterative optimization mechanism was designed to guide cross-modal learning with this knowledge information consistent with human cognition and physical laws in a self-supervised closed loop consisting of contrast, matching, and reconstruction; (4) A unified evaluation benchmark was established in 11 typical downstream tasks in the two major categories of vision and language, and compared with 15 mainstream foundation models.</p></details> |  |

This work offers a rigorous, unified benchmark by using four publicly available datasets covering text and image modalities (binary and multiclass complexity) that contrasts traditional Machine Learning (ML) with contemporary transformer-based techniques. We evaluated three model classes for each task: Classical ML (LR, LightGBM, ResNet-50), Prompt-Based LLMs/VLMs (Gemini 2.5), and Fine-Tuned PEFT Models (LoRA-adapted Gemma3 variants). All experiments used consistent data splits and aligned metrics. According to our results, traditional machine learning (ML) models set a high standard by consistently achieving the best overall performance across most medical categorization tasks. This was especially true for structured text-based datasets, where the classical models performed exceptionally well. In stark contrast, the LoRA-tuned Gemma variants consistently showed the worst performance across all text and image experiments, failing to generalize from the minimal fine-tuning provided. However, the zero-shot LLM/VLM pipelines (Gemini 2.5) had mixed results; they performed poorly on text-based tasks, but demonstrated competitive performance on the multiclass image task, matching the classical ResNet-50 baseline. These results demonstrate that in many medical categorization scenarios, established machine learning models continue to be the most reliable option. The experiment suggests that foundation models are not universally superior and that the effectiveness of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) is highly dependent on the adaptation strategy, as minimal fine-tuning proved detrimental in this study.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables, paper accepted in AAIML'26 conference</p></details> |
| **[StarEmbed: Benchmarking Time Series Foundation Models on Astronomical Observations of Variable Stars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06200v2)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series foundation models (TSFMs) are increasingly being adopted as highly-capable general-purpose time series representation learners. Although their training corpora are vast, they exclude astronomical time series data. Observations of stars produce peta-scale time series with unique challenges including irregular sampling and heteroskedasticity. We introduce StarEmbed, the first public benchmark for rigorous and standardized evaluation of state-of-the-art TSFMs on stellar time series observations (``light curves''). We benchmark on three scientifically-motivated downstream tasks: unsupervised clustering, supervised classification, and out-of-distribution source detection. StarEmbed integrates a catalog of expert-vetted labels with multi-variate light curves from the Zwicky Transient Facility, yielding ~40k hand-labeled light curves spread across seven astrophysical classes. We evaluate the zero-shot representation capabilities of three TSFMs (MOIRAI, Chronos, Chronos-Bolt) and a domain-specific transformer (Astromer) against handcrafted feature extraction, the long-standing baseline in the astrophysics literature. Our results demonstrate that these TSFMs, especially the Chronos models, which are trained on data completely unlike the astronomical observations, can outperform established astrophysics-specific baselines in some tasks and effectively generalize to entirely new data. In particular, TSFMs deliver state-of-the-art performance on our out-of-distribution source detection benchmark. With the first benchmark of TSFMs on astronomical time series data, we test the limits of their generalization and motivate a paradigm shift in time-domain astronomy from using task-specific, fully supervised pipelines toward adopting generic foundation model representations for the analysis of peta-scale datasets from forthcoming observatories.</p></details> |  |
| **[VISTA-PATH: An interactive foundation model for pathology image segmentation and quantitative analysis in computational pathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16451v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate semantic segmentation for histopathology image is crucial for quantitative tissue analysis and downstream clinical modeling. Recent segmentation foundation models have improved generalization through large-scale pretraining, yet remain poorly aligned with pathology because they treat segmentation as a static visual prediction task. Here we present VISTA-PATH, an interactive, class-aware pathology segmentation foundation model designed to resolve heterogeneous structures, incorporate expert feedback, and produce pixel-level segmentation that are directly meaningful for clinical interpretation. VISTA-PATH jointly conditions segmentation on visual context, semantic tissue descriptions, and optional expert-provided spatial prompts, enabling precise multi-class segmentation across heterogeneous pathology images. To support this paradigm, we curate VISTA-PATH Data, a large-scale pathology segmentation corpus comprising over 1.6 million image-mask-text triplets spanning 9 organs and 93 tissue classes. Across extensive held-out and external benchmarks, VISTA-PATH consistently outperforms existing segmentation foundation models. Importantly, VISTA-PATH supports dynamic human-in-the-loop refinement by propagating sparse, patch-level bounding-box annotation feedback into whole-slide segmentation. Finally, we show that the high-fidelity, class-aware segmentation produced by VISTA-PATH is a preferred model for computational pathology. It improve tissue microenvironment analysis through proposed Tumor Interaction Score (TIS), which exhibits strong and significant associations with patient survival. Together, these results establish VISTA-PATH as a foundation model that elevates pathology image segmentation from a static prediction to an interactive and clinically grounded representation for digital pathology.

By conducting experiments with two recent foundational models on a multi-organ abdominal segmentation task, we reveal several facets of promptable medical segmentation, especially pertaining to reliance on visual shape and spatial cues, and the extent of resilience of models towards certain perturbations.

On the Ability of Foundation Models to Recognize Contextually Important Moments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16333v1)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models are used for many real-world applications involving language generation from temporally-ordered multimodal events. In this work, we study the ability of models to identify the most important sub-events in a video, which is a fundamental prerequisite for narrating or summarizing multimodal events. Specifically, we focus on football games and evaluate models on their ability to distinguish between important and non-important sub-events in a game. To this end, we construct a new dataset by leveraging human preferences for importance implicit in football game highlight reels, without any additional annotation costs. Using our dataset, which we will publicly release to the community, we compare several state-of-the-art multimodal models and show that they are not far from chance level performance. Analyses of models beyond standard evaluation metrics reveal their tendency to rely on a single dominant modality and their ineffectiveness in synthesizing necessary information from multiple sources. Our findings underline the importance of modular architectures that can handle sample-level heterogeneity in multimodal data and the need for complementary training procedures that can maximize cross-modal synergy.</p></details> |  |

To help address these challenges, we developed Mantis, a foundation model trained entirely on mechanistic simulations, which enables out-of-the-box forecasting across diseases, regions, and outcomes, even in settings with limited historical data. We evaluated Mantis against 48 forecasting models across six diseases with diverse modes of transmission, assessing both point forecast accuracy (mean absolute error) and probabilistic performance (weighted interval score and coverage). Despite using no real-world data during training, Mantis achieved lower mean absolute error than all models in the CDC's COVID-19 Forecast Hub when backtested on early pandemic forecasts which it had not previously seen. Across all other diseases tested, Mantis consistently ranked in the top two models across evaluation metrics. Mantis further generalized to diseases with transmission mechanisms not represented in its training data, demonstrating that it can capture fundamental contagion dynamics rather than memorizing disease-specific patterns. These capabilities illustrate that purely simulation-based foundation models such as Mantis can provide a practical foundation for disease forecasting: general-purpose, accurate, and deployable where traditional models struggle.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |
| **[DSFedMed: Dual-Scale Federated Medical Image Segmentation via Mutual Distillation Between Foundation and Lightweight Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16073v1)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation Models (FMs) have demonstrated strong generalization across diverse vision tasks. However, their deployment in federated settings is hindered by high computational demands, substantial communication overhead, and significant inference costs. We propose DSFedMed, a dual-scale federated framework that enables mutual knowledge distillation between a centralized foundation model and lightweight client models for medical image segmentation. To support knowledge distillation, a set of high-quality medical images is generated to replace real public datasets, and a learnability-guided sample selection strategy is proposed to enhance efficiency and effectiveness in dual-scale distillation. This mutual distillation enables the foundation model to transfer general knowledge to lightweight clients, while also incorporating client-specific insights to refine the foundation model. Evaluations on five medical imaging segmentation datasets show that DSFedMed achieves an average 2 percent improvement in Dice score while reducing communication costs and inference time by nearly 90 percent compared to existing federated foundation model baselines. These results demonstrate significant efficiency gains and scalability for resource-limited federated deployments.</p></details> |  |

This limits their deployment in real-world scenarios requiring flexible computeaccuracy trade-offs. We propose THOR, a "computeadaptive" foundation model that solves both input heterogeneity and deployment rigidity. THOR is the first architecture to unify data from Copernicus Sentinel-1, -2, and -3 (OLCI & SLSTR) satellites, processing their native 10 m to 1000 m resolutions in a single model. We pre-train THOR with a novel randomized patch and input image size strategy. This allows a single set of pre-trained weights to be deployed at inference with any patch size, enabling a dynamic trade-off between computational cost and feature resolution without retraining. We pre-train THOR on THOR Pretrain, a new, large-scale multi-sensor dataset and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on downstream benchmarks, particularly in data-limited regimes like the PANGAEA 10% split, validating that THOR's flexible feature generation excels for diverse climate and society applications.</p></details> | 25 pages |

Existing benchmarks attempting to measure this matter rely on synthetic, Visual Question Answer templates or focus on perceptual video quality that is tangential to measuring how well the video abides by physical laws. To address this fragmentation, we introduce PhysicsMind, a unified benchmark with both real and simulation environments that evaluates law-consistent reasoning and generation over three canonical principles: Center of Mass, Lever Equilibrium, and Newton's First Law. PhysicsMind comprises two main tasks: i) VQA tasks, testing whether models can reason and determine physical quantities and values from images or short videos, and ii) Video Generation(VG) tasks, evaluating if predicted motion trajectories obey the same center-of-mass, torque, and inertial constraints as the ground truth. A broad range of recent models and video generation models is evaluated on PhysicsMind and found to rely on appearance heuristics while often violating basic mechanics. These gaps indicate that current scaling and training are still insufficient for robust physical understanding, underscoring PhysicsMind as a focused testbed for physics-aware multimodal models. Our data will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Opening the Black Box: Preliminary Insights into Affective Modeling in Multimodal Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15906v1)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding where and how emotions are represented in large-scale foundation models remains an open problem, particularly in multimodal affective settings. Despite the strong empirical performance of recent affective models, the internal architectural mechanisms that support affective understanding and generation are still poorly understood. In this work, we present a systematic mechanistic study of affective modeling in multimodal foundation models. Across multiple architectures, training strategies, and affective tasks, we analyze how emotion-oriented supervision reshapes internal model parameters. Our results consistently reveal a clear and robust pattern: affective adaptation does not primarily focus on the attention module, but instead localizes to the feed-forward gating projection (\texttt{gate\_proj}). Through controlled module transfer, targeted single-module adaptation, and destructive ablation, we further demonstrate that \texttt{gate\_proj} is sufficient, efficient, and necessary for affective understanding and generation. Notably, by tuning only approximately 24.5\% of the parameters tuned by AffectGPT, our approach achieves 96.6\% of its average performance across eight affective tasks, highlighting substantial parameter efficiency. Together, these findings provide empirical evidence that affective capabilities in foundation models are structurally mediated by feed-forward gating mechanisms and identify \texttt{gate\_proj} as a central architectural locus of affective modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding the Transfer Limits of Vision Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15888v1)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models leverage large-scale pretraining to capture extensive knowledge, demonstrating generalization in a wide range of language tasks. By comparison, vision foundation models (VFMs) often exhibit uneven improvements across downstream tasks, despite substantial computational investment. We postulate that this limitation arises from a mismatch between pretraining objectives and the demands of downstream vision-and-imaging tasks. Pretraining strategies like masked image reconstruction or contrastive learning shape representations for tasks such as recovery of generic visual patterns or global semantic structures, which may not align with the task-specific requirements of downstream applications including segmentation, classification, or image synthesis. To investigate this in a concrete real-world clinical area, we assess two VFMs, a reconstruction-focused MAE-based model (ProFound) and a contrastive-learning-based model (ProViCNet), on five prostate multiparametric MR imaging tasks, examining how such task alignment influences transfer performance, i.e., from pretraining to fine-tuning. Our findings indicate that better alignment between pretraining and downstream tasks, measured by simple divergence metrics such as maximum-mean-discrepancy (MMD) between the same features before and after fine-tuning, correlates with greater performance improvements and faster convergence, emphasizing the importance of designing and analyzing pretraining objectives with downstream applicability in mind.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted in ISBI 2026</p></details> |

Recent large language models have opened new avenues for genomic analysis, but existing approaches are often limited by restricted training scope, constrained generative capability, or prohibitive computational cost. We introduce GENErator, a generative genomic foundation model for long-context DNA modeling, with a context length of 98k nucleotides, pre-trained on 386 billion nucleotides of eukaryotic DNA. Without task-specific fine-tuning, GENERator exhibits strong intrinsic capabilities: unsupervised embedding analyses reveal phylogenetically coherent structure, and sequence recovery benchmarks demonstrate generative accuracy comparable to or exceeding state-of-the-art models with substantially improved computational efficiency. In a zero-shot setting, GENERator achieves competitive variant effect prediction performance relative to alignment-based methods, while remaining fully alignment-free and broadly applicable across species. With task-specific fine-tuning, the model attains leading performance on established genomic benchmarks. We further demonstrate practical generative applications. GENERator can generate protein-coding DNA sequences that translate into structurally plausible proteins and, through a prompt-guided design framework, design cis-regulatory elements with targeted activity profiles, including synthetic super-enhancers validated by high-throughput UMI-STARR-seq assays. Together, these results establish GENERator as an efficient and biologically grounded framework for genomic interpretation and programmable sequence design.

We introduce SAGE-FM, a lightweight spatial transcriptomics foundation model based on graph convolutional networks (GCNs) trained with a masked central spot prediction objective. Trained on 416 human Visium samples spanning 15 organs, SAGE-FM learns spatially coherent embeddings that robustly recover masked genes, with 91% of masked genes showing significant correlations (p < 0.05). The embeddings generated by SAGE-FM outperform MOFA and existing spatial transcriptomics methods in unsupervised clustering and preservation of biological heterogeneity. SAGE-FM generalizes to downstream tasks, enabling 81% accuracy in pathologist-defined spot annotation in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma and improving glioblastoma subtype prediction relative to MOFA. In silico perturbation experiments further demonstrate that the model captures directional ligand-receptor and upstream-downstream regulatory effects consistent with ground truth. These results demonstrate that simple, parameter-efficient GCNs can serve as biologically interpretable and spatially aware foundation models for large-scale spatial transcriptomics.</p></details> | 26 pages, 5 figures |

Classical work by Holmström established that under pure self-interest, Nash equilibrium is universal shirking. While i* represents teams as composite actors, it lacks scalable computational mechanisms for analyzing how collective action problems emerge and resolve in coopetitive settings. This technical report extends computational foundations for strategic coopetition to team-level dynamics, building on companion work formalizing interdependence/complementarity (arXiv:2510.18802) and trust dynamics (arXiv:2510.24909). We develop loyalty-moderated utility functions with two mechanisms: loyalty benefit (welfare internalization plus intrinsic contribution satisfaction) and cost tolerance (reduced effort burden for loyal members). We integrate i* structural dependencies through dependency-weighted team cohesion, connecting member incentives to team-level positioning. The framework applies to both human teams (loyalty as psychological identification) and multi-agent systems (alignment coefficients and adjusted cost functions). Experimental validation across 3,125 configurations demonstrates robust loyalty effects (15.04x median effort differentiation). All six behavioral targets achieve thresholds: free-riding baseline (96.5%), loyalty monotonicity (100%), effort differentiation (100%), team size effect (100%), mechanism synergy (99.5%), and bounded outcomes (100%). Empirical validation using published Apache HTTP Server (1995-2023) case study achieves 60/60 points, reproducing contribution patterns across formation, growth, maturation, and governance phases.

However, GFMs remain constrained by in-memory bottlenecks: they attempt to encode knowledge into model parameters, which limits semantic capacity, introduces heavy lossy compression with conflicts, and entangles graph representation with the knowledge in ways that hinder efficient adaptation, undermining scalability and interpretability. In this work,we propose RAG-GFM, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation aided Graph Foundation Model that offloads knowledge from parameters and complements parameterized learning. To externalize graph knowledge, we build a dual-modal unified retrieval module, where a semantic store from prefix-structured text and a structural store from centrality-based motif. To preserve heterogeneous information, we design a dual-view alignment objective that contrasts both modalities to capture both content and relational patterns. To enable efficient downstream adaptation, we perform in-context augmentation to enrich supporting instances with retrieved texts and motifs as contextual evidence. Extensive experiments on five benchmark graph datasets demonstrate that RAG-GFM consistently outperforms 13 state-of-the-art baselines in both cross-domain node and graph classification, achieving superior effectiveness and efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the Web Conference 2026 (Research Track)</p></details> |

Unlike traditional models, which are limited to fixed-length input sizes or configurations, OmniSpectra handles spectra of any length at their original size, without resampling or interpolation. Despite the large-scale spectroscopic data from diverse surveys fueling the rapid growth of astronomy, existing foundation models are limited to a fixed wavelength range and specific instruments. OmniSpectra is the first foundation model to learn simultaneously from multiple real-world spectra surveys with different configurations at a large scale. We achieve this by designing a novel architecture with adaptive patching across variable lengths, sinusoidal global wavelength encoding, local positional embeddings through depthwise convolution, and validity-aware self-attention masks. Allowing us to learn multi-scale spatial patterns while skipping attention for invalid patches. Even with a limited training example, OmniSpectra demonstrates excellent zero-shot generalization compared to methods tailored for specific tasks. This transfer learning capability makes this model the state-of-the-art across various astronomy tasks, including source classification, redshift estimation, and properties prediction for stars and galaxies. OmniSpectra reduces the need for training individual models for different tasks from scratch, establishing itself as the next-generation astronomy foundation model.</p></details> |  |

Test-time adaptation (TTA) has recently emerged as a viable strategy to address such domain shifts at inference time without requiring access to source data or labels. However, existing TTA approaches, particularly those relying on backpropagation, are memory-intensive, limiting their applicability in speech tasks and resource-constrained settings. Although backpropagation-free methods offer improved efficiency, existing ones exhibit poor accuracy. This is because they are predominantly developed for vision tasks, which fundamentally differ from speech task formulations, noise characteristics, and model architecture, posing unique transferability challenges. In this paper, we introduce E-BATS, the first Efficient BAckpropagation-free TTA framework designed explicitly for speech foundation models. E-BATS achieves a balance between adaptation effectiveness and memory efficiency through three key components: (i) lightweight prompt adaptation for a forward-pass-based feature alignment, (ii) a multi-scale loss to capture both global (utterance-level) and local distribution shifts (token-level) and (iii) a test-time exponential moving average mechanism for stable adaptation across utterances. Experiments conducted on four noisy speech datasets spanning sixteen acoustic conditions demonstrate consistent improvements, with 4.1%-13.5% accuracy gains over backpropagation-free baselines and 2.0-6.4 times GPU memory savings compared to backpropagation-based methods. By enabling scalable and robust adaptation under acoustic variability, this work paves the way for developing more efficient adaptation approaches for practical speech processing systems in real-world environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

However, existing SFOD methods predominantly rely on internal knowledge from the source model, which limits their capacity to generalize across domains and often results in biased pseudo-labels, thereby hindering both transferability and discriminability. In contrast, Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), pretrained on massive and diverse data, exhibit strong perception capabilities and broad generalization, yet their potential remains largely untapped in the SFOD setting. In this paper, we propose a novel SFOD framework that leverages VFMs as external knowledge sources to jointly enhance feature alignment and label quality. Specifically, we design three VFM-based modules: (1) Patch-weighted Global Feature Alignment (PGFA) distills global features from VFMs using patch-similarity-based weighting to enhance global feature transferability; (2) Prototype-based Instance Feature Alignment (PIFA) performs instance-level contrastive learning guided by momentum-updated VFM prototypes; and (3) Dual-source Enhanced Pseudo-label Fusion (DEPF) fuses predictions from detection VFMs and teacher models via an entropy-aware strategy to yield more reliable supervision. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art SFOD performance, validating the effectiveness of integrating VFMs to simultaneously improve transferability and discriminability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026.

We propose CausalMixFT, a method that enhances fine-tuning robustness and downstream performance by generating structurally consistent synthetic samples using Structural Causal Models (SCMs) fitted on the target dataset. This approach augments limited real data with causally informed synthetic examples, preserving feature dependencies while expanding training diversity. Evaluated across 33 classification datasets from TabArena and over 2300 fine-tuning runs, our CausalMixFT method consistently improves median normalized ROC-AUC from 0.10 (standard fine-tuning) to 0.12, outperforming purely statistical generators such as CTGAN (-0.01), TabEBM (-0.04), and TableAugment (-0.09). Moreover, it narrows the median validation-test performance correlation gap from 0.67 to 0.30, enabling more reliable validation-based early stopping, a key step toward improving fine-tuning stability under data scarcity. These results demonstrate that incorporating causal structure into data augmentation provides an effective and principled route to fine-tuning tabular foundation models in low-data regimes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for oral presentation at the EurIPS 2025 Workshop on AI for Tabular Data (Copenhagen).

| **[On Foundation Models for Temporal Point Processes to Accelerate Scientific Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12640v2)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many scientific fields, from medicine to seismology, rely on analyzing sequences of events over time to understand complex systems. Traditionally, machine learning models must be built and trained from scratch for each new dataset, which is a slow and costly process. We introduce a new approach: a single, powerful model that learns the underlying patterns of event data in context. We trained this "foundation model" on millions of simulated event sequences, teaching it a general-purpose understanding of how events can unfold. As a result, our model can analyze new scientific data instantly, without retraining, simply by looking at a few examples from the dataset. It can also be quickly fine-tuned for even higher accuracy. This approach makes sophisticated event analysis more accessible and accelerates the pace of scientific discovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Fast Coarse-graining and Equation Discovery with Foundation Inference Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12618v2)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-dimensional recordings of dynamical processes are often characterized by a much smaller set of effective variables, evolving on low-dimensional manifolds. Identifying these latent dynamics requires solving two intertwined problems: discovering appropriate coarse-grained variables and simultaneously fitting the governing equations. Most machine learning approaches tackle these tasks jointly by training autoencoders together with models that enforce dynamical consistency. We propose to decouple the two problems by leveraging the recently introduced Foundation Inference Models (FIMs). FIMs are pretrained models that estimate the infinitesimal generators of dynamical systems (e.g., the drift and diffusion of a stochastic differential equation) in zero-shot mode. By amortizing the inference of the dynamics through a FIM with frozen weights, and training only the encoder-decoder map, we define a simple, simulation-consistent loss that stabilizes representation learning. A proof of concept on a stochastic double-well system with semicircle diffusion, embedded into synthetic video data, illustrates the potential of this approach for fast and reusable coarse-graining pipelines.</p></details> |  |
| **[GeoSurDepth: Harnessing Foundation Model for Spatial Geometry Consistency-Oriented Self-Supervised Surround-View Depth Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05839v2)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate surround-view depth estimation provides a competitive alternative to laser-based sensors and is essential for 3D scene understanding in autonomous driving. While empirical studies have proposed various approaches that primarily focus on enforcing cross-view constraints at photometric level, few explicitly exploit the rich geometric structure inherent in both monocular and surround-view setting. In this work, we propose GeoSurDepth, a framework that leverages geometry consistency as the primary cue for surround-view depth estimation. Concretely, we utilize vision foundation models as pseudo geometry priors and feature representation enhancement tool to guide the network to maintain surface normal consistency in spatial 3D space and regularize object- and texture-consistent depth estimation in 2D. In addition, we introduce a novel view synthesis pipeline where 2D-3D lifting is achieved with dense depth reconstructed via spatial warping, encouraging additional photometric supervision across temporal and spatial contexts, and compensating for the limitations of target-view image reconstruction. Finally, a newly-proposed adaptive joint motion learning strategy enables the network to adaptively emphasize informative spatial geometry cues for improved motion reasoning. Extensive experiments on KITTI, DDAD and nuScenes demonstrate that GeoSurDepth achieves SoTA performance, validating the effectiveness of our approach. Our framework highlights the importance of exploiting geometry coherence and consistency for robust self-supervised depth estimation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaling Laws for Geospatial Foundation Models: A case study on PhilEO Bench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14765v5)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation Models (FMs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance across domains by leveraging large-scale pretraining. In Earth Observation (EO), the availability of petabyte-scale satellite archives has recently enabled the development of GeoSpatial Foundation Models (GFMs). Yet, fundamental questions remain regarding how dataset size, model architecture, and size interact to determine downstream performance. In this work, we systematically explore this design space by pretraining and fine-tuning models on three dataset scales: PhilEO Globe (0.5TB), FastTOM (2TB, introduced here), and MajorTOM (23TB). We evaluate three architectural families: Geo-Aware U-Net (CNN), ViT-UPerNet (Transformer), and Mamba (State-Space Model); across model sizes ranging from 44M to 300M parameters. All models are benchmarked on the PhilEO Bench, covering: road density and building density regression, and land cover segmentation, and are compared against existing GFMs such as TerraMind and Prithvi-EO-2.0. Our results show that CNN-based models remain highly competitive in low-shot settings, with a 200M-parameter Geo-Aware U-Net outperforming larger architectures on regression tasks. However, when scaling to multi-terabyte datasets, ViT-UPerNet achieves the best performance, particularly for semantic segmentation on MajorTOM (23TB). Finally, we provide the first extensive evaluation of Mamba models in EO, highlighting their potential efficiency advantages, though further large-scale pretraining is required to fully match CNNs and ViTs. All code, pretrained models, and the FastTOM dataset are released publicly, enabling reproducibility and further exploration of scaling laws for GFMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 12 figures, 3 tables, Submitted</p></details> |

| **[TVWorld: Foundations for Remote-Control TV Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13142v1)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated strong potential for device control. However, existing research has primarily focused on point-and-click (PnC) interaction, while remote-control (RC) interaction commonly encountered in everyday TV usage remains largely underexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce \textbf{TVWorld}, an offline graph-based abstraction of real-world TV navigation that enables reproducible and deployment-free evaluation. On this basis, we derive two complementary benchmarks that comprehensively assess TV-use capabilities: \textbf{TVWorld-N} for topology-aware navigation and \textbf{TVWorld-G} for focus-aware grounding. These benchmarks expose a key limitation of existing agents: insufficient topology awareness for focus-based, long-horizon TV navigation. Motivated by this finding, we propose a \emph{Topology-Aware Training} framework that injects topology awareness into LVLMs. Using this framework, we develop \textbf{TVTheseus}, a foundation model specialized for TV navigation. TVTheseus achieves a success rate of $68.3\%$ on TVWorld-N, surpassing strong closed-source baselines such as Gemini 3 Flash and establishing state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. Additional analyses further provide valuable insights into the development of effective TV-use agents.</p></details> |  |

The advancement of video-text research has spurred growing interest in extending image-based models to the video domain. This paradigm, termed as image-to-video transfer learning, effectively mitigates the substantial data and computational demands compared to training video-language models from scratch while achieves comparable or even stronger model performance. This survey provides the first comprehensive review of this emerging field, which begins by summarizing the widely used ILFMs and their capabilities. We then systematically classify existing image-to-video transfer learning techniques into two broad root categories (frozen features and adapted features), along with numerous fine-grained subcategories, based on the paradigm for transferring image understanding capability to video tasks. Building upon the task-specific nature of image-to-video transfer, this survey methodically elaborates these strategies and details their applications across a spectrum of video-text learning tasks, ranging from fine-grained settings (e.g., spatio-temporal video grounding) to coarse-grained ones (e.g., video question answering). We further present a detailed experimental analysis to investigate the efficacy of different image-to-video transfer learning paradigms on a range of downstream video understanding tasks. Finally, we identify prevailing challenges and highlight promising directions for future research. By offering a comprehensive and structured overview, this survey aims to establish a structured roadmap for advancing video-text learning based on existing ILFM, and to inspire future research directions in this rapidly evolving domain.

We introduce SDF-HOLO (Systemic Dual-stream Fusion Holo Model), a multimodal foundation model for holistic total-body PET/CT, pre-trained on more than 10,000 patients. SDF-HOLO decouples CT and PET representation learning with dual-stream encoders and couples them through a cross-modal interaction module, allowing anatomical context to refine PET aggregation while metabolic saliency guides subtle morphological reasoning. To model long-range dependencies across the body, hierarchical context modeling combines efficient local windows with global attention. To bridge voxels and clinical language, we use anatomical segmentation masks as explicit semantic anchors and perform voxel-mask-text alignment during pre-training. Across tumor segmentation, low-dose lesion detection, and multilingual diagnostic report generation, SDF-HOLO outperforms strong task-specific and clinical-reference baselines while reducing localization errors and hallucinated findings. Beyond focal interpretation, the model enables system-wide metabolic profiling and reveals tumor-associated fingerprints of inter-organ metabolic network interactions, providing a scalable computational foundation for total-body PET/CT diagnostics and system-level precision oncology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distilling Time Series Foundation Models for Efficient Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12785v1)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time Series foundation models (TSFMs) deliver strong forecasting performance through large-scale pretraining, but their large parameter sizes make deployment costly. While knowledge distillation offers a natural and effective approach for model compression, techniques developed for general machine learning tasks are not directly applicable to time series forecasting due to the unique characteristics. To address this, we present DistilTS, the first distillation framework specifically designed for TSFMs. DistilTS addresses two key challenges: (1) task difficulty discrepancy, specific to forecasting, where uniform weighting makes optimization dominated by easier short-term horizons, while long-term horizons receive weaker supervision; and (2) architecture discrepancy, a general challenge in distillation, for which we design an alignment mechanism in the time series forecasting. To overcome these issues, DistilTS introduces horizon-weighted objectives to balance learning across horizons, and a temporal alignment strategy that reduces architectural mismatch, enabling compact models. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that DistilTS achieves forecasting performance comparable to full-sized TSFMs, while reducing parameters by up to 1/150 and accelerating inference by up to 6000x. Code is available at: https://github.com/itsnotacie/DistilTS-ICASSP2026.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICASSP-2026</p></details> |
| **[Quantum Blockchain Survey: Foundations, Trends, and Gaps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13720v2)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum computing poses fundamental risks to classical blockchain systems by undermining widely used cryptographic primitives. In response, two major research directions have emerged: post-quantum blockchains, which integrate quantum-resistant algorithms, and quantum blockchains, which leverage quantum properties such as entanglement and quantum key distribution. This survey reviews key developments in both areas, analyzing their cryptographic foundations, architectural designs, and implementation challenges. This work provides a comparative overview of technical proposals, highlight trade-offs in security, scalability, and deployment, and identify open research problems across hardware, consensus, and network design. The goal is to offer a structured and comprehensive reference for advancing secure blockchain systems in the quantum era.</p></details> | 12 Pages, 4 figures |
| **[MOMEMTO: Patch-based Memory Gate Model in Time Series Foundation Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18751v2)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently reconstruction-based deep models have been widely used for time series anomaly detection, but as their capacity and generalization capability increase, these models tend to over-generalize, often reconstructing unseen anomalies accurately. Prior works have attempted to mitigate this by incorporating a memory architecture that stores prototypes of normal patterns. Nevertheless, these approaches suffer from high training costs and have yet to be effectively integrated with time series foundation models (TFMs). To address these challenges, we propose MOMEMTO, an improved variant of TFM for anomaly detection, enhanced with a patch-based memory module to mitigate over-generalization. The memory module is designed to capture representative normal patterns from multiple domains and enables a single model to be jointly fine-tuned across multiple datasets through a multi-domain training strategy. MOMEMTO initializes memory items with latent representations from a pre-trained encoder, organizes them into patch-level units, and updates them via an attention mechanism. We evaluate our method using 23 univariate benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that MOMEMTO, as a single model, achieves higher scores on AUC and VUS metrics compared to baseline methods, and further enhances the performance of its backbone TFM, particularly in few-shot learning scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Promise of Time-Series Foundation Models for Agricultural Forecasting: Evidence from Commodity Prices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06371v2)** | 2026-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting agricultural markets remains challenging due to nonlinear dynamics, structural breaks, and sparse data. A long-standing belief holds that simple time-series methods outperform more advanced alternatives. This paper provides the first systematic evidence that this belief no longer holds with modern time-series foundation models (TSFMs). Using USDA ERS monthly commodity price data from 1997-2025, we evaluate 17 forecasting approaches across four model classes, including traditional time-series, machine learning, deep learning, and five state-of-the-art TSFMs (Chronos, Chronos-2, TimesFM 2.5, Time-MoE, Moirai-2), and construct annual marketing year price predictions to compare with USDA's futures-based season-average price (SAP) forecasts. We show that zero-shot foundation models consistently outperform traditional time-series methods, machine learning, and deep learning architectures trained from scratch in both monthly and annual forecasting. Furthermore, foundation models remarkably outperform USDA's futures-based forecasts on three of four major commodities despite USDA's information advantage from forward-looking futures markets. Time-MoE delivers the largest accuracy gains, achieving 54.9% improvement on wheat and 18.5% improvement on corn relative to USDA ERS benchmarks on recent data (2017-2024 excluding COVID). These results point to a paradigm shift in agricultural forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Hierarchical Benchmark of Foundation Models for Dermatology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12382v1)** | 2026-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have transformed medical image analysis by providing robust feature representations that reduce the need for large-scale task-specific training. However, current benchmarks in dermatology often reduce the complex diagnostic taxonomy to flat, binary classification tasks, such as distinguishing melanoma from benign nevi. This oversimplification obscures a model's ability to perform fine-grained differential diagnoses, which is critical for clinical workflow integration. This study evaluates the utility of embeddings derived from ten foundation models, spanning general computer vision, general medical imaging, and dermatology-specific domains, for hierarchical skin lesion classification. Using the DERM12345 dataset, which comprises 40 lesion subclasses, we calculated frozen embeddings and trained lightweight adapter models using a five-fold cross-validation. We introduce a hierarchical evaluation framework that assesses performance across four levels of clinical granularity: 40 Subclasses, 15 Main Classes, 2 and 4 Superclasses, and Binary Malignancy. Our results reveal a "granularity gap" in model capabilities: MedImageInsights achieved the strongest overall performance (97.52% weighted F1-Score on Binary Malignancy detection) but declined to 65.50% on fine-grained 40-class subtype classification. Conversely, MedSigLip (69.79%) and dermatology-specific models (Derm Foundation and MONET) excelled at fine-grained 40-class subtype discrimination while achieving lower overall performance than MedImageInsights on broader classification tasks. Our findings suggest that while general medical foundation models are highly effective for high-level screening, specialized modeling strategies are necessary for the granular distinctions required in diagnostic support systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[DepthCropSeg++: Scaling a Crop Segmentation Foundation Model With Depth-Labeled Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12366v1)** | 2026-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>DepthCropSeg++: a foundation model for crop segmentation, capable of segmenting different crop species under open in-field environment. Crop segmentation is a fundamental task for modern agriculture, which closely relates to many downstream tasks such as plant phenotyping, density estimation, and weed control. In the era of foundation models, a number of generic large language and vision models have been developed. These models have demonstrated remarkable real world generalization due to significant model capacity and largescale datasets. However, current crop segmentation models mostly learn from limited data due to expensive pixel-level labelling cost, often performing well only under specific crop types or controlled environment. In this work, we follow the vein of our previous work DepthCropSeg, an almost unsupervised approach to crop segmentation, to scale up a cross-species and crossscene crop segmentation dataset, with 28,406 images across 30+ species and 15 environmental conditions. We also build upon a state-of-the-art semantic segmentation architecture ViT-Adapter architecture, enhance it with dynamic upsampling for improved detail awareness, and train the model with a two-stage selftraining pipeline. To systematically validate model performance, we conduct comprehensive experiments to justify the effectiveness and generalization capabilities across multiple crop datasets. Results demonstrate that DepthCropSeg++ achieves 93.11% mIoU on a comprehensive testing set, outperforming both supervised baselines and general-purpose vision foundation models like Segmentation Anything Model (SAM) by significant margins (+0.36% and +48.57% respectively). The model particularly excels in challenging scenarios including night-time environment (86.90% mIoU), high-density canopies (90.09% mIoU), and unseen crop varieties (90.09% mIoU), indicating a new state of the art for crop segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 15 figures and 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[SLIM-Brain: A Data- and Training-Efficient Foundation Model for fMRI Data Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21881v2)** | 2026-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models are emerging as a powerful paradigm for fMRI analysis, but current approaches face a dual bottleneck of data- and training-efficiency. Atlas-based methods aggregate voxel signals into fixed regions of interest, reducing data dimensionality but discarding fine-grained spatial details, and requiring extremely large cohorts to train effectively as general-purpose foundation models. Atlas-free methods, on the other hand, operate directly on voxel-level information - preserving spatial fidelity but are prohibitively memory- and compute-intensive, making large-scale pre-training infeasible. We introduce SLIM-Brain (Sample-efficient, Low-memory fMRI Foundation Model for Human Brain), a new atlas-free foundation model that simultaneously improves both data- and training-efficiency. SLIM-Brain adopts a two-stage adaptive design: (i) a lightweight temporal extractor captures global context across full sequences and ranks data windows by saliency, and (ii) a 4D hierarchical encoder (Hiera-JEPA) learns fine-grained voxel-level representations only from the top-$k$ selected windows, while deleting about 70% masked patches. Extensive experiments across seven public benchmarks show that SLIM-Brain establishes new state-of-the-art performance on diverse tasks, while requiring only 4 thousand pre-training sessions and approximately 30% of GPU memory comparing to traditional voxel-level methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Wavelet-Driven Masked Multiscale Reconstruction for PPG Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12215v1)** | 2026-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Wearable foundation models have the potential to transform digital health by learning transferable representations from large-scale biosignals collected in everyday settings. While recent progress has been made in large-scale pretraining, most approaches overlook the spectral structure of photoplethysmography (PPG) signals, wherein physiological rhythms unfold across multiple frequency bands. Motivated by the insight that many downstream health-related tasks depend on multi-resolution features spanning fine-grained waveform morphology to global rhythmic dynamics, we introduce Masked Multiscale Reconstruction (MMR) for PPG representation learning - a self-supervised pretraining framework that explicitly learns from hierarchical time-frequency scales of PPG data. The pretraining task is designed to reconstruct randomly masked out coefficients obtained from a wavelet-based multiresolution decomposition of PPG signals, forcing the transformer encoder to integrate information across temporal and spectral scales. We pretrain our model with MMR using ~17 million unlabeled 10-second PPG segments from ~32,000 smartwatch users. On 17 of 19 diverse health-related tasks, MMR trained on large-scale wearable PPG data improves over or matches state-of-the-art open-source PPG foundation models, time-series foundation models, and other self-supervised baselines. Extensive analysis of our learned embeddings and systematic ablations underscores the value of wavelet-based representations, showing that they capture robust and physiologically-grounded features. Together, these results highlight the potential of MMR as a step toward generalizable PPG foundation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhanced Diagnostic Performance via Large-Resolution Inference Optimization for Pathology Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12150v1)** | 2026-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite their prominent performance on tasks such as ROI classification and segmentation, many pathology foundation models remain constrained by a specific input size e.g. 224 x 224, creating substantial inefficiencies when applied to whole-slide images (WSIs), which span thousands of resolutions. A naive strategy is to either enlarge inputs or downsample the WSIs. However, enlarging inputs results in prohibitive GPU memory consumption, while downsampling alters the microns-per-pixel resolution and obscures critical morphological details. To overcome these limitations, we propose an space- and time- efficient inference strategy that sparsifies attention using spatially aware neighboring blocks and filters out non-informative tokens through global attention scores. This design substantially reduces GPU memory and runtime during high-resolution WSI inference while preserving and even improving the downstream performance, enabling inference at higher resolutions under the same GPU budget. The experimental results show that our method can achieves up to an 7.67% improvement in the ROI classification and compatible results in segmentation.</p></details> | 8 pages |

Block low-rank (BLR) compression techniques address this challenge by learning compact representations of weight matrices. While traditional low-rank (LR) methods often incur sharp accuracy drops, BLR approaches such as Monarch and BLAST can better capture the underlying structure, thus preserving accuracy while reducing computations and memory footprints. In this work, we use roofline analysis to show that, although BLR methods achieve theoretical savings and practical speedups for single-token inference, multi-token inference often becomes memory-bound in practice, increasing latency despite compiler-level optimizations in PyTorch. To address this, we introduce custom Triton kernels with partial fusion and memory layout optimizations for both Monarch and BLAST. On memory-constrained NVIDIA GPUs such as Jetson Orin Nano and A40, our kernels deliver up to $3.76\times$ speedups and $3\times$ model size compression over PyTorch dense baselines using CUDA backend and compiler-level optimizations, while supporting various models including Llama-7/1B, GPT2-S, DiT-XL/2, and ViT-B.

Current approaches focus on single-table generalization or schema-level relationships, fundamentally missing the operational knowledge that gives data meaning. We introduce Semantically Linked Tables (SLT) and Foundation Models for SLT (FMSLT) as a new model class that grounds tabular data in its operational context. We propose dual-phase training: pre-training on open-source code-data pairs and synthetic systems to learn business logic mechanics, followed by zero-shot inference on proprietary data. We introduce the ``Operational Turing Test'' benchmark and argue that operational grounding is essential for autonomous agents in complex data environments.</p></details> |  |

Substantially extending our preliminary conference version, we present FactoST-v2, an enhanced factorized framework redesigned for full weight transfer and arbitrary-length generalization. FactoST-v2 decouples universal temporal learning from domain-specific spatial adaptation. The first stage pretrains a minimalist encoder-only backbone using randomized sequence masking to capture invariant temporal dynamics, enabling probabilistic quantile prediction across variable horizons. The second stage employs a streamlined adapter to rapidly inject spatial awareness via meta adaptive learning and prompting. Comprehensive evaluations across diverse domains demonstrate that FactoST-v2 achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with linear efficiency - significantly outperforming existing foundation models in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios while rivaling domain-specific expert baselines. This factorized paradigm offers a practical, scalable path toward truly universal STFMs. Code is available at https://github.com/CityMind-Lab/FactoST.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is an extended version of the paper presented at NeurIPS 2025.

| **[A New Strategy for Artificial Intelligence: Training Foundation Models Directly on Human Brain Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12053v1)** | 2026-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While foundation models have achieved remarkable results across a diversity of domains, they still rely on human-generated data, such as text, as a fundamental source of knowledge. However, this data is ultimately the product of human brains, the filtered projection of a deeper neural complexity. In this paper, we explore a new strategy for artificial intelligence: moving beyond surface-level statistical regularities by training foundation models directly on human brain data. We hypothesize that neuroimaging data could open a window into elements of human cognition that are not accessible through observable actions, and argue that this additional knowledge could be used, alongside classical training data, to overcome some of the current limitations of foundation models. While previous research has demonstrated the possibility to train classical machine learning or deep learning models on neural patterns, this path remains largely unexplored for high-level cognitive functions. Here, we classify the current limitations of foundation models, as well as the promising brain regions and cognitive processes that could be leveraged to address them, along four levels: perception, valuation, execution, and integration. Then, we propose two methods that could be implemented to prioritize the use of limited neuroimaging data for strategically chosen, high-value steps in foundation model training: reinforcement learning from human brain (RLHB) and chain of thought from human brain (CoTHB). We also discuss the potential implications for agents, artificial general intelligence, and artificial superintelligence, as well as the ethical, social, and technical challenges and opportunities. We argue that brain-trained foundation models could represent a realistic and effective middle ground between continuing to scale current architectures and exploring alternative, neuroscience-inspired solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[TabDPT: Scaling Tabular Foundation Models on Real Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18164v3)** | 2026-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tabular data is one of the most ubiquitous sources of information worldwide, spanning a wide variety of domains. This inherent heterogeneity has slowed the development of Tabular Foundation Models (TFMs) capable of fast generalization to unseen datasets. In-Context Learning (ICL) has recently emerged as a promising solution for TFMs, enabling dynamic adaptation to new tasks without additional tuning. While many studies have attempted to re-purpose large language models for tabular ICL, they have had limited success, so recent works have focused on developing tabular-specific foundation models. In this work, we propose an approach to combine ICL-based retrieval with self supervised learning to train tabular foundation models. We also investigate the utility of real vs. synthetic data for model pre-training, and show that real data can contain useful signal not easily captured in synthetic training. Specifically, we show that incorporating real data during the pre-training phase can lead to significantly faster training and better downstream generalization to unseen data. Our resulting model, TabDPT, achieves strong performance on both regression (CTR23) and classification (CC18) benchmarks. Importantly, we also demonstrate that with our pre-training procedure, scaling both model and data size leads to consistent performance improvements that follow power laws. This echoes scaling laws in LLMs and other foundation models, and suggests that large-scale TFMs can be achievable. We open-source our full pipeline: inference code including trained model weights can be found at github.com/layer6ai-labs/TabDPT-inference, and the training code to reproduce experiments can be found at github.com/layer6ai-labs/TabDPT-training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Infer...</summary><p>Inference repo: github.com/layer6ai-labs/TabDPT-inference; Training repo: github.com/layer6ai-labs/TabDPT-training</p></details> |
| **[Shapelets-Enriched Selective Forecasting using Time Series Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11821v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series foundation models have recently gained a lot of attention due to their ability to model complex time series data encompassing different domains including traffic, energy, and weather. Although they exhibit strong average zero-shot performance on forecasting tasks, their predictions on certain critical regions of the data are not always reliable, limiting their usability in real-world applications, especially when data exhibits unique trends. In this paper, we propose a selective forecasting framework to identify these critical segments of time series using shapelets. We learn shapelets using shift-invariant dictionary learning on the validation split of the target domain dataset. Utilizing distance-based similarity to these shapelets, we facilitate the user to selectively discard unreliable predictions and be informed of the model's realistic capabilities. Empirical results on diverse benchmark time series datasets demonstrate that our approach leveraging both zero-shot and full-shot fine-tuned models reduces the overall error by an average of 22.17% for zero-shot and 22.62% for full-shot fine-tuned model. Furthermore, our approach using zero-shot and full-shot fine-tuned models, also outperforms its random selection counterparts by up to 21.41% and 21.43% on one of the datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the AAAI-26 Workshop on Artificial Intelligence for Time Series Analysis (AI4TS)</p></details> |
| **[Assessing the value of Geo-Foundational Models for Flood Inundation Mapping: Benchmarking models for Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and Planetscope for end-users](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01990v3)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Geo-Foundational Models (GFMs) enable fast and reliable extraction of spatiotemporal information from satellite imagery, improving flood inundation mapping by leveraging location and time embeddings. Despite their potential, it remains unclear whether GFMs outperform traditional models like U-Net. A systematic comparison across sensors and data availability scenarios is still lacking, which is an essential step to guide end-users in model selection. To address this, we evaluate three GFMs, Prithvi 2.0, Clay V1.5, DOFA, and UViT (a Prithvi variant), against TransNorm, U-Net, and Attention U-Net using PlanetScope, Sentinel-1, and Sentinel-2. We observe competitive performance among all GFMs, with only 2-5% variation between the best and worst models across sensors. Clay outperforms others on PlanetScope (0.79 mIoU) and Sentinel-2 (0.70), while Prithvi leads on Sentinel-1 (0.57). In leave-one-region-out cross-validation across five regions, Clay shows slightly better performance across all sensors (mIoU: 0.72(0.04), 0.66(0.07), 0.51(0.08)) compared to Prithvi (0.70(0.05), 0.64(0.09), 0.49(0.13)) and DOFA (0.67(0.07), 0.64(0.04), 0.49(0.09)) for PlanetScope, Sentinel-2, and Sentinel-1, respectively. Across all 19 sites, leave-one-region-out cross-validation reveals a 4% improvement by Clay compared to U-Net. Visual inspection highlights Clay's superior ability to retain fine details. Few-shot experiments show Clay achieves 0.64 mIoU on PlanetScope with just five training images, outperforming Prithvi (0.24) and DOFA (0.35). In terms of computational time, Clay is a better choice due to its smaller model size (26M parameters), making it ~3x faster than Prithvi (650M) and 2x faster than DOFA (410M). Contrary to previous findings, our results suggest GFMs offer small to moderate improvements in flood mapping accuracy at lower computational cost and labeling effort compared to traditional U-Net.</p></details> |  |
| **[SpaRRTa: A Synthetic Benchmark for Evaluating Spatial Intelligence in Visual Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11729v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), such as DINO and CLIP, excel in semantic understanding of images but exhibit limited spatial reasoning capabilities, which limits their applicability to embodied systems. As a result, recent work incorporates some 3D tasks (such as depth estimation) into VFM training. However, VFM performance remains inconsistent across other spatial tasks, raising the question of whether these models truly have spatial awareness or overfit to specific 3D objectives. To address this question, we introduce the Spatial Relation Recognition Task (SpaRRTa) benchmark, which evaluates the ability of VFMs to identify relative positions of objects in the image. Unlike traditional 3D objectives that focus on precise metric prediction (e.g., surface normal estimation), SpaRRTa probes a fundamental capability underpinning more advanced forms of human-like spatial understanding. SpaRRTa generates an arbitrary number of photorealistic images with diverse scenes and fully controllable object arrangements, along with freely accessible spatial annotations. Evaluating a range of state-of-the-art VFMs, we reveal significant disparities between their spatial reasoning abilities. Through our analysis, we provide insights into the mechanisms that support or hinder spatial awareness in modern VFMs. We hope that SpaRRTa will serve as a useful tool for guiding the development of future spatially aware visual models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page is available at https://sparrta.gmum.net/</p></details> |

Existing lightweight variants predominantly compress the denoising U-Net or reduce the diffusion trajectory, which disrupts the underlying latent manifold and limits generalization beyond a single task. We introduce NanoSD, a family of Pareto-optimal diffusion foundation models distilled from Stable Diffusion 1.5 through network surgery, feature-wise generative distillation, and structured architectural scaling jointly applied to the U-Net and the VAE encoder-decoder. This full-pipeline co-design preserves the generative prior while producing models that occupy distinct operating points along the accuracy-latency-size frontier (e.g., 130M-315M parameters, achieving real-time inference down to 20ms on mobile-class NPUs). We show that parameter reduction alone does not correlate with hardware efficiency, and we provide an analysis revealing how architectural balance, feature routing, and latent-space preservation jointly shape true on-device latency. When used as a drop-in backbone, NanoSD enables state-of-the-art performance across image super-resolution, image deblurring, face restoration, and monocular depth estimation, outperforming prior lightweight diffusion models in both perceptual quality and practical deployability. NanoSD establishes a general-purpose diffusion foundation model family suitable for real-time visual generation and restoration on edge devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to CVPR 2026</p></details> |
| **[ProSGNeRF: Progressive Dynamic Neural Scene Graph with Frequency Modulated Foundation Model in Urban Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09076v3)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Implicit neural representation has demonstrated promising results in 3D reconstruction on various scenes. However, existing approaches either struggle to model fast-moving objects or are incapable of handling large-scale camera ego-motions in urban environments. This leads to low-quality synthesized views of the large-scale urban scenes. In this paper, we aim to jointly solve the problems caused by large-scale scenes and fast-moving vehicles, which are more practical and challenging. To this end, we propose a progressive scene graph network architecture to learn the local scene representations of dynamic objects and global urban scenes. The progressive learning architecture dynamically allocates a new local scene graph trained on frames within a temporal window, with the window size automatically determined, allowing us to scale up the representation to arbitrarily large scenes. Besides, according to our observations, the training views of dynamic objects are relatively sparse according to rapid movements, which leads to a significant decline in reconstruction accuracy for dynamic objects. Therefore, we utilize a foundation model network to encode the latent code. Specifically, we leverage the generalization capability of the visual foundation model DINOv2 to extract appearance and shape codes, and train the network on a large-scale urban scene object dataset to enhance its prior modeling ability for handling sparse-view dynamic inputs. In parallel, we introduce a frequency-modulated module that regularizes the frequency spectrum of objects, thereby addressing the challenge of modeling sparse image inputs from a frequency-domain perspective. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art view synthesis accuracy, object manipulation, and scene roaming ability in various scenes.</p></details> |  |

Yet conventional Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions in aviation remain siloed and narrow, focusing on isolated tasks or single modalities. They struggle to integrate heterogeneous data such as voice communications, radar tracks, sensor streams and textual reports, which limits situational awareness, adaptability, and real-time decision support. This paper introduces the vision of AviationLMM, a Large Multimodal foundation Model for civil aviation, designed to unify the heterogeneous data streams of civil aviation and enable understanding, reasoning, generation and agentic applications. We firstly identify the gaps between existing AI solutions and requirements. Secondly, we describe the model architecture that ingests multimodal inputs such as air-ground voice, surveillance, on-board telemetry, video and structured texts, and performs cross-modal alignment and fusion, and produces flexible outputs ranging from situation summaries and risk alerts to predictive diagnostics and multimodal incident reconstructions. In order to fully realize this vision, we identify key research opportunities to address, including data acquisition, alignment and fusion, pretraining, reasoning, trustworthiness, privacy, robustness to missing modalities, and synthetic scenario generation. By articulating the design and challenges of AviationLMM, we aim to boost the civil aviation foundation model progress and catalyze coordinated research efforts toward an integrated, trustworthy and privacy-preserving aviation AI ecosystem.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 2025 7th International Conference on Interdisciplinary Computer Science and Engineering (ICICSE 2025), Chongqing, China; 9 pages,1 figure,5 tables</p></details> |

However, their direct applicability to medical image segmentation remains limited by severe domain shifts, the absence of privileged spatial prompts, and the need to reason over complex anatomical and volumetric structures. Here we present Medical SAM3, a foundation model for universal prompt-driven medical image segmentation, obtained by fully fine-tuning SAM3 on large-scale, heterogeneous 2D and 3D medical imaging datasets with paired segmentation masks and text prompts. Through a systematic analysis of vanilla SAM3, we observe that its performance degrades substantially on medical data, with its apparent competitiveness largely relying on strong geometric priors such as ground-truth-derived bounding boxes. These findings motivate full model adaptation beyond prompt engineering alone. By fine-tuning SAM3's model parameters on 33 datasets spanning 10 medical imaging modalities, Medical SAM3 acquires robust domain-specific representations while preserving prompt-driven flexibility. Extensive experiments across organs, imaging modalities, and dimensionalities demonstrate consistent and significant performance gains, particularly in challenging scenarios characterized by semantic ambiguity, complex morphology, and long-range 3D context. Our results establish Medical SAM3 as a universal, text-guided segmentation foundation model for medical imaging and highlight the importance of holistic model adaptation for achieving robust prompt-driven segmentation under severe domain shift.

Using the HiQ dataset (U.S., 2000-2022), we systematically compare statistical baselines, a fully supervised LSTM, and the Sundial foundation model under multiple evaluation protocols. We find that Sundial, in the zero-shot setting, can outperform a fully trained LSTM provided that the input context window is sufficiently long-specifically, when covering more than one or two full seasonal cycles. We show that a general-purpose foundation model can surpass specialized supervised models on remote-sensing time series prediction without any task-specific tuning. These results highlight the strong potential of pretrained time series foundation models to serve as effective plug-and-play forecasters in agricultural and environmental applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 5 figures, AAAI 2026 AgriAI workshop</p></details> |

Existing evaluations often rely on downstream fine-tuning with linear heads or task-specific decoders, making it difficult to isolate the intrinsic 3D reasoning ability of pre-trained encoders. In this work, we introduce a novel benchmark for in-context 3D scene understanding that requires no fine-tuning and directly probes the quality of dense visual features. Building on the Hummingbird framework, which evaluates in-context 2D scene understanding, we extend the setup to the 3D Multi-View ImageNet (MVImgNet) dataset. Given a set of images depicting objects at specific camera angles (keys), we benchmark the performance of segmenting novel views (queries) and report the scores in 4 categories of easy, medium, hard, and extreme based on the key-query view contrast. We benchmark 7 state-of-the-art foundation models and show that DINO-based encoders remain competitive across large viewpoint shifts.

| **[See Less, Drive Better: Generalizable End-to-End Autonomous Driving via Foundation Models Stochastic Patch Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10707v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in end-to-end autonomous driving show that policies trained on patch-aligned features extracted from foundation models generalize better to Out-of-Distribution (OOD). We hypothesize that due to the self-attention mechanism, each patch feature implicitly embeds/contains information from all other patches, represented in a different way and intensity, making these descriptors highly redundant. We quantify redundancy in such (BLIP2) features via PCA and cross-patch similarity: $90$% of variance is captured by $17/64$ principal components, and strong inter-token correlations are pervasive. Training on such overlapping information leads the policy to overfit spurious correlations, hurting OOD robustness. We present Stochastic-Patch-Selection (SPS), a simple yet effective approach for learning policies that are more robust, generalizable, and efficient. For every frame, SPS randomly masks a fraction of patch descriptors, not feeding them to the policy model, while preserving the spatial layout of the remaining patches. Thus, the policy is provided with different stochastic but complete views of the (same) scene: every random subset of patches acts like a different, yet still sensible, coherent projection of the world. The policy thus bases its decisions on features that are invariant to which specific tokens survive. Extensive experiments confirm that across all OOD scenarios, our method outperforms the state of the art (SOTA), achieving a $6.2$% average improvement and up to $20.4$% in closed-loop simulations, while being $2.4\times$ faster. We conduct ablations over masking rates and patch-feature reorganization, training and evaluating 9 systems, with 8 of them surpassing prior SOTA. Finally, we show that the same learned policy transfers to a physical, real-world car without any tuning.</p></details> |  |
| **[TinyMyo: a Tiny Foundation Model for Flexible EMG Signal Processing at the Edge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15729v2)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Objective: Surface electromyography (EMG) is a non-invasive sensing modality widely used in biomechanics, rehabilitation, prosthetic control, and human-machine interfaces. Despite decades of use, achieving robust generalization across subjects, recording systems, and acquisition protocols remains challenging. While foundation models (FMs) are gaining traction for EMG, existing approaches remain limited to single downstream tasks and lack deployability on embedded platforms. This work addresses these limitations. Methods: We present TinyMyo, a lightweight FM based on a Transformer encoder architecture. The model is pre-trained in a self-supervised manner using masked reconstruction on publicly available datasets. With only 3.6M parameters, TinyMyo is designed to support multiple downstream tasks through minimal task-specific head adaptations. Results: We demonstrate generalization across hand gesture classification, hand kinematic regression, speech production and speech recognition, with performance comparable to or surpassing the state of the art (SoA), and model size below 5M parameters. We achieve SoA results compared to previous FM-based works on the NinaPro DB5 (89.4%), UCI-EMG (97.56%), and EPN-612 (96.74%) datasets. We demonstrate the first-time deployment of an EMG FM on an ultra-low power microcontroller (GAP9), with an inference time of 0.785 s, energy of 44.91 mJ and power envelope of 57.18 mW. Conclusion: TinyMyo demonstrates that compact, self-supervised EMG FM can guarantee strong generalization across multiple downstream tasks while remaining compatible with low-power edge devices. Significance: TinyMyo is the first EMG FM for ultra-low power edge devices, enabling scalable and energy-efficient sensing for motor intent decoding, neuromuscular assessment, and biosignal driven human-machine interaction.</p></details> |  |
| **[ProbFM: Probabilistic Time Series Foundation Model with Uncertainty Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10591v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have emerged as a promising approach for zero-shot financial forecasting, demonstrating strong transferability and data efficiency gains. However, their adoption in financial applications is hindered by fundamental limitations in uncertainty quantification: current approaches either rely on restrictive distributional assumptions, conflate different sources of uncertainty, or lack principled calibration mechanisms. While recent TSFMs employ sophisticated techniques such as mixture models, Student's t-distributions, or conformal prediction, they fail to address the core challenge of providing theoretically-grounded uncertainty decomposition. For the very first time, we present a novel transformer-based probabilistic framework, ProbFM (probabilistic foundation model), that leverages Deep Evidential Regression (DER) to provide principled uncertainty quantification with explicit epistemic-aleatoric decomposition. Unlike existing approaches that pre-specify distributional forms or require sampling-based inference, ProbFM learns optimal uncertainty representations through higher-order evidence learning while maintaining single-pass computational efficiency. To rigorously evaluate the core DER uncertainty quantification approach independent of architectural complexity, we conduct an extensive controlled comparison study using a consistent LSTM architecture across five probabilistic methods: DER, Gaussian NLL, Student's-t NLL, Quantile Loss, and Conformal Prediction. Evaluation on cryptocurrency return forecasting demonstrates that DER maintains competitive forecasting accuracy while providing explicit epistemic-aleatoric uncertainty decomposition. This work establishes both an extensible framework for principled uncertainty quantification in foundation models and empirical evidence for DER's effectiveness in financial applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for oral presentation at the AI Meets Quantitative Finance Workshop at ICAIF 2025.

Our framework consists of four major components: (1) HeartCLAP, an audio-text alignment model; (2) HeartTranscriptor, a robust lyric recognition model optimized for real-world music scenarios; and (3) HeartCodec, a low-frame-rate (12.5 Hz) yet high-fidelity music codec tokenizer that captures long-range musical structure while preserving fine-grained acoustic details and enabling efficient autoregressive modeling; (4) HeartMuLa, an LLM-based song generation model capable of synthesizing high-fidelity music under rich, user-controllable conditions (e.g., textual style descriptions, lyrics, and reference audio). In addition, it provides two specialized modes: (i) fine-grained musical attribute control, which allows users to specify the style of different song sections (e.g., intro, verse, chorus) using natural language prompts; and (ii) short, engaging music generation, which is suitable as background music for short videos. Lastly, HeartMuLa improves significantly when scaled to 7B parameters. For the first time, we show that a Suno-level, commercial-grade system can be reproduced using academic-scale data and GPU resources. We expect these foundation models to serve as strong baselines for future research and to facilitate practical applications in multimodal content production.</p></details> |  |
| **[AgriFM: A Multi-source Temporal Remote Sensing Foundation Model for Agriculture Mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21357v3)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate crop mapping fundamentally relies on modeling multi-scale spatiotemporal patterns, where spatial scales range from individual field textures to landscape-level context, and temporal scales capture both short-term phenological transitions and full growing-season dynamics. Transformer-based remote sensing foundation models (RSFMs) offer promising potential for crop mapping due to their innate ability for unified spatiotemporal processing. However, current RSFMs remain suboptimal for crop mapping: they either employ fixed spatiotemporal windows that ignore the multi-scale nature of crop systems or completely disregard temporal information by focusing solely on spatial patterns. To bridge these gaps, we present AgriFM, a multi-source remote sensing foundation model specifically designed for agricultural crop mapping. Our approach begins by establishing the necessity of simultaneous hierarchical spatiotemporal feature extraction, leading to the development of a modified Video Swin Transformer architecture where temporal down-sampling is synchronized with spatial scaling operations. This modified backbone enables efficient unified processing of long time-series satellite inputs. AgriFM leverages temporally rich data streams from three satellite sources including MODIS, Landsat-8/9 and Sentinel-2, and is pre-trained on a global representative dataset comprising over 25 million image samples supervised by land cover products. The resulting framework incorporates a versatile decoder architecture that dynamically fuses these learned spatiotemporal representations, supporting diverse downstream tasks. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate AgriFM's superior performance over conventional deep learning approaches and state-of-the-art general-purpose RSFMs across all downstream tasks. Codes will be available at https://github.com/flyakon/AgriFM.</p></details> |  |

Motivated by the success of large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing, graph foundation models (GFMs) is proposed to handle few-shot learning task with fewer labeling efforts. GFMs have been successfully applied to detection of individual anomalies but cannot be generalized to group anomalies, as group anomaly patterns must be detected as a whole and individuals in an abnormal group can look rather normal. Therefore, we propose GFM4GA, a novel graph foundation model for group anomaly detection. The pipeline is pretrained via dual-level contrastive learning based on feature-based estimation and group extraction, to capture potential group anomaly structure and feature inconsistencies. In the downstream tasks, the pipeline is finetuned in parameter-constrained and group-anomaly-proportion weighted few-shot settings, and its adaptive ability to unseen group anomalies expanded via group contexts determined by labeled anomaly neighbors. Experiments show that GFM4GA surpasses group anomaly detectors and GFMs for individual anomalies, achieving average improvements of 2.85% in AUROC and 2.55% in AUPRC.</p></details> |  |

Diagnosing ADHD using neuroimaging data, however, remains challenging due to heterogeneous presentations and overlapping symptoms with other conditions. To address this, we propose a novel parameter-efficient transfer learning approach that adapts a large-scale 3D convolutional foundation model, pre-trained on CT images, to an MRI-based ADHD classification task. Our method introduces Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) in 3D by factorizing 3D convolutional kernels into 2D low-rank updates, dramatically reducing trainable parameters while achieving superior performance. In a five-fold cross-validated evaluation on a public diffusion MRI database, our 3D LoRA fine-tuning strategy achieved state-of-the-art results, with one model variant reaching 71.9% accuracy and another attaining an AUC of 0.716. Both variants use only 1.64 million trainable parameters (over 113x fewer than a fully fine-tuned foundation model). Our results represent one of the first successful cross-modal (CT-to-MRI) adaptations of a foundation model in neuroimaging, establishing a new benchmark for ADHD classification while greatly improving efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at the IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) 2026</p></details> |

This study examines these communication challenges and explores AI-based approaches to mitigate them. We conducted a diary study with English-speaking, community-dwelling older adults to collect asynchronous, technology-related queries and used reflexive thematic analysis to identify communication barriers. To address these barriers, we evaluated how foundation models can paraphrase older adults' queries to improve solution accuracy. Two controlled experiments followed: one with younger adults evaluating AI-rephrased queries and another with older adults evaluating AI-generated solutions. We also developed a pipeline using large language models to generate the first synthetic dataset of how older adults request tech support (OATS). We identified four key communication challenges: verbosity, incompleteness, over-specification, and under-specification. Our prompt-chaining approach using the large language model, GPT-4o, elicited contextual details, paraphrased the original query, and generated a solution. AI-rephrased queries significantly improved solution accuracy (69% vs. 46%) and Google search results (69% vs. 35%). Younger adults better understood AI-rephrased queries (93.7% vs. 65.8%) and reported greater confidence and ease. Older adults reported high perceived ability to answer contextual questions (89.8%) and follow solutions (94.7%), with high confidence and ease. OATS demonstrated strong fidelity and face validity. This work shows how foundation models can enhance technology support for older adults by addressing age-related communication barriers. The OATS dataset offers a scalable resource for developing equitable AI systems that better serve aging populations.</p></details> |  |

We find that zero-shot TFMs already achieve strong performance, while the benefits of fine-tuning are highly model and data-dependent. Meta-learning and PEFT provide moderate gains under specific conditions, whereas full supervised fine-tuning (SFT) often reduces accuracy or calibration quality. This work presents the first comprehensive study of fine-tuning in TFMs across benchmarks including TALENT, OpenML-CC18, and TabZilla. We compare Zero-Shot, Meta-Learning, Supervised (SFT), and parameter-efficient (PEFT) approaches, analyzing how dataset factors such as imbalance, size, and dimensionality affect outcomes.

Foundation Models (FMs), trained on vast datasets through self-supervised learning, enable efficient adaptation across medical imaging tasks while reducing dependency on labeled data. These models demonstrate potential for enhancing fairness, though significant challenges remain in achieving consistent performance across demographic groups. Our review indicates that effective bias mitigation in FMs requires systematic interventions throughout all stages of development. While previous approaches focused primarily on model-level bias mitigation, our analysis reveals that fairness in FMs requires integrated interventions throughout the development pipeline, from data documentation to deployment protocols. This comprehensive framework advances current knowledge by demonstrating how systematic bias mitigation, combined with policy engagement, can effectively address both technical and institutional barriers to equitable AI in healthcare. The development of equitable FMs represents a critical step toward democratizing advanced healthcare technologies, particularly for underserved populations and regions with limited medical infrastructure and computational resources.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lens: A Knowledge-Guided Foundation Model for Network Traffic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03646v5)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Network traffic refers to the amount of data being sent and received over the Internet or any system that connects computers. Analyzing network traffic is vital for security and management, yet remains challenging due to the heterogeneity of plain-text packet headers and encrypted payloads. To capture the latent semantics of traffic, recent studies have adopted Transformer-based pretraining techniques to learn network representations from massive traffic data. However, these methods pre-train on data-driven tasks but overlook network knowledge, such as masking partial digits of the indivisible network port numbers for prediction, thereby limiting semantic understanding. In addition, they struggle to extend classification to new classes during fine-tuning due to the distribution shift. Motivated by these limitations, we propose \Lens, a unified knowledge-guided foundation model for both network traffic classification and generation. In pretraining, we propose a Knowledge-Guided Mask Span Prediction method with textual context for learning knowledge-enriched representations. For extending to new classes in finetuning, we reframe the traffic classification as a closed-ended generation task and introduce context-aware finetuning to adapt to the distribution shift. Evaluation results across various benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed Lens~achieves superior performance on both classification and generation tasks. For traffic classification, Lens~outperforms competitive baselines substantially on 8 out of 12 tasks with an average accuracy of \textbf{96.33\%} and extends to novel classes with significantly better performance. For traffic generation, Lens~generates better high-fidelity network traffic for network simulation, gaining up to \textbf{30.46\%} and \textbf{33.3\%} better accuracy and F1 in fuzzing tests. We will open-source the code upon publication.</p></details> |  |

Leveraging large volumes of unlabeled brain MRI data, such models can learn anatomical priors that improve few-shot performance in diverse neuroimaging tasks. However, most SSL frameworks are tailored to natural images, and their adaptation to capture multi-modal MRI information remains underexplored. This work proposes a modality-invariant representation learning setup and evaluates its effectiveness in stroke and epilepsy lesion segmentation, following large-scale pre-training. Experimental results suggest that despite successful cross-modality alignment, lesion segmentation primarily benefits from preserving fine-grained modality-specific features. Model checkpoints and code are made publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE ISBI 2026</p></details> |
| **[Vision Foundation Models for Domain Generalisable Cross-View Localisation in Planetary Ground-Aerial Robotic Teams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09107v1)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate localisation in planetary robotics enables the advanced autonomy required to support the increased scale and scope of future missions. The successes of the Ingenuity helicopter and multiple planetary orbiters lay the groundwork for future missions that use ground-aerial robotic teams. In this paper, we consider rovers using machine learning to localise themselves in a local aerial map using limited field-of-view monocular ground-view RGB images as input. A key consideration for machine learning methods is that real space data with ground-truth position labels suitable for training is scarce. In this work, we propose a novel method of localising rovers in an aerial map using cross-view-localising dual-encoder deep neural networks. We leverage semantic segmentation with vision foundation models and high volume synthetic data to bridge the domain gap to real images. We also contribute a new cross-view dataset of real-world rover trajectories with corresponding ground-truth localisation data captured in a planetary analogue facility, plus a high volume dataset of analogous synthetic image pairs. Using particle filters for state estimation with the cross-view networks allows accurate position estimation over simple and complex trajectories based on sequences of ground-view images.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 10 figures.

| **[Scaling Remote Sensing Foundation Models: Data Domain Tradeoffs at the Peta-Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23903v2)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We explore the scaling behaviors of artificial intelligence to establish practical techniques for training foundation models on high-resolution electro-optical (EO) datasets that exceed the current state-of-the-art scale by orders of magnitude. Modern multimodal machine learning (ML) applications, such as generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) systems for image captioning, search, and reasoning, depend on robust, domain-specialized encoders for non-text modalities. In natural image domains where internet-scale data is plentiful, well-established scaling laws help optimize the joint scaling of model capacity, training compute, and dataset size. Unfortunately, these relationships are much less well understood in high-value domains like remote sensing (RS). Using over a quadrillion pixels of commercial satellite EO data and MITRE's Federal AI Sandbox, we train progressively larger vision transformer (ViT) backbones, report successes and failure modes observed at peta-scale, and analyze implications for bridging domain gaps across additional RS modalities. We observe that even at this scale, performance is consistent with a data-limited regime rather than a model parameter-limited one. These practical insights are intended to inform data collection strategies, compute budgets, and optimization schedules that advance the future development of frontier scale RS foundation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Incentivizing Multi-Tenant Split Federated Learning for Foundation Models at the Network Edge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04971v2)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models (FMs) such as GPT-4 exhibit exceptional generative capabilities across diverse downstream tasks through fine-tuning. Split Federated Learning (SFL) facilitates privacy-preserving FM fine-tuning on resource-constrained local devices by offloading partial FM computations to edge servers, enabling device-edge synergistic fine-tuning. Practical edge networks often host multiple SFL tenants to support diversified downstream tasks. However, existing research primarily focuses on single-tenant SFL scenarios, and lacks tailored incentive mechanisms for multi-tenant settings, which are essential to effectively coordinate self-interested local devices for participation in various downstream tasks, ensuring that each SFL tenant's distinct FM fine-tuning requirements (e.g., FM types, performance targets, and fine-tuning deadlines) are met. To address this gap, we propose a novel Price-Incentive Mechanism (PRINCE) that guides multiple SFL tenants to offer strategic price incentives, which solicit high-quality device participation for efficient FM fine-tuning. Specifically, we first develop a bias-resilient global SFL model aggregation scheme to eliminate model biases caused by independent device participation. We then derive a rigorous SFL convergence bound to evaluate the contributions of heterogeneous devices to FM performance improvements, guiding the incentive strategies of SFL tenants. Furthermore, we model inter-tenant device competition as a congestion game for Stackelberg equilibrium (SE) analysis, deriving each SFL tenant's optimal incentive strategy. Extensive simulations involving four representative SFL tenant types (ViT, BERT, Whisper, and LLaMA) across diverse data modalities (text, images, and audio) demonstrate that PRINCE accelerates FM fine-tuning by up to 3.07x compared to state-of-the-art approaches, while consistently meeting fine-tuning performance targets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking.

Learning robust and transferable representations directly from such raw signals, however, remains challenging due to heterogeneous communication systems, diverse propagation environments, and limited labeled data. To address this, we present LWM-Spectro, a transformer-based foundation model pretrained on large-scale I/Q data represented as time-frequency spectrograms. The model leverages self-supervised masked modeling, contrastive learning, and a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture to learn general-purpose wireless representations. These representations transfer effectively to downstream tasks such as modulation classification and joint SNR/mobility recognition, even with minimal supervision. Across tasks, LWM-Spectro consistently outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning baselines in both few-shot and data-rich regimes, providing a unified foundation for wireless learning.</p></details> | 6 pages, 5 figures |

| **[MUSE-FM: Multi-task Environment-aware Foundation Model for Wireless Communications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01967v2)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in foundation models (FMs) have attracted increasing attention in the wireless communication domain. Leveraging the powerful multi-task learning capability, FMs hold the promise of unifying multiple tasks of wireless communication with a single framework. Nevertheless, existing wireless FMs face limitations in the uniformity to address multiple tasks with diverse inputs/outputs across different communication scenarios. In this paper, we propose a MUlti-taSk Environment-aware FM (MUSE-FM) with a unified architecture to handle multiple tasks in wireless communications, while effectively incorporating scenario information. Specifically, to achieve task uniformity, we propose a unified prompt-guided data encoder-decoder pair to handle data with heterogeneous formats and distributions across different tasks. Besides, we integrate the environmental context as a multi-modal input, which serves as prior knowledge of environment and channel distributions and facilitates cross-scenario feature extraction. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed MUSE-FM outperforms existing methods for various tasks, and its prompt-guided encoder-decoder pair facilitates few-shot adaptation to new task configurations. Moreover, the incorporation of environment information improves the ability to adapt to different scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, subjective visual assessment and inter-institutional variability limit diagnostic consistency. This study developed and externally evaluated a multi-centre, foundation model-driven framework that automatically classifies EVI and MFI on axial and sagittal MRI. Methods A total of 331 pre-treatment rectal cancer T2-weighted MRI scans from three European hospitals were retrospectively recruited. A self-supervised frequency domain harmonization strategy was applied to reduce scanner variability. Three classifiers, SeResNet, the universal biomedical pretrained model (UMedPT) with a multilayer perceptron head, and a logistic-regression variant using frozen UMedPT features (UMedPT_LR), were trained (n=265) and tested (n=66). Gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) visualized model predictions. Results UMedPT_LR achieved the best EVI performance with multiplanar fusion (AUC=0.82, test set). For MFI, UMedPT trained on axial harmonized images yielded the highest performance (AUC = 0.77). Both tasks outperformed the CHAIMELEON 2024 benchmark (EVI: 0.82 vs 0.74; MFI: 0.77 vs 0.75). Harmonization enhanced MFI classification, and multiplanar fusion further boosted EVI performance. Grad-CAM confirmed biologically plausible attention on peritumoral regions (EVI) and mesorectal fascia margins (MFI). Conclusion The proposed foundation model-driven framework, leveraging frequency domain harmonization and multiplanar fusion, achieves state-of-the-art performance for automated EVI and MFI classification on MRI, demonstrating strong generalizability across multiple centers.</p></details> | 27 pages, 9 figures |

Although ECGFounder expanded cardiac disease coverage, a holistic health profiling model remains needed. Methods: We constructed a large multicenter dataset comprising 13.3 million ECGs from 2.98 million patients. Using transfer learning, ECGFounder was fine-tuned to develop AnyECG, a foundation model for holistic health profiling. Performance was evaluated using external validation cohorts and a 10-year longitudinal cohort for current diagnosis, future risk prediction, and comorbidity identification. Results: AnyECG demonstrated systemic predictive capability across 1172 conditions, achieving an AUROC greater than 0.7 for 306 diseases. The model revealed novel disease associations, robust comorbidity patterns, and future disease risks. Representative examples included high diagnostic performance for hyperparathyroidism (AUROC 0.941), type 2 diabetes (0.803), Crohn disease (0.817), lymphoid leukemia (0.856), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (0.773). Conclusion: The AnyECG foundation model provides substantial evidence that AI-ECG can serve as a systemic tool for concurrent disease detection and long-term risk prediction.</p></details> | in progress |

We developed a foundation model-based AI pipeline for patient-level classification and lesion-level detection of CRLM on contrast-enhanced CT, integrating uncertainty quantification and explainability. CT data from the EuCanImage consortium (n=2437) and an external TCIA cohort (n=197) were used. Among several pretrained models, UMedPT achieved the best performance and was fine-tuned with an MLP head for classification and an FCOS-based head for lesion detection. The classification model achieved an AUC of 0.90 and a sensitivity of 0.82 on the combined test set, with a sensitivity of 0.85 on the external cohort. Excluding the most uncertain 20 percent of cases improved AUC to 0.91 and balanced accuracy to 0.86. Decision curve analysis showed clinical benefit for threshold probabilities between 0.30 and 0.40. The detection model identified 69.1 percent of lesions overall, increasing from 30 percent to 98 percent across lesion size quartiles. Grad-CAM highlighted lesion-corresponding regions in high-confidence cases. These results demonstrate that foundation model-based pipelines can support robust and interpretable CRLM detection and classification across heterogeneous CT data.</p></details> |  |
| **[FlyCo: Foundation Model-Empowered Drones for Autonomous 3D Structure Scanning in Open-World Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07558v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous 3D scanning of open-world target structures via drones remains challenging despite broad applications. Existing paradigms rely on restrictive assumptions or effortful human priors, limiting practicality, efficiency, and adaptability. Recent foundation models (FMs) offer great potential to bridge this gap. This paper investigates a critical research problem: What system architecture can effectively integrate FM knowledge for this task? We answer it with FlyCo, a principled FM-empowered perception-prediction-planning loop enabling fully autonomous, prompt-driven 3D target scanning in diverse unknown open-world environments. FlyCo directly translates low-effort human prompts (text, visual annotations) into precise adaptive scanning flights via three coordinated stages: (1) perception fuses streaming sensor data with vision-language FMs for robust target grounding and tracking; (2) prediction distills FM knowledge and combines multi-modal cues to infer the partially observed target's complete geometry; (3) planning leverages predictive foresight to generate efficient and safe paths with comprehensive target coverage. Building on this, we further design key components to boost open-world target grounding efficiency and robustness, enhance prediction quality in terms of shape accuracy, zero-shot generalization, and temporal stability, and balance long-horizon flight efficiency with real-time computability and online collision avoidance. Extensive challenging real-world and simulation experiments show FlyCo delivers precise scene understanding, high efficiency, and real-time safety, outperforming existing paradigms with lower human effort and verifying the proposed architecture's practicality. Comprehensive ablations validate each component's contribution. FlyCo also serves as a flexible, extensible blueprint, readily leveraging future FM and robotics advances. Code will be released.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 24 figures, 9 tables.

| **[CompNO: A Novel Foundation Model approach for solving Partial Differential Equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07384v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Partial differential equations (PDEs) govern a wide range of physical phenomena, but their numerical solution remains computationally demanding, especially when repeated simulations are required across many parameter settings. Recent Scientific Foundation Models (SFMs) aim to alleviate this cost by learning universal surrogates from large collections of simulated systems, yet they typically rely on monolithic architectures with limited interpretability and high pretraining expense. In this work we introduce Compositional Neural Operators (CompNO), a compositional neural operator framework for parametric PDEs. Instead of pretraining a single large model on heterogeneous data, CompNO first learns a library of Foundation Blocks, where each block is a parametric Fourier neural operator specialized to a fundamental differential operator (e.g. convection, diffusion, nonlinear convection). These blocks are then assembled, via lightweight Adaptation Blocks, into task-specific solvers that approximate the temporal evolution operator for target PDEs. A dedicated boundary-condition operator further enforces Dirichlet constraints exactly at inference time. We validate CompNO on one-dimensional convection, diffusion, convection--diffusion and Burgers' equations from the PDEBench suite. The proposed framework achieves lower relative L2 error than strong baselines (PFNO, PDEFormer and in-context learning based models) on linear parametric systems, while remaining competitive on nonlinear Burgers' flows. The model maintains exact boundary satisfaction with zero loss at domain boundaries, and exhibits robust generalization across a broad range of Peclet and Reynolds numbers. These results demonstrate that compositional neural operators provide a scalable and physically interpretable pathway towards foundation models for PDEs.</p></details> | Under review at MDPI |
| **[The Semantic Lifecycle in Embodied AI: Acquisition, Representation and Storage via Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08876v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic information in embodied AI is inherently multi-source and multi-stage, making it challenging to fully leverage for achieving stable perception-to-action loops in real-world environments. Early studies have combined manual engineering with deep neural networks, achieving notable progress in specific semantic-related embodied tasks. However, as embodied agents encounter increasingly complex environments and open-ended tasks, the demand for more generalizable and robust semantic processing capabilities has become imperative. Recent advances in foundation models (FMs) address this challenge through their cross-domain generalization abilities and rich semantic priors, reshaping the landscape of embodied AI research. In this survey, we propose the Semantic Lifecycle as a unified framework to characterize the evolution of semantic knowledge within embodied AI driven by foundation models. Departing from traditional paradigms that treat semantic processing as isolated modules or disjoint tasks, our framework offers a holistic perspective that captures the continuous flow and maintenance of semantic knowledge. Guided by this embodied semantic lifecycle, we further analyze and compare recent advances across three key stages: acquisition, representation, and storage. Finally, we summarize existing challenges and outline promising directions for future research.</p></details> |  |

We introduce HydroGEM (Hydrological Generalizable Encoder for Monitoring), a foundation model for continental-scale streamflow quality control. HydroGEM uses two-stage training: self-supervised pretraining on 6.03 million sequences from 3,724 USGS stations learns hydrological representations, followed by fine-tuning with synthetic anomalies for detection and reconstruction. A hybrid TCN-Transformer architecture (14.2M parameters) captures local temporal patterns and long-range dependencies, while hierarchical normalization handles six orders of magnitude in discharge. On held-out synthetic tests comprising 799 stations with 18 expert-validated anomaly types, HydroGEM achieves F1 = 0.792 for detection and 68.7% reconstruction-error reduction, a 36.3% improvement over existing methods. Zero-shot transfer to 100 Environment and Climate Change Canada stations yields F1 = 0.586, exceeding all baselines and demonstrating cross-national generalization. The model maintains consistent detection across correction magnitudes and aligns with operational seasonal patterns. HydroGEM is designed for human-in-the-loop workflows - outputs are quality control suggestions requiring expert review, not autonomous corrections.</p></details> | <details><summary>Suppl...</summary><p>Supplementary materials, datasets, and implementation code will be made publicly available upon acceptance for publication in a peer-reviewed journal</p></details> |
| **[The Blueprints of Intelligence: A Functional-Topological Foundation for Perception and Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05089v3)** | 2026-01-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world phenomena do not generate arbitrary variability: their signals concentrate on compact, low-variability subsets of functional space, enabling rapid generalization from few examples. A small child can recognize a dog after extremely limited exposure because the perceptual manifold of "dog" is compact, structured, and low-dimensional. We formalize this principle through a deterministic functional-topological framework in which the set of valid realizations produced by a physical process forms a compact subset of a Banach space, endowed with stable invariants, a finite Hausdorff radius, and an induced continuous perceptual functional. This geometry provides explicit limits on knowledge, conditions for identifiability, and guarantees for generalization from sparse evidence -- properties fundamental to both natural and artificial intelligence. Across electromechanical, electrochemical, and physiological domains, we show that real-world processes consistently generate compact perceptual manifolds with the same geometric characteristics. Their boundaries can be discovered in a fully self-supervised manner as the empirical radius saturates with increasing sampling, even when the governing equations are unknown. These results demonstrate that deterministic functional topology offers a unified mathematical foundation for perception, representation, and world-model construction. It provides a geometric explanation for why biological learners and self-supervised AI systems can generalize from few observations, and establishes compact perceptual manifolds as a fundamental building block for future AI architectures. Finally, this work unifies biological perception and modern self-supervised models under a single geometric principle: both derive their generalization ability from the compactness and invariants of real-world perceptual manifolds.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 6 figures.

This work presents a unified framework leveraging vision foundation models to automate the quantification and classification of CNTs in electron microscopy images. First, we introduce an interactive quantification tool built on the Segment Anything Model (SAM) that segments particles with near-perfect accuracy using minimal user input. Second, we propose a novel classification pipeline that utilizes these segmentation masks to spatially constrain a DINOv2 vision transformer, extracting features exclusively from particle regions while suppressing background noise. Evaluated on a dataset of 1,800 TEM images, this architecture achieves 95.5% accuracy in distinguishing between four different CNT morphologies, significantly outperforming the current baseline despite using a fraction of the training data. Crucially, this instance-level processing allows the framework to resolve mixed samples, correctly classifying distinct particle types co-existing within a single field of view. These results demonstrate that integrating zero-shot segmentation with self-supervised feature learning enables high-throughput, reproducible nanomaterial analysis, transforming a labor-intensive bottleneck into a scalable, data-driven process.</p></details> |  |
| **[What Is The Best 3D Scene Representation for Robotics? From Geometric to Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03422v2)** | 2026-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of existing scene representation methods for robotics, covering traditional representations such as point clouds, voxels, signed distance functions (SDF), and scene graphs, as well as more recent neural representations like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), and the emerging Foundation Models. While current SLAM and localization systems predominantly rely on sparse representations like point clouds and voxels, dense scene representations are expected to play a critical role in downstream tasks such as navigation and obstacle avoidance. Moreover, neural representations such as NeRF, 3DGS, and foundation models are well-suited for integrating high-level semantic features and language-based priors, enabling more comprehensive 3D scene understanding and embodied intelligence. In this paper, we categorized the core modules of robotics into five parts (Perception, Mapping, Localization, Navigation, Manipulation). We start by presenting the standard formulation of different scene representation methods and comparing the advantages and disadvantages of scene representation across different modules. This survey is centered around the question: What is the best 3D scene representation for robotics? We then discuss the future development trends of 3D scene representations, with a particular focus on how the 3D Foundation Model could replace current methods as the unified solution for future robotic applications. The remaining challenges in fully realizing this model are also explored. We aim to offer a valuable resource for both newcomers and experienced researchers to explore the future of 3D scene representations and their application in robotics. We have published an open-source project on GitHub and will continue to add new works and technologies to this project.</p></details> |  |

Their detection remains a significant challenge due to subtle morphological cues, class imbalance, and inter-observer variability among pathologists. The MIDOG 2025 challenge introduced a dedicated track for atypical mitosis classification, enabling systematic evaluation of deep learning methods. In this study, we investigated the use of large vision foundation models, including Virchow, Virchow2, and UNI, with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for parameter-efficient fine-tuning. We conducted extensive experiments with different LoRA ranks, as well as random and group-based data splits, to analyze robustness under varied conditions. Our best approach, Virchow with LoRA rank 8 and ensemble of three-fold cross-validation, achieved a balanced accuracy of 88.37% on the preliminary test set, ranking joint 9th in the challenge leaderboard. These results highlight the promise of foundation models with efficient adaptation strategies for the classification of atypical mitosis, while underscoring the need for improvements in specificity and domain generalization.</p></details> | MIDOG'25 |

However, existing time series foundation models primarily focus on forecasting tasks and often overlook classification-specific challenges, such as modeling interpretable shapelets that capture class-discriminative temporal features. To bridge this gap, we propose UniShape, a unified shape-aware foundation model designed for time series classification. UniShape incorporates a shape-aware adapter that adaptively aggregates multiscale discriminative subsequences (shapes) into class tokens, effectively selecting the most relevant subsequence scales to enhance model interpretability. Meanwhile, a prototype-based pretraining module is introduced to jointly learn instance- and shape-level representations, enabling the capture of transferable shape patterns. Pre-trained on a large-scale multi-domain time series dataset comprising 1.89 million samples, UniShape exhibits superior generalization across diverse target domains. Experiments on 128 UCR datasets and 30 additional time series datasets demonstrate that UniShape achieves state-of-the-art classification performance, with interpretability and ablation analyses further validating its effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in AAAI 2026</p></details> |

Safety requirements are often specified by multiple stakeholders with uncoordinated objectives, leading to gaps, duplications, and contradictions that jeopardize system safety and compliance. Existing approaches are largely informal and insufficient for addressing these challenges. SAFER enhances Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) by consuming requirement specification models and generating the following results: (1) mapping requirements to system functions, (2) identifying functions with insufficient requirement specifications, (3) detecting duplicate requirements, and (4) identifying contradictions within requirement sets. SAFER provides structured analysis, reporting, and decision support for safety engineers. We demonstrate SAFER on an autonomous drone system, significantly improving the detection of requirement inconsistencies, enhancing both efficiency and reliability of the safety engineering process. We show that Generative AI must be augmented by formal models and queried systematically, to provide meaningful early-stage safety requirement specifications and robust safety architectures.</p></details> |  |
