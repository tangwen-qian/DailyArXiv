| **[ReSem3D: Refinable 3D Spatial Constraints via Fine-Grained Semantic Grounding for Generalizable Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18262v2)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantics-driven 3D spatial constraints align highlevel semantic representations with low-level action spaces, facilitating the unification of task understanding and execution in robotic manipulation. The synergistic reasoning of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) enables cross-modal 3D spatial constraint construction. Nevertheless, existing methods have three key limitations: (1) coarse semantic granularity in constraint modeling, (2) lack of real-time closed-loop planning, (3) compromised robustness in semantically diverse environments. To address these challenges, we propose ReSem3D, a unified manipulation framework for semantically diverse environments, leveraging the synergy between VFMs and MLLMs to achieve fine-grained visual grounding and dynamically constructs hierarchical 3D spatial constraints for real-time manipulation. Specifically, the framework is driven by hierarchical recursive reasoning in MLLMs, which interact with VFMs to automatically construct 3D spatial constraints from natural language instructions and RGB-D observations in two stages: part-level extraction and region-level refinement. Subsequently, these constraints are encoded as real-time optimization objectives in joint space, enabling reactive behavior to dynamic disturbances. Extensive simulation and real-world experiments are conducted in semantically rich household and sparse chemical lab environments. The results demonstrate that ReSem3D performs diverse manipulation tasks under zero-shot conditions, exhibiting strong adaptability and generalization.

| **[Real-time rail vehicle localisation using spatially resolved magnetic field measurements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19327v1)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work presents two complementary real-time rail vehicle localization methods based on magnetic field measurements and a pre-recorded magnetic map. The first uses a particle filter reweighted via magnetic similarity, employing a heavy-tailed non-Gaussian kernel for enhanced stability. The second is a stateless sequence alignment technique that transforms real-time magnetic signals into the spatial domain and matches them to the map using a similarity measure. Experiments with operational train data show that the particle filter achieves track-selective, sub-5-meter accuracy over 21.6 km, though its performance degrades at low speeds and during cold starts. Accuracy tests were constrained by the GNSS-based reference system. In contrast, the alignment-based method excels in cold-start scenarios, localizing within 30 m in 92 % of tests (100 % using top-3 matches). A hybrid approach combines both methods$\unicode{x2014}$alignment-based initialization followed by particle filter tracking. Runtime analysis confirms real-time capability on consumer-grade hardware. The system delivers accurate, robust localization suitable for safety-critical rail applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cross Spatial Temporal Fusion Attention for Remote Sensing Object Detection via Image Feature Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19118v1)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effectively describing features for cross-modal remote sensing image matching remains a challenging task due to the significant geometric and radiometric differences between multimodal images. Existing methods primarily extract features at the fully connected layer but often fail to capture cross-modal similarities effectively. We propose a Cross Spatial Temporal Fusion (CSTF) mechanism that enhances feature representation by integrating scale-invariant keypoints detected independently in both reference and query images. Our approach improves feature matching in two ways: First, by creating correspondence maps that leverage information from multiple image regions simultaneously, and second, by reformulating the similarity matching process as a classification task using SoftMax and Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) layers. This dual approach enables CSTF to maintain sensitivity to distinctive local features while incorporating broader contextual information, resulting in robust matching across diverse remote sensing modalities. To demonstrate the practical utility of improved feature matching, we evaluate CSTF on object detection tasks using the HRSC2016 and DOTA benchmark datasets. Our method achieves state-of-theart performance with an average mAP of 90.99% on HRSC2016 and 90.86% on DOTA, outperforming existing models. The CSTF model maintains computational efficiency with an inference speed of 12.5 FPS. These results validate that our approach to crossmodal feature matching directly enhances downstream remote sensing applications such as object detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[SP-Mamba: Spatial-Perception State Space Model for Unsupervised Medical Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19076v1)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Radiography imaging protocols target on specific anatomical regions, resulting in highly consistent images with recurrent structural patterns across patients. Recent advances in medical anomaly detection have demonstrated the effectiveness of CNN- and transformer-based approaches. However, CNNs exhibit limitations in capturing long-range dependencies, while transformers suffer from quadratic computational complexity. In contrast, Mamba-based models, leveraging superior long-range modeling, structural feature extraction, and linear computational efficiency, have emerged as a promising alternative. To capitalize on the inherent structural regularity of medical images, this study introduces SP-Mamba, a spatial-perception Mamba framework for unsupervised medical anomaly detection. The window-sliding prototype learning and Circular-Hilbert scanning-based Mamba are introduced to better exploit consistent anatomical patterns and leverage spatial information for medical anomaly detection. Furthermore, we excavate the concentration and contrast characteristics of anomaly maps for improving anomaly detection. Extensive experiments on three diverse medical anomaly detection benchmarks confirm the proposed method's state-of-the-art performance, validating its efficacy and robustness. The code is available at https://github.com/Ray-RuiPan/SP-Mamba.</p></details> | 11 pages |

However, existing techniques often couple tracking speed adjustments directly with hand movements, reducing interaction flexibility. Inspired by the natural friction control inherent in the physical world, we introduce ForcePinch, a novel force-responsive spatial interaction method that enables users to intuitively modulate pointer tracking speed and smoothly transition between rapid and precise movements by varying their pinching force. To implement this concept, we developed a hardware prototype integrating a pressure sensor with a customizable mapping function that translates pinching force into tracking speed adjustments. We conducted a user study with 20 participants performing well-established 1D, 2D, and 3D object manipulation tasks, comparing ForcePinch against the distance-responsive technique Go-Go and speed-responsive technique PRISM. Results highlight distinctive characteristics of the force-responsive approach across different interaction contexts. Drawing on these findings, we highlight the contextual meaning and versatility of force-responsive interactions through four illustrative examples, aiming to inform and inspire future spatial interaction design.</p></details> |  |

For non-smooth initial data, the regularity of the mild solution is investigated, and an error estimate is derived within the spatial (L^2)-norm setting. In the case of smooth initial data, two error estimates are established within the framework of general spatial (L^q)-norms.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, Coordinated Spatial Reuse (Co-SR) can potentially contribute to optimizing spectrum resource utilization. This mechanism is expected to enable simultaneous transmissions, thereby boosting spectral efficiency in dense environments and increasing the overall network performance. In this paper, we shed light on the performance of Co-SR for Wi-Fi 8 networks. For that, we propose an implementation of Co-SR aligned with ongoing Wi-Fi 8 standardization efforts. The evaluation is done on a Wi-Fi simulator, which allows us to study the performance of the proposed Co-SR mechanisms in relevant scenarios. The results obtained in a Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) consisting of four APs show delay reduction with Co-SR ranging from 31% to 95% when compared to Distributed Coordination Function (DCF).</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Communications Standards Magazine</p></details> |
| **[Towards Scalable Spatial Intelligence via 2D-to-3D Data Lifting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18678v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial intelligence is emerging as a transformative frontier in AI, yet it remains constrained by the scarcity of large-scale 3D datasets. Unlike the abundant 2D imagery, acquiring 3D data typically requires specialized sensors and laborious annotation. In this work, we present a scalable pipeline that converts single-view images into comprehensive, scale- and appearance-realistic 3D representations - including point clouds, camera poses, depth maps, and pseudo-RGBD - via integrated depth estimation, camera calibration, and scale calibration. Our method bridges the gap between the vast repository of imagery and the increasing demand for spatial scene understanding. By automatically generating authentic, scale-aware 3D data from images, we significantly reduce data collection costs and open new avenues for advancing spatial intelligence. We release two generated spatial datasets, i.e., COCO-3D and Objects365-v2-3D, and demonstrate through extensive experiments that our generated data can benefit various 3D tasks, ranging from fundamental perception to MLLM-based reasoning. These results validate our pipeline as an effective solution for developing AI systems capable of perceiving, understanding, and interacting with physical environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025 (Highlight)</p></details> |
| **[Discrete stochastic maximal $ L^p $-regularity and convergence of a spatial semidiscretization for a linear stochastic heat equation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04615v7)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study investigates the boundedness of the \( H^\infty \)-calculus for the discrete negative Laplace operator, subject to homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. The discrete negative Laplace operator is implemented using the finite element method, and we establish that its \(H^\infty\)-calculus is uniformly bounded with respect to the spatial mesh size. Using this finding, we derive a discrete stochastic maximal \(L^p\)-regularity estimate for a spatial semidiscretization of a linear stochastic heat equation. Furthermore, we provide a nearly optimal pathwise uniform convergence estimate for this spatial semidiscretization within the framework of general spatial \(L^q\)-norms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating judgment of spatial correlation in visual displays of scalar field distributions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17997v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work we study the identification of spatial correlation in distributions of 2D scalar fields, presented across different forms of visual displays. We study simple visual displays that directly show color-mapped scalar fields, namely those drawn from a distribution, and whether humans can identify strongly correlated spatial regions in these displays. In this setting, the recognition of correlation requires making judgments on a set of fields, rather than just one field. Thus, in our experimental design we compare two basic visualization designs: animation-based displays against juxtaposed views of scalar fields, along different choices of color scales. Moreover, we investigate the impacts of the distribution itself, controlling for the level of spatial correlation and discriminability in spatial scales. Our study's results illustrate the impacts of these distribution characteristics, while also highlighting how different visual displays impact the types of judgments made in assessing spatial correlation.

It leverages the richness of stochastic modelling and ensemble learning, making it robust, scalable and suitable for large datasets. In addition, Spatialize provides a powerful framework for uncertainty quantification, offering both point estimates and empirical posterior distributions. It is implemented in Python 3.x, with a C++ core for improved performance, and is designed to be easy to use, requiring minimal user intervention. This library aims to bridge the gap between expert and non-expert users of geostatistics by providing automated tools that rival traditional geostatistical methods. Here, we present a detailed description of Spatialize along with a wealth of examples of its use.</p></details> |  |
| **[Nonparametric inference for nonstationary spatial point processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17600v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Point pattern data often exhibit features such as abrupt changes, hotspots and spatially varying dependence in local intensity. Under a Poisson process framework, these correspond to discontinuities and nonstationarity in the underlying intensity function -- features that are difficult to capture with standard modeling approaches. This paper proposes a spatial Cox process model in which nonstationarity is induced through a random partition of the spatial domain, with conditionally independent Gaussian process priors specified across the resulting regions. This construction allows for heterogeneous spatial behavior, including sharp transitions in intensity. To ensure exact inference, a discretization-free MCMC algorithm is developed to target the infinite-dimensional posterior distribution without approximation. The random partition framework also reduces the computational burden typically associated with Gaussian process models. Spatial covariates can be incorporated to account for structured variation in intensity. The proposed methodology is evaluated through synthetic examples and real-world applications, demonstrating its ability to flexibly capture complex spatial structures. The paper concludes with a discussion of potential extensions and directions for future work.</p></details> |  |
| **[SToFM: a Multi-scale Foundation Model for Spatial Transcriptomics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11588v2)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) technologies provide biologists with rich insights into single-cell biology by preserving spatial context of cells. Building foundational models for ST can significantly enhance the analysis of vast and complex data sources, unlocking new perspectives on the intricacies of biological tissues. However, modeling ST data is inherently challenging due to the need to extract multi-scale information from tissue slices containing vast numbers of cells. This process requires integrating macro-scale tissue morphology, micro-scale cellular microenvironment, and gene-scale gene expression profile. To address this challenge, we propose SToFM, a multi-scale Spatial Transcriptomics Foundation Model. SToFM first performs multi-scale information extraction on each ST slice, to construct a set of ST sub-slices that aggregate macro-, micro- and gene-scale information. Then an SE(2) Transformer is used to obtain high-quality cell representations from the sub-slices. Additionally, we construct \textbf{SToCorpus-88M}, the largest high-resolution spatial transcriptomics corpus for pretraining. SToFM achieves outstanding performance on a variety of downstream tasks, such as tissue region semantic segmentation and cell type annotation, demonstrating its comprehensive understanding of ST data through capturing and integrating multi-scale information.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accpe...</summary><p>Accpeted by ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **[ISDrama: Immersive Spatial Drama Generation through Multimodal Prompting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20630v5)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal immersive spatial drama generation focuses on creating continuous multi-speaker binaural speech with dramatic prosody based on multimodal prompts, with potential applications in AR, VR, and others. This task requires simultaneous modeling of spatial information and dramatic prosody based on multimodal inputs, with high data collection costs. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first attempt to address these challenges. We construct MRSDrama, the first multimodal recorded spatial drama dataset, containing binaural drama audios, scripts, videos, geometric poses, and textual prompts. Then, we propose ISDrama, the first immersive spatial drama generation model through multimodal prompting. ISDrama comprises these primary components: 1) Multimodal Pose Encoder, based on contrastive learning, considering the Doppler effect caused by moving speakers to extract unified pose information from multimodal prompts. 2) Immersive Drama Transformer, a flow-based mamba-transformer model that generates high-quality drama, incorporating Drama-MOE to select proper experts for enhanced prosody and pose control. We also design a context-consistent classifier-free guidance strategy to coherently generate complete drama. Experimental results show that ISDrama outperforms baseline models on objective and subjective metrics. The demos are available at https://aaronz345.github.io/ISDramaDemo. We provide the dataset and the evaluation code at https://huggingface.co/datasets/AaronZ345/MRSDrama and https://github.com/AaronZ345/ISDrama.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM Multimedia 2025</p></details> |
| **[STQE: Spatial-Temporal Quality Enhancement for G-PCC Compressed Dynamic Point Clouds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17522v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Very few studies have addressed quality enhancement for compressed dynamic point clouds. In particular, the effective exploitation of spatial-temporal correlations between point cloud frames remains largely unexplored. Addressing this gap, we propose a spatial-temporal attribute quality enhancement (STQE) network that exploits both spatial and temporal correlations to improve the visual quality of G-PCC compressed dynamic point clouds. Our contributions include a recoloring-based motion compensation module that remaps reference attribute information to the current frame geometry to achieve precise inter-frame geometric alignment, a channel-aware temporal attention module that dynamically highlights relevant regions across bidirectional reference frames, a Gaussian-guided neighborhood feature aggregation module that efficiently captures spatial dependencies between geometry and color attributes, and a joint loss function based on the Pearson correlation coefficient, designed to alleviate over-smoothing effects typical of point-wise mean squared error optimization. When applied to the latest G-PCC test model, STQE achieved improvements of 0.855 dB, 0.682 dB, and 0.828 dB in delta PSNR, with Bj{\o}ntegaard Delta rate (BD-rate) reductions of -25.2%, -31.6%, and -32.5% for the Luma, Cb, and Cr components, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Spatial Diversity for Region-based Active Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17367v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-of-the-art methods for semantic segmentation are based on deep neural networks trained on large-scale labeled datasets. Acquiring such datasets would incur large annotation costs, especially for dense pixel-level prediction tasks like semantic segmentation. We consider region-based active learning as a strategy to reduce annotation costs while maintaining high performance. In this setting, batches of informative image regions instead of entire images are selected for labeling. Importantly, we propose that enforcing local spatial diversity is beneficial for active learning in this case, and to incorporate spatial diversity along with the traditional active selection criterion, e.g., data sample uncertainty, in a unified optimization framework for region-based active learning. We apply this framework to the Cityscapes and PASCAL VOC datasets and demonstrate that the inclusion of spatial diversity effectively improves the performance of uncertainty-based and feature diversity-based active learning methods. Our framework achieves $95\%$ performance of fully supervised methods with only $5-9\%$ of the labeled pixels, outperforming all state-of-the-art region-based active learning methods for semantic segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>publi...</summary><p>published in IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 2021</p></details> |
| **[SFNet: A Spatial-Frequency Domain Deep Learning Network for Efficient Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16267v2)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that predominantly affects the elderly population and currently has no cure. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), as a non-invasive imaging technique, is essential for the early diagnosis of AD. MRI inherently contains both spatial and frequency information, as raw signals are acquired in the frequency domain and reconstructed into spatial images via the Fourier transform. However, most existing AD diagnostic models extract features from a single domain, limiting their capacity to fully capture the complex neuroimaging characteristics of the disease. While some studies have combined spatial and frequency information, they are mostly confined to 2D MRI, leaving the potential of dual-domain analysis in 3D MRI unexplored. To overcome this limitation, we propose Spatio-Frequency Network (SFNet), the first end-to-end deep learning framework that simultaneously leverages spatial and frequency domain information to enhance 3D MRI-based AD diagnosis. SFNet integrates an enhanced dense convolutional network to extract local spatial features and a global frequency module to capture global frequency-domain representations. Additionally, a novel multi-scale attention module is proposed to further refine spatial feature extraction. Experiments on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset demonstrate that SFNet outperforms existing baselines and reduces computational overhead in classifying cognitively normal (CN) and AD, achieving an accuracy of 95.1%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial Frequency Modulation for Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11893v2)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High spatial frequency information, including fine details like textures, significantly contributes to the accuracy of semantic segmentation. However, according to the Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem, high-frequency components are vulnerable to aliasing or distortion when propagating through downsampling layers such as strided-convolution. Here, we propose a novel Spatial Frequency Modulation (SFM) that modulates high-frequency features to a lower frequency before downsampling and then demodulates them back during upsampling. Specifically, we implement modulation through adaptive resampling (ARS) and design a lightweight add-on that can densely sample the high-frequency areas to scale up the signal, thereby lowering its frequency in accordance with the Frequency Scaling Property. We also propose Multi-Scale Adaptive Upsampling (MSAU) to demodulate the modulated feature and recover high-frequency information through non-uniform upsampling This module further improves segmentation by explicitly exploiting information interaction between densely and sparsely resampled areas at multiple scales. Both modules can seamlessly integrate with various architectures, extending from convolutional neural networks to transformers. Feature visualization and analysis confirm that our method effectively alleviates aliasing while successfully retaining details after demodulation. Finally, we validate the broad applicability and effectiveness of SFM by extending it to image classification, adversarial robustness, instance segmentation, and panoptic segmentation tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/Linwei-Chen/SFM.</p></details> | Accept by TPAMI 2025 |
| **[Efficient Bayesian Inference for Spatial Point Patterns Using the Palm Likelihood](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17065v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bayesian inference for spatial point patterns is often hindered computationally by intractable likelihoods. In the frequentist literature, estimating equations utilizing pseudolikelihoods have long been used for simulation-free parameter estimation. One such pseudolikelihood based on the process of differences is known as the Palm likelihood. Utilizing notions of Bayesian composite likelihoods and generalized Bayesian inference, we develop a framework for the use of Palm likelihoods in a Bayesian context. Naive implementation of the Palm likelihood results in posterior undercoverage of model parameters. We propose two approaches to remedy this issue and calibrate the resulting posterior. Numerical simulations illustrate both the efficacy of the method in terms of statistical properties and the superiority in terms of computational efficiency when compared to classical Markov chain Monte Carlo. The method is then applied to the popular \textit{Beilschmiedia pendula Lauraceae} dataset.</p></details> |  |

However, the high cost and scarcity of high resolution ST data remain significant challenges. We present Single-shot Sparser-to-Sparse (S2S-ST), a novel framework for accurate ST imputation that requires only a single and low-cost sparsely sampled ST dataset alongside widely available natural images for co-training. Our approach integrates three key innovations: (1) a sparser-to-sparse self-supervised learning strategy that leverages intrinsic spatial patterns in ST data, (2) cross-domain co-learning with natural images to enhance feature representation, and (3) a Cascaded Data Consistent Imputation Network (CDCIN) that iteratively refines predictions while preserving sampled gene data fidelity. Extensive experiments on diverse tissue types, including breast cancer, liver, and lymphoid tissue, demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in imputation accuracy. By enabling robust ST reconstruction from sparse inputs, our framework significantly reduces reliance on costly high resolution data, facilitating potential broader adoption in biomedical research and clinical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 5 figure, under review</p></details> |
| **[A Partitioned Sparse Variational Gaussian Process for Fast, Distributed Spatial Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16771v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The next generation of Department of Energy supercomputers will be capable of exascale computation. For these machines, far more computation will be possible than that which can be saved to disk. As a result, users will be unable to rely on post-hoc access to data for uncertainty quantification and other statistical analyses and there will be an urgent need for sophisticated machine learning algorithms which can be trained in situ. Algorithms deployed in this setting must be highly scalable, memory efficient and capable of handling data which is distributed across nodes as spatially contiguous partitions. One suitable approach involves fitting a sparse variational Gaussian process (SVGP) model independently and in parallel to each spatial partition. The resulting model is scalable, efficient and generally accurate, but produces the undesirable effect of constructing discontinuous response surfaces due to the disagreement between neighboring models at their shared boundary. In this paper, we extend this idea by allowing for a small amount of communication between neighboring spatial partitions which encourages better alignment of the local models, leading to smoother spatial predictions and a better fit in general. Due to our decentralized communication scheme, the proposed extension remains highly scalable and adds very little overhead in terms of computation (and none, in terms of memory). We demonstrate this Partitioned SVGP (PSVGP) approach for the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) and compare the results to the independent SVGP case.</p></details> |  |

However, existing audio-language models struggle with processing spatial audio and perceiving spatial acoustic scenes. We introduce the Spatial Audio Language Model (SALM), a novel framework that bridges spatial audio and language via multi-modal contrastive learning. SALM consists of a text encoder and a dual-branch audio encoder, decomposing spatial sound into semantic and spatial components through structured audio embeddings. Key features of SALM include seamless alignment of spatial and text representations, separate and joint extraction of spatial and semantic information, zero-shot direction classification and robust support for spatial audio editing. Experimental results demonstrate that SALM effectively captures and aligns cross-modal representations. Furthermore, it supports advanced editing capabilities, such as altering directional audio using text-based embeddings.</p></details> | 5 pages, 1 figure |

Existing methods typically necessitate supervised learning based on human-refined masks in the ventricular myocardium, which become impractical without contrast agents. We introduce a self-supervised framework, namely Codebook-based Temporal-Spatial Learning (CTSL), that learns dynamic, spatiotemporal representations from raw Cine data without requiring segmentation masks. CTSL decouples temporal and spatial features through a multi-view distillation strategy, where the teacher model processes multiple Cine views, and the student model learns from reduced-dimensional Cine-SA sequences. By leveraging codebook-based feature representations and dynamic lesion self-detection through motion cues, CTSL captures intricate temporal dependencies and motion patterns. High-confidence MACE risk predictions are achieved through our model, providing a rapid, non-invasive solution for cardiac risk assessment that outperforms traditional contrast-dependent methods, thereby enabling timely and accessible heart disease diagnosis in clinical settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at MICCAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Spatial 3D-LLM: Exploring Spatial Awareness in 3D Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16524v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>New era has unlocked exciting possibilities for extending Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle 3D vision-language tasks. However, most existing 3D multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) rely on compressing holistic 3D scene information or segmenting independent objects to perform these tasks, which limits their spatial awareness due to insufficient representation of the richness inherent in 3D scenes. To overcome these limitations, we propose Spatial 3D-LLM, a 3D MLLM specifically designed to enhance spatial awareness for 3D vision-language tasks by enriching the spatial embeddings of 3D scenes. Spatial 3D-LLM integrates an LLM backbone with a progressive spatial awareness scheme that progressively captures spatial information as the perception field expands, generating location-enriched 3D scene embeddings to serve as visual prompts. Furthermore, we introduce two novel tasks: 3D object distance measurement and 3D layout editing, and construct a 3D instruction dataset, MODEL, to evaluate the model's spatial awareness capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that Spatial 3D-LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of 3D vision-language tasks, revealing the improvements stemmed from our progressive spatial awareness scheme of mining more profound spatial information. Our code is available at https://github.com/bjshuyuan/Spatial-3D-LLM.</p></details> | Accepted by ICME2025 |
| **[Multivariate spatial models for small area estimation of species-specific forest inventory parameters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07118v2)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>National Forest Inventories (NFIs) provide statistically reliable information on forest resources at national and other large spatial scales. As forest management and conservation needs become increasingly complex, NFIs are being called upon to provide forest parameter estimates at spatial scales smaller than current design-based estimation procedures can provide. This is particularly true when estimates are desired by species or species groups. Here we propose a multivariate spatial model for small area estimation of species-specific forest inventory parameters. The hierarchical Bayesian modeling framework accounts for key complexities in species-specific forest inventory data, such as zero-inflation, correlations among species, and residual spatial autocorrelation. Importantly, by fitting the model directly to the individual plot-level data, the framework enables estimates of species-level forest parameters, with associated uncertainty, across any user-defined small area of interest. A simulation study revealed minimal bias and higher accuracy of the proposed model-based approach compared to design-based estimator. We applied the model to estimate species-specific county-level aboveground biomass for the 20 most abundant tree species in the southern United States using Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data. Model-based biomass estimates had high correlations with design-based estimates, yet the model-based estimates tended to have a slight positive bias relative to design-based estimates. Importantly, the proposed model provided large gains in precision across all 20 species. On average across species, 91.5% of county-level biomass estimates had higher precision compared to the design-based estimates. The proposed framework improves the ability of NFI data users to generate species-level forest parameter estimates with reasonable precision at management-relevant spatial scales.</p></details> | 40 pages, 7 figures |
| **[A Bayesian Geoadditive Model for Spatial Disaggregation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16376v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel Bayesian spatial disaggregation model for count data, providing fast and flexible inference at high resolution. First, it incorporates non-linear covariate effects using penalized splines, a flexible approach that is not typically included in existing spatial disaggregation methods. Additionally, it employs a spline-based low-rank kriging approximation for modeling spatial dependencies. The use of Laplace approximation provides computational advantages over traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approaches, facilitating scalability to large datasets. We explore two estimation strategies: one using the exact likelihood and another leveraging a spatially discrete approximation for enhanced computational efficiency. Simulation studies demonstrate that both methods perform well, with the approximate method offering significant computational gains. We illustrate the applicability of our model by disaggregating disease rates in the United Kingdom and Belgium, showcasing its potential for generating high-resolution risk maps. By combining flexibility in covariate modeling, computational efficiency and ease of implementation, our approach offers a practical and effective framework for spatial disaggregation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Micromobility Flow Prediction: A Bike Sharing Station-level Study via Multi-level Spatial-Temporal Attention Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16020v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient use of urban micromobility resources such as bike sharing is challenging due to the unbalanced station-level demand and supply, which causes the maintenance of the bike sharing systems painstaking. Prior efforts have been made on accurate prediction of bike traffics, i.e., demand/pick-up and return/drop-off, to achieve system efficiency. However, bike station-level traffic prediction is difficult because of the spatial-temporal complexity of bike sharing systems. Moreover, such level of prediction over entire bike sharing systems is also challenging due to the large number of bike stations. To fill this gap, we propose BikeMAN, a multi-level spatio-temporal attention neural network to predict station-level bike traffic for entire bike sharing systems. The proposed network consists of an encoder and a decoder with an attention mechanism representing the spatial correlation between features of bike stations in the system and another attention mechanism describing the temporal characteristic of bike station traffic. Through experimental study on over 10 millions trips of bike sharing systems (> 700 stations) of New York City, our network showed high accuracy in predicting the bike station traffic of all stations in the city.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, UrbComp 2024</p></details> |
| **[A Practical Investigation of Spatially-Controlled Image Generation with Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15724v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enabling image generation models to be spatially controlled is an important area of research, empowering users to better generate images according to their own fine-grained specifications via e.g. edge maps, poses. Although this task has seen impressive improvements in recent times, a focus on rapidly producing stronger models has come at the cost of detailed and fair scientific comparison. Differing training data, model architectures and generation paradigms make it difficult to disentangle the factors contributing to performance. Meanwhile, the motivations and nuances of certain approaches become lost in the literature. In this work, we aim to provide clear takeaways across generation paradigms for practitioners wishing to develop transformer-based systems for spatially-controlled generation, clarifying the literature and addressing knowledge gaps. We perform controlled experiments on ImageNet across diffusion-based/flow-based and autoregressive (AR) models. First, we establish control token prefilling as a simple, general and performant baseline approach for transformers. We then investigate previously underexplored sampling time enhancements, showing that extending classifier-free guidance to control, as well as softmax truncation, have a strong impact on control-generation consistency. Finally, we re-clarify the motivation of adapter-based approaches, demonstrating that they mitigate "forgetting" and maintain generation quality when trained on limited downstream data, but underperform full training in terms of generation-control consistency. Code will be released upon publication.</p></details> | preprint |
| **[Continuous sPatial-Temporal Deformable Image Registration (CPT-DIR) for motion modelling in radiotherapy: beyond classic voxel-based methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00430v2)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deformable image registration (DIR) is a crucial tool in radiotherapy for analyzing anatomical changes and motion patterns. Current DIR implementations rely on discrete volumetric motion representation, which often leads to compromised accuracy and uncertainty when handling significant anatomical changes and sliding boundaries. This limitation affects the reliability of subsequent contour propagation and dose accumulation procedures, particularly in regions with complex anatomical interfaces such as the lung-chest wall boundary. Given that organ motion is inherently a continuous process in both space and time, we aimed to develop a model that preserves these fundamental properties. Drawing inspiration from fluid mechanics, we propose a novel approach using implicit neural representation (INR) for continuous modeling of patient anatomical motion. This approach ensures spatial and temporal continuity while effectively unifying Eulerian and Lagrangian specifications to enable natural continuous motion modeling and frame interpolation. The integration of these specifications provides a more comprehensive understanding of anatomical deformation patterns. By leveraging the continuous representations, the CPT-DIR method significantly enhances registration and interpolation accuracy, automation, and speed. The method demonstrates superior performance in landmark and contour precision, particularly in challenging anatomical regions, representing a substantial advancement over conventional approaches in deformable image registration. The improved efficiency and accuracy of CPT-DIR make it particularly suitable for real-time adaptive radiotherapy applications.</p></details> |  |

However, they still struggle with non-uniform lighting scenarios, such as backlit and shadow, appearing as over-exposure or inadequate brightness restoration. To address this challenge, we present a Spatially-Adaptive Illumination-Guided Transformer (SAIGFormer) framework that enables accurate illumination restoration. Specifically, we propose a dynamic integral image representation to model the spatially-varying illumination, and further construct a novel Spatially-Adaptive Integral Illumination Estimator ($\text{SAI}^2\text{E}$). Moreover, we introduce an Illumination-Guided Multi-head Self-Attention (IG-MSA) mechanism, which leverages the illumination to calibrate the lightness-relevant features toward visual-pleased illumination enhancement. Extensive experiments on five standard low-light datasets and a cross-domain benchmark (LOL-Blur) demonstrate that our SAIGFormer significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative metrics. In particular, our method achieves superior performance in non-uniform illumination enhancement while exhibiting strong generalization capabilities across multiple datasets.

| **[Revisiting the Effect of Grid-Following Converter on Frequency Dynamics -- Part II: Spatial Variation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15362v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Besides the center of inertia (COI) frequency dynamics addressed in Part I, the spatial frequency variation in power systems with grid-following (GFL) converters is also crucial. Part II revisits the effect of GFLs on frequency spatial variation. Leveraging the interfacing state variables and equivalent frequency defined in Part I, an extended frequency divider (FD) formula is proposed. The linearized mapping relationship between network node frequency and synchronous generator (SG) rotor frequency, as well as GFL equivalent frequency, is modeled. The superposition contribution from GFLs is determined by the electrical distance between the generator and the frequency observation node, as well as the system power flow conditions. Additionally, the frequency mapping for branch currents, which is overlooked in previous research, is addressed. Simulation results validate the accuracy of the proposed extended FD formula. They quantitatively demonstrate that the superposition contribution of GFLs to node frequency is relatively weak and that the superposition coefficient is time-varying. The branch frequency superposition reveals a complex and distinctly different pattern.</p></details> |  |
| **[Few-Shot Object Detection via Spatial-Channel State Space Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15308v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the limited training samples in few-shot object detection (FSOD), we observe that current methods may struggle to accurately extract effective features from each channel. Specifically, this issue manifests in two aspects: i) channels with high weights may not necessarily be effective, and ii) channels with low weights may still hold significant value. To handle this problem, we consider utilizing the inter-channel correlation to facilitate the novel model's adaptation process to novel conditions, ensuring the model can correctly highlight effective channels and rectify those incorrect ones. Since the channel sequence is also 1-dimensional, its similarity with the temporal sequence inspires us to take Mamba for modeling the correlation in the channel sequence. Based on this concept, we propose a Spatial-Channel State Space Modeling (SCSM) module for spatial-channel state modeling, which highlights the effective patterns and rectifies those ineffective ones in feature channels. In SCSM, we design the Spatial Feature Modeling (SFM) module to balance the learning of spatial relationships and channel relationships, and then introduce the Channel State Modeling (CSM) module based on Mamba to learn correlation in channels. Extensive experiments on the VOC and COCO datasets show that the SCSM module enables the novel detector to improve the quality of focused feature representation in channels and achieve state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Spatial Context for Positive Pair Sampling in Histopathology Image Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05170v2)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has shown strong potential in cancer classification from whole-slide images (WSIs), but the need for extensive expert annotations often limits its success. Annotation-free approaches, such as multiple instance learning (MIL) and self-supervised learning (SSL), have emerged as promising alternatives to traditional annotation-based methods. However, conventional SSL methods typically rely on synthetic data augmentations, which may fail to capture the spatial structure critical to histopathology. In this work, we propose a spatial context-driven positive pair sampling strategy that enhances SSL by leveraging the morphological coherence of spatially adjacent patches within WSIs. Our method is modular and compatible with established joint embedding SSL frameworks, including Barlow Twins, BYOL, VICReg, and DINOv2. We evaluate its effectiveness on both slide-level classification using MIL and patch-level linear probing. Experiments across four datasets demonstrate consistent performance improvements, with accuracy gains of 5\% to 10\% compared to standard augmentation-based sampling. These findings highlight the value of spatial context in improving representation learning for computational pathology and provide a biologically meaningful enhancement for pretraining models in annotation-limited settings.

| **[Event-based Graph Representation with Spatial and Motion Vectors for Asynchronous Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15150v1)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event-based sensors offer high temporal resolution and low latency by generating sparse, asynchronous data. However, converting this irregular data into dense tensors for use in standard neural networks diminishes these inherent advantages, motivating research into graph representations. While such methods preserve sparsity and support asynchronous inference, their performance on downstream tasks remains limited due to suboptimal modeling of spatiotemporal dynamics. In this work, we propose a novel spatiotemporal multigraph representation to better capture spatial structure and temporal changes. Our approach constructs two decoupled graphs: a spatial graph leveraging B-spline basis functions to model global structure, and a temporal graph utilizing motion vector-based attention for local dynamic changes. This design enables the use of efficient 2D kernels in place of computationally expensive 3D kernels. We evaluate our method on the Gen1 automotive and eTraM datasets for event-based object detection, achieving over a 6% improvement in detection accuracy compared to previous graph-based works, with a 5x speedup, reduced parameter count, and no increase in computational cost. These results highlight the effectiveness of structured graph modeling for asynchronous vision. Project page: eventbasedvision.github.io/eGSMV.</p></details> |  |

In ecological assessment, citizen scientists identifying species across geographic regions exhibit systematic spatial patterns in task difficulty due to environmental factors. Similarly, in Author Recognition Tests, literary knowledge organizes by genre, where familiarity with science fiction authors systematically predicts recognition of other science fiction authors. Current spatial Item Response Theory methods, represented by the 1PLUS, 2PLUS, and 3PLUS model family, address these dependencies but remain limited by (1) binary response restrictions, and (2) conditional autoregressive priors that impose rigid local correlation assumptions, preventing effective modeling of complex spatial relationships. Our proposed method, Spatial Gaussian Process Item Response Theory (SGP-IRT), addresses these limitations by replacing conditional autoregressive priors with flexible Gaussian process priors that adapt to complex dependency structures while maintaining principled uncertainty quantification. SGP-IRT accommodates polytomous responses and models spatial dependencies in both geographic and abstract cognitive spaces, where items cluster by theoretical constructs rather than physical proximity. Simulation studies demonstrate improved parameter recovery, particularly for item difficulty estimation. Empirical applications show enhanced recovery of meaningful difficulty surfaces and improved measurement precision across psychological, educational, and ecological research applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 6 figures, 1 table.

| **[Spatial-Temporal Transformer with Curriculum Learning for EEG-Based Emotion Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14698v1)** | 2025-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>EEG-based emotion recognition plays an important role in developing adaptive brain-computer communication systems, yet faces two fundamental challenges in practical implementations: (1) effective integration of non-stationary spatial-temporal neural patterns, (2) robust adaptation to dynamic emotional intensity variations in real-world scenarios. This paper proposes SST-CL, a novel framework integrating spatial-temporal transformers with curriculum learning. Our method introduces two core components: a spatial encoder that models inter-channel relationships and a temporal encoder that captures multi-scale dependencies through windowed attention mechanisms, enabling simultaneous extraction of spatial correlations and temporal dynamics from EEG signals. Complementing this architecture, an intensity-aware curriculum learning strategy progressively guides training from high-intensity to low-intensity emotional states through dynamic sample scheduling based on a dual difficulty assessment. Comprehensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across various emotional intensity levels, with ablation studies confirming the necessity of both architectural components and the curriculum learning mechanism.</p></details> |  |

Transfer learning offers a promising solution by leveraging information from regions or domains with similar spatial spillover effects to improve the analysis of the target data. In this paper, we propose a parameter-transfer approach based on Mallows model averaging for spatial autoregressive models to improve the prediction accuracy. Our approach does not require sharing multi-source spatial data and can be combined with various parameter estimation methods, such as the maximum likelihood and the two-stage least squares. Theoretical analyses demonstrate that our method achieves asymptotic optimality and ensures weight convergence with an explicit convergence rate. Simulation studies and the application of infection count prediction in Africa further demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |

A Comparative Study of AR See-Through vs. 2D Minimap](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14316v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In high-stakes, time-critical scenarios-such as emergency evacuation, first responder prioritization, and crisis management -- decision-makers must rapidly choose among spatial targets, such as exits, individuals to assist, or areas to secure. Advances in indoor sensing and artificial intelligence (AI) can support these decisions by visualizing real-time situational data and AI suggestions on 2D maps. However, mentally mapping this information onto real-world spaces imposes significant cognitive load. This load can impair users' ability to appropriately judge AI suggestions, leading to inappropriate reliance (e.g., accepting wrong AI suggestions or rejecting correct ones). Embedded visualizations in Augmented Reality (AR), by directly overlaying information onto physical environments, may reduce this load and foster more deliberate, appropriate reliance on AI. But is this true? In this work, we conducted an empirical study (N = 32) comparing AR see-through (embedded visualization) and 2D Minimap in time-critical, AI-assisted spatial target selection tasks. Contrary to our expectations, users exhibited greater inappropriate reliance on AI in the AR condition. Our analysis further reveals that this is primarily due to over-reliance, with factors specific to embedded visualizations, such as perceptual challenges, visual proximity illusions, and highly realistic visual representations. Nonetheless, embedded visualizations demonstrated notable benefits in spatial reasoning, such as spatial mapping and egocentric spatial imagery. We conclude by discussing the empirical insights, deriving design implications, and outlining important directions for future research on human-AI decision collaboration in AR.</p></details> |  |

Additionally, we present, for the first time, a constructive algorithm based on the Moser-Tardos algorithm that ensures predictable performance. Furthermore, leveraging the properties of LLL-distribution and M-T-distribution, we establish the dependencies among the harmful structures during the construction process. We provide upper bounds on the probability change of remaining harmful structures after eliminating some of them. In particular, the elimination of 4-cycles increases the probability of 6-cycles becoming active by at most a factor of $e^{8/3}$.</p></details> | Accepted by ITW2025 |
| **[Learning Deformable Body Interactions With Adaptive Spatial Tokenization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13707v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulating interactions between deformable bodies is vital in fields like material science, mechanical design, and robotics. While learning-based methods with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are effective at solving complex physical systems, they encounter scalability issues when modeling deformable body interactions. To model interactions between objects, pairwise global edges have to be created dynamically, which is computationally intensive and impractical for large-scale meshes. To overcome these challenges, drawing on insights from geometric representations, we propose an Adaptive Spatial Tokenization (AST) method for efficient representation of physical states. By dividing the simulation space into a grid of cells and mapping unstructured meshes onto this structured grid, our approach naturally groups adjacent mesh nodes. We then apply a cross-attention module to map the sparse cells into a compact, fixed-length embedding, serving as tokens for the entire physical state. Self-attention modules are employed to predict the next state over these tokens in latent space. This framework leverages the efficiency of tokenization and the expressive power of attention mechanisms to achieve accurate and scalable simulation results. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in modeling deformable body interactions. Notably, it remains effective on large-scale simulations with meshes exceeding 100,000 nodes, where existing methods are hindered by computational limitations. Additionally, we contribute a novel large-scale dataset encompassing a wide range of deformable body interactions to support future research in this area.</p></details> | 21 pages, 15 figures |

TUI success will depend on how well they exploit spatiality, the intuitive spatial skills humans have with the objects they use. In this paper we carefully examine the relationship between humans and physical objects, and related previous research. From this examination we distill a set of observations, and turn these into heuristics for incorporation of spatiality into TUI application design, a cornerstone for their success. Following this line of thought, we identify spatial TUIs, the subset of TUIs that mediate interaction with shape, space and structure. We then examine several existing spatial TUIs using our heuristics.</p></details> |  |

While MLLMs have been extensively studied for visual semantic understanding tasks, their ability to perform precise and quantitative spatial-temporal understanding in real-world applications remains largely unexamined, leading to uncertain prospects. To evaluate models' Spatial-Temporal Intelligence, we introduce STI-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' spatial-temporal understanding through challenging tasks such as estimating and predicting the appearance, pose, displacement, and motion of objects. Our benchmark encompasses a wide range of robot and vehicle operations across desktop, indoor, and outdoor scenarios. The extensive experiments reveals that the state-of-the-art MLLMs still struggle in real-world spatial-temporal understanding, especially in tasks requiring precise distance estimation and motion analysis.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a systematic literature review of transformer-based spatial grounding approaches from 2018 to 2025.

This study provides essential insights and structured guidance for researchers and practitioners, facilitating the development of robust, reliable, and industry-ready transformer-based spatial grounding models.</p></details> |  |
| **[STF: Spatial Temporal Fusion for Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18149v2)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is a challenging task that aims to predict the future trajectory of vehicles or pedestrians over a short time horizon based on their historical positions. The main reason is that the trajectory is a kind of complex data, including spatial and temporal information, which is crucial for accurate prediction. Intuitively, the more information the model can capture, the more precise the future trajectory can be predicted. However, previous works based on deep learning methods processed spatial and temporal information separately, leading to inadequate spatial information capture, which means they failed to capture the complete spatial information. Therefore, it is of significance to capture information more fully and effectively on vehicle interactions. In this study, we introduced an integrated 3D graph that incorporates both spatial and temporal edges. Based on this, we proposed the integrated 3D graph, which considers the cross-time interaction information. In specific, we design a Spatial-Temporal Fusion (STF) model including Multi-layer perceptions (MLP) and Graph Attention (GAT) to capture the spatial and temporal information historical trajectories simultaneously on the 3D graph. Our experiment on the ApolloScape Trajectory Datasets shows that the proposed STF outperforms several baseline methods, especially on the long-time-horizon trajectory prediction.</p></details> | 6 pages, 6 figures |

This paper presents FORTRESS (Function-composition Optimized Real-Time Resilient Structural Segmentation), a new architecture that balances accuracy and speed by using a special method that combines depthwise separable convolutions with adaptive Kolmogorov-Arnold Network integration. FORTRESS incorporates three key innovations: a systematic depthwise separable convolution framework achieving a 3.6x parameter reduction per layer, adaptive TiKAN integration that selectively applies function composition transformations only when computationally beneficial, and multi-scale attention fusion combining spatial, channel, and KAN-enhanced features across decoder levels. The architecture achieves remarkable efficiency gains with 91% parameter reduction (31M to 2.9M), 91% computational complexity reduction (13.7 to 1.17 GFLOPs), and 3x inference speed improvement while delivering superior segmentation performance. Evaluation on benchmark infrastructure datasets demonstrates state-of-the-art results with an F1- score of 0.771 and a mean IoU of 0.677, significantly outperforming existing methods including U-Net, SA-UNet, and U- KAN. The dual optimization strategy proves essential for optimal performance, establishing FORTRESS as a robust solution for practical structural defect segmentation in resource-constrained environments where both accuracy and computational efficiency are paramount.

However, state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) struggle frequently with tasks as simple as anticipating how a scene will look after an egocentric motion: they perceive 2D images but lack an internal model of 3D dynamics. We therefore propose MindJourney, a test-time scaling framework that grants a VLM with this missing capability by coupling it to a controllable world model based on video diffusion. The VLM iteratively sketches a concise camera trajectory, while the world model synthesizes the corresponding view at each step. The VLM then reasons over this multi-view evidence gathered during the interactive exploration. Without any fine-tuning, our MindJourney achieves over an average 8% performance boost on the representative spatial reasoning benchmark SAT, showing that pairing VLMs with world models for test-time scaling offers a simple, plug-and-play route to robust 3D reasoning. Meanwhile, our method also improves upon the test-time inference VLMs trained through reinforcement learning, which demonstrates the potential of our method that utilizes world models for test-time scaling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://umass-embodied-agi.github.io/MindJourney</p></details> |

While hippocampal neurons encoding position and orientation are well documented, the large-scale neural dynamics supporting spatial representation, particularly during naturalistic, passive experience, remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that non-invasive brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) based on electroencephalography (EEG) can decode spontaneous, fine-grained egocentric 6D pose, comprising three-dimensional position and orientation, during passive viewing of egocentric video. Despite EEG's limited spatial resolution and high signal noise, we find that spatially coherent visual input (i.e., continuous and structured motion) reliably evokes decodable spatial representations, aligning with participants' subjective sense of spatial engagement. Decoding performance further improves when visual input is presented at a frame rate of 100 ms per image, suggesting alignment with intrinsic neural temporal dynamics. Using gradient-based backpropagation through a neural decoding model, we identify distinct EEG channels contributing to position -- and orientation specific -- components, revealing a distributed yet complementary neural encoding scheme. These findings indicate that the brain's spatial systems operate spontaneously and continuously, even under passive conditions, challenging traditional distinctions between active and passive spatial cognition. Our results offer a non-invasive window into the automatic construction of egocentric spatial maps and advance our understanding of how the human mind transforms everyday sensory experience into structured internal representations.</p></details> |  |

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in general reasoning, their effectiveness in spatial strategic reasoning, which is critical for complex and fully observable board games, remains insufficiently explored. In this work, we adopt Chinese Chess (Xiangqi) as a challenging and rich testbed due to its intricate rules and spatial complexity. To advance LLMs' strategic competence in such environments, we propose a training framework tailored to Xiangqi, built upon a large-scale dataset of five million board-move pairs enhanced with expert annotations and engine evaluations. Building on this foundation, we introduce Xiangqi-R1, a 7B-parameter model trained in multi-stage manner: (1) fine-tuning for legal move prediction to capture basic spatial rules, (2) incorporating strategic annotations to improve decision-making, and (3) applying reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with multi-dimensional reward signals to enhance reasoning stability. Our Experimental results indicate that, despite their size and power, general-purpose LLMs struggle to achieve satisfactory performance in these tasks. Compared to general-purpose LLMs, Xiangqi-R1 greatly advances with an 18% rise in move legality and a 22% boost in analysis accuracy. Our results point to a promising path for creating general strategic intelligence in spatially complex areas.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |

Aiming to achieve minimal speech distortion, a hard constraint has been used in previous work in the optimization problem to compute the control filter. In this work, we propose a soft-constrained SSANC system that uses a frequency-independent parameter to trade off between speech distortion and noise reduction. We derive both time- and frequency-domain formulations, and show that conventional active noise control and hard-constrained SSANC represent two limiting cases of the proposed design. We evaluate the system through simulations using a pair of open-fitting hearables in an anechoic environment with one speech source and two noise sources. The simulation results validate the theoretical derivations and demonstrate that for a broad range of the trade-off parameter, the signal-to-noise ratio and the speech quality and intelligibility in terms of PESQ and ESTOI can be substantially improved compared to the hard-constrained design.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE Workshop on Applications of Signal Processing to Audio and Acoustics (WASPAA) 2025. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2505.10372</p></details> |

Existing methods mainly utilize spatial attention to highlight the region of interest. However, due to limitations of medical imaging devices, medical images exhibit significant heterogeneity, posing challenges for segmentation. Ultrasound images, for instance, often suffer from speckle noise, low resolution, and poor contrast between target tissues and background, which may lead to inaccurate boundary delineation. To address these challenges caused by heterogeneous image quality, we propose a hybrid CNN-Transformer model,called CFFormer, which leverages effective channel feature extraction to enhance the model' s ability to accurately identify tissue regions by capturing rich contextual information. The proposed architecture contains two key components: the Cross Feature Channel Attention (CFCA) module and the X-Spatial Feature Fusion (XFF) module. The model incorporates dual encoders, with the CNN encoder focusing on capturing local features and the Transformer encoder modeling global features. The CFCA module filters and facilitates interactions between the channel features from the two encoders, while the XFF module effectively reduces the significant semantic information differences in spatial features, enabling a smooth and cohesive spatial feature fusion. We evaluate our model across eight datasets covering five modalities to test its generalization capability. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms current state-of-the-art methods and maintains accurate tissue region segmentation across heterogeneous medical image datasets.

Existing methods regard the RGB domain as a unified domain and neglect the multiple subdomains within it, such as daytime, nighttime, and foggy scenes. We argue that decoupling the domain-invariant (DI) and domain-specific (DS) features across these multiple subdomains is beneficial for RGB-IR domain adaptation. To this end, this paper proposes a new SS-DC framework based on a decoupling-coupling strategy. In terms of decoupling, we design a Spectral Adaptive Idempotent Decoupling (SAID) module in the aspect of spectral decomposition. Due to the style and content information being highly embedded in different frequency bands, this module can decouple DI and DS components more accurately and interpretably. A novel filter bank-based spectral processing paradigm and a self-distillation-driven decoupling loss are proposed to improve the spectral domain decoupling. In terms of coupling, a new spatial-spectral coupling method is proposed, which realizes joint coupling through spatial and spectral DI feature pyramids. Meanwhile, this paper introduces DS from decoupling to reduce the domain bias. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can significantly improve the baseline performance and outperform existing UDAOD methods on multiple RGB-IR datasets, including a new experimental protocol proposed in this paper based on the FLIR-ADAS dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 mai...</summary><p>8 main-pages, 3 reference-pages, 5 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

However, the number of real-world object-centric event logs remains limited, and further studies are needed to test their usefulness. The increasing availability of data from team sports can facilitate object-centric process mining, leveraging both real-world data and suitable use cases. In this paper, we present a framework for transforming football (soccer) data into an object-centric event log, further enhanced with a spatial dimension. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by generating object-centric event logs based on real-world football data and discuss the results for varying process representations. With our paper, we provide the first example for object-centric event logs in football analytics.

| **[GS-Bias: Global-Spatial Bias Learner for Single-Image Test-Time Adaptation of Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11969v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in test-time adaptation (TTA) for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have garnered increasing attention, particularly through the use of multiple augmented views of a single image to boost zero-shot generalization. Unfortunately, existing methods fail to strike a satisfactory balance between performance and efficiency, either due to excessive overhead of tuning text prompts or unstable benefits from handcrafted, training-free visual feature enhancement. In this paper, we present Global-Spatial Bias Learner (GS-Bias), an efficient and effective TTA paradigm that incorporates two learnable biases during TTA, unfolded as the global bias and spatial bias. Particularly, the global bias captures the global semantic features of a test image by learning consistency across augmented views, while spatial bias learns the semantic coherence between regions in the image's spatial visual representation. It is worth highlighting that these two sets of biases are directly added to the logits outputed by the pretrained VLMs, which circumvent the full backpropagation through VLM that hinders the efficiency of existing TTA methods. This endows GS-Bias with extremely high efficiency while achieving state-of-the-art performance on 15 benchmark datasets. For example, it achieves a 2.23% improvement over TPT in cross-dataset generalization and a 2.72% improvement in domain generalization, while requiring only 6.5% of TPT's memory usage on ImageNet.</p></details> |  |
| **[MOSPA: Human Motion Generation Driven by Spatial Audio](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11949v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enabling virtual humans to dynamically and realistically respond to diverse auditory stimuli remains a key challenge in character animation, demanding the integration of perceptual modeling and motion synthesis. Despite its significance, this task remains largely unexplored. Most previous works have primarily focused on mapping modalities like speech, audio, and music to generate human motion. As of yet, these models typically overlook the impact of spatial features encoded in spatial audio signals on human motion. To bridge this gap and enable high-quality modeling of human movements in response to spatial audio, we introduce the first comprehensive Spatial Audio-Driven Human Motion (SAM) dataset, which contains diverse and high-quality spatial audio and motion data. For benchmarking, we develop a simple yet effective diffusion-based generative framework for human MOtion generation driven by SPatial Audio, termed MOSPA, which faithfully captures the relationship between body motion and spatial audio through an effective fusion mechanism. Once trained, MOSPA could generate diverse realistic human motions conditioned on varying spatial audio inputs. We perform a thorough investigation of the proposed dataset and conduct extensive experiments for benchmarking, where our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on this task. Our model and dataset will be open-sourced upon acceptance. Please refer to our supplementary video for more details.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Spatial-Physics Informed Model for 3D Spiral Sample Scanned by SQUID Microscopy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11853v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of advanced packaging is essential in the semiconductor manufacturing industry. However, non-destructive testing (NDT) of advanced packaging becomes increasingly challenging due to the depth and complexity of the layers involved. In such a scenario, Magnetic field imaging (MFI) enables the imaging of magnetic fields generated by currents. For MFI to be effective in NDT, the magnetic fields must be converted into current density. This conversion has typically relied solely on a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for magnetic field inversion; however, the existing approach does not consider eddy current effects or image misalignment in the test setup. In this paper, we present a spatial-physics informed model (SPIM) designed for a 3D spiral sample scanned using Superconducting QUantum Interference Device (SQUID) microscopy. The SPIM encompasses three key components: i) magnetic image enhancement by aligning all the "sharp" wire field signals to mitigate the eddy current effect using both in-phase (I-channel) and quadrature-phase (Q-channel) images; (ii) magnetic image alignment that addresses skew effects caused by any misalignment of the scanning SQUID microscope relative to the wire segments; and (iii) an inversion method for converting magnetic fields to magnetic currents by integrating the Biot-Savart Law with FFT. The results show that the SPIM improves I-channel sharpness by 0.3% and reduces Q-channel sharpness by 25%. Also, we were able to remove rotational and skew misalignments of 0.30 in a real image. Overall, SPIM highlights the potential of combining spatial analysis with physics-driven models in practical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>copyr...</summary><p>copyright 2025 IEEE.

It proposes a generative model that integrates effects of spatially-varying inputs and a network-valued input using deep neural networks to capture complex non-linear and spatial associations with the output. The method models spatial smoothness, accounts for subject heterogeneity and complex associations between network and spatial images at different scales, enables accurate inference of each images effect on the output image, and allows prediction with uncertainty quantification via Monte Carlo dropout, contributing to one of the first Explainable AI (XAI) frameworks for heterogeneous imaging data. The model is highly scalable to high-resolution data without the heavy pre-processing or summarization often required by Bayesian methods. Empirical results demonstrate its strong performance compared to existing statistical and deep learning methods. We applied the XAI model to the ABCD data which revealed associations between cortical features and ALFF throughout the entire brain. Our model performed comparably to existing methods in predictive accuracy but provided superior uncertainty quantification and faster computation, demonstrating its effectiveness for large-scale neuroimaging analysis. Open-source software in Python for XAI is available.</p></details> |  |
| **[On QoE-Aware Traffic Management for Real-time, Interactive Video with Time-variant Spatial Complexity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11798v1)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We analyzed spatial complexity, defined as the relationship between the required bitrate and a corresponding picture Quality of Experience (QoE) metric, for realistic, long, real-time, interactive video clips. Apart from variation across different content types, e.g., game genres, we discovered time-variability within a clip from second to second, and explored the ramifications for traffic management. We introduced utility as an elegant way to manage resource sharing preferences. Our analysis of resource sharing methods shows that frequent QoE-aware reallocation has significant performance advantages compared to static rate allocation, even in case the latter is based on rich information about long-term average spatial complexity. We have also shown that utility-based resource allocation has clear advantages over methods targeting equal QoE allocation, it increases the average QoE, while it still controls the worst case QoE.</p></details> |  |

The Spatial Web is missing a key ingredient that is impeding its growth -- a spatial naming system to resolve real-world locations to names. Today's spatial naming systems are digital maps such as Google and Apple maps. These maps and the location-based services provided on top of these maps are primarily controlled by a few large corporations and mostly cover outdoor public spaces. Emerging classes of applications, such as persistent world-scale augmented reality, require detailed maps of both outdoor and indoor spaces. Existing centralized mapping infrastructures are proving insufficient for such applications because of the scale of cartography efforts required and the privacy of indoor map data. In this paper, we present a case for a federated spatial naming system, or in other words, a federated mapping infrastructure. This enables disparate parties to manage and serve their own maps of physical regions and unlocks scalability of map management, isolation and privacy of maps. Map-related services such as address-to-location mapping, location-based search, and routing needs re-architecting to work on federated maps. We discuss some essential services and practicalities of enabling these services.</p></details> |  |

| **[SpaRTAN: Spatial Reinforcement Token-based Aggregation Network for Visual Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10999v1)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The resurgence of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in visual recognition tasks, exemplified by ConvNeXt, has demonstrated their capability to rival transformer-based architectures through advanced training methodologies and ViT-inspired design principles. However, both CNNs and transformers exhibit a simplicity bias, favoring straightforward features over complex structural representations. Furthermore, modern CNNs often integrate MLP-like blocks akin to those in transformers, but these blocks suffer from significant information redundancies, necessitating high expansion ratios to sustain competitive performance. To address these limitations, we propose SpaRTAN, a lightweight architectural design that enhances spatial and channel-wise information processing. SpaRTAN employs kernels with varying receptive fields, controlled by kernel size and dilation factor, to capture discriminative multi-order spatial features effectively. A wave-based channel aggregation module further modulates and reinforces pixel interactions, mitigating channel-wise redundancies. Combining the two modules, the proposed network can efficiently gather and dynamically contextualize discriminative features. Experimental results in ImageNet and COCO demonstrate that SpaRTAN achieves remarkable parameter efficiency while maintaining competitive performance. In particular, on the ImageNet-1k benchmark, SpaRTAN achieves 77. 7% accuracy with only 3.8M parameters and approximately 1.0 GFLOPs, demonstrating its ability to deliver strong performance through an efficient design. On the COCO benchmark, it achieves 50.0% AP, surpassing the previous benchmark by 1.2% with only 21.5M parameters.

We focus on achieving robust spatial generalization of the policy for the peg-in-hole (PiH) task trained from a small number of demonstrations. We propose EquiContact, a hierarchical policy composed of a high-level vision planner (Diffusion Equivariant Descriptor Field, Diff-EDF) and a novel low-level compliant visuomotor policy (Geometric Compliant ACT, G-CompACT). G-CompACT operates using only localized observations (geometrically consistent error vectors (GCEV), force-torque readings, and wrist-mounted RGB images) and produces actions defined in the end-effector frame. Through these design choices, we show that the entire EquiContact pipeline is SE(3)-equivariant, from perception to force control. We also outline three key components for spatially generalizable contact-rich policies: compliance, localized policies, and induced equivariance. Real-world experiments on PiH tasks demonstrate a near-perfect success rate and robust generalization to unseen spatial configurations, validating the proposed framework and principles.

To accurately characterize "data-level dependence'' in analysis of extreme events, we propose a mixture model that achieves flexible dependence properties and allows high-dimensional inference for extremes of spatial processes. We modify the popular random scale construction that multiplies a Gaussian random field by a single radial variable; we allow the radial variable to vary smoothly across space and add non-stationarity to the Gaussian process. As the level of extremeness increases, this single model exhibits both asymptotic independence at long ranges and either asymptotic dependence or independence at short ranges. We make joint inference on the dependence model and a marginal model using a copula approach within a Bayesian hierarchical model. Three different simulation scenarios show close to nominal frequentist coverage rates. Lastly, we apply the model to a dataset of extreme summertime precipitation over the central United States. We find that the joint tail of precipitation exhibits non-stationary dependence structure that cannot be captured by limiting extreme value models or current state-of-the-art sub-asymptotic models.</p></details> |  |

| **[3S-Attack: Spatial, Spectral and Semantic Invisible Backdoor Attack Against DNN Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10733v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Backdoor attacks involve either poisoning the training data or directly modifying the model in order to implant a hidden behavior, that causes the model to misclassify inputs when a specific trigger is present. During inference, the model maintains high accuracy on benign samples but misclassifies poisoned samples into an attacker-specified target class. Existing research on backdoor attacks has explored developing triggers in the spatial, spectral (frequency), and semantic (feature) domains, aiming to make them stealthy. While some approaches have considered designing triggers that are imperceptible in both spatial and spectral domains, few have incorporated the semantic domain. In this paper, we propose a novel backdoor attack, termed 3S-attack, which is stealthy across the spatial, spectral, and semantic domains. The key idea is to exploit the semantic features of benign samples as triggers, using Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) and a preliminary model for extraction. The trigger is then embedded in the spectral domain, followed by pixel-level restrictions after converting the samples back to the spatial domain. This process minimizes the distance between poisoned and benign samples, making the attack harder to detect by existing defenses and human inspection. Extensive experiments on various datasets, along with theoretical analysis, demonstrate the stealthiness of 3S-attack and highlight the need for stronger defenses to ensure AI security.

Traditional deep reinforcement learning methods face computational complexity bottlenecks, particularly with standard attention mechanisms, when handling large-scale urban-level location problems. This paper proposes GeoHopNet, a Hopfield-augmented sparse spatial attention network specifically designed for dynamic UAV site location problems. Our approach introduces four core innovations: (1) distance-biased multi-head attention mechanism that explicitly encodes spatial geometric information; (2) K-nearest neighbor sparse attention that reduces computational complexity from $O(N^2)$ to $O(NK)$; (3) a modern Hopfield external memory module; and (4) a memory regularization strategy. Experimental results demonstrate that GeoHopNet extends the boundary of solvable problem sizes. For large-scale instances with 1,000 nodes, where standard attention models become prohibitively slow (over 3 seconds per instance) and traditional solvers fail, GeoHopNet finds high-quality solutions (0.22\% optimality gap) in under 0.1 seconds. Compared to the state-of-the-art ADNet baseline on 100-node instances, our method improves solution quality by 22.2\% and is 1.8$\times$ faster.</p></details> | 12 Pages, 5 Figures |

SL operates by lifting standard inputs, such as 2D images, into a higher-dimensional space and subsequently processing them using networks designed for that higher dimension, such as a 3D U-Net. Counterintuitively, this dimensionality lifting allows us to achieve good performance on benchmark tasks compared to conventional approaches, while reducing inference costs and significantly lowering the number of model parameters. The SL framework produces intrinsically structured outputs along the lifted dimension. This emergent structure facilitates dense supervision during training and enables robust, near-zero-additional-cost prediction quality assessment at test time. We validate our approach across 19 benchmark datasets (13 for semantic segmentation and 6 for depth estimation), demonstrating competitive dense prediction performance while reducing the model parameter count by over 98% (in the U-Net case) and lowering inference costs. Spatial Lifting introduces a new vision modeling paradigm that offers a promising path toward more efficient, accurate, and reliable deep networks for dense prediction tasks in vision.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

However, obtaining lane-level traffic data has become a critical bottleneck for data-driven models due to limitations in the types and number of sensors and issues with the accuracy of tracking algorithms. To address this, we propose the Fine-grained Road Traffic Inference (FRTI) task, which aims to generate more detailed lane-level traffic information using limited road data, providing a more energy-efficient and cost-effective solution for precise traffic management. This task is abstracted as the first scene of the spatio-temporal graph node generation problem. We designed a two-stage framework--RoadDiff--to solve the FRTI task. solve the FRTI task. This framework leverages the Road-Lane Correlation Autoencoder-Decoder and the Lane Diffusion Module to fully utilize the limited spatio-temporal dependencies and distribution relationships of road data to accurately infer fine-grained lane traffic states. Based on existing research, we designed several baseline models with the potential to solve the FRTI task and conducted extensive experiments on six datasets representing different road conditions to validate the effectiveness of the RoadDiff model in addressing the FRTI task. The relevant datasets and code are available at https://github.com/ShuhaoLii/RoadDiff.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging Sequential Deep Operator Network and Video Diffusion: Residual Refinement of Spatio-Temporal PDE Solutions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06133v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video-diffusion models have recently set the standard in video generation, inpainting, and domain translation thanks to their training stability and high perceptual fidelity. Building on these strengths, we repurpose conditional video diffusion as a physics surrogate for spatio-temporal fields governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). Our two-stage surrogate first applies a Sequential Deep Operator Network (S-DeepONet) to produce a coarse, physics-consistent prior from the prescribed boundary or loading conditions. The prior is then passed to a conditional video diffusion model that learns only the residual: the point-wise difference between the ground truth and the S-DeepONet prediction. By shifting the learning burden from the full solution to its much smaller residual space, diffusion can focus on sharpening high-frequency structures without sacrificing global coherence. The framework is assessed on two disparate benchmarks: (i) vortex-dominated lid-driven cavity flow and (ii) tensile plastic deformation of dogbone specimens. Across these data sets the hybrid surrogate consistently outperforms its single-stage counterpart, cutting the mean relative L2 error from 4.57% to 0.83% for the flow problem and from 4.42% to 2.94% for plasticity, a relative improvements of 81.8% and 33.5% respectively. The hybrid approach not only lowers quantitative errors but also improves visual quality, visibly recovering fine spatial details. These results show that (i) conditioning diffusion on a physics-aware prior enables faithful reconstruction of localized features, (ii) residual learning reduces the problem, accelerating convergence and enhancing accuracy, and (iii) the same architecture transfers seamlessly from incompressible flow to nonlinear elasto-plasticity without problem-specific architectural modifications, highlighting its broad applicability to nonlinear, time-dependent continua.</p></details> |  |
| **[IntentVCNet: Bridging Spatio-Temporal Gaps for Intention-Oriented Controllable Video Captioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18531v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intent-oriented controlled video captioning aims to generate targeted descriptions for specific targets in a video based on customized user intent. Current Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) have gained strong instruction following and visual comprehension capabilities. Although the LVLMs demonstrated proficiency in spatial and temporal understanding respectively, it was not able to perform fine-grained spatial control in time sequences in direct response to instructions. This substantial spatio-temporal gap complicates efforts to achieve fine-grained intention-oriented control in video. Towards this end, we propose a novel IntentVCNet that unifies the temporal and spatial understanding knowledge inherent in LVLMs to bridge the spatio-temporal gap from both prompting and model perspectives. Specifically, we first propose a prompt combination strategy designed to enable LLM to model the implicit relationship between prompts that characterize user intent and video sequences. We then propose a parameter efficient box adapter that augments the object semantic information in the global visual context so that the visual token has a priori information about the user intent. The final experiment proves that the combination of the two strategies can further enhance the LVLM's ability to model spatial details in video sequences, and facilitate the LVLMs to accurately generate controlled intent-oriented captions. Our proposed method achieved state-of-the-art results in several open source LVLMs and was the runner-up in the IntentVC challenge.

| **[INLA-RF: A Hybrid Modeling Strategy for Spatio-Temporal Environmental Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18488v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Environmental processes often exhibit complex, non-linear patterns and discontinuities across space and time, posing significant challenges for traditional geostatistical modeling approaches. In this paper, we propose a hybrid spatio-temporal modeling framework that combines the interpretability and uncertainty quantification of Bayesian models -- estimated using the INLA-SPDE approach -- with the predictive power and flexibility of Random Forest (RF). Specifically, we introduce two novel algorithms, collectively named INLA-RF, which integrate a statistical spatio-temporal model with RF in an iterative two-stage framework. The first algorithm (INLA-RF1) incorporates RF predictions as an offset in the INLA-SPDE model, while the second (INLA-RF2) uses RF to directly correct selected latent field nodes. Both hybrid strategies enable uncertainty propagation between modeling stages, an aspect often overlooked in existing hybrid approaches. In addition, we propose a Kullback-Leibler divergence-based stopping criterion. We evaluate the predictive performance and uncertainty quantification capabilities of the proposed algorithms through two simulation studies. Results suggest that our hybrid approach enhances spatio-temporal prediction while maintaining interpretability and coherence in uncertainty estimates.</p></details> |  |

However, current prediction methods are limited in their adaptability across different urban environments and produce inaccurate results due to the high uncertainty in personal traffic patterns, the lack of detailed environmental context, and the complex dependencies among different network services. These challenges demand advanced modeling techniques that can capture dynamic traffic distributions and rich environmental features. Inspired by the recent success of diffusion models in distribution modeling and Large Language Models (LLMs) in contextual understanding, we propose an LLM-Enhanced Spatio-temporal Diffusion Model (LSDM). LSDM integrates the generative power of diffusion models with the adaptive learning capabilities of transformers, augmented by the ability to capture multimodal environmental information for modeling service-level patterns and dynamics. Extensive evaluations on real-world service-level datasets demonstrate that the model excels in traffic usage predictions, showing outstanding generalization and adaptability. After incorporating contextual information via LLM, the performance improves by at least 2.83% in terms of the coefficient of determination. Compared to models of a similar type, such as CSDI, the root mean squared error can be reduced by at least 8.29%. The code and dataset will be available at: https://github.com/SoftYuaneR/LSDM.</p></details> | 14 pages, 9 figures |

This allows for modeling non-linearities and interactions among predictor variables in a flexible data-driven manner and for accounting for spatio-temporal variation that is not explained by observable predictor variables. We also show how estimation and prediction can be done in a computationally efficient manner. In an application to a large U.S. mortgage credit risk data set, we find that both predictive default probabilities for individual loans and predictive loan portfolio loss distributions obtained with our novel approach are more accurate compared to conventional independent linear hazard models and also linear spatio-temporal models. Using interpretability tools for machine learning models, we find that the likely reasons for this outperformance are strong interaction and non-linear effects in the predictor variables and the presence of spatio-temporal frailty effects.</p></details> |  |

We propose COMPASS, a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework that enables decentralized agents to persistently monitor multiple moving targets efficiently. We model the environment as a graph, where nodes represent spatial locations and edges capture topological proximity, allowing agents to reason over structured layouts and revisit informative regions as needed. Each agent independently selects actions based on a shared spatio-temporal attention network that we design to integrate historical observations and spatial context. We model target dynamics using Gaussian Processes (GPs), which support principled belief updates and enable uncertainty-aware planning. We train COMPASS using centralized value estimation and decentralized policy execution under an adaptive reward setting. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that COMPASS consistently outperforms strong baselines in uncertainty reduction, target coverage, and coordination efficiency across dynamic multi-target scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reducing GPU Memory Fragmentation via Spatio-Temporal Planning for Efficient Large-Scale Model Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16274v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid scaling of large language models (LLMs) has significantly increased GPU memory pressure, which is further aggravated by training optimization techniques such as virtual pipeline and recomputation that disrupt tensor lifespans and introduce considerable memory fragmentation. Default GPU memory allocators of popular deep learning frameworks like PyTorch use online strategies without knowledge of tensor lifespans, which can waste up to 43\% of memory and cause out-of-memory errors, rendering optimization techniques ineffective or even unusable. To address this, we introduce STWeaver, a GPU memory allocator for deep learning frameworks that reduces fragmentation by exploiting the spatial and temporal regularity in memory allocation behaviors of training workloads. STWeaver introduces a novel paradigm that combines offline planning with online allocation. The offline planning leverages spatio-temporal regularities to generate a near-optimal allocation plan, while the online allocation handles complex and dynamic models such as Mixture-of-Experts (MoE). Built as a pluggable PyTorch allocator, STWeaver reduces fragmentation ratio on average by 79.2\% (up to 100\%) across both dense and sparse models, with negligible overhead. This enables more efficient, high-throughput training configurations and improves performance by up to 32.5\%.</p></details> |  |
| **[STL-GO: Spatio-Temporal Logic with Graph Operators for Distributed Systems with Multiple Network Topologies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15147v1)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent systems (MASs) consisting of a number of autonomous agents that communicate, coordinate, and jointly sense the environment to achieve complex missions can be found in a variety of applications such as robotics, smart cities, and internet-of-things applications. Modeling and monitoring MAS requirements to guarantee overall mission objectives, safety, and reliability is an important problem. Such requirements implicitly require reasoning about diverse sensing and communication modalities between agents, analysis of the dependencies between agent tasks, and the spatial or virtual distance between agents. To capture such rich MAS requirements, we model agent interactions via multiple directed graphs, and introduce a new logic -- Spatio-Temporal Logic with Graph Operators (STL-GO). The key innovation in STL-GO are graph operators that enable us to reason about the number of agents along either the incoming or outgoing edges of the underlying interaction graph that satisfy a given property of interest; for example, the requirement that an agent should sense at least two neighboring agents whose task graphs indicate the ability to collaborate. We then propose novel distributed monitoring conditions for individual agents that use only local information to determine whether or not an STL-GO specification is satisfied. We compare the expressivity of STL-GO against existing spatio-temporal logic formalisms, and demonstrate the utility of STL-GO and our distributed monitors in a bike-sharing and a multi-drone case study.</p></details> |  |

Most existing methods rely on binary classifiers trained using real and fake image sequences, therefore hindering their generalization capabilities to unseen generation methods. Moreover, with the constant progress in generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), deepfake artifacts are becoming imperceptible at both the spatial and the temporal levels, making them extremely difficult to capture. To address these issues, we propose a fine-grained deepfake video detection approach called FakeSTormer that enforces the modeling of subtle spatio-temporal inconsistencies while avoiding overfitting. Specifically, we introduce a multi-task learning framework that incorporates two auxiliary branches for explicitly attending artifact-prone spatial and temporal regions. Additionally, we propose a video-level data synthesis strategy that generates pseudo-fake videos with subtle spatio-temporal artifacts, providing high-quality samples and hand-free annotations for our additional branches. Extensive experiments on several challenging benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared to recent state-of-the-art methods.

In this paper, we demonstrate that effective information compression may occur over time or space during sequences of node communications in distributed algorithms, leading to the concept of spatio-temporal compressors. This abstraction classifies existing compressors and inspires new compressors as spatio-temporal compressors, with their effectiveness described by constructive stability criteria from nonlinear system theory. Subsequently, we incorporate these spatio-temporal compressors directly into standard continuous-time consensus flows and distributed primal-dual flows, establishing conditions ensuring exponential convergence. Additionally, we introduce a novel observer-based distributed primal-dual continuous flow integrated with spatio-temporal compressors, which provides broader convergence conditions. These continuous flows achieve exponential convergence to the global optimum when the objective function is strongly convex and can be discretized using Euler approximations.

While 3D CNNs have been effective at capturing spatiotemporal dynamics, recent Transformer models leverage self-attention to model long-range spatial and temporal dependencies. Despite achieving state-of-the-art performance on major benchmarks, Transformers remain computationally expensive, particularly with dense video data. To address this, we propose a lightweight Video Focal Modulation Network, DVFL-Net, which distills spatiotemporal knowledge from a large pre-trained teacher into a compact nano student model, enabling efficient on-device deployment. DVFL-Net utilizes knowledge distillation and spatial-temporal feature modulation to significantly reduce computation while preserving high recognition performance. We employ forward Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence alongside spatio-temporal focal modulation to effectively transfer both local and global context from the Video-FocalNet Base (teacher) to the proposed VFL-Net (student). We evaluate DVFL-Net on UCF50, UCF101, HMDB51, SSV2, and Kinetics-400, benchmarking it against recent state-of-the-art methods in Human Action Recognition (HAR). Additionally, we conduct a detailed ablation study analyzing the impact of forward KL divergence. The results confirm the superiority of DVFL-Net in achieving an optimal balance between performance and efficiency, demonstrating lower memory usage, reduced GFLOPs, and strong accuracy, making it a practical solution for real-time HAR applications.</p></details> | 17 pages |

Previous methods solve the issue of insufficient observation by leveraging 4D diffusion models to generate videos at novel viewpoints. However, the generated videos from these models often lack spatio-temporal consistency, thus degrading view synthesis quality. In this paper, we propose a novel sliding iterative denoising process to enhance the spatio-temporal consistency of the 4D diffusion model. Specifically, we define a latent grid in which each latent encodes the image, camera pose, and human pose for a certain viewpoint and timestamp, then alternately denoising the latent grid along spatial and temporal dimensions with a sliding window, and finally decode the videos at target viewpoints from the corresponding denoised latents. Through the iterative sliding, information flows sufficiently across the latent grid, allowing the diffusion model to obtain a large receptive field and thus enhance the 4D consistency of the output, while making the GPU memory consumption affordable. The experiments on the DNA-Rendering and ActorsHQ datasets demonstrate that our method is able to synthesize high-quality and consistent novel-view videos and significantly outperforms the existing approaches.

It serves as a cornerstone for achieving high-level autonomous driving. However, current approaches remain inadequate for accurately modeling the complex spatio-temporal interdependencies and the unpredictable variability of human driving behavior. To address these challenges, we propose CaSTFormer, a Causal Spatio-Temporal Transformer to explicitly model causal interactions between driver behavior and environmental context for robust intention prediction. Specifically, CaSTFormer introduces a novel Reciprocal Shift Fusion (RSF) mechanism for precise temporal alignment of internal and external feature streams, a Causal Pattern Extraction (CPE) module that systematically eliminates spurious correlations to reveal authentic causal dependencies, and an innovative Feature Synthesis Network (FSN) that adaptively synthesizes these purified representations into coherent spatio-temporal inferences. We evaluate the proposed CaSTFormer on the public Brain4Cars dataset, and it achieves state-of-the-art performance. It effectively captures complex causal spatio-temporal dependencies and enhances both the accuracy and transparency of driving intention prediction.</p></details> |  |

Leveraging fine-scale weekly mortality and high-resolution climate data from Austria (2002 to 2019), we assess how interactions between temperature, humidity, age, and gender influence mortality patterns. Our approach goes beyond conventional modelling by capturing complex dependencies through structured interactions across space-time, space-age, and age-time dimensions, allowing us to capture complex demographic and environmental dependencies. The analysis identifies district-level mortality patterns and quantifies climate-related risks on a weekly basis, offering new insights for public health surveillance.</p></details> |  |

Real-world measurements of such processes are often collected at irregularly distributed points in space, which can be effectively represented as graphs; however, there are currently only a few existing datasets. Our work aims to make advancements in the field of PDE-modeling accessible to the temporal graph machine learning community, while addressing the data scarcity problem, by creating and utilizing datasets based on PDEs. In this work, we create and use synthetic datasets based on PDEs to support spatio-temporal graph modeling in machine learning for different applications. More precisely, we showcase three equations to model different types of disasters and hazards in the fields of epidemiology, atmospheric particles, and tsunami waves. Further, we show how such created datasets can be used by benchmarking several machine learning models on the epidemiological dataset. Additionally, we show how pre-training on this dataset can improve model performance on real-world epidemiological data. The presented methods enable others to create datasets and benchmarks customized to individual requirements.

| **[Reprogramming Vision Foundation Models for Spatio-Temporal Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11558v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have achieved remarkable success in natural language processing and computer vision, demonstrating strong capabilities in modeling complex patterns. While recent efforts have explored adapting large language models (LLMs) for time-series forecasting, LLMs primarily capture one-dimensional sequential dependencies and struggle to model the richer spatio-temporal (ST) correlations essential for accurate ST forecasting. In this paper, we present \textbf{ST-VFM}, a novel framework that systematically reprograms Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) for general-purpose spatio-temporal forecasting. While VFMs offer powerful spatial priors, two key challenges arise when applying them to ST tasks: (1) the lack of inherent temporal modeling capacity and (2) the modality gap between visual and ST data. To address these, ST-VFM adopts a \emph{dual-branch architecture} that integrates raw ST inputs with auxiliary ST flow inputs, where the flow encodes lightweight temporal difference signals interpretable as dynamic spatial cues. To effectively process these dual-branch inputs, ST-VFM introduces two dedicated reprogramming stages. The \emph{pre-VFM reprogramming} stage applies a Temporal-Aware Token Adapter to embed temporal context and align both branches into VFM-compatible feature spaces. The \emph{post-VFM reprogramming} stage introduces a Bilateral Cross-Prompt Coordination module, enabling dynamic interaction between branches through prompt-based conditioning, thus enriching joint representation learning without modifying the frozen VFM backbone. Extensive experiments on ten spatio-temporal datasets show that ST-VFM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating effectiveness and robustness across VFM backbones (e.g., DINO, CLIP, DEIT) and ablation studies, establishing it as a strong general framework for spatio-temporal forecasting.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches in this field usually struggle to capture the complex spatio-temporal dependencies in EV charging behaviors, and their limited model parameters hinder their ability to learn complex data distribution representations from large datasets. To this end, we propose a novel EV spatio-temporal large language model (EV-STLLM) for accurate prediction. Our proposed framework is divided into two modules. In the data processing module, we utilize variational mode decomposition (VMD) for data denoising, and improved complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (ICEEMDAN) for data multi-frequency decomposition. Fuzzy information granulation (FIG) for extracting multi-scale information. Additionally, ReliefF is used for feature selection to mitigate redundancy. In the forecasting module, the EV-STLLM is used to directly achieve EV charging and occupancy forecasting. Firstly, we fully capture the intrinsic spatio-temporal characteristics of the data by integrating adjacency matrices derived from the regional stations network and spatio-temporal-frequency embedding information. Then, the partially frozen graph attention (PFGA) module is utilized to maintain the sequential feature modeling capabilities of the pre-trained large model while incorporating EV domain knowledge. Extensive experiments using real-world data from Shenzhen, China, demonstrate that our proposed framework can achieve superior accuracy and robustness compared to the state-of-the-art benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Although not only accuracy but also efficiency for scalability is important, some previous methods struggle to capture heterogeneity such as varying traffic patterns across regions and time periods. Moreover, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which are the mainstream of traffic prediction, not only require predefined adjacency matrix, but also limit scalability to large-scale data containing many nodes due to their inherent complexity. To overcome these limitations, we propose Deformable Dynamic Convolution Network (DDCN) for accurate yet efficient traffic prediction. Traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are limited in modeling non-Euclidean spatial structures and spatio-temporal heterogeneity, DDCN overcomes these challenges by dynamically applying deformable filters based on offset. Specifically, DDCN decomposes transformer-style CNN to encoder-decoder structure, and applies proposed approaches to the spatial and spatio-temporal attention blocks of the encoder to emphasize important features. The decoder, composed of feed-forward module, complements the output of the encoder. This novel structure make DDCN can perform accurate yet efficient traffic prediction. In comprehensive experiments on four real-world datasets, DDCN achieves competitive performance, emphasizing the potential and effectiveness of CNN-based approaches for spatio-temporal traffic prediction.</p></details> | 7 pages |

However, the inherent time variance of many spatio-temporal systems poses challenges to achieving accurate predictions whenever stationarity is not granted. In order to address non-stationarity, we propose a Distribution and Relation Adaptive Network (DRAN) capable of dynamically adapting to relation and distribution changes over time. While temporal normalization and de-normalization are frequently used techniques to adapt to distribution shifts, this operation is not suitable for the spatio-temporal context as temporal normalization scales the time series of nodes and possibly disrupts the spatial relations among nodes. In order to address this problem, a Spatial Factor Learner (SFL) module is developed that enables the normalization and de-normalization process. To adapt to dynamic changes in spatial relationships among sensors, we propose a Dynamic-Static Fusion Learner (DSFL) module that effectively integrates features learned from both dynamic and static relations through an adaptive fusion ratio mechanism. Furthermore, we introduce a Stochastic Learner to capture the noisy components of spatio-temporal representations. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on weather prediction and traffic flow forecasting tasks.Experimental results show that our SFL efficiently preserves spatial relationships across various temporal normalization operations. Visualizations of the learned dynamic and static relations demonstrate that DSFL can capture both local and distant relationships between nodes.</p></details> | 15 pages, 10 figures |

Spatio-Temporal Anomaly detection plays an important role in ensuring system security and operational integrity. However, current data-driven approaches, largely driven by black-box deep learning, face challenges in interpretability, adaptability to distribution shifts, and robustness under evolving system dynamics. In this paper, we advocate for a causal learning perspective to advance anomaly detection in spatially distributed infrastructures that grounds detection in structural cause-effect relationships. We identify and formalize three key directions: causal graph profiling, multi-view fusion, and continual causal graph learning, each offering distinct advantages in uncovering dynamic cause-effect structures across time and space. Drawing on real-world insights from systems such as water treatment infrastructures, we illustrate how causal models provide early warning signals and root cause attribution, addressing the limitations of black-box detectors. Looking ahead, we outline the future research agenda centered on multi-modality, generative AI-driven, and scalable adaptive causal frameworks. Our objective is to lay a new research trajectory toward scalable, adaptive, explainable, and spatially grounded anomaly detection systems. We hope to inspire a paradigm shift in cybersecurity research, promoting causality-driven approaches to address evolving threats in interconnected infrastructures.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 1 figure, Under Review in Vision Paper Track-ACM SIGSPATIAL 2025</p></details> |

To address this, we propose a training-free spatio-temporal token merging method, named STTM. Our key insight is to exploit local spatial and temporal redundancy in video data which has been overlooked in prior work. STTM first transforms each frame into multi-granular spatial tokens using a coarse-to-fine search over a quadtree structure, then performs directed pairwise merging across the temporal dimension. This decomposed merging approach outperforms existing token reduction methods across six video QA benchmarks. Notably, STTM achieves a 2$\times$ speed-up with only a 0.5% accuracy drop under a 50% token budget, and a 3$\times$ speed-up with just a 2% drop under a 30% budget. Moreover, STTM is query-agnostic, allowing KV cache reuse across different questions for the same video.

While most existing benchmarks evaluate models under offline settings with a fixed set of pre-recorded inputs, we introduce OST-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate Online Spatio-Temporal understanding from the perspective of an agent actively exploring a scene. The Online aspect emphasizes the need to process and reason over incrementally acquired observations, while the Spatio-Temporal component requires integrating current visual inputs with historical memory to support dynamic spatial reasoning. OST-Bench better reflects the challenges of real-world embodied perception. Built on an efficient data collection pipeline, OST-Bench consists of 1.4k scenes and 10k question-answer pairs collected from ScanNet, Matterport3D, and ARKitScenes. We evaluate several leading MLLMs on OST-Bench and observe that they fall short on tasks requiring complex spatio-temporal reasoning. Under the online setting, their accuracy declines as the exploration horizon extends and the memory grows. Through further experimental analysis, we identify common error patterns across models and find that both complex clue-based spatial reasoning demands and long-term memory retrieval requirements significantly drop model performance along two separate axes, highlighting the core challenges that must be addressed to improve online embodied reasoning.

Although various domain adaptation and generalization methods were proposed to promote the adaptability of deep-based rPPG models in unseen deployment environments, considerations in aspects like privacy concerns and real-time adaptation restrict their application in real-world deployment. Thus, we aim to propose a novel fully Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) strategy tailored for rPPG tasks in this work. Specifically, based on prior knowledge in physiology and our observations, we noticed not only there is spatio-temporal consistency in the frequency domain of rPPG signals, but also that inconsistency in the time domain was significant. Given this, by leveraging both consistency and inconsistency priors, we introduce an innovative expert knowledge-based self-supervised \textbf{C}onsistency-\textbf{i}n\textbf{C}onsistency-\textbf{i}ntegration (\textbf{CiCi}) framework to enhances model adaptation during inference. Besides, our approach further incorporates a gradient dynamic control mechanism to mitigate potential conflicts between priors, ensuring stable adaptation across instances. Through extensive experiments on five diverse datasets under the TTA protocol, our method consistently outperforms existing techniques, presenting state-of-the-art performance in real-time self-supervised adaptation without accessing source data. The code will be released later.</p></details> |  |

The standard neuron model for spike-based computation on such systems has long been the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron. A computationally light augmentation of the LIF neuron model with an adaptation mechanism has recently been shown to exhibit superior performance on spatio-temporal processing tasks. The root of the superiority of these so-called adaptive LIF neurons however is not well understood. In this article, we thoroughly analyze the dynamical, computational, and learning properties of adaptive LIF neurons and networks thereof. Our investigation reveals significant challenges related to stability and parameterization when employing the conventional Euler-Forward discretization for this class of models. We report a rigorous theoretical and empirical demonstration that these challenges can be effectively addressed by adopting an alternative discretization approach - the Symplectic Euler method, allowing to improve over state-of-the-art performances on common event-based benchmark datasets. Our further analysis of the computational properties of networks of adaptive LIF neurons shows that they are particularly well suited to exploit the spatio-temporal structure of input sequences without any normalization techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Nature Communications, July 2025</p></details> |

Recent studies have typically focused on fusing cross-domain spatio-temporal data to train unified Transformer-based models. However, these models suffer from quadratic computational complexity and high memory overhead, limiting their scalability and practical deployment. Inspired by the efficiency of Mamba, a state space model with linear time complexity, we explore its potential for efficient urban spatio-temporal prediction. However, directly applying Mamba as a spatio-temporal backbone leads to negative transfer and severe performance degradation. This is primarily due to spatio-temporal heterogeneity and the recursive mechanism of Mamba's hidden state updates, which limit cross-domain generalization. To overcome these challenges, we propose Damba-ST, a novel domain-adaptive Mamba-based model for efficient urban spatio-temporal prediction. Damba-ST retains Mamba's linear complexity advantage while significantly enhancing its adaptability to heterogeneous domains. Specifically, we introduce two core innovations: (1) a domain-adaptive state space model that partitions the latent representation space into a shared subspace for learning cross-domain commonalities and independent, domain-specific subspaces for capturing intra-domain discriminative features; (2) three distinct Domain Adapters, which serve as domain-aware proxies to bridge disparate domain distributions and facilitate the alignment of cross-domain commonalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate the generalization and efficiency of Damba-ST. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on prediction tasks and demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization, enabling seamless deployment in new urban environments without extensive retraining or fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |

Radar sensors, capable of penetrating ice, provide detailed radargram images of these internal layers. In this work, we present ST-GRIT, a spatio-temporal graph transformer for ice layer thickness, designed to process these radargrams and capture the spatiotemporal relationships between shallow and deep ice layers. ST-GRIT leverages an inductive geometric graph learning framework to extract local spatial features as feature embeddings and employs a series of temporal and spatial attention blocks separately to model long-range dependencies effectively in both dimensions. Experimental evaluation on radargram data from the Greenland ice sheet demonstrates that ST-GRIT consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art methods and other baseline graph neural networks by achieving lower root mean-squared error. These results highlight the advantages of self-attention mechanisms on graphs over pure graph neural networks, including the ability to handle noise, avoid oversmoothing, and capture long-range dependencies. Moreover, the use of separate spatial and temporal attention blocks allows for distinct and robust learning of spatial relationships and temporal patterns, providing a more comprehensive and effective approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for 2025 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)</p></details> |
| **[Accelerated Spatio-Temporal Bayesian Modeling for Multivariate Gaussian Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06938v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate Gaussian processes (GPs) offer a powerful probabilistic framework to represent complex interdependent phenomena. They pose, however, significant computational challenges in high-dimensional settings, which frequently arise in spatial-temporal applications. We present DALIA, a highly scalable framework for performing Bayesian inference tasks on spatio-temporal multivariate GPs, based on the methodology of integrated nested Laplace approximations. Our approach relies on a sparse inverse covariance matrix formulation of the GP, puts forward a GPU-accelerated block-dense approach, and introduces a hierarchical, triple-layer, distributed memory parallel scheme. We showcase weak scaling performance surpassing the state-of-the-art by two orders of magnitude on a model whose parameter space is 8$\times$ larger and measure strong scaling speedups of three orders of magnitude when running on 496 GH200 superchips on the Alps supercomputer. Applying DALIA to air pollution data from northern Italy over 48 days, we showcase refined spatial resolutions over the aggregated pollutant measurements.</p></details> |  |

However, in high-precision industrial scenarios such as semiconductor manufacturing, the absence of specialized benchmark datasets severely hampers research on modeling and predicting complex processes. To address this challenge, we make a twofold contribution.First, we construct and release the Chip Dicing Lane Dataset (CHDL), the first public temporal image dataset dedicated to the semiconductor wafer dicing process. Captured via an industrial-grade vision system, CHDL provides a much-needed and challenging benchmark for high-fidelity process modeling, defect detection, and digital twin development.Second, we propose DIFFUMA, an innovative dual-path prediction architecture specifically designed for such fine-grained dynamics. The model captures global long-range temporal context through a parallel Mamba module, while simultaneously leveraging a diffusion module, guided by temporal features, to restore and enhance fine-grained spatial details, effectively combating feature degradation. Experiments demonstrate that on our CHDL benchmark, DIFFUMA significantly outperforms existing methods, reducing the Mean Squared Error (MSE) by 39% and improving the Structural Similarity (SSIM) from 0.926 to a near-perfect 0.988. This superior performance also generalizes to natural phenomena datasets. Our work not only delivers a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) model but, more importantly, provides the community with an invaluable data resource to drive future research in industrial AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distributionally Robust Predictive Runtime Verification under Spatio-Temporal Logic Specifications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02964v2)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cyber-physical systems (CPS) designed in simulators, often consisting of multiple interacting agents (e.g. in multi-agent formations), behave differently in the real-world. We want to verify these systems during runtime when they are deployed. We thus propose robust predictive runtime verification (RPRV) algorithms for: (1) general stochastic CPS under signal temporal logic (STL) tasks, and (2) stochastic multi-agent systems (MAS) under spatio-temporal logic tasks. The RPRV problem presents the following challenges: (1) there may not be sufficient data on the behavior of the deployed CPS, (2) predictive models based on design phase system trajectories may encounter distribution shift during real-world deployment, and (3) the algorithms need to scale to the complexity of MAS and be applicable to spatio-temporal logic tasks. To address the challenges, we assume knowledge of an upper bound on the statistical distance between the trajectory distributions of the system at deployment and design time. We are motivated by our prior work [1, 2] where we proposed an accurate and an interpretable RPRV algorithm for general CPS, which we here extend to the MAS setting and spatio-temporal logic tasks. Specifically, we use a learned predictive model to estimate the system behavior at runtime and robust conformal prediction to obtain probabilistic guarantees by accounting for distribution shifts. Building on [1], we perform robust conformal prediction over the robust semantics of spatio-temporal reach and escape logic (STREL) to obtain centralized RPRV algorithms for MAS. We empirically validate our results in a drone swarm simulator, where we show the scalability of our RPRV algorithms to MAS and analyze the impact of different trajectory predictors on the verification result. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first statistically valid algorithms for MAS under distribution shift.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2311.09482</p></details> |

Specifically, it is challenging to address prompts that refer to 1) the entirety of an environment that an agent equipped with an MLLM can operate in; and simultaneously also refer to 2) recent actions that just happened and are encoded in a video clip. However, such a holistic spatio-temporal understanding is important for agents operating in the real world. To address this issue, we first develop a framework to collect a large-scale dataset. Using the collected "Reasoning about Environments and Actions" (REA) dataset, we show that recent methods indeed struggle to correctly answer the prompts. To improve, we develop a "spatio-temporal LLM" (ST-LLM), a model equipped with projectors to improve both spatial understanding of an environment and temporal understanding of recent observations. On the collected REA data, we show that the proposed method significantly improves results compared to prior work.

Existing methods often prioritize the development of intricate neural networks to capture the complex dependencies of the data. These methods neglect node-level heterogeneity and face over-parameterization when attempting to model node-specific characteristics. In this paper, we present a novel low-rank adaptation framework for existing spatio-temporal prediction models, termed \model, which alleviates the aforementioned problems through node-level adjustments. Specifically, we introduce the node-adaptive low-rank layer and node-specific predictor, capturing the complex functional characteristics of nodes while maintaining computational efficiency. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that our method consistently achieves superior performance across various forecasting models with minimal computational overhead, improving performance by 7% with only 1% additional parameter cost.

Current video-based approaches, while proficient in tracking, lack the sophisticated reasoning capabilities of large language models, limiting their contextual understanding and generalization. We introduce VideoMolmo, a large multimodal model tailored for fine-grained spatio-temporal pointing conditioned on textual descriptions. Building upon the Molmo architecture, VideoMolmo incorporates a temporal module utilizing an attention mechanism to condition each frame on preceding frames, ensuring temporal consistency. Additionally, our novel temporal mask fusion pipeline employs SAM2 for bidirectional point propagation, significantly enhancing coherence across video sequences. This two-step decomposition, i.e., first using the LLM to generate precise pointing coordinates, then relying on a sequential mask-fusion module to produce coherent segmentation, not only simplifies the task for the language model but also enhances interpretability. Due to the lack of suitable datasets, we curate a comprehensive dataset comprising 72k video-caption pairs annotated with 100k object points. To evaluate the generalization of VideoMolmo, we introduce VPoS-Bench, a challenging out-of-distribution benchmark spanning five real-world scenarios: Cell Tracking, Egocentric Vision, Autonomous Driving, Video-GUI Interaction, and Robotics. We also evaluate our model on Referring Video Object Segmentation (Refer-VOS) and Reasoning VOS tasks. In comparison to existing models, VideoMolmo substantially improves spatio-temporal pointing accuracy and reasoning capability. Our code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/mbzuai-oryx/VideoMolmo.</p></details> | 20 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Spatio-temporal smoothing, interpolation and prediction of income distributions based on grouped data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08384v3)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Housing and Land Survey (HLS) of Japan provides municipality-level grouped data on household incomes. Although these data can be used for effective local policymaking, their analyses are hindered by several challenges, such as limited information attributed to grouping, the presence of non-sampled areas, and the very low frequency of implementing surveys. To address these challenges, we propose a novel grouped-data-based spatio-temporal finite mixture model for estimating the income distributions of multiple spatial units at multiple time points. A unique feature of the proposed method is that all the areas share common latent distributions and that the mixing proportions, including spatial and temporal effects, capture the potential area-wise heterogeneity. Thus, incorporating these effects can smooth out the quantities of interest over time and space, impute missing values, and predict future values. By treating the HLS data with the proposed method, we obtain complete maps of the income and inequality measures at an arbitrary time, which can facilitate rapid and efficient policymaking with fine granularity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Representation Decoupling and Enhancement for Federated Instrument Segmentation in Surgical Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23759v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Surgical instrument segmentation under Federated Learning (FL) is a promising direction, which enables multiple surgical sites to collaboratively train the model without centralizing datasets. However, there exist very limited FL works in surgical data science, and FL methods for other modalities do not consider inherent characteristics in surgical domain: i) different scenarios show diverse anatomical backgrounds while highly similar instrument representation; ii) there exist surgical simulators which promote large-scale synthetic data generation with minimal efforts. In this paper, we propose a novel Personalized FL scheme, Spatio-Temporal Representation Decoupling and Enhancement (FedST), which wisely leverages surgical domain knowledge during both local-site and global-server training to boost segmentation. Concretely, our model embraces a Representation Separation and Cooperation (RSC) mechanism in local-site training, which decouples the query embedding layer to be trained privately, to encode respective backgrounds. Meanwhile, other parameters are optimized globally to capture the consistent representations of instruments, including the temporal layer to capture similar motion patterns. A textual-guided channel selection is further designed to highlight site-specific features, facilitating model adapta tion to each site. Moreover, in global-server training, we propose Synthesis-based Explicit Representation Quantification (SERQ), which defines an explicit representation target based on synthetic data to synchronize the model convergence during fusion for improving model generalization.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we explore the potential of adapter tuning in image-to-video model adaptation and propose a novel video adapter tuning framework, called Disentangled-and-Deformable Spatio-Temporal Adapter (D$^2$ST-Adapter). It features a lightweight design, low adaptation overhead and powerful spatio-temporal feature adaptation capabilities. D$^2$ST-Adapter is structured with an internal dual-pathway architecture that enables built-in disentangled encoding of spatial and temporal features within the adapter, seamlessly integrating into the single-stream feature learning framework of pre-trained image models. In particular, we develop an efficient yet effective implementation of the D$^2$ST-Adapter, incorporating the specially devised anisotropic Deformable Spatio-Temporal Attention as its pivotal operation. This mechanism can be individually tailored for two pathways with anisotropic sampling densities along the spatial and temporal domains in 3D spatio-temporal space, enabling disentangled encoding of spatial and temporal features while maintaining a lightweight design. Extensive experiments by instantiating our method on both pre-trained ResNet and ViT demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art methods. Our method is particularly well-suited to challenging scenarios where temporal dynamics are critical for action recognition.

We propose the Intervention-Aware Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network (IA-STGNN), a novel framework that closes the causal loop from tactical input to strategic delay output. The model integrates graph attention mechanisms, counterfactual simulation units, and spatial intervention node reconstruction to enable dynamic simulations of strike configurations and synchronization strategies. Training data are generated from a multi-physics simulation platform (GEANT4 + COMSOL) under NIST SP 800-160 standards, ensuring structural traceability and policy-level validation. Experimental results demonstrate that IA-STGNN significantly outperforms baseline models (ST-GNN, GCN-LSTM, XGBoost), achieving a 12.8 percent reduction in MAE and 18.4 percent increase in Top-5 percent accuracy, while improving causal path consistency and intervention stability. IA-STGNN enables interpretable prediction of strategic delay and supports applications such as nuclear deterrence simulation, diplomatic window assessment, and multi-strategy optimization, providing a structured and transparent AI decision-support mechanism for high-level policy modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper proposes the first closed-loop causal modeling framework (IA-STGNN) that links tactical strike variables to strategic delay outcomes via graph neural networks with counterfactual reasoning</p></details> |

This work aims to provide additional insight into the association between dengue and climate in the Philippines. We employ a two-stage modelling framework: the first stage fits climate models, while the second stage fits a health model that uses the climate predictions from the first stage as inputs. We postulate a Bayesian spatio-temporal model and use the integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) approach for inference. To account for the uncertainty in the climate models, we perform posterior sampling and then perform Bayesian model averaging to compute the final posterior estimates of second-stage model parameters. The results indicate that temperature is positively associated with dengue, although extremely hot conditions tend to have a negative effect. Moreover, the relationship between rainfall and dengue varies in space. In areas with uniform amounts of rainfall all year round, rainfall is negatively associated with dengue. In contrast, in regions with pronounced dry and wet season, rainfall shows a positive association with dengue. Finally, there remains unexplained structured variation in space and time after accounting for the impact of climate variables and other covariates.</p></details> |  |
| **[VideoFusion: A Spatio-Temporal Collaborative Network for Multi-modal Video Fusion and Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23359v2)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Compared to images, videos better align with real-world acquisition scenarios and possess valuable temporal cues. However, existing multi-sensor fusion research predominantly integrates complementary context from multiple images rather than videos. This primarily stems from two factors: 1) the scarcity of large-scale multi-sensor video datasets, limiting research in video fusion, and 2) the inherent difficulty of jointly modeling spatial and temporal dependencies in a unified framework. This paper proactively compensates for the dilemmas. First, we construct M3SVD, a benchmark dataset with $220$ temporally synchronized and spatially registered infrared-visible video pairs comprising 153,797 frames, filling the data gap for the video fusion community. Secondly, we propose VideoFusion, a multi-modal video fusion model that fully exploits cross-modal complementarity and temporal dynamics to generate spatio-temporally coherent videos from (potentially degraded) multi-modal inputs. Specifically, 1) a differential reinforcement module is developed for cross-modal information interaction and enhancement, 2) a complete modality-guided fusion strategy is employed to adaptively integrate multi-modal features, and 3) a bi-temporal co-attention mechanism is devised to dynamically aggregate forward-backward temporal contexts to reinforce cross-frame feature representations. Extensive experiments reveal that VideoFusion outperforms existing image-oriented fusion paradigms in sequential scenarios, effectively mitigating temporal inconsistency and interference.</p></details> |  |
| **[CAST: Cross-Attentive Spatio-Temporal feature fusion for Deepfake detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21711v1)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deepfakes have emerged as a significant threat to digital media authenticity, increasing the need for advanced detection techniques that can identify subtle and time-dependent manipulations. CNNs are effective at capturing spatial artifacts, and Transformers excel at modeling temporal inconsistencies. However, many existing CNN-Transformer models process spatial and temporal features independently. In particular, attention-based methods often use separate attention mechanisms for spatial and temporal features and combine them using naive approaches like averaging, addition, or concatenation, which limits the depth of spatio-temporal interaction. To address this challenge, we propose a unified CAST model that leverages cross-attention to effectively fuse spatial and temporal features in a more integrated manner. Our approach allows temporal features to dynamically attend to relevant spatial regions, enhancing the model's ability to detect fine-grained, time-evolving artifacts such as flickering eyes or warped lips. This design enables more precise localization and deeper contextual understanding, leading to improved performance across diverse and challenging scenarios. We evaluate the performance of our model using the FaceForensics++, Celeb-DF, and DeepfakeDetection datasets in both intra- and cross-dataset settings to affirm the superiority of our approach. Our model achieves strong performance with an AUC of 99.49 percent and an accuracy of 97.57 percent in intra-dataset evaluations. In cross-dataset testing, it demonstrates impressive generalization by achieving a 93.31 percent AUC on the unseen DeepfakeDetection dataset. These results highlight the effectiveness of cross-attention-based feature fusion in enhancing the robustness of deepfake video detection.</p></details> | 50 pages, 6 figures |
| **[A Modular Multitask Reasoning Framework Integrating Spatio-temporal Models and LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20073v1)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal data mining plays a pivotal role in informed decision making across diverse domains. However, existing models are often restricted to narrow tasks, lacking the capacity for multi-task inference and complex long-form reasoning that require generation of in-depth, explanatory outputs. These limitations restrict their applicability to real-world, multi-faceted decision scenarios. In this work, we introduce STReason, a novel framework that integrates the reasoning strengths of large language models (LLMs) with the analytical capabilities of spatio-temporal models for multi-task inference and execution. Without requiring task-specific finetuning, STReason leverages in-context learning to decompose complex natural language queries into modular, interpretable programs, which are then systematically executed to generate both solutions and detailed rationales. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we construct a new benchmark dataset and propose a unified evaluation framework with metrics specifically designed for long-form spatio-temporal reasoning. Experimental results show that STReason significantly outperforms advanced LLM baselines across all metrics, particularly excelling in complex, reasoning-intensive spatio-temporal scenarios. Human evaluations further validate STReason's credibility and practical utility, demonstrating its potential to reduce expert workload and broaden the applicability to real-world spatio-temporal tasks. We believe STReason provides a promising direction for developing more capable and generalizable spatio-temporal reasoning systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Spatio-Temporal Point Process for Fine-Grained Modeling of Reading Behavior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19999v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reading is a process that unfolds across space and time, alternating between fixations where a reader focuses on a specific point in space, and saccades where a reader rapidly shifts their focus to a new point. An ansatz of psycholinguistics is that modeling a reader's fixations and saccades yields insight into their online sentence processing. However, standard approaches to such modeling rely on aggregated eye-tracking measurements and models that impose strong assumptions, ignoring much of the spatio-temporal dynamics that occur during reading. In this paper, we propose a more general probabilistic model of reading behavior, based on a marked spatio-temporal point process, that captures not only how long fixations last, but also where they land in space and when they take place in time. The saccades are modeled using a Hawkes process, which captures how each fixation excites the probability of a new fixation occurring near it in time and space. The duration time of fixation events is modeled as a function of fixation-specific predictors convolved across time, thus capturing spillover effects. Empirically, our Hawkes process model exhibits a better fit to human saccades than baselines. With respect to fixation durations, we observe that incorporating contextual surprisal as a predictor results in only a marginal improvement in the model's predictive accuracy. This finding suggests that surprisal theory struggles to explain fine-grained eye movements.</p></details> | ACL 2025 |

In this work, we aim to harness the reasoning and generalization abilities of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) for more effective spatio-temporal forecasting, particularly in data-scarce scenarios. However, recent studies uncover that PLMs, which are primarily trained on textual data, often falter when tasked with modeling the intricate correlations in numerical time series, thereby limiting their effectiveness in comprehending spatio-temporal data. To bridge the gap, we propose RePST, a semantic-oriented PLM reprogramming framework tailored for spatio-temporal forecasting. Specifically, we first propose a semantic-oriented decomposer that adaptively disentangles spatially correlated time series into interpretable sub-components, which facilitates PLM to understand sophisticated spatio-temporal dynamics via a divide-and-conquer strategy. Moreover, we propose a selective discrete reprogramming scheme, which introduces an expanded spatio-temporal vocabulary space to project spatio-temporal series into discrete representations. This scheme minimizes the information loss during reprogramming and enriches the representations derived by PLMs. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that the proposed RePST outperforms twelve state-of-the-art baseline methods, particularly in data-scarce scenarios, highlighting the effectiveness and superior generalization capabilities of PLMs for spatio-temporal forecasting.

Thyroid nodules are frequently detected through ultrasound (US) imaging, and some require further evaluation via fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy. Despite its effectiveness, FNA often leads to unnecessary biopsies of benign nodules, causing patient discomfort and anxiety. To address this, the American College of Radiology Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TI-RADS) has been developed to reduce benign biopsies. However, such systems are limited by interobserver variability. Recent deep learning approaches have sought to improve risk stratification, but they often fail to utilize the rich temporal and spatial context provided by US cine clips, which contain dynamic global information and surrounding structural changes across various views. In this work, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Cross Attention for Cine Thyroid Ultrasound Time Series Classification (STACT-Time) model, a novel representation learning framework that integrates imaging features from US cine clips with features from segmentation masks automatically generated by a pretrained model. By leveraging self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms, our model captures the rich temporal and spatial context of US cine clips while enhancing feature representation through segmentation-guided learning. Our model improves malignancy prediction compared to state-of-the-art models, achieving a cross-validation precision of 0.91 (plus or minus 0.02) and an F1 score of 0.89 (plus or minus 0.02). By reducing unnecessary biopsies of benign nodules while maintaining high sensitivity for malignancy detection, our model has the potential to enhance clinical decision-making and improve patient outcomes.</p></details> |  |

However, existing Geographic Information Systems (GIS)-based systems struggle to integrate and manage of such large-scale and diverse data sources. To address these challenges, this paper proposes G-SEED (GeoSOT-based Scalable Encoding and Extraction for Forest and Grassland Spatio-temporal Data), a unified encoding and management framework based on the hierarchical GeoSOT (Geographical coordinate global Subdivision grid with One dimension integer on 2n tree) grid system. G-SEED integrates spatial, temporal, and type information into a composite code, enabling consistent encoding of both structured and unstructured data, including remote sensing imagery, vector maps, sensor records, documents, and multimedia content. The framework incorporates adaptive grid-level selection, center-cell-based indexing, and full-coverage grid arrays to optimize spatial querying and compression. Through extensive experiments on a real-world dataset from Shennongjia National Park (China), G-SEED demonstrates superior performance in spatial precision control, cross-source consistency, query efficiency, and compression compared to mainstream methods such as Geohash and H3. This study provides a scalable and reusable paradigm for the unified organization of forest and grassland big data, supporting dynamic monitoring and intelligent decision-making in these domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 2 figures.

While prior work has improved the timeliness and accuracy of spatio-temporal forecasting, converting these forecasts into actionable strategies remains a key challenge. A main limitation is the decoupling of the prediction and the downstream decision phases, which can significantly degrade the downstream efficiency. For example, in emergency response, the priority is successful resource allocation and intervention, not just incident prediction. To this end, it is essential to propose an Adaptive Spatio-Temporal Early Decision model (ASTER) that reforms the forecasting paradigm from event anticipation to actionable decision support. This framework ensures that information is directly used for decision-making, thereby maximizing overall effectiveness. Specifically, ASTER introduces a new Resource-aware Spatio-Temporal interaction module (RaST) that adaptively captures long- and short-term dependencies under dynamic resource conditions, producing context-aware spatiotemporal representations. To directly generate actionable decisions, we further design a Preference-oriented decision agent (Poda) based on multi-objective reinforcement learning, which transforms predictive signals into resource-efficient intervention strategies by deriving optimal actions under specific preferences and dynamic constraints. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of ASTER in improving both early prediction accuracy and resource allocation outcomes across six downstream metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>ASTER...</summary><p>ASTER: Adaptive Spatio-Temporal Early Decision Model for Dynamic Resource Allocation</p></details> |

This issue is particularly challenging in spatio-temporal analyses, where it has been less explored so far. To study the effects of air pollution on mortality in Italy, we argue that a model that simultaneously accounts for spatio-temporal confounding and for the non-linear form of the effect of interest is needed. To this end, we propose a Bayesian spatial dynamic generalized linear model, which allows for a non-linear association and for a decomposition of the exposure effect into two components. This decomposition accommodates associations with the outcome at fine and coarse temporal and spatial scales of variation. These features, when combined, allow reducing the spatio-temporal confounding bias and recovering the true shape of the association, as demonstrated through simulation studies. The results from the real-data application indicate that the exposure effect seems to have different magnitudes in different seasons, with peaks in the summer. We hypothesize that this could be due to possible interactions between the exposure variable with air temperature and unmeasured confounders.</p></details> | 46 pages, 11 figures |

Genesis employs a two-stage architecture that integrates a DiT-based video diffusion model with 3D-VAE encoding, and a BEV-aware LiDAR generator with NeRF-based rendering and adaptive sampling. Both modalities are directly coupled through a shared latent space, enabling coherent evolution across visual and geometric domains. To guide the generation with structured semantics, we introduce DataCrafter, a captioning module built on vision-language models that provides scene-level and instance-level supervision. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that Genesis achieves state-of-the-art performance across video and LiDAR metrics (FVD 16.95, FID 4.24, Chamfer 0.611), and benefits downstream tasks including segmentation and 3D detection, validating the semantic fidelity and practical utility of the generated data.</p></details> |  |

However, modeling real-world environments presents unique challenges as they dynamically change across both space and, crucially, time. To capture these composed dynamics, we introduce a Spatio-Temporal Road Image Dataset for Exploration (STRIDE) permuting 360-degree panoramic imagery into rich interconnected observation, state and action nodes. Leveraging this structure, we can simultaneously model the relationship between egocentric views, positional coordinates, and movement commands across both space and time. We benchmark this dataset via TARDIS, a transformer-based generative world model that integrates spatial and temporal dynamics through a unified autoregressive framework trained on STRIDE. We demonstrate robust performance across a range of agentic tasks such as controllable photorealistic image synthesis, instruction following, autonomous self-control, and state-of-the-art georeferencing. These results suggest a promising direction towards sophisticated generalist agents--capable of understanding and manipulating the spatial and temporal aspects of their material environments--with enhanced embodied reasoning capabilities.

The proposed system requires neither access to multi-channel training data nor prior knowledge about the number or placement of microphones. It works for both a compact microphone array and distributed microphones, with minor adjustments. Due to its superior handling of overlapping speech during segmentation, the proposed pipeline significantly outperforms the single-channel pyannote approach, both in a scenario with a compact microphone array and in a setup with distributed microphones. Additionally, we show that, unlike fully spatial diarization pipelines, the proposed system can correctly track speakers when they change positions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Interspeech 2025</p></details> |

In order to summarise information encompassed in such data, we combine two well known statistical modelling methods. To account for the spatial dimension, we use the intrinsic modification of the conditional autoregression, and incorporate it with the hidden Markov model, allowing the spatial patterns to vary over time. We apply our method into parish register data considering deaths caused by measles in Finland in 1750-1850, and gain novel insight of previously undiscovered infection dynamics. Five distinctive, reoccurring states describing spatially and temporally differing infection burden and potential routes of spread are identified. We also find that there is a change in the occurrences of the most typical spatial patterns circa 1812, possibly due to changes in communication routes after major administrative transformations in Finland.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we leverage a large-scale spatio-temporal dataset collected from Peru's national Digital Contact Tracing (DCT) application during the COVID-19 pandemic to forecast mobility flows across urban regions. A key challenge lies in the spatial sparsity of hourly mobility counts across hexagonal grid cells, which limits the predictive power of conventional time series models. To address this, we propose a lightweight and model-agnostic Spatial Neighbourhood Fusion (SPN) technique that augments each cell's features with aggregated signals from its immediate H3 neighbors. We evaluate this strategy on three forecasting backbones: NLinear, PatchTST, and K-U-Net, under various historical input lengths. Experimental results show that SPN consistently improves forecasting performance, achieving up to 9.85 percent reduction in test MSE. Our findings demonstrate that spatial smoothing of sparse mobility signals provides a simple yet effective path toward robust spatio-temporal forecasting during public health crises.</p></details> |  |
| **[Navigating Challenges in Spatio-temporal Modelling of Antarctic Krill Abundance: Addressing Zero-inflated Data and Misaligned Covariates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01399v2)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) are among the most abundant species on our planet and serve as a vital food source for many marine predators in the Southern Ocean. In this paper, we utilise statistical spatio-temporal methods to combine data from various sources and resolutions, aiming to model krill abundance. Our focus lies in fitting the model to a dataset comprising acoustic measurements of krill biomass. To achieve this, we integrate climate covariates obtained from satellite imagery and from drifting surface buoys (also known as drifters). Additionally, we use sparsely collected krill biomass data obtained from net fishing efforts (KRILLBASE) for validation. However, integrating these multiple heterogeneous data sources presents significant modelling challenges, including spatio-temporal misalignment and inflated zeros in the observed data. To address these challenges, we fit a Hurdle-Gamma model to jointly describe the occurrence of zeros and the krill biomass for the non-zero observations, while also accounting for misaligned and heterogeneous data sources, including drifters. Therefore, our work presents a comprehensive framework for analysing and predicting krill abundance in the Southern Ocean, leveraging information from various sources and formats. This is crucial due to the impact of krill fishing, as understanding their distribution is essential for informed management decisions and fishing regulations aimed at protecting the species.</p></details> |  |

While recent data-driven methods like deep reinforcement learning improve microscopic realism, they often overlook critical macroscopic features such as crowd density and flow, which are governed by spatio-temporal spawn dynamics, namely, when and where agents enter a scene. Traditional methods, like random spawn rates, stochastic processes, or fixed schedules, are not guaranteed to capture the underlying complexity or lack diversity and realism. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach called nTPP-GMM that models spatio-temporal spawn dynamics using Neural Temporal Point Processes (nTPPs) that are coupled with a spawn-conditional Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for agent spawn and goal positions. We evaluate our approach by orchestrating crowd simulations of three diverse real-world datasets with nTPP-GMM. Our experiments demonstrate the orchestration with nTPP-GMM leads to realistic simulations that reflect real-world crowd scenarios and allow crowd analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Using Deep Operators to Create Spatio-temporal Surrogates for Dynamical Systems under Uncertainty](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11761v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal data, which consists of responses or measurements gathered at different times and positions, is ubiquitous across diverse applications of civil infrastructure. While SciML methods have made significant progress in tackling the issue of response prediction for individual time histories, creating a full spatial-temporal surrogate remains a challenge. This study proposes a novel variant of deep operator networks (DeepONets), namely the full-field Extended DeepONet (FExD), to serve as a spatial-temporal surrogate that provides multi-output response predictions for dynamical systems. The proposed FExD surrogate model effectively learns the full solution operator across multiple degrees of freedom by enhancing the expressiveness of the branch network and expanding the predictive capabilities of the trunk network. The proposed FExD surrogate is deployed to simultaneously capture the dynamics at several sensing locations along a testbed model of a cable-stayed bridge subjected to stochastic ground motions. The ensuing response predictions from the FExD are comprehensively compared against both a vanilla DeepONet and a modified spatio-temporal Extended DeepONet. The results demonstrate the proposed FExD can achieve both superior accuracy and computational efficiency, representing a significant advancement in operator learning for structural dynamics applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[FAME: A Lightweight Spatio-Temporal Network for Model Attribution of Face-Swap Deepfakes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11477v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread emergence of face-swap Deepfake videos poses growing risks to digital security, privacy, and media integrity, necessitating effective forensic tools for identifying the source of such manipulations. Although most prior research has focused primarily on binary Deepfake detection, the task of model attribution -- determining which generative model produced a given Deepfake -- remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce FAME (Fake Attribution via Multilevel Embeddings), a lightweight and efficient spatio-temporal framework designed to capture subtle generative artifacts specific to different face-swap models. FAME integrates spatial and temporal attention mechanisms to improve attribution accuracy while remaining computationally efficient. We evaluate our model on three challenging and diverse datasets: Deepfake Detection and Manipulation (DFDM), FaceForensics++, and FakeAVCeleb. Results show that FAME consistently outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and runtime, highlighting its potential for deployment in real-world forensic and information security applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Attention-based Spatio-Temporal Neural Operator for Evolving Physics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11328v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In scientific machine learning (SciML), a key challenge is learning unknown, evolving physical processes and making predictions across spatio-temporal scales. For example, in real-world manufacturing problems like additive manufacturing, users adjust known machine settings while unknown environmental parameters simultaneously fluctuate. To make reliable predictions, it is desired for a model to not only capture long-range spatio-temporal interactions from data but also adapt to new and unknown environments; traditional machine learning models excel at the first task but often lack physical interpretability and struggle to generalize under varying environmental conditions. To tackle these challenges, we propose the Attention-based Spatio-Temporal Neural Operator (ASNO), a novel architecture that combines separable attention mechanisms for spatial and temporal interactions and adapts to unseen physical parameters. Inspired by the backward differentiation formula (BDF), ASNO learns a transformer for temporal prediction and extrapolation and an attention-based neural operator for handling varying external loads, enhancing interpretability by isolating historical state contributions and external forces, enabling the discovery of underlying physical laws and generalizability to unseen physical environments. Empirical results on SciML benchmarks demonstrate that ASNO outperforms over existing models, establishing its potential for engineering applications, physics discovery, and interpretable machine learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[CINeMA: Conditional Implicit Neural Multi-Modal Atlas for a Spatio-Temporal Representation of the Perinatal Brain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09668v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Magnetic resonance imaging of fetal and neonatal brains reveals rapid neurodevelopment marked by substantial anatomical changes unfolding within days. Studying this critical stage of the developing human brain, therefore, requires accurate brain models-referred to as atlases-of high spatial and temporal resolution. To meet these demands, established traditional atlases and recently proposed deep learning-based methods rely on large and comprehensive datasets. This poses a major challenge for studying brains in the presence of pathologies for which data remains scarce. We address this limitation with CINeMA (Conditional Implicit Neural Multi-Modal Atlas), a novel framework for creating high-resolution, spatio-temporal, multimodal brain atlases, suitable for low-data settings. Unlike established methods, CINeMA operates in latent space, avoiding compute-intensive image registration and reducing atlas construction times from days to minutes. Furthermore, it enables flexible conditioning on anatomical features including GA, birth age, and pathologies like ventriculomegaly (VM) and agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC). CINeMA supports downstream tasks such as tissue segmentation and age prediction whereas its generative properties enable synthetic data creation and anatomically informed data augmentation. Surpassing state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, efficiency, and versatility, CINeMA represents a powerful tool for advancing brain research. We release the code and atlases at https://github.com/m-dannecker/CINeMA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work currently under revision for IEEE TMI</p></details> |

However, existing time-to-space sequential methods often fail to effectively extract features in block-wise missing data scenarios. Meanwhile, the static graph structure for spatial feature propagation significantly constrains the models flexibility in handling the distribution shift issue for the nonstationary traffic data. To address these issues, this paper proposes a SpatioTemporal Attention Mixture of experts network named STAMImputer for traffic data imputation. Specifically, we introduce a Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework to capture latent spatio-temporal features and their influence weights, effectively imputing block missing. A novel Low-rank guided Sampling Graph ATtention (LrSGAT) mechanism is designed to dynamically balance the local and global correlations across road networks. The sampled attention vectors are utilized to generate dynamic graphs that capture real-time spatial correlations. Extensive experiments are conducted on four traffic datasets for evaluation. The result shows STAMImputer achieves significantly performance improvement compared with existing SOTA approaches.

Current memory systems often grapple with fundamental limitations in structural flexibility, temporal awareness, and the ability to synthesize higher-level insights from raw interaction data. This paper introduces Cognitive Weave, a novel memory framework centered around a multi-layered spatio-temporal resonance graph (STRG). This graph manages information as semantically rich insight particles (IPs), which are dynamically enriched with resonance keys, signifiers, and situational imprints via a dedicated semantic oracle interface (SOI). These IPs are interconnected through typed relational strands, forming an evolving knowledge tapestry. A key component of Cognitive Weave is the cognitive refinement process, an autonomous mechanism that includes the synthesis of insight aggregates (IAs) condensed, higher-level knowledge structures derived from identified clusters of related IPs. We present comprehensive experimental results demonstrating Cognitive Weave's marked enhancement over existing approaches in long-horizon planning tasks, evolving question-answering scenarios, and multi-session dialogue coherence. The system achieves a notable 34% average improvement in task completion rates and a 42% reduction in mean query latency when compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, this paper explores the ethical considerations inherent in such advanced memory systems, discusses the implications for long-term memory in LLMs, and outlines promising future research trajectories.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal State Space Model For Efficient Event-Based Optical Flow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07878v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event cameras unlock new frontiers that were previously unthinkable with standard frame-based cameras. One notable example is low-latency motion estimation (optical flow), which is critical for many real-time applications. In such applications, the computational efficiency of algorithms is paramount. Although recent deep learning paradigms such as CNN, RNN, or ViT have shown remarkable performance, they often lack the desired computational efficiency. Conversely, asynchronous event-based methods including SNNs and GNNs are computationally efficient; however, these approaches fail to capture sufficient spatio-temporal information, a powerful feature required to achieve better performance for optical flow estimation. In this work, we introduce Spatio-Temporal State Space Model (STSSM) module along with a novel network architecture to develop an extremely efficient solution with competitive performance. Our STSSM module leverages state-space models to effectively capture spatio-temporal correlations in event data, offering higher performance with lower complexity compared to ViT, CNN-based architectures in similar settings. Our model achieves 4.5x faster inference and 8x lower computations compared to TMA and 2x lower computations compared to EV-FlowNet with competitive performance on the DSEC benchmark. Our code will be available at https://github.com/AhmedHumais/E-STMFlow</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce ST-GraphNet, a spatio-temporal graph neural network framework designed to model and predict AV crash severity by using both fine-grained and region-aggregated spatial graphs. Using a balanced dataset of 2,352 real-world AV-related crash reports from Texas (2024), including geospatial coordinates, crash timestamps, SAE automation levels, and narrative descriptions, we construct two complementary graph representations: (1) a fine-grained graph with individual crash events as nodes, where edges are defined via spatio-temporal proximity; and (2) a coarse-grained graph where crashes are aggregated into Hexagonal Hierarchical Spatial Indexing (H3)-based spatial cells, connected through hexagonal adjacency. Each node in the graph is enriched with multimodal data, including semantic, spatial, and temporal attributes, including textual embeddings from crash narratives using a pretrained Sentence-BERT model. We evaluate various graph neural network (GNN) architectures, such as Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), Graph Attention Networks (GAT), and Dynamic Spatio-Temporal GCN (DSTGCN), to classify crash severity and predict high-risk regions. Our proposed ST-GraphNet, which utilizes a DSTGCN backbone on the coarse-grained H3 graph, achieves a test accuracy of 97.74\%, substantially outperforming the best fine-grained model (64.7\% test accuracy). These findings highlight the effectiveness of spatial aggregation, dynamic message passing, and multi-modal feature integration in capturing the complex spatio-temporal patterns underlying AV crash severity.</p></details> |  |
| **[STSBench: A Spatio-temporal Scenario Benchmark for Multi-modal Large Language Models in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06218v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce STSBench, a scenario-based framework to benchmark the holistic understanding of vision-language models (VLMs) for autonomous driving. The framework automatically mines pre-defined traffic scenarios from any dataset using ground-truth annotations, provides an intuitive user interface for efficient human verification, and generates multiple-choice questions for model evaluation. Applied to the NuScenes dataset, we present STSnu, the first benchmark that evaluates the spatio-temporal reasoning capabilities of VLMs based on comprehensive 3D perception. Existing benchmarks typically target off-the-shelf or fine-tuned VLMs for images or videos from a single viewpoint and focus on semantic tasks such as object recognition, dense captioning, risk assessment, or scene understanding. In contrast, STSnu evaluates driving expert VLMs for end-to-end driving, operating on videos from multi-view cameras or LiDAR. It specifically assesses their ability to reason about both ego-vehicle actions and complex interactions among traffic participants, a crucial capability for autonomous vehicles. The benchmark features 43 diverse scenarios spanning multiple views and frames, resulting in 971 human-verified multiple-choice questions. A thorough evaluation uncovers critical shortcomings in existing models' ability to reason about fundamental traffic dynamics in complex environments. These findings highlight the urgent need for architectural advances that explicitly model spatio-temporal reasoning. By addressing a core gap in spatio-temporal evaluation, STSBench enables the development of more robust and explainable VLMs for autonomous driving.</p></details> | <details><summary>Datas...</summary><p>Dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/ivc-lrp/STSBench, Code: https://github.com/LRP-IVC/STSBench</p></details> |

However, the spatial correlation inherent to environmental monitoring has been mostly neglected in the recent literature, due to the significant modeling complexity it introduces. In this work, we address this gap by presenting a model of spatio-temporal information freshness, considering the conditional entropy of the system state in a remote monitoring scenario, such as a low-orbit satellite collecting information from a wide geographical area. Our analytical results show that purely age-oriented schemes tend to select an overly broad communication range, leading to inaccurate estimates and energy inefficiency, both of which can be mitigated by adopting a spatio-temporal approach.</p></details> |  |

Although spatio-temporal graph neural networks have achieved success in modeling various static spatio-temporal forecasting scenarios, real-world spatio-temporal data are typically received in a streaming manner, and the network continuously expands with the installation of new sensors. Thus, spatio-temporal forecasting in streaming scenarios faces dual challenges: the inefficiency of retraining models over newly arrived data and the detrimental effects of catastrophic forgetting over long-term history. To address these challenges, we propose a novel prompt tuning-based continuous forecasting method, following two fundamental tuning principles guided by empirical and theoretical analysis: expand and compress, which effectively resolve the aforementioned problems with lightweight tuning parameters. Specifically, we integrate the base spatio-temporal graph neural network with a continuous prompt pool, utilizing stored prompts (i.e., few learnable parameters) in memory, and jointly optimize them with the base spatio-temporal graph neural network. This method ensures that the model sequentially learns from the spatio-temporal data stream to accomplish tasks for corresponding periods. Extensive experimental results on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the multi-faceted superiority of our method over the state-of-the-art baselines, including effectiveness, efficiency, universality, etc.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> |

However, existing methods typically rely on transformer-based architectures, which often face challenges related to scalability and efficiency. To address these issues, we propose a novel, efficient human-human interaction generation method based on the Mamba framework, designed to meet the demands of effectively capturing long-sequence dependencies while providing real-time feedback. Specifically, we introduce an adaptive spatio-temporal Mamba framework that utilizes two parallel SSM branches with an adaptive mechanism to integrate the spatial and temporal features of motion sequences. To further enhance the model's ability to capture dependencies within individual motion sequences and the interactions between different individual sequences, we develop two key modules: the self-adaptive spatio-temporal Mamba module and the cross-adaptive spatio-temporal Mamba module, enabling efficient feature learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results on two interaction datasets with remarkable quality and efficiency. Compared to the baseline method InterGen, our approach not only improves accuracy but also requires a minimal parameter size of just 66M ,only 36% of InterGen's, while achieving an average inference speed of 0.57 seconds, which is 46% of InterGen's execution time.</p></details> |  |

Many end-to-end approaches rely on human annotations to learn intermediate perception and prediction tasks, while purely self-supervised approaches--which directly learn from sensor inputs to generate planning trajectories without human annotations often underperform the state of the art. We observe a key gap in the input representation space: end-to-end approaches built on MLLMs are often pretrained with reasoning tasks in 2D image space rather than the native 3D space in which autonomous vehicles plan. To this end, we propose S4-Driver, a scalable self-supervised motion planning algorithm with spatio-temporal visual representation, based on the popular PaLI multimodal large language model. S4-Driver uses a novel sparse volume strategy to seamlessly transform the strong visual representation of MLLMs from perspective view to 3D space without the need to finetune the vision encoder. This representation aggregates multi-view and multi-frame visual inputs and enables better prediction of planning trajectories in 3D space. To validate our method, we run experiments on both nuScenes and Waymo Open Motion Dataset (with in-house camera data). Results show that S4-Driver performs favorably against existing supervised multi-task approaches while requiring no human annotations. It also demonstrates great scalability when pretrained on large volumes of unannotated driving logs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR2025; Project website: s4-driver.github.io</p></details> |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Fuzzy-oriented Multi-Modal Meta-Learning for Fine-grained Emotion Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13541v4)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-grained emotion recognition (FER) plays a vital role in various fields, such as disease diagnosis, personalized recommendations, and multimedia mining. However, existing FER methods face three key challenges in real-world applications: (i) they rely on large amounts of continuously annotated data to ensure accuracy since emotions are complex and ambiguous in reality, which is costly and time-consuming; (ii) they cannot capture the temporal heterogeneity caused by changing emotion patterns, because they usually assume that the temporal correlation within sampling periods is the same; (iii) they do not consider the spatial heterogeneity of different FER scenarios, that is, the distribution of emotion information in different data may have bias or interference. To address these challenges, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Fuzzy-oriented Multi-modal Meta-learning framework (ST-F2M). Specifically, ST-F2M first divides the multi-modal videos into multiple views, and each view corresponds to one modality of one emotion. Multiple randomly selected views for the same emotion form a meta-training task. Next, ST-F2M uses an integrated module with spatial and temporal convolutions to encode the data of each task, reflecting the spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Then it adds fuzzy semantic information to each task based on generalized fuzzy rules, which helps handle the complexity and ambiguity of emotions. Finally, ST-F2M learns emotion-related general meta-knowledge through meta-recurrent neural networks to achieve fast and robust fine-grained emotion recognition. Extensive experiments show that ST-F2M outperforms various state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and model efficiency. In addition, we construct ablation studies and further analysis to explore why ST-F2M performs well.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

They provide policymakers with the granular information needed to identify, target, and implement effective interventions and allocate resources appropriately. Traditional disease mapping methods typically rely on Poisson regression, modeling observed counts while adjusting for local covariates that are treated as fixed and known. However, these methods may fail to capture the complexities and uncertainties in areas with sparse or absent data. To address this challenge, we developed a Bayesian hierarchical spatio-temporal top-down approach designed to estimate county-level OUD rates when direct small-area (county) data is unavailable. This method allows us to infer small-area OUD rates and quantify associated uncertainties, even in data-sparse environments using observed state-level OUD rates and a combination of state and county level informative covariates. We applied our approach to estimate OUD rates for 3,143 counties in the United States between 2010 and 2025. Model performance was assessed through simulation studies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unraveling Spatio-Temporal Foundation Models via the Pipeline Lens: A Comprehensive Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01364v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal deep learning models aims to utilize useful patterns in such data to support tasks like prediction. However, previous deep learning models designed for specific tasks typically require separate training for each use case, leading to increased computational and storage costs. To address this issue, spatio-temporal foundation models have emerged, offering a unified framework capable of solving multiple spatio-temporal tasks. These foundation models achieve remarkable success by learning general knowledge with spatio-temporal data or transferring the general capabilities of pre-trained language models. While previous surveys have explored spatio-temporal data and methodologies separately, they have ignored a comprehensive examination of how foundation models are designed, selected, pre-trained, and adapted. As a result, the overall pipeline for spatio-temporal foundation models remains unclear. To bridge this gap, we innovatively provide an up-to-date review of previous spatio-temporal foundation models from the pipeline perspective. The pipeline begins with an introduction to different types of spatio-temporal data, followed by details of data preprocessing and embedding techniques. The pipeline then presents a novel data property taxonomy to divide existing methods according to data sources and dependencies, providing efficient and effective model design and selection for researchers. On this basis, we further illustrate the training objectives of primitive models, as well as the adaptation techniques of transferred models. Overall, our survey provides a clear and structured pipeline to understand the connection between core elements of spatio-temporal foundation models while guiding researchers to get started quickly. Additionally, we introduce emerging opportunities such as multi-objective training in the field of spatio-temporal foundation models.</p></details> | 21 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Decoupled Learning for Spiking Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01117v1)** | 2025-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have gained significant attention for their potential to enable energy-efficient artificial intelligence. However, effective and efficient training of SNNs remains an unresolved challenge. While backpropagation through time (BPTT) achieves high accuracy, it incurs substantial memory overhead. In contrast, biologically plausible local learning methods are more memory-efficient but struggle to match the accuracy of BPTT. To bridge this gap, we propose spatio-temporal decouple learning (STDL), a novel training framework that decouples the spatial and temporal dependencies to achieve both high accuracy and training efficiency for SNNs. Specifically, to achieve spatial decoupling, STDL partitions the network into smaller subnetworks, each of which is trained independently using an auxiliary network. To address the decreased synergy among subnetworks resulting from spatial decoupling, STDL constructs each subnetwork's auxiliary network by selecting the largest subset of layers from its subsequent network layers under a memory constraint. Furthermore, STDL decouples dependencies across time steps to enable efficient online learning. Extensive evaluations on seven static and event-based vision datasets demonstrate that STDL consistently outperforms local learning methods and achieves comparable accuracy to the BPTT method with considerably reduced GPU memory cost. Notably, STDL achieves 4x reduced GPU memory than BPTT on the ImageNet dataset. Therefore, this work opens up a promising avenue for memory-efficient SNN training.

In this paper, we propose a noise-robust real-world VSR framework by incorporating self-supervised learning and Mamba into pre-trained latent diffusion models. To ensure content consistency across adjacent frames, we enhance the diffusion model with a global spatio-temporal attention mechanism using the Video State-Space block with a 3D Selective Scan module, which reinforces coherence at an affordable computational cost. To further reduce artifacts in generated details, we introduce a self-supervised ControlNet that leverages HR features as guidance and employs contrastive learning to extract degradation-insensitive features from LR videos. Finally, a three-stage training strategy based on a mixture of HR-LR videos is proposed to stabilize VSR training. The proposed Self-supervised ControlNet with Spatio-Temporal Continuous Mamba based VSR algorithm achieves superior perceptual quality than state-of-the-arts on real-world VSR benchmark datasets, validating the effectiveness of the proposed model design and training strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 10 figures, accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Fixed Variables: Expanding-variate Time Series Forecasting via Flat Scheme and Spatio-temporal Focal Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15296v2)** | 2025-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate Time Series Forecasting (MTSF) has long been a key research focus. Traditionally, these studies assume a fixed number of variables, but in real-world applications, Cyber-Physical Systems often expand as new sensors are deployed, increasing variables in MTSF. In light of this, we introduce a novel task, Expanding-variate Time Series Forecasting (EVTSF). This task presents unique challenges, specifically (1) handling inconsistent data shapes caused by adding new variables, and (2) addressing imbalanced spatio-temporal learning, where expanding variables have limited observed data due to the necessity for timely operation. To address these challenges, we propose STEV, a flexible spatio-temporal forecasting framework. STEV includes a new Flat Scheme to tackle the inconsistent data shape issue, which extends the graph-based spatio-temporal modeling architecture into 1D space by flattening the 2D samples along the variable dimension, making the model variable-scale-agnostic while still preserving dynamic spatial correlations through a holistic graph. We introduce a novel Spatio-temporal Focal Learning strategy that incorporates a negative filter to resolve potential conflicts between contrastive learning and graph representation, and a focal contrastive loss as its core to guide the framework to focus on optimizing the expanding variables. We benchmark EVTSF performance using three real-world datasets and compare it against three potential solutions employing SOTA MTSF models tailored for EVSTF. Experimental results show that STEV significantly outperforms its competitors, particularly on expanding variables. Notably, STEV, with only 5% of observations from the expanding period, is on par with SOTA MTSF models trained with complete observations. Further exploration of various expanding strategies underscores the generalizability of STEV in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

However, the interpretable spatio-temporal features extraction by soft sensors remains a challenge. In this light, this work introduces a novel method termed spatio-temporal consistent and interpretable model (STCIM). First, temporal and spatial features are captured and aligned by a far topological spatio-temporal consistency extraction block. Then, the features are mapped into an interpretable latent space for further prediction by explicitly giving physical meanings to latent variables. The efficacy of the proposed STCIM is demonstrated through the modeling of two generated datasets and a real-life dataset of coal-fired power plants. The corresponding experiments show: 1) The generalization of STCIM outperforms other methods, especially in different operation situations. 2) The far topological spatio-temporal consistency is vital for feature alignment. 3) The hyper-parameters of physics-informed interpretable latent space loss decide the performance of STCIM.</p></details> |  |

However, accurately forecasting STTS is challenging due to complex dynamic correlations in both time and space dimensions. Existing graph neural networks struggle to balance effectiveness and efficiency in modeling dynamic spatio-temporal relations. To address this problem, we propose the Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Stiefel Graph Neural Network (DST-SGNN) to efficiently process STTS. For DST-SGNN, we first introduce the novel Stiefel Graph Spectral Convolution (SGSC) and Stiefel Graph Fourier Transform (SGFT). The SGFT matrix in SGSC is constrained to lie on the Stiefel manifold, and SGSC can be regarded as a filtered graph spectral convolution. We also propose the Linear Dynamic Graph Optimization on Stiefel Manifold (LDGOSM), which can efficiently learn the SGFT matrix from the dynamic graph and significantly reduce the computational complexity. Finally, we propose a multi-layer SGSC (MSGSC) that efficiently captures complex spatio-temporal correlations. Extensive experiments on seven spatio-temporal datasets show that DST-SGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods while maintaining relatively low computational costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IJCAI 2025</p></details> |

While Graph Attention Networks (GATs) are popular for modeling spatial dependencies, they rely on predefined adjacency structures and dynamic attention scores, introducing inductive biases and computational overhead that can obscure interpretability. We propose InterGAT, a simplified alternative to GAT that replaces masked attention with a fully learnable, symmetric node interaction matrix, capturing latent spatial relationships without relying on fixed graph topologies. Our framework, InterGAT-GRU, which incorporates a GRU-based temporal decoder, outperforms the baseline GAT-GRU in forecasting accuracy, achieving at least a 21% improvement on the SZ-Taxi dataset and a 6% improvement on the Los-Loop dataset across all forecasting horizons (15 to 60 minutes). Additionally, we observed reduction in training time by 60-70% compared to GAT-GRU baseline. Crucially, the learned interaction matrix reveals interpretable structure: it recovers sparse, topology-aware attention patterns that align with community structure. Spectral and clustering analyses show that the model captures both localized and global dynamics, offering insights into the functional topology driving predictions. This highlights how structure learning can simultaneously support prediction, computational efficiency, and topological interpretabil-ity in dynamic graph-based domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 10 figures, workshop</p></details> |

However, real-world scenarios frequently present challenges such as signal anomalies, noise, and distributional shifts. Existing solutions primarily enhance robustness by modifying network architectures or training procedures. Nevertheless, these approaches are computationally intensive and resource-demanding, especially for large-scale applications. In this paper, we explore a novel test-time computing paradigm, namely learning with calibration, ST-TTC, for spatio-temporal forecasting. Through learning with calibration, we aim to capture periodic structural biases arising from non-stationarity during the testing phase and perform real-time bias correction on predictions to improve accuracy. Specifically, we first introduce a spectral-domain calibrator with phase-amplitude modulation to mitigate periodic shift and then propose a flash updating mechanism with a streaming memory queue for efficient test-time computation. ST-TTC effectively bypasses complex training-stage techniques, offering an efficient and generalizable paradigm. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness, universality, flexibility and efficiency of our proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 9 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

It provides a systematic approach to quantifying resource consumption, emissions, and waste, enabling industries, researchers, and policymakers to identify hotspots for sustainability improvements. By providing a comprehensive assessment of systems, from raw material extraction to end-of-life disposal, LCA facilitates the development of environmentally sound strategies, thereby contributing significantly to sustainable engineering and informed decision-making. Despite its strengths and ubiquitous use, life cycle analysis has not been reconciled with the broader literature in model-based systems engineering and analysis, thus hindering its integration into the design of complex systems more generally. This lack of reconciliation poses a significant problem, as it hinders the seamless integration of environmental sustainability into the design and optimization of complex systems. Without alignment between life cycle analysis (LCA) and model-based systems engineering (MBSE), sustainability remains an isolated consideration rather than an inherent part of the system's architecture and design. The original contribution of this paper is twofold. First, the paper reconciles process-based life cycle analysis with the broader literature and vocabulary of model-based systems engineering and hetero-functional graph theory. It ultimately proves that model-based systems engineering and hetero-functional graph theory are a formal generalization of process-based life cycle analysis. Secondly, the paper demonstrates how model-based systems engineering and hetero-functional graph theory may be used to enhance the spatio-temporal resolution of process-based life cycle analysis in a manner that aligns with system design objectives.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |

This paper presents a comprehensive approach to expert elicitation, with a particular emphasis on spatial and spatio-temporal contexts.

Hence, analyzing and clustering spatio-temporal air quality data is crucial for understanding pollution dynamics and guiding policy interventions. This work provides a review of Bayesian nonparametric clustering methods, with a particular focus on their application to spatio-temporal data, which are ubiquitous in environmental sciences. We first introduce key modeling approaches for point-referenced spatio-temporal data, highlighting their flexibility in capturing complex spatial and temporal dependencies. We then review recent advancements in Bayesian clustering, focusing on spatial product partition models, which incorporate spatial structure into the clustering process. We illustrate the proposed methods on PM10 monitoring data from Northern Italy, demonstrating their ability to identify meaningful pollution patterns. This review highlights the potential of Bayesian nonparametric methods for environmental risk assessment and offers insights into future research directions in spatio-temporal clustering for public health and environmental science.</p></details> |  |
| **[Model-Guided Network with Cluster-Based Operators for Spatio-Spectral Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24605v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the problem of reconstructing a high-resolution hyperspectral image from a low-resolution multispectral observation. While spatial super-resolution and spectral super-resolution have been extensively studied, joint spatio-spectral super-resolution remains relatively explored. We propose an end-to-end model-driven framework that explicitly decomposes the joint spatio-spectral super-resolution problem into spatial super-resolution, spectral super-resolution and fusion tasks. Each sub-task is addressed by unfolding a variational-based approach, where the operators involved in the proximal gradient iterative scheme are replaced with tailored learnable modules. In particular, we design an upsampling operator for spatial super-resolution based on classical back-projection algorithms, adapted to handle arbitrary scaling factors. Spectral reconstruction is performed using learnable cluster-based upsampling and downsampling operators. For image fusion, we integrate low-frequency estimation and high-frequency injection modules to combine the spatial and spectral information from spatial super-resolution and spectral super-resolution outputs. Additionally, we introduce an efficient nonlocal post-processing step that leverages image self-similarity by combining a multi-head attention mechanism with residual connections. Extensive evaluations on several datasets and sampling factors demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Such data show dependence across several dimensions of space as well as in time, and can easily involve hundreds of thousands of observations. Many spatio-temporal models result in a dependence structure across all observations and can be fit only at a substantial computational cost, arising from dense matrix inversion, high dimensional parameter spaces, poor mixing in Markov Chain Monte Carlo, or the impossibility of utilizing parallel computing due to a lack of independence anywhere in the model fitting process. These computational challenges are exacerbated when the response variable is ordinal, and especially as the number of ordered categories grows. Some spatio-temporal models achieve computational feasibility for large datasets but only through overly restrictive model simplifications, which we seek to avoid here. In this paper we demonstrate a two-stage algorithm to fit a Bayesian spatio-temporal model to large datasets when the response variable is ordinal. The first stage models locations independently in space, capturing temporal dependence, and can be run in parallel. The second stage resamples from the first stage posterior distributions with an acceptance probability computed to impose spatial dependence from the full spatio-temporal model. The result is fast Bayesian inference which samples from the full spatio-temporal posterior and is computationally feasible even for large datasets. We quantify the substantial computational gains our approach achieves, and demonstrate the preservation of the posterior distribution as compared to the more costly single-stage model fit. We apply our approach to a large spatio-temporal drought dataset in the United States, a dataset too large for many existing spatio-temporal methods.</p></details> |  |

For real-time wind speed prediction, statistical models typically depend on high-quality (near) real-time data from official meteorological stations to improve forecasting accuracy. Personal weather stations (PWS) offer an additional source of real-time data and broader spatial coverage than offical stations. However, they are not subject to rigorous quality control and may exhibit bias or measurement errors. This paper presents a framework for incorporating PWS data into statistical models for validated official meteorological station data via a two-stage approach. First, bias correction is performed on PWS wind speed data using reanalysis data. Second, we implement a Bayesian hierarchical spatio-temporal model that accounts for varying measurement error in the PWS data. This enables wind speed prediction across a target area, and is particularly beneficial for improving predictions in regions sparse in official monitoring stations. Our results show that including bias-corrected PWS data improves prediction accuracy compared to using meteorological station data alone, with a 7% reduction in prediction error on average across all sites. The results are comparable with popular reanalysis products, but unlike these numerical weather models our approach is available in real-time and offers improved uncertainty quantification.</p></details> |  |

However, most current systems assume a static environment, which limits the system's applicability in real-world scenarios where environments frequently change due to human intervention or the robot's own actions. In this work, we present DynaMem, a new approach to open-world mobile manipulation that uses a dynamic spatio-semantic memory to represent a robot's environment. DynaMem constructs a 3D data structure to maintain a dynamic memory of point clouds, and answers open-vocabulary object localization queries using multimodal LLMs or open-vocabulary features generated by state-of-the-art vision-language models. Powered by DynaMem, our robots can explore novel environments, search for objects not found in memory, and continuously update the memory as objects move, appear, or disappear in the scene. We run extensive experiments on the Stretch SE3 robots in three real and nine offline scenes, and achieve an average pick-and-drop success rate of 70% on non-stationary objects, which is more than a 2x improvement over state-of-the-art static systems.

However, existing 3DGS-based methods for dynamic reconstruction often suffer from \textit{spatio-temporal incoherence} during initialization, where canonical Gaussians are constructed by aggregating observations from multiple frames without temporal distinction. This results in spatio-temporally entangled representations, making it difficult to model dynamic motion accurately. To overcome this limitation, we propose \textbf{STDR} (Spatio-Temporal Decoupling for Real-time rendering), a plug-and-play module that learns spatio-temporal probability distributions for each Gaussian. STDR introduces a spatio-temporal mask, a separated deformation field, and a consistency regularization to jointly disentangle spatial and temporal patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that incorporating our module into existing 3DGS-based dynamic scene reconstruction frameworks leads to notable improvements in both reconstruction quality and spatio-temporal consistency across synthetic and real-world benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we adapt and specialise the robust and conjugate GP (RCGP) framework of Altamirano et al. (2024) to the spatio-temporal setting. In doing so, we obtain an outlier-robust spatio-temporal GP with a computational cost comparable to classical spatio-temporal GPs. We also overcome the three main drawbacks of RCGPs: their unreliable performance when the prior mean is chosen poorly, their lack of reliable uncertainty quantification, and the need to carefully select a hyperparameter by hand. We study our method extensively in finance and weather forecasting applications, demonstrating that it provides a reliable approach to spatio-temporal modelling in the presence of outliers.</p></details> |  |

Recently, advancements in monitoring technology have facilitated the effective recording of nuclear radiation levels and related factors, such as weather conditions. The abundance of monitoring data enables the development of accurate and reliable nuclear radiation forecasting models, which play a crucial role in informing decision-making for individuals and governments. However, this task is challenging due to the imbalanced distribution of monitoring stations over a wide spatial range and the non-stationary radiation variation patterns. In this study, we introduce NRFormer, a novel framework tailored for the nationwide prediction of nuclear radiation variations. By integrating a non-stationary temporal attention module, an imbalance-aware spatial attention module, and a radiation propagation prompting module, NRFormer collectively captures complex spatio-temporal dynamics of nuclear radiation. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework against 11 baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by KDD 2025 ADS Track</p></details> |

To make profits, prosumers equipped with photovoltaic (PV) panels and even the energy storage system (ESS) can actively participate in the real-time P2P energy market and trade energy. However, in real situations, system states such as energy demands and renewable energy power generation are highly uncertain, making it difficult for prosumers to make optimal real-time decisions. Moreover, severe problems with the physical network can arise from the real-time P2P energy trading, such as bus voltage violations and line overload. To handle these problems, this work first formulates the real-time P2P energy trading problem as a spatio-temporally constrained stochastic optimization problem by considering ESS and the spatial physical network constraints. To deal with the uncertainties online, a modified Lyapunov optimization method is innovatively proposed to approximately reformulate the stochastic optimization problem into an online one by relaxing the time-coupling constraints. Compared with the state-of-the-art online methods, the proposed one renders more flexibility and better performance for the real-time P2P energy market operation. Additionally, to protect the prosumers' privacy, an online distributed algorithm based on the consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is developed to solve the reformulated online problem by decoupling the spatial constraints. The theoretical near-optimal performance guarantee of the proposed online distributed algorithm is derived, and its performance can be further improved by minimizing the performance gap. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed online distributed algorithm can guarantee the fast, stable, and safe long-term operation of the real-time P2P energy market.</p></details> |  |

Spatio-temporal deep learning models, while scalable, typically assume a simplistic independent covariance matrix for the response, failing to capture the underlying correlation structure. However, spatio-temporal GPs suffer from issues of scalability and various forms of approximation bias resulting from restrictive assumptions of the covariance kernel function. We propose STACI, a novel framework consisting of a variational Bayesian neural network approximation of non-stationary spatio-temporal GP along with a novel spatio-temporal conformal inference algorithm. STACI is highly scalable, taking advantage of GPU training capabilities for neural network models, and provides statistically valid prediction intervals for uncertainty quantification. STACI outperforms competing GPs and deep methods in accurately approximating spatio-temporal processes and we show it easily scales to datasets with millions of observations.</p></details> |  |

However, they often fail to generalize in Spatio-Temporal Out-of-Distribution (STOOD) scenarios, where both temporal dynamics and spatial structures evolve beyond the training distribution. To address this problem, we propose an innovative Spatio-Temporal Retrieval-Augmented Pattern Learning framework,STRAP, which enhances model generalization by integrating retrieval-augmented learning into the STGNN continue learning pipeline. The core of STRAP is a compact and expressive pattern library that stores representative spatio-temporal patterns enriched with historical, structural, and semantic information, which is obtained and optimized during the training phase. During inference, STRAP retrieves relevant patterns from this library based on similarity to the current input and injects them into the model via a plug-and-play prompting mechanism. This not only strengthens spatio-temporal representations but also mitigates catastrophic forgetting. Moreover, STRAP introduces a knowledge-balancing objective to harmonize new information with retrieved knowledge. Extensive experiments across multiple real-world streaming graph datasets show that STRAP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art STGNN baselines on STOOD tasks, demonstrating its robustness, adaptability, and strong generalization capability without task-specific fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |

To tackle these challenges, we propose STH-SepNet (Spatio-Temporal Hypergraph Separation Networks), a novel framework that decouples temporal and spatial modeling to enhance both efficiency and precision. Therein, the temporal dimension is modeled using lightweight large language models, which effectively capture low-rank temporal dynamics. Concurrently, the spatial dimension is addressed through an adaptive hypergraph neural network, which dynamically constructs hyperedges to model intricate, higher-order interactions. A carefully designed gating mechanism is integrated to seamlessly fuse temporal and spatial representations. By leveraging the fundamental principles of low-rank temporal dynamics and spatial interactions, STH-SepNet offers a pragmatic and scalable solution for spatio-temporal prediction in real-world applications. Extensive experiments on large-scale real-world datasets across multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of STH-SepNet in boosting predictive performance while maintaining computational efficiency. This work may provide a promising lightweight framework for spatio-temporal prediction, aiming to reduce computational demands and while enhancing predictive performance.

We introduce a stochastic differential equation driven by a Brownian motion to model the accumulated total claims amount for the chain-ladder method. Within this continuous-time framework, we propose a bootstrap technique for estimating the distribution of claims reserves.

The core idea is to combine an implicit Crank-Nicolson step on spatial subdomains with a local prediction step at the subdomain interfaces. This enables parallelization across space while advancing sequentially in time, without requiring iterations at each time step. The method is similar to the methods from Blum, Lisky and Rannacher (1992) or Dawson and Dupont (1992), which have been designed for parabolic problems. Our approach adapts them to the case of the wave equation in a fully discrete setting, using linear finite elements with mass lumping. Compared to explicit schemes, our method permits significantly larger time steps and retains high accuracy. We prove that the resulting method achieves second-order accuracy in time and global convergence of order $\mathcal{O}(h + \tau^2)$ under a CFL-type condition, which depends on the overlap width between subdomains.

The first uses a particle filter reweighted via magnetic similarity, employing a heavy-tailed non-Gaussian kernel for enhanced stability. The second is a stateless sequence alignment technique that transforms real-time magnetic signals into the spatial domain and matches them to the map using a similarity measure. Experiments with operational train data show that the particle filter achieves track-selective, sub-5-meter accuracy over 21.6 km, though its performance degrades at low speeds and during cold starts. Accuracy tests were constrained by the GNSS-based reference system. In contrast, the alignment-based method excels in cold-start scenarios, localizing within 30 m in 92 % of tests (100 % using top-3 matches). A hybrid approach combines both methods$\unicode{x2014}$alignment-based initialization followed by particle filter tracking. Runtime analysis confirms real-time capability on consumer-grade hardware. The system delivers accurate, robust localization suitable for safety-critical rail applications.</p></details> |  |

Commercial systems are rarely open source, hard to expand, and limited by issues like node synchronisation, data throughput, unclear sensor placement, complexity, and high cost. As a result, researchers typically use only a few intuitively placed sensors and conduct limited field trials. HARNode overcomes these challenges with a fully open-source hardware and software platform. Each node includes an ESP32-S3 module (AtomS3), a 9-axis IMU (Bosch BMX160), pressure and temperature sensors (Bosch BMP388), a display, and an I2C port. Data is streamed via Wi-Fi, with NTP-based time synchronisation achieving roughly 1 ms accuracy. The system runs for up to 8 hours and is built using off-the-shelf parts, a simple online PCB service, and a compact 3D-printed housing with Velcro straps, enabling flexible and scalable body placement while requiring little hardware knowledge. In a study with ten subjects wearing eleven HARNodes each, setup took under five minutes per person. A random forest classifier distinguished walking from stair-climbing transitions, showing the benefits of sensor-overprovisioning: Seven nodes achieved approx. 98% accuracy, matching the performance of all eleven. These findings confirm HARNode's value as a fast-deploying, scalable tool for field-based HAR research and optimised sensor placement.</p></details> | 6 pages, 6 figures |

However, despite the virtual nature of its services, the sector remains inherently constrained by its materiality and cannot rely on an infinite pool of resources. As a result, the wide variety of supported services may need to be managed under stricter limits within hosting facilities in the future. Contrary to common assumptions, we show that tenants typically do not share computing resources, even in environments commonly perceived as mutualized, such as cloud platforms. Time-sharing has been progressively phased out for reasons of performance, security, predictability, and, perhaps more importantly, due to the decreasing cost of computing resources. This paper advocates for managing fewer physical resources by improving resource sharing between tenants. It represents a paradigm shift, moving beyond traditional time-sharing at the hardware level to a higher abstraction. This approach entails "doing with fewer resources" under conditions of "reduced performance". Nonetheless, enhancing the mutualization of infrastructure can reduce cluster sizes (through consolidation) and improve energy efficiency, with gains related to the accepted performance trade-off, a situation potentially more socially acceptable than eliminating services. We review the current state of the art, identify challenges and opportunities, propose interpretations of Time-Shared Computing, and outline key research directions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Post-...</summary><p>Post-proceedings paper presented at LIMITS 2025: 11th Workshop on Computing within Limits, 2025-06-26/27, Online</p></details> |

As an extension of the naive Monte Carlo method, the Multi-Level Monte Carlo method reduces the overall computational effort, but is unable to reduce the time to solution in a sufficiently parallel computing environment. In this work, we propose a Uncertainty Quantification method combining Multi-Level Monte Carlo sampling and Parallel-in-Time integration for select samples, exploiting remaining parallel computing capacity to accelerate the computation. While effective at reducing the time-to-solution, Parallel-in-Time integration methods greatly increase the total computational effort. We investigate the tradeoff between time-to-solution and total computational effort of the combined method, starting from theoretical considerations and comparing our findings to two numerical examples. There, a speedup of 12 - 45% compared to Multi-Level Monte Carlo sampling is observed, with an increase of 15 - 18% in computational effort.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Benchmarking Overestimation under the One-Time-Pad-Based Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19219v1)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Overestimation in evaluating large language models (LLMs) has become an increasing concern. Due to the contamination of public benchmarks or imbalanced model training, LLMs may achieve unreal evaluation results on public benchmarks, either intentionally or unintentionally, which leads to unfair comparisons among LLMs and undermines their realistic capability assessments. Existing benchmarks attempt to address these issues by keeping test cases permanently secret, mitigating contamination through human evaluation, or repeatedly collecting and constructing new samples. However, these approaches fail to ensure reproducibility, transparency, and high efficiency simultaneously. Moreover, the extent of overestimation in current LLMs remains unquantified. To address these issues, we propose ArxivRoll, a dynamic evaluation framework inspired by one-time pad encryption in cryptography. ArxivRoll comprises two key components: \emph{i) SCP (Sequencing, Cloze, and Prediction)}, an automated generator for private test cases, and \emph{ii) Rugged Scores (RS)}, metrics that measure the proportion of public benchmark contamination and training bias. Leveraging SCP, ArxivRoll constructs a new benchmark every six months using recent articles from ArXiv and employs them for one-time evaluations of LLM performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the high quality of our benchmark, and we provide a systematic evaluation of current LLMs. The source code is available at https://github.com/liangzid/ArxivRoll/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Sourc...</summary><p>Source code: https://github.com/liangzid/ArxivRoll/ Website: https://arxivroll.moreoverai.com/</p></details> |

Employing an integral equation approach, we rigorously prove the existence of these solutions and establish several fundamental properties, including upper and lower estimates, mass conservation, regularity, and monotonicity. To bridge theory and practice, we introduce a family of convergent numerical schemes specifically designed to compute the Barenblatt solutions, ensuring reliable and efficient approximations. The theoretical framework is enriched with various examples that illustrate the concepts and validate the effectiveness of the proposed numerical methods, enhancing the understanding and applicability of our results.</p></details> |  |
| **[DASH: 4D Hash Encoding with Self-Supervised Decomposition for Real-Time Dynamic Scene Rendering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19141v1)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic scene reconstruction is a long-term challenge in 3D vision. Existing plane-based methods in dynamic Gaussian splatting suffer from an unsuitable low-rank assumption, causing feature overlap and poor rendering quality. Although 4D hash encoding provides an explicit representation without low-rank constraints, directly applying it to the entire dynamic scene leads to substantial hash collisions and redundancy. To address these challenges, we present DASH, a real-time dynamic scene rendering framework that employs 4D hash encoding coupled with self-supervised decomposition. Our approach begins with a self-supervised decomposition mechanism that separates dynamic and static components without manual annotations or precomputed masks. Next, we introduce a multiresolution 4D hash encoder for dynamic elements, providing an explicit representation that avoids the low-rank assumption. Finally, we present a spatio-temporal smoothness regularization strategy to mitigate unstable deformation artifacts. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that DASH achieves state-of-the-art dynamic rendering performance, exhibiting enhanced visual quality at real-time speeds of 264 FPS on a single 4090 GPU.

However, implementing dynamic 3DGS on edge devices faces challenges: (1) Loading all Gaussian parameters from DRAM for frustum culling incurs high energy costs. (2) Increased parameters for dynamic scenes elevate sorting latency and energy consumption. (3) Limited on-chip buffer capacity with higher parameters reduces buffer reuse, causing frequent DRAM access. (4) Dynamic 3DGS operations are not readily compatible with digital compute-in-memory (DCIM). These challenges hinder real-time performance and power efficiency on edge devices, leading to reduced battery life or requiring bulky batteries. To tackle these challenges, we propose algorithm-hardware co-design techniques. At the algorithmic level, we introduce three optimizations: (1) DRAM-access reduction frustum culling to lower DRAM access overhead, (2) Adaptive tile grouping to enhance on-chip buffer reuse, and (3) Adaptive interval initialization Bucket-Bitonic sort to reduce sorting latency. At the hardware level, we present a DCIM-friendly computation flow that is evaluated using the measured data from a 16nm DCIM prototype chip. Our experimental results on Large-Scale Real-World Static/Dynamic Datasets demonstrate the ability to achieve high frame rate real-time rendering exceeding 200 frame per second (FPS) with minimal power consumption, merely 0.28 W for static Large-Scale Real-World scenes and 0.63 W for dynamic Large-Scale Real-World scenes. This work successfully addresses the significant challenges of implementing static/dynamic 3DGS technology on resource-constrained edge devices.</p></details> |  |
| **[PatchTraj: Dynamic Patch Representation Learning for Time-Frequency Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19119v1)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pedestrian trajectory prediction is crucial for autonomous driving and robotics. While existing point-based and grid-based methods expose two key limitations: insufficiently modeling human motion dynamics, as they fail to balance local motion details with long-range spatiotemporal dependencies, and the time representation lacks interaction with the frequency domain in modeling trajectory sequences. To address these challenges, we propose PatchTraj, a dynamic patch-based trajectory prediction framework that unifies time-domain and frequency-domain representations. Specifically, we decompose the trajectory into raw time sequences and frequency components, employing dynamic patch partitioning for multi-scale trajectory segmentation to capture hierarchical motion patterns. Each patch is processed by an adaptive embedding layer with scale-aware feature extraction, followed by hierarchical feature aggregation to model both fine-grained and long-range dependencies. The outputs of two branches interact via cross-modal attention, enabling complementary fusion of temporal and spectral cues. Finally, a Transformer encoder-decoder integrates both modalities to autoregressively predict future trajectories. Extensive experiments on ETH-UCY, SDD, NBA, and JRDB datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with high efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[IMEX-RB: a self-adaptive implicit-explicit time integration scheme exploiting the reduced basis method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16470v2)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we introduce a self-adaptive implicit-explicit (IMEX) time integration scheme, named IMEX-RB, for the numerical integration of systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), arising from spatial discretizations of partial differential equations (PDEs) by finite difference methods. Leveraging the Reduced Basis (RB) method, at each timestep we project the high-fidelity problem onto a suitable low-dimensional subspace and integrate its dynamics implicitly. Following the IMEX paradigm, the resulting solution then serves as an educated guess within a full-order explicit step. Notably, compared to the canonical RB method, IMEX-RB neither requires a parametrization of the underlying PDE nor features an offline-online splitting, since the reduced subspace is built dynamically, exploiting the high-fidelity solution history. We present the first-order formulation of IMEX-RB, demonstrating and showcasing its convergence and stability properties. In particular, under appropriate conditions on the method's hyperparameters, IMEX-RB is unconditionally stable. The theoretical analysis is corroborated by numerical experiments performed on representative model problems in two and three dimensions. The results demonstrate that our approach can outperform conventional time integration schemes like backward Euler. Indeed, IMEX-RB yields high-fidelity accurate solutions, provided that its main hyperparameters - namely the reduced basis size and the stability tolerance - are suitably tuned. Moreover, IMEX-RB realizes computational gains over backward Euler for a range of timestep sizes above the forward Euler stability threshold.</p></details> | 20 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Negation-Aware Test-Time Adaptation for Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19064v1)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we study a practical but less-touched problem in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), \ie, negation understanding. Specifically, many real-world applications require models to explicitly identify what is false or non-existent, \eg, radiologists may search for images that exclude specific conditions. Despite the impressive transferability of VLMs through large-scale training, they suffer from a critical limitation that fails to handle negation. To address this challenge, existing methods attribute its root cause to the scarcity of negation training data and propose to fine-tune VLMs on massive data containing explicit negation. Undoubtedly, such data-centric solutions demand substantial data and computational resources, limiting their sustainable widespread adoption. To tackle negation in a low-carbon manner, we empirically observe that the key obstacle lies in the dual-concept shifts between the affirmation and negation distributions. Therefore, we propose a Negation-Aware Test-Time Adaptation (NEAT) method to efficiently adjust distribution-related parameters during inference. In brief, NEAT can reduce distribution shift in consistent semantics while eliminating false distributional consistency in unrelated semantics. Extensive experiments on the various negation understanding tasks verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The code is available at https://github.com/hhc1997/NEAT.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper will be submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Many scenarios, particularly those in quantum learning and metrology, assume free access to the time-reverse of an unknown unitary. In this paper, we settle the query complexity of the unitary time-reversal task: approximately implementing $U^{-1}$ given only black-box access to an unknown $d$-dimensional unitary $U$. We provide a tight query lower bound $\Omega((1-\epsilon)d^2)$ for the unitary time-reversal to within diamond norm error $\epsilon$. Notably, our lower bound applies to general coherent protocols with unbounded ancillas, and holds even when $\epsilon$ is an average-case distance error and access to control-$U$ is available.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages; minor revision; removed the result about hardness of unitary controlization due to an error</p></details> |

Unlike standard score-based models that treat price trajectories as generic numerical sequences, our method injects noise proportionally to asset prices at each time step, reflecting the heteroskedasticity observed in financial time series. By accurately balancing the drift and diffusion terms, we show that the resulting log-price process reduces to a variance-exploding stochastic differential equation, aligning with the formulation in score-based generative models. The reverse-time generative process is trained via denoising score matching using a Transformer-based architecture adapted from the Conditional Score-based Diffusion Imputation (CSDI) framework. Empirical evaluations on historical stock data demonstrate that our model reproduces key stylized facts heavy-tailed return distributions, volatility clustering, and the leverage effect more realistically than conventional diffusion models.</p></details> |  |
| **[TiVy: Time Series Visual Summary for Scalable Visualization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18972v1)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visualizing multiple time series presents fundamental tradeoffs between scalability and visual clarity. Time series capture the behavior of many large-scale real-world processes, from stock market trends to urban activities. Users often gain insights by visualizing them as line charts, juxtaposing or superposing multiple time series to compare them and identify trends and patterns. However, existing representations struggle with scalability: when covering long time spans, leading to visual clutter from too many small multiples or overlapping lines. We propose TiVy, a new algorithm that summarizes time series using sequential patterns. It transforms the series into a set of symbolic sequences based on subsequence visual similarity using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), then constructs a disjoint grouping of similar subsequences based on the frequent sequential patterns. The grouping result, a visual summary of time series, provides uncluttered superposition with fewer small multiples. Unlike common clustering techniques, TiVy extracts similar subsequences (of varying lengths) aligned in time. We also present an interactive time series visualization that renders large-scale time series in real-time. Our experimental evaluation shows that our algorithm (1) extracts clear and accurate patterns when visualizing time series data, (2) achieves a significant speed-up (1000X) compared to a straightforward DTW clustering. We also demonstrate the efficiency of our approach to explore hidden structures in massive time series data in two usage scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>to be...</summary><p>to be published in TVCG (IEEE VIS 2025)</p></details> |

The latter is often neglected, replaced with an upper bound or calculated as a numerical approximation of the spatial integrals involved. In this paper, we consider a special case of time-varying density functions modeled as Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) that evolve with time via a set of time-varying sources (with known corresponding velocities). By imposing this structure, we obtain an efficient time-varying coverage controller that fully incorporates the time evolution of the density function. We show that the induced trajectories under our control law minimise the overall coverage cost. We elicit the structure of the proposed controller and compare it with a classical time-varying coverage controller, against which we benchmark the coverage performance in simulation. Furthermore, we highlight that the computationally efficient and distributed nature of the proposed control law makes it ideal for multi-vehicle robotic applications involving time-varying coverage control problems. We employ our method in plume monitoring using a swarm of drones. In an experimental field trial we show that drones guided by the proposed controller are able to track a simulated time-varying chemical plume in a distributed manner.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to CDC 2025</p></details> |

However, no similar studies have been conducted for computational notebooks in the context of data science. To help bridge this research gap, we make three scientific contributions: we (1) introduce a toolset for collecting code changes in Jupyter notebooks during development time; (2) use it to collect more than 100 hours of work related to a data analysis task and a machine learning task (carried out by 20 developers with different levels of expertise), resulting in a dataset containing 2,655 cells and 9,207 cell executions; and (3) use this dataset to investigate the dynamic nature of the notebook development process and the changes that take place in the notebooks. In our analysis of the collected data, we classified the changes made to the cells between executions and found that a significant number of these changes were code iteration modifications. We report a number of other insights and propose potential future research directions on the novel data.</p></details> | 32 pages, 6 figures |

There are strong parallels between this widespread framework and offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning algorithms: a universal value function is trained on a large number of goals, and the policy is evaluated on a single goal in each test episode. Extensive research in foundation models has shown that performance can be substantially improved through test-time training, specializing the model to the current goal. We find similarly that test-time offline reinforcement learning on experience related to the test goal can lead to substantially better policies at minimal compute costs. We propose a novel self-supervised data selection criterion, which selects transitions from an offline dataset according to their relevance to the current state and quality with respect to the evaluation goal. We demonstrate across a wide range of high-dimensional loco-navigation and manipulation tasks that fine-tuning a policy on the selected data for a few gradient steps leads to significant performance gains over standard offline pre-training. Our goal-conditioned test-time training (GC-TTT) algorithm applies this routine in a receding-horizon fashion during evaluation, adapting the policy to the current trajectory as it is being rolled out. Finally, we study compute allocation at inference, demonstrating that, at comparable costs, GC-TTT induces performance gains that are not achievable by scaling model size.</p></details> |  |

For the steady nonlinear equation, we use an iteration method to reformulate the nonlinear equation into its linear counterpart, and derive a fourth-order compact 9-point finite difference method (FDM) to solve the reformulated equation on a uniform Cartesian grid. To increase the accuracy, we modify the FDM to reduce the pollution effect. The linear system of the FDM generates an M-matrix, provided the mesh size $h$ is sufficiently small. For the time dependent nonlinear equation, we discrete the temporal domain using the Crank-Nicolson (CN), BDF3, BDF4 time stepping methods, and apply a similar iterative method to rewrite the nonlinear equation as the same linear convection-diffusion equation. Then we propose the second-order to fourth-order compact 9-point FDMs with the reduced pollution effects on a uniform Cartesian grid. We prove that all FDMs satisfy the discrete maximum principle for sufficiently small $h$. Several examples with the variable and time-dependent diffusion coefficients and challenging nonlinear terms (not limited to the Burgers equation) are provided to verify the accuracy and the desired convergence rates in the $l_2$ and $l_{\infty}$ norms in space and time. We also compare our second-order CN method with the third-order BDF3 method and the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method, and the numerical results demonstrate that our FDM with the coarse time step generates the small error. Especially, if the same BDF3 scheme is applied, our error is 1.6\% of that obtained from the DG method. The proposed methods can be easily extended to a 3D spatial domain and more general nonlinear convection-diffusion-reaction equations.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages and 6 figures</p></details> |
| **[Cure Rate Joint Model for Time-to-Event Data and Longitudinal Tumor Burden with Potential Change Points](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18773v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) clinical trials, tumor burden (TB) is a key longitudinal biomarker for assessing treatment effects. Typically, standard-of-care (SOC) therapies and some novel interventions initially decrease TB; however, many patients subsequently experience an increase-indicating disease progression-while others show a continuous decline. In patients with an eventual TB increase, the change point marks the onset of progression and must occur before the time of the event. To capture these distinct dynamics, we propose a novel joint model that integrates time-to-event and longitudinal TB data, classifying patients into a change-point group or a stable group. For the change-point group, our approach flexibly estimates an individualized change point by leveraging time-to-event information. We use a Monte Carlo Expectation-Maximization (MCEM) algorithm for efficient parameter estimation. Simulation studies demonstrate that our model outperforms traditional approaches by accurately capturing diverse disease progression patterns and handling censoring complexities, leading to robust marginal TB outcome estimates. When applied to a Phase 3 NSCLC trial comparing cemiplimab monotherapy to SOC, the treatment group shows prolonged TB reduction and consistently lower TB over time, highlighting the clinical utility of our approach.

VISTA is specifically designed for the unsupervised identification of groups in datasets originating from healthcare and psychology where such sampling issues are commonplace. Our approach adapts linear Gaussian state space models (LGSSMs) to provide a flexible parametric framework for fitting a wide range of time series dynamics. The clustering approach itself is based on the assumption that the population can be represented as a mixture of a fixed number of LGSSMs. VISTA's model formulation allows for an explicit derivation of the log-likelihood function, from which we develop an expectation-maximization scheme for fitting model parameters to the observed data samples. Our algorithmic implementation is designed to handle populations of multivariate time series that can exhibit large changes in sampling rate as well as irregular sampling. We evaluate the versatility and accuracy of our approach on simulated and real-world datasets, including demographic trends, wearable sensor data, epidemiological time series, and ecological momentary assessments. Our results indicate that VISTA outperforms most comparable standard times series clustering methods. We provide an open-source implementation of VISTA in Python.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time-resolved dynamic CBCT reconstruction using prior-model-free spatiotemporal Gaussian representation (PMF-STGR)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22139v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-resolved CBCT imaging, which reconstructs a dynamic sequence of CBCTs reflecting intra-scan motion (one CBCT per x-ray projection without phase sorting or binning), is highly desired for regular and irregular motion characterization, patient setup, and motion-adapted radiotherapy. Representing patient anatomy and associated motion fields as 3D Gaussians, we developed a Gaussian representation-based framework (PMF-STGR) for fast and accurate dynamic CBCT reconstruction. PMF-STGR comprises three major components: a dense set of 3D Gaussians to reconstruct a reference-frame CBCT for the dynamic sequence; another 3D Gaussian set to capture three-level, coarse-to-fine motion-basis-components (MBCs) to model the intra-scan motion; and a CNN-based motion encoder to solve projection-specific temporal coefficients for the MBCs. Scaled by the temporal coefficients, the learned MBCs will combine into deformation vector fields to deform the reference CBCT into projection-specific, time-resolved CBCTs to capture the dynamic motion. Due to the strong representation power of 3D Gaussians, PMF-STGR can reconstruct dynamic CBCTs in a 'one-shot' training fashion from a standard 3D CBCT scan, without using any prior anatomical or motion model. We evaluated PMF-STGR using XCAT phantom simulations and real patient scans. Metrics including the image relative error, structural-similarity-index-measure, tumor center-of-mass-error, and landmark localization error were used to evaluate the accuracy of solved dynamic CBCTs and motion. PMF-STGR shows clear advantages over a state-of-the-art, INR-based approach, PMF-STINR. Compared with PMF-STINR, PMF-STGR reduces reconstruction time by 50% while reconstructing less blurred images with better motion accuracy. With improved efficiency and accuracy, PMF-STGR enhances the applicability of dynamic CBCT imaging for potential clinical translation.</p></details> | 25 pages, 5 figures |

We introduce Specification Self-Correction (SSC), a novel, test-time framework that enables an LM to identify and correct flaws within its own guiding specification. SSC employs a multi-step inference process where the model first generates a response based on a potentially tainted specification, critiques its output, and then revises the specification itself to remove the exploitable loophole. A final, more robust response is then generated using this self-corrected specification. Across experiments spanning creative writing and agentic coding tasks with several LMs, we demonstrate that while models initially game tainted specifications in 50-70\% of cases, the SSC process reduces this vulnerability by over 90\%. This dynamic repair occurs at inference time, requires no weight modification, and leads to more robustly aligned model behavior.

Neural radiance field (NeRF)-based methods that reconstruct sensor observations via ray-casting of implicit representations have demonstrated accurate simulation of driving scenes, but are slow to train and render, hampering scale. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated faster training and rendering times through rasterization, but is primarily restricted to pinhole camera sensors, preventing usage for realistic multi-sensor autonomy evaluation. Moreover, both NeRF and 3DGS couple the representation with the rendering procedure (implicit networks for ray-based evaluation, particles for rasterization), preventing interoperability, which is key for general usage. In this work, we present Sparse Local Fields (SaLF), a novel volumetric representation that supports rasterization and raytracing. SaLF represents volumes as a sparse set of 3D voxel primitives, where each voxel is a local implicit field. SaLF has fast training (<30 min) and rendering capabilities (50+ FPS for camera and 600+ FPS LiDAR), has adaptive pruning and densification to easily handle large scenes, and can support non-pinhole cameras and spinning LiDARs. We demonstrate that SaLF has similar realism as existing self-driving sensor simulation methods while improving efficiency and enhancing capabilities, enabling more scalable simulation. https://waabi.ai/salf/</p></details> |  |

Although YOLO-series models have set strong benchmarks by balancing speed and accuracy, the increasing need for richer global context modeling has led to the use of Transformer-based architectures. Nevertheless, Transformers have high computational complexity because of their self-attention mechanism, which limits their practicality for real-time and edge deployments. To overcome these challenges, recent developments in linear state space models, such as Mamba, provide a promising alternative by enabling efficient sequence modeling with linear complexity. Building on this insight, we propose MambaNeXt-YOLO, a novel object detection framework that balances accuracy and efficiency through three key contributions: (1) MambaNeXt Block: a hybrid design that integrates CNNs with Mamba to effectively capture both local features and long-range dependencies; (2) Multi-branch Asymmetric Fusion Pyramid Network (MAFPN): an enhanced feature pyramid architecture that improves multi-scale object detection across various object sizes; and (3) Edge-focused Efficiency: our method achieved 66.6% mAP at 31.9 FPS on the PASCAL VOC dataset without any pre-training and supports deployment on edge devices such as the NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX and Orin NX.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is under consideration at Image and Vision Computing</p></details> |

Unlike recent rasterization based approach by 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), our primitive based representation allows for exact volume rendering, rather than alpha compositing 3D Gaussian billboards. As such, unlike 3DGS our formulation does not suffer from popping artifacts and view dependent density, but still achieves frame rates of $\sim\!30$ FPS at 720p on an NVIDIA RTX4090. Since our approach is built upon ray tracing it enables effects such as defocus blur and camera distortion (e.g. such as from fisheye cameras), which are difficult to achieve by rasterization. We show that our method is more accurate with fewer blending issues than 3DGS and follow-up work on view-consistent rendering, especially on the challenging large-scale scenes from the Zip-NeRF dataset where it achieves sharpest results among real-time techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://half-potato.gitlab.io/posts/ever</p></details> |
| **[TTS-VAR: A Test-Time Scaling Framework for Visual Auto-Regressive Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18537v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scaling visual generation models is essential for real-world content creation, yet requires substantial training and computational expenses. Alternatively, test-time scaling has garnered growing attention due to resource efficiency and promising performance. In this work, we present TTS-VAR, the first general test-time scaling framework for visual auto-regressive (VAR) models, modeling the generation process as a path searching problem. To dynamically balance computational efficiency with exploration capacity, we first introduce an adaptive descending batch size schedule throughout the causal generation process. Besides, inspired by VAR's hierarchical coarse-to-fine multi-scale generation, our framework integrates two key components: (i) At coarse scales, we observe that generated tokens are hard for evaluation, possibly leading to erroneous acceptance of inferior samples or rejection of superior samples. Noticing that the coarse scales contain sufficient structural information, we propose clustering-based diversity search. It preserves structural variety through semantic feature clustering, enabling later selection on samples with higher potential. (ii) In fine scales, resampling-based potential selection prioritizes promising candidates using potential scores, which are defined as reward functions incorporating multi-scale generation history. Experiments on the powerful VAR model Infinity show a notable 8.7% GenEval score improvement (from 0.69 to 0.75). Key insights reveal that early-stage structural features effectively influence final quality, and resampling efficacy varies across generation scales.

We apply a model-free approach that relies neither on knowledge of model parameters nor on their estimations, and devise an RL algorithm to learn the optimal policy parameter directly. Our main contributions include the introduction of an exploration schedule and a regret analysis of the proposed algorithm. We provide the convergence rate of the policy parameter to the optimal one, and prove that the algorithm achieves a regret bound of $O(N^{\frac{3}{4}})$ up to a logarithmic factor, where $N$ is the number of learning episodes. We conduct a simulation study to validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed algorithm. We also perform numerical comparisons between our method and those of the recent model-based stochastic LQ RL studies adapted to the state- and control-dependent volatility setting, demonstrating a better performance of the former in terms of regret bounds.</p></details> | <details><summary>42 pa...</summary><p>42 pages, 4 figures.

| **[Unsupervised Concept Drift Detection from Deep Learning Representations in Real-time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17813v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Concept drift is the phenomenon in which the underlying data distributions and statistical properties of a target domain change over time, leading to a degradation in model performance. Consequently, production models require continuous drift detection monitoring. Most drift detection methods to date are supervised, relying on ground-truth labels. However, they are inapplicable in many real-world scenarios, as true labels are often unavailable. Although recent efforts have proposed unsupervised drift detectors, many lack the accuracy required for reliable detection or are too computationally intensive for real-time use in high-dimensional, large-scale production environments. Moreover, they often fail to characterize or explain drift effectively. To address these limitations, we propose \textsc{DriftLens}, an unsupervised framework for real-time concept drift detection and characterization. Designed for deep learning classifiers handling unstructured data, \textsc{DriftLens} leverages distribution distances in deep learning representations to enable efficient and accurate detection. Additionally, it characterizes drift by analyzing and explaining its impact on each label. Our evaluation across classifiers and data-types demonstrates that \textsc{DriftLens} (i) outperforms previous methods in detecting drift in 15/17 use cases; (ii) runs at least 5 times faster; (iii) produces drift curves that align closely with actual drift (correlation $\geq\!0.85$); (iv) effectively identifies representative drift samples as explanations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering (TKDE)</p></details> |

The proposed approach employs an Arrival-Order Speaker Cache (AOSC) to store frame-level acoustic embeddings of previously observed speakers. Unlike conventional speaker-tracing buffers, AOSC orders embeddings by speaker index corresponding to their arrival time order, and is dynamically updated by selecting frames with the highest scores based on the model's past predictions. Notably, the number of stored embeddings per speaker is determined dynamically by the update mechanism, ensuring efficient cache utilization and precise speaker tracking. Experiments on benchmark datasets confirm the effectiveness and flexibility of our approach, even in low-latency setups. These results establish Streaming Sortformer as a robust solution for real-time multi-speaker tracking and a foundation for streaming multi-talker speech processing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Interspeech 2025</p></details> |

| **[State of Health Estimation of Batteries Using a Time-Informed Dynamic Sequence-Inverted Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18320v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid adoption of battery-powered vehicles and energy storage systems over the past decade has made battery health monitoring increasingly critical. Batteries play a central role in the efficiency and safety of these systems, yet they inevitably degrade over time due to repeated charge-discharge cycles. This degradation leads to reduced energy efficiency and potential overheating, posing significant safety concerns. Accurate estimation of a State of Health (SoH) of battery is therefore essential for ensuring operational reliability and safety. Several machine learning architectures, such as LSTMs, transformers, and encoder-based models, have been proposed to estimate SoH from discharge cycle data. However, these models struggle with the irregularities inherent in real-world measurements: discharge readings are often recorded at non-uniform intervals, and the lengths of discharge cycles vary significantly. To address this, most existing approaches extract features from the sequences rather than processing them in full, which introduces information loss and compromises accuracy. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel architecture: Time-Informed Dynamic Sequence Inverted Transformer (TIDSIT). TIDSIT incorporates continuous time embeddings to effectively represent irregularly sampled data and utilizes padded sequences with temporal attention mechanisms to manage variable-length inputs without discarding sequence information. Experimental results on the NASA battery degradation dataset show that TIDSIT significantly outperforms existing models, achieving over 50% reduction in prediction error and maintaining an SoH prediction error below 0.58%. Furthermore, the architecture is generalizable and holds promise for broader applications in health monitoring tasks involving irregular time-series data.</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 figures |

We show the proposed estimators are consistent and follow normal distributions in large samples under weak conditions. We also provide a precise characterisation of the leading bias term due to smoothing, which has not been done before. We demonstrate the usefulness of our general results by establishing primitive conditions for local (quasi-)maximum-likelihood estimators of time-varying models threshold autoregressions, ARCH models and Poisson autogressions with exogenous co--variates, to be normally distributed in large samples and characterise their leading biases. An empirical study of US corporate default counts demonstrates the applicability of the proposed local linear estimator for Poisson autoregression, shedding new light on the dynamic properties of US corporate defaults.</p></details> |  |
| **[EigenWave: An Optimal O(N) Method for Computing Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors by Time-Filtering the Wave Equation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18282v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An algorithm named EigenWave is described to compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors of elliptic boundary value problems. The algorithm, based on the recently developed WaveHoltz scheme, solves a related time-dependent wave equation as part of an iteration. At each iteration, the solution to the wave equation is filtered in time. As the iteration progresses, the filtered solution generally contains relatively larger and larger proportions of eigenmodes whose eigenvalues are near a chosen target frequency (target eigenvalue). The ability to choose an arbitrary target frequency enables the computation of eigenvalues anywhere in the spectrum, without the need to invert an indefinite matrix, as is common with other approaches. Furthermore, the iteration can be embedded within a matrix-free Arnoldi algorithm, which enables the efficient computation of multiple eigenpairs near the target frequency. For efficiency, the time-dependent wave equation can be solved with implicit time-stepping and only about $10$ time-steps per-period are needed, independent of the mesh spacing. When the (definite) implicit time-stepping equations are solved with a multigrid algorithm, the cost of the resulting EigenWave scheme scales linearly with the number of grid points $N$ as the mesh is refined, giving an optimal $O(N)$ algorithm. The approach is demonstrated by finding eigenpairs of the Laplacian in complex geometry using overset grids. Results in two and three space dimensions are presented using second-order and fourth-order accurate approximations.</p></details> |  |
| **[DisMS-TS: Eliminating Redundant Multi-Scale Features for Time Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04600v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world time series typically exhibit complex temporal variations, making the time series classification task notably challenging. Recent advancements have demonstrated the potential of multi-scale analysis approaches, which provide an effective solution for capturing these complex temporal patterns. However, existing multi-scale analysis-based time series prediction methods fail to eliminate redundant scale-shared features across multi-scale time series, resulting in the model over- or under-focusing on scale-shared features. To address this issue, we propose a novel end-to-end Disentangled Multi-Scale framework for Time Series classification (DisMS-TS). The core idea of DisMS-TS is to eliminate redundant shared features in multi-scale time series, thereby improving prediction performance. Specifically, we propose a temporal disentanglement module to capture scale-shared and scale-specific temporal representations, respectively. Subsequently, to effectively learn both scale-shared and scale-specific temporal representations, we introduce two regularization terms that ensure the consistency of scale-shared representations and the disparity of scale-specific representations across all temporal scales. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple datasets validate the superiority of DisMS-TS over its competitive baselines, with the accuracy improvement up to 9.71%.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for presentation at the ACM International Conference on Multimedia (ACM MM 2025)</p></details> |
| **[DATA: Domain-And-Time Alignment for High-Quality Feature Fusion in Collaborative Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18237v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Feature-level fusion shows promise in collaborative perception (CP) through balanced performance and communication bandwidth trade-off. However, its effectiveness critically relies on input feature quality. The acquisition of high-quality features faces domain gaps from hardware diversity and deployment conditions, alongside temporal misalignment from transmission delays. These challenges degrade feature quality with cumulative effects throughout the collaborative network. In this paper, we present the Domain-And-Time Alignment (DATA) network, designed to systematically align features while maximizing their semantic representations for fusion. Specifically, we propose a Consistency-preserving Domain Alignment Module (CDAM) that reduces domain gaps through proximal-region hierarchical downsampling and observability-constrained discriminator. We further propose a Progressive Temporal Alignment Module (PTAM) to handle transmission delays via multi-scale motion modeling and two-stage compensation. Building upon the aligned features, an Instance-focused Feature Aggregation Module (IFAM) is developed to enhance semantic representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DATA achieves state-of-the-art performance on three typical datasets, maintaining robustness with severe communication delays and pose errors.

This work extends a stabilized two-step formulation of Maxwell's equations to the time-domain. Using a Galerkin discretization in space, we apply two different time-discretization schemes that are tailored to the first- and second-order in time partial differential equations of the two-step solution procedure used here. To address the low-frequency instability, we incorporate a generalized tree-cotree gauge that removes the singularity of the curl-curl operator, ensuring robustness even in the static limit. Numerical results on academic and application-oriented 3D problems confirm stability, accuracy, and the method's applicability to nonlinear, temperature-dependent materials.</p></details> | 6 pages, 9 figures |
| **[3D Test-time Adaptation via Graph Spectral Driven Point Shift](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18225v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While test-time adaptation (TTA) methods effectively address domain shifts by dynamically adapting pre-trained models to target domain data during online inference, their application to 3D point clouds is hindered by their irregular and unordered structure. Current 3D TTA methods often rely on computationally expensive spatial-domain optimizations and may require additional training data. In contrast, we propose Graph Spectral Domain Test-Time Adaptation (GSDTTA), a novel approach for 3D point cloud classification that shifts adaptation to the graph spectral domain, enabling more efficient adaptation by capturing global structural properties with fewer parameters. Point clouds in target domain are represented as outlier-aware graphs and transformed into graph spectral domain by Graph Fourier Transform (GFT). For efficiency, adaptation is performed by optimizing only the lowest 10% of frequency components, which capture the majority of the point cloud's energy. An inverse GFT (IGFT) is then applied to reconstruct the adapted point cloud with the graph spectral-driven point shift. This process is enhanced by an eigenmap-guided self-training strategy that iteratively refines both the spectral adjustments and the model parameters. Experimental results and ablation studies on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of GSDTTA, outperforming existing TTA methods for 3D point cloud classification.</p></details> |  |
| **[Why Do Class-Dependent Evaluation Effects Occur with Time Series Feature Attributions? A Synthetic Data Investigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11790v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating feature attribution methods represents a critical challenge in explainable AI (XAI), as researchers typically rely on perturbation-based metrics when ground truth is unavailable. However, recent work reveals that these evaluation metrics can show different performance across predicted classes within the same dataset. These "class-dependent evaluation effects" raise questions about whether perturbation analysis reliably measures attribution quality, with direct implications for XAI method development and evaluation trustworthiness. We investigate under which conditions these class-dependent effects arise by conducting controlled experiments with synthetic time series data where ground truth feature locations are known. We systematically vary feature types and class contrasts across binary classification tasks, then compare perturbation-based degradation scores with ground truth-based precision-recall metrics using multiple attribution methods. Our experiments demonstrate that class-dependent effects emerge with both evaluation approaches, even in simple scenarios with temporally localized features, triggered by basic variations in feature amplitude or temporal extent between classes. Most critically, we find that perturbation-based and ground truth metrics frequently yield contradictory assessments of attribution quality across classes, with weak correlations between evaluation approaches. These findings suggest that researchers should interpret perturbation-based metrics with care, as they may not always align with whether attributions correctly identify discriminating features. By showing this disconnect, our work points toward reconsidering what attribution evaluation actually measures and developing more rigorous evaluation methods that capture multiple dimensions of attribution quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at TempXAI Workshop @ ECML-PKDD 2025 (Explainable AI for Time Series and Data Streams)</p></details> |
| **[The Role of the Time-Dependent Hessian in High-Dimensional Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02418v3)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gradient descent is commonly used to find minima in rough landscapes, particularly in recent machine learning applications. However, a theoretical understanding of why good solutions are found remains elusive, especially in strongly non-convex and high-dimensional settings. Here, we focus on the phase retrieval problem as a typical example, which has received a lot of attention recently in theoretical machine learning. We analyze the Hessian during gradient descent, identify a dynamical transition in its spectral properties, and relate it to the ability of escaping rough regions in the loss landscape. When the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is large enough, an informative negative direction exists in the Hessian at the beginning of the descent, i.e in the initial condition. While descending, a BBP transition in the spectrum takes place in finite time: the direction is lost, and the dynamics is trapped in a rugged region filled with marginally stable bad minima. Surprisingly, for finite system sizes, this window of negative curvature allows the system to recover the signal well before the theoretical SNR found for infinite sizes, emphasizing the central role of initialization and early-time dynamics for efficiently navigating rough landscapes.</p></details> | 32 pages |

In practice, engineers favour simple models, such as labelled transition systems (LTSs). However, to deal with quiescence - the absence of observable output - in practice, a time-out needs to be set to conclude observation of quiescence. Timed MBT exists, but it typically relies on the full arsenal of timed automata (TA). We present a lifting operator $\chi^{\scriptstyle M}\!$ that adds timing without the TA overhead: given an LTS, $\chi^{\scriptstyle M}\!$ introduces a single clock for a user chosen time bound $M>0$ to declare quiescence. In the timed automaton, the clock is used to model that outputs should happen before the clock reaches value $M$, while quiescence occurs exactly at time $M$. This way we provide a formal basis for the industrial practice of choosing a time-out to conclude quiescence. Our contributions are threefold: (1) an implementation conforms under $\mathbf{ioco}$ if and only if its lifted version conforms under timed $\mathbf{tioco_M}$ (2) applying $\chi^{\scriptstyle M}\!$ before or after the standard $\mathbf{ioco}$ test-generation algorithm yields the same set of tests, and (3) the lifted TA test suite and the original LTS test suite deliver identical verdicts for every implementation.</p></details> |  |

Existing deep learning-based methods such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Single Shot Detectors (SSDs), and You Only Look Once (YOLO) have demonstrated high performance in terms of accuracy and computational speed when deployed on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). However, despite these advances, state-of-the-art YOLO-based object detection and classification systems continue to face challenges in achieving resource efficiency suitable for edge FPGA platforms.

While existing interventions predominantly target children through structured or intrusive methods, adults lack tools that translate clinical strategies into daily communication support. To address this gap, we present Understood, a Mixed Reality (MR) system implemented on Microsoft HoloLens 2, designed to assist adults with ADHD in real-world communication. Through formative semi-structured interviews and a design workshop, we identified critical communication barriers and derived design goals for the system. Understood combines three key features: (1) real-time conversation summarization to reduce cognitive load, (2) context-aware subsequent word suggestions during moments of disfluency, and (3) topic shifting detection and reminding to mitigate off-topic transitions. A within-subjects user study and expert interviews demonstrate that Understood effectively supports communication with high usability, offering a complement to therapist-mediated interventions.</p></details> | Appear UIST2025 |

However, the understanding of long videos is still challenging, as their long-context nature results in significant computational and memory overhead. Most existing work treats long videos in the same way as short videos, which is inefficient for real-world applications and hard to generalize to even longer videos. To address these issues, we propose Flash-VStream, an efficient video language model capable of processing extremely long videos and responding to user queries in real time. Particularly, we design a Flash Memory module, containing a low-capacity context memory to aggregate long-context temporal information and model the distribution of information density, and a high-capacity augmentation memory to retrieve detailed spatial information based on this distribution. Compared to existing models, Flash-VStream achieves significant reductions in inference latency. Extensive experiments on long video benchmarks and comprehensive video benchmarks, i.e., EgoSchema, MLVU, LVBench, MVBench and Video-MME, demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance and outstanding efficiency of our method.

These techniques are crucial to controller design for complex systems while significantly reducing computational costs. Nevertheless, constructing effective reduced-order models (ROMs) poses considerable challenges, particularly for dynamical systems characterized by highly nonlinear terms. These challenges are further exacerbated when the actual system model is unavailable, a scenario frequently encountered in real-world applications. In this work, we propose a data-driven framework for the construction of ROMs for both continuous- and discrete-time nonlinear dynamical systems with unknown mathematical models. By leveraging two sets of data collected from the system, referred to as two input-state trajectories, we first construct a data-based closed-loop representation of the system. We then establish a similarity relation between the output trajectories of the original system and those of its data-driven ROM employing the notion of simulation functions (SFs), thereby enabling a formal characterization of their closeness. To achieve this, we propose data-dependent semidefinite programs as sufficient conditions to simultaneously construct both ROMs and SFs, while offering correctness guarantees. We demonstrate that the obtained data-driven ROMs can be employed for synthesizing controllers that ensure the unknown system satisfies high-level logic properties. This is accomplished by first designing controllers for the data-driven ROMs and then translating the results back to the original system through an interface function. We evaluate the efficacy of our data-driven findings through four benchmark case studies involving unknown dynamics with highly nonlinear terms.</p></details> |  |

The optimization problem for ED is formulated with load being an unknown parameter while DCOPF consists of load and power transfer distribution factor (PTDF) matrix as unknown parameters. PTDF represents the incremental variations of real power on transmission lines which occur due to real power transfers between two regions. These values represent a linearized approximation of power flows over the transmission lines. We develop novel ILO formulations to solve post-hoc penalties in electricity market and line congestion problems using ED and DCOPF optimization formulations. Our proposed methodologies capture the real-time electricity market and line congestion behavior to train the regret function which eventually train unknown loads at different buses and line PTDF matrix to achieve the afore-mentioned post-hoc goals. The proposed methodology is compared to sequential learning and optimization (SLO) which train load and PTDF forecasts for accuracy rather than economic operation. Our experimentation prove the superiority of ILO in minimizing the post-hoc penalties in electricity markets and minimizing the line congestion thereby improving the economic operation with noticeable amount.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we study the test-time scaling of language models for mathematical reasoning tasks, where the model's own confidence is used to select the most promising attempts. Surprisingly, we find that we can achieve significant performance gains by continuing only the most promising attempt, selected by the model's prefix-confidence. We systematically evaluate prefix-confidence scaling on five mathematical reasoning datasets: the school-level GSM8K and MATH500, and the competition-level AMC23, AIME24, and AIME25. We find that prefix-confidence scaling with prefixes of only 32 tokens achieves a better accuracy-compute trade-off than majority voting. Moreover, prefix-confidence scaling appears less susceptible than BoN to length biases. Finally, we also evaluate test-time training with prefix-confidence and find that, while outperforming the base model, it does not improve over prefix-confidence scaling.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present a lightweight deep learning-based hand gesture recognition system that enables humans to control collaborative robots naturally and efficiently. This model recognizes eight distinct hand gestures with only 1,103 parameters and a compact size of 22 KB, achieving an accuracy of 93.5%. To further optimize the model for real-world deployment on edge devices, we applied quantization and pruning using TensorFlow Lite, reducing the final model size to just 7 KB.

Ultra low-bit quantization can significantly reduce storage and accelerate inference, but extreme compression (i.e., mean bit-width <= 2) often leads to severe performance degradation. To address this, we propose Squeeze10-LLM, effectively "squeezing" 16-bit LLMs' weights by 10 times. Specifically, Squeeze10-LLM is a staged mixed-precision post-training quantization (PTQ) framework and achieves an average of 1.6 bits per weight by quantizing 80% of the weights to 1 bit and 20% to 4 bits. We introduce Squeeze10LLM with two key innovations: Post-Binarization Activation Robustness (PBAR) and Full Information Activation Supervision (FIAS). PBAR is a refined weight significance metric that accounts for the impact of quantization on activations, improving accuracy in low-bit settings. FIAS is a strategy that preserves full activation information during quantization to mitigate cumulative error propagation across layers. Experiments on LLaMA and LLaMA2 show that Squeeze10-LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance for sub-2bit weight-only quantization, improving average accuracy from 43% to 56% on six zero-shot classification tasks--a significant boost over existing PTQ methods.

| **[Fixing the Pitfalls of Probabilistic Time-Series Forecasting Evaluation by Kernel Quadrature](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06079v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the significance of probabilistic time-series forecasting models, their evaluation metrics often involve intractable integrations. The most widely used metric, the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS), is a strictly proper scoring function; however, its computation requires approximation. We found that popular CRPS estimators--specifically, the quantile-based estimator implemented in the widely used GluonTS library and the probability-weighted moment approximation--both exhibit inherent estimation biases. These biases lead to crude approximations, resulting in improper rankings of forecasting model performance when CRPS values are close. To address this issue, we introduced a kernel quadrature approach that leverages an unbiased CRPS estimator and employs cubature construction for scalable computation. Empirically, our approach consistently outperforms the two widely used CRPS estimators.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |

Simultaneously, extensive research has explored the interplay between collaborative perception and decision-making in end-to-end driving frameworks. In this work, we revisit the collaborative driving problem and propose the Select2Drive framework to optimize the utilization of limited computational and communication resources. Particularly, to mitigate cumulative latency in perception and decision-making, Select2Drive introduces distributed predictive perception by formulating an active prediction paradigm and simplifying high-dimensional semantic feature prediction into a computation cost-efficient, motion-aware reconstruction. Given the ``less is more" principle that an over-broadened perceptual horizon possibly confuses the decision module rather than contributing to it, Select2Drive utilizes area-of-importance-based PragComm to prioritize the communications of critical regions, thus boosting both communication efficiency and decision-making efficacy. Empirical evaluations on the V2Xverse and real-world DAIR-V2X demonstrate that Select2Drive achieves a $2.60$\% and $1.99$\% improvement in offline perception tasks under limited bandwidth (resp., pose error conditions). Moreover, it delivers at most $8.35$\% and $2.65$\% enhancement in closed-loop driving scores and route completion rates, particularly in scenarios characterized by dense traffic and high-speed dynamics.</p></details> |  |

State-of-the-art (SOTA) scheduling systems optimize global workload distributions for heterogeneous devices but often suffer from extended scheduling cycles, leading to sub-optimal processing in rapidly changing Edge environments. Local Reinforcement Learning (RL) enables quick adjustments between cycles but faces scalability, knowledge integration, and adaptability issues. Thus, we propose FCPO, which combines Continual RL (CRL) with Federated RL (FRL) to address these challenges. This integration dynamically adjusts inference batch sizes, input resolutions, and multi-threading during pre- and post-processing. CRL allows agents to learn from changing Markov Decision Processes, capturing dynamic environmental variations, while FRL improves generalization and convergence speed by integrating experiences across inference models. FCPO combines these via an agent-specific aggregation scheme and a diversity-aware experience buffer. Experiments on a real-world EVA testbed showed over 5 times improvement in effective throughput, 60% reduced latency, and 20% faster convergence with up to 10 times less memory consumption compared to SOTA RL-based approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 14 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

However, most existing approaches rely on fixed, global intervention vectors, overlook the causal influence of individual input tokens, and fail to leverage informative gradients from the model's logits, particularly in multimodal settings where visual and textual inputs contribute unevenly. To address these limitations, we introduce GrAInS, an inference-time steering approach that operates across both language-only and vision-language models and tasks. GrAInS uses contrastive, gradient-based attribution via Integrated Gradients to identify the top-k most influential tokens, both positively and negatively attributed based on their contribution to preferred versus dispreferred outputs. These tokens are then used to construct directional steering vectors that capture semantic shifts from undesirable to desirable behavior. During inference, GrAInS adjusts hidden activations at transformer layers guided by token-level attribution signals, and normalizes activations to preserve representational scale. This enables fine-grained, interpretable, and modular control over model behavior, without retraining or auxiliary supervision. Empirically, GrAInS consistently outperforms both fine-tuning and existing steering baselines: it achieves a 13.22% accuracy gain on TruthfulQA using Llama-3.1-8B, reduces hallucination rates on MMHal-Bench from 0.624 to 0.514 with LLaVA-1.6-7B, and improves alignment win rates on SPA-VL by 8.11%, all while preserving the model's fluency and general capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages.

Existing lane detection algorithms generally perform well under favorable weather conditions. However, their performance degrades significantly in adverse conditions, such as fog, which increases the risk of traffic accidents. This challenge is compounded by the lack of specialized datasets and methods designed for foggy environments. To address this, we introduce the FoggyLane dataset, captured in real-world foggy scenarios, and synthesize two additional datasets, FoggyCULane and FoggyTusimple, from existing popular lane detection datasets. Furthermore, we propose a robust Fog-Enhanced Network for lane detection, incorporating a Global Feature Fusion Module (GFFM) to capture global relationships in foggy images, a Kernel Feature Fusion Module (KFFM) to model the structural and positional relationships of lane instances, and a Low-level Edge Enhanced Module (LEEM) to address missing edge details in foggy conditions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, with F1-scores of 95.04 on FoggyLane, 79.85 on FoggyCULane, and 96.95 on FoggyTusimple. Additionally, with TensorRT acceleration, the method reaches a processing speed of 38.4 FPS on the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin, confirming its real-time capabilities and robustness in foggy environments.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose TimelyHLS, a novel framework integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to automatically generate and iteratively refine HLS code optimized for FPGA-specific timing and performance requirements. TimelyHLS is driven by a structured architectural knowledge base containing FPGA-specific features, synthesis directives, and pragma templates. Given a kernel, TimelyHLS generates HLS code annotated with both timing-critical and design-specific pragmas. The synthesized RTL is then evaluated using commercial toolchains, and simulation correctness is verified against reference outputs via custom testbenches. TimelyHLS iteratively incorporates synthesis logs and performance reports into the LLM engine for refinement in the presence of functional discrepancies. Experimental results across 10 FPGA architectures and diverse benchmarks show that TimelyHLS reduces the need for manual tuning by up to 70%, while achieving up to 4x latency speedup (e.g., 3.85x for Matrix Multiplication, 3.7x for Bitonic Sort) and over 50% area savings in certain cases (e.g., 57% FF reduction in Viterbi). TimelyHLS consistently achieves timing closure and functional correctness across platforms, highlighting the effectiveness of LLM-driven, architecture-aware synthesis in automating FPGA design.</p></details> |  |

We show that the time and space scaling of NMC is equivalent to that of a theoretically infinite processor conventional system, however the energy scaling is significantly different. Specifically, the energy of conventional systems scales with absolute algorithm work, whereas the energy of neuromorphic systems scales with the derivative of algorithm state. The unique characteristics of NMC architectures make it well suited for different classes of algorithms than conventional multi-core systems like GPUs that have been optimized for dense numerical applications such as linear algebra.

| **[Enhancing Generalization of Spiking Neural Networks Through Temporal Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19256v3)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have received widespread attention due to their event-driven and low-power characteristics, making them particularly effective for processing event-based neuromorphic data. Recent studies have shown that directly trained SNNs suffer from severe overfitting issues due to the limited scale of neuromorphic datasets and the gradient mismatching problem, which fundamentally constrain their generalization performance. In this paper, we propose a temporal regularization training (TRT) method by introducing a time-dependent regularization mechanism to enforce stronger constraints on early timesteps. We compare the performance of TRT with other state-of-the-art methods performance on datasets including CIFAR10/100, ImageNet100, DVS-CIFAR10, and N-Caltech101. To validate the effectiveness of TRT, we conducted ablation studies and analyses including loss landscape visualization and learning curve analysis, demonstrating that TRT can effectively mitigate overfitting and flatten the training loss landscape, thereby enhancing generalizability. Furthermore, we establish a theoretical interpretation of TRT's temporal regularization mechanism based on the results of Fisher information analysis. We analyze the temporal information dynamics inside SNNs by tracking Fisher information during the TRT training process, revealing the Temporal Information Concentration (TIC) phenomenon, where Fisher information progressively concentrates in early timesteps. The time-decaying regularization mechanism implemented in TRT effectively guides the network to learn robust features in early timesteps with rich information, thereby leading to significant improvements in model generalization.

| **[Cross Spatial Temporal Fusion Attention for Remote Sensing Object Detection via Image Feature Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19118v1)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effectively describing features for cross-modal remote sensing image matching remains a challenging task due to the significant geometric and radiometric differences between multimodal images. Existing methods primarily extract features at the fully connected layer but often fail to capture cross-modal similarities effectively. We propose a Cross Spatial Temporal Fusion (CSTF) mechanism that enhances feature representation by integrating scale-invariant keypoints detected independently in both reference and query images. Our approach improves feature matching in two ways: First, by creating correspondence maps that leverage information from multiple image regions simultaneously, and second, by reformulating the similarity matching process as a classification task using SoftMax and Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) layers. This dual approach enables CSTF to maintain sensitivity to distinctive local features while incorporating broader contextual information, resulting in robust matching across diverse remote sensing modalities. To demonstrate the practical utility of improved feature matching, we evaluate CSTF on object detection tasks using the HRSC2016 and DOTA benchmark datasets. Our method achieves state-of-theart performance with an average mAP of 90.99% on HRSC2016 and 90.86% on DOTA, outperforming existing models. The CSTF model maintains computational efficiency with an inference speed of 12.5 FPS. These results validate that our approach to crossmodal feature matching directly enhances downstream remote sensing applications such as object detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fine-Grained Traffic Inference from Road to Lane via Spatio-Temporal Graph Node Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19089v1)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-grained traffic management and prediction are fundamental to key applications such as autonomous driving, lane change guidance, and traffic signal control. However, obtaining lane-level traffic data has become a critical bottleneck for data-driven models due to limitations in the types and number of sensors and issues with the accuracy of tracking algorithms. To address this, we propose the Fine-grained Road Traffic Inference (FRTI) task, which aims to generate more detailed lane-level traffic information using limited road data, providing a more energy-efficient and cost-effective solution for precise traffic management. This task is abstracted as the first scene of the spatio-temporal graph node generation problem. We designed a two-stage framework--RoadDiff--to solve the FRTI task. solve the FRTI task. This framework leverages the Road-Lane Correlation Autoencoder-Decoder and the Lane Diffusion Module to fully utilize the limited spatio-temporal dependencies and distribution relationships of road data to accurately infer fine-grained lane traffic states. Based on existing research, we designed several baseline models with the potential to solve the FRTI task and conducted extensive experiments on six datasets representing different road conditions to validate the effectiveness of the RoadDiff model in addressing the FRTI task. The relevant datasets and code are available at https://github.com/ShuhaoLii/RoadDiff.</p></details> |  |

The method consists of two phases: $(i)$ learning spatio-temporal motion primitives to encapsulate the inherent robot-specific constraints and $(ii)$ constructing an STL-compliant motion plan from these primitives. Initially, we employ reinforcement learning to construct a library of control policies that perform trajectories described by the motion primitives. Then, we map motion primitives to spatio-temporal characteristics. Subsequently, we present a sampling-based STL-compliant motion planning strategy tailored to meet the STL specification. The proposed model-free approach, which generates feasible STL-compliant motion plans across various environments, is validated on differential-drive and quadruped robots across various STL specifications.

| **[Towards Improving Long-Tail Entity Predictions in Temporal Knowledge Graphs through Global Similarity and Weighted Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18977v1)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG) completion models traditionally assume access to the entire graph during training. This overlooks challenges stemming from the evolving nature of TKGs, such as: (i) the model's requirement to generalize and assimilate new knowledge, and (ii) the task of managing new or unseen entities that often have sparse connections. In this paper, we present an incremental training framework specifically designed for TKGs, aiming to address entities that are either not observed during training or have sparse connections. Our approach combines a model-agnostic enhancement layer with a weighted sampling strategy, that can be augmented to and improve any existing TKG completion method. The enhancement layer leverages a broader, global definition of entity similarity, which moves beyond mere local neighborhood proximity of GNN-based methods. The weighted sampling strategy employed in training accentuates edges linked to infrequently occurring entities. We evaluate our method on two benchmark datasets, and demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing methods in total link prediction, inductive link prediction, and in addressing long-tail entities. Notably, our method achieves a 10\% improvement and a 15\% boost in MRR for these datasets. The results underscore the potential of our approach in mitigating catastrophic forgetting and enhancing the robustness of TKG completion methods, especially in an incremental training context</p></details> |  |

By virtue of using structured temporal kernels and event-based data, we have the freedom to vary the sample rate of the data along with the discretization step-size of the network without additional finetuning. We experimented with three event-based benchmarks and obtained state-of-the-art results on all three by large margins with significantly smaller memory and compute costs.

| **[Bridging Sequential Deep Operator Network and Video Diffusion: Residual Refinement of Spatio-Temporal PDE Solutions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06133v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video-diffusion models have recently set the standard in video generation, inpainting, and domain translation thanks to their training stability and high perceptual fidelity. Building on these strengths, we repurpose conditional video diffusion as a physics surrogate for spatio-temporal fields governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). Our two-stage surrogate first applies a Sequential Deep Operator Network (S-DeepONet) to produce a coarse, physics-consistent prior from the prescribed boundary or loading conditions. The prior is then passed to a conditional video diffusion model that learns only the residual: the point-wise difference between the ground truth and the S-DeepONet prediction. By shifting the learning burden from the full solution to its much smaller residual space, diffusion can focus on sharpening high-frequency structures without sacrificing global coherence. The framework is assessed on two disparate benchmarks: (i) vortex-dominated lid-driven cavity flow and (ii) tensile plastic deformation of dogbone specimens. Across these data sets the hybrid surrogate consistently outperforms its single-stage counterpart, cutting the mean relative L2 error from 4.57% to 0.83% for the flow problem and from 4.42% to 2.94% for plasticity, a relative improvements of 81.8% and 33.5% respectively. The hybrid approach not only lowers quantitative errors but also improves visual quality, visibly recovering fine spatial details. These results show that (i) conditioning diffusion on a physics-aware prior enables faithful reconstruction of localized features, (ii) residual learning reduces the problem, accelerating convergence and enhancing accuracy, and (iii) the same architecture transfers seamlessly from incompressible flow to nonlinear elasto-plasticity without problem-specific architectural modifications, highlighting its broad applicability to nonlinear, time-dependent continua.</p></details> |  |
| **[IntentVCNet: Bridging Spatio-Temporal Gaps for Intention-Oriented Controllable Video Captioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18531v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intent-oriented controlled video captioning aims to generate targeted descriptions for specific targets in a video based on customized user intent. Current Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) have gained strong instruction following and visual comprehension capabilities. Although the LVLMs demonstrated proficiency in spatial and temporal understanding respectively, it was not able to perform fine-grained spatial control in time sequences in direct response to instructions. This substantial spatio-temporal gap complicates efforts to achieve fine-grained intention-oriented control in video. Towards this end, we propose a novel IntentVCNet that unifies the temporal and spatial understanding knowledge inherent in LVLMs to bridge the spatio-temporal gap from both prompting and model perspectives. Specifically, we first propose a prompt combination strategy designed to enable LLM to model the implicit relationship between prompts that characterize user intent and video sequences. We then propose a parameter efficient box adapter that augments the object semantic information in the global visual context so that the visual token has a priori information about the user intent. The final experiment proves that the combination of the two strategies can further enhance the LVLM's ability to model spatial details in video sequences, and facilitate the LVLMs to accurately generate controlled intent-oriented captions. Our proposed method achieved state-of-the-art results in several open source LVLMs and was the runner-up in the IntentVC challenge.

| **[PLOT-TAL: Prompt Learning with Optimal Transport for Few-Shot Temporal Action Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18915v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-shot temporal action localization (TAL) methods that adapt large models via single-prompt tuning often fail to produce precise temporal boundaries. This stems from the model learning a non-discriminative mean representation of an action from sparse data, which compromises generalization. We address this by proposing a new paradigm based on multi-prompt ensembles, where a set of diverse, learnable prompts for each action is encouraged to specialize on compositional sub-events. To enforce this specialization, we introduce PLOT-TAL, a framework that leverages Optimal Transport (OT) to find a globally optimal alignment between the prompt ensemble and the video's temporal features. Our method establishes a new state-of-the-art on the challenging few-shot benchmarks of THUMOS'14 and EPIC-Kitchens, without requiring complex meta-learning. The significant performance gains, particularly at high IoU thresholds, validate our hypothesis and demonstrate the superiority of learning distributed, compositional representations for precise temporal localization.</p></details> | Accepted to ICCVWS |
| **[Dynamic mapping from static labels: remote sensing dynamic sample generation with temporal-spectral embedding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02574v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate remote sensing geographic mapping requires timely and representative samples. However, rapid land surface changes often render static samples obsolete within months, making manual sample updates labor-intensive and unsustainable. To address this challenge, we propose TasGen, a two-stage Temporal spectral-aware Automatic Sample Generation method for generating dynamic training samples from single-date static labels without human intervention. Land surface dynamics often manifest as anomalies in temporal-spectral sequences. %These anomalies are multivariate yet unified: temporal, spectral, or joint anomalies stem from different mechanisms and cannot be naively coupled, as this may obscure the nature of changes. Yet, any land surface state corresponds to a coherent temporal-spectral signature, which would be lost if the two dimensions are modeled separately. To effectively capture these dynamics, TasGen first disentangles temporal and spectral features to isolate their individual contributions, and then couples them to model their synergistic interactions. In the first stage, we introduce a hierarchical temporal-spectral variational autoencoder (HTS-VAE) with a dual-dimension embedding to learn low-dimensional latent patterns of normal samples by first disentangling and then jointly embedding temporal and spectral information. This temporal-spectral embedding enables robust anomaly detection by identifying deviations from learned joint patterns. In the second stage, a classifier trained on stable samples relabels change points across time to generate dynamic samples. To not only detect but also explain surface dynamics, we further propose an anomaly interpretation method based on Gibbs sampling, which attributes changes to specific spectral-temporal dimensions.</p></details> |  |
| **[INLA-RF: A Hybrid Modeling Strategy for Spatio-Temporal Environmental Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18488v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Environmental processes often exhibit complex, non-linear patterns and discontinuities across space and time, posing significant challenges for traditional geostatistical modeling approaches. In this paper, we propose a hybrid spatio-temporal modeling framework that combines the interpretability and uncertainty quantification of Bayesian models -- estimated using the INLA-SPDE approach -- with the predictive power and flexibility of Random Forest (RF). Specifically, we introduce two novel algorithms, collectively named INLA-RF, which integrate a statistical spatio-temporal model with RF in an iterative two-stage framework. The first algorithm (INLA-RF1) incorporates RF predictions as an offset in the INLA-SPDE model, while the second (INLA-RF2) uses RF to directly correct selected latent field nodes. Both hybrid strategies enable uncertainty propagation between modeling stages, an aspect often overlooked in existing hybrid approaches. In addition, we propose a Kullback-Leibler divergence-based stopping criterion. We evaluate the predictive performance and uncertainty quantification capabilities of the proposed algorithms through two simulation studies. Results suggest that our hybrid approach enhances spatio-temporal prediction while maintaining interpretability and coherence in uncertainty estimates.</p></details> |  |

In particular, we guide the imitation learning procedures by transferring motions from source to target, effectively bridging the morphological disparities while ensuring the physical feasibility of the target system. In the first stage, we focus on motion retargeting at the kinematic level by generating kinematically feasible whole-body motions from keypoint trajectories. Following this, we refine the motion at the dynamic level by adjusting it in the temporal domain while adhering to physical constraints. This process facilitates policy training via reinforcement learning, enabling precise and robust motion tracking. We demonstrate that our approach successfully transforms noisy motion sources, such as hand-held camera videos, into robot-specific motions that align with the morphology and physical properties of the target robots. Moreover, we demonstrate terrain-aware motion retargeting to perform BackFlip on top of a box. We successfully deployed these skills to four robots with different dimensions and physical properties in the real world through hardware experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 12 figures, videos available at https://taerimyoon.me/Spatio-Temporal-Motion-Retargeting-for-Quadruped-Robots/</p></details> |

Automatically transforming NL into STL is an attractive approach to overcome the limitations of manual transformation, which is time-consuming and error-prone. However, due to the lack of datasets, automatic transformation currently faces significant challenges and has not been fully explored. In this paper, we propose an NL-STL dataset named STL-Diversity-Enhanced (STL-DivEn), which comprises 16,000 samples enriched with diverse patterns. To develop the dataset, we first manually create a small-scale seed set of NL-STL pairs. Next, representative examples are identified through clustering and used to guide large language models (LLMs) in generating additional NL-STL pairs. Finally, diversity and accuracy are ensured through rigorous rule-based filters and human validation. Furthermore, we introduce the Knowledge-Guided STL Transformation (KGST) framework, a novel approach for transforming natural language into STL, involving a generate-then-refine process based on external knowledge. Statistical analysis shows that the STL-DivEn dataset exhibits more diversity than the existing NL-STL dataset. Moreover, both metric-based and human evaluations indicate that our KGST approach outperforms baseline models in transformation accuracy on STL-DivEn and DeepSTL datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures, published to ACL 2025</p></details> |

While existing methods for learning with noisy labels (LNL) have made considerable progress, they fundamentally suffer from static snapshot evaluations and fail to leverage the rich temporal dynamics of learning evolution. In this paper, we propose ChronoSelect (chrono denoting its temporal nature), a novel framework featuring an innovative four-stage memory architecture that compresses prediction history into compact temporal distributions. Our unique sliding update mechanism with controlled decay maintains only four dynamic memory units per sample, progressively emphasizing recent patterns while retaining essential historical knowledge. This enables precise three-way sample partitioning into clean, boundary, and noisy subsets through temporal trajectory analysis and dual-branch consistency.

| **[Learning Temporal Abstractions via Variational Homomorphisms in Option-Induced Abstract MDPs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16473v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable reasoning ability through explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, but generating these step-by-step textual explanations is computationally expensive and slow. To overcome this, we aim to develop a framework for efficient, implicit reasoning, where the model "thinks" in a latent space without generating explicit text for every step. We propose that these latent thoughts can be modeled as temporally-extended abstract actions, or options, within a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework. To effectively learn a diverse library of options as latent embeddings, we first introduce the Variational Markovian Option Critic (VMOC), an off-policy algorithm that uses variational inference within the HiT-MDP framework. To provide a rigorous foundation for using these options as an abstract reasoning space, we extend the theory of continuous MDP homomorphisms. This proves that learning a policy in the simplified, abstract latent space, for which VMOC is suited, preserves the optimality of the solution to the original, complex problem. Finally, we propose a cold-start procedure that leverages supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data to distill human reasoning demonstrations into this latent option space, providing a rich initialization for the model's reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves strong performance on complex logical reasoning benchmarks and challenging locomotion tasks, validating our framework as a principled method for learning abstract skills for both language and control.</p></details> |  |

Despite recent progress with large vision-language models (LVLMs) and instruction-tuning, existing approaches often suffer from limited temporal awareness and poor generalization. In this work, we introduce a two-stage training framework that integrates supervised fine-tuning with reinforcement learning (RL) to improve both the accuracy and robustness of VTG models. Our approach first leverages high-quality curated cold start data for SFT initialization, followed by difficulty-controlled RL to further enhance temporal localization and reasoning abilities. Comprehensive experiments on multiple VTG benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing models, particularly in challenging and open-domain scenarios. We conduct an in-depth analysis of training strategies and dataset curation, highlighting the importance of both high-quality cold start data and difficulty-controlled RL. To facilitate further research and industrial adoption, we release all intermediate datasets, models, and code to the community.</p></details> |  |

The generation part of the recipe outputs audios from the input dataset with several critical characteristics, such as longer duration, noisy conditions, and containing multiple speakers, in a controllable fashion. The corresponding detection and localization protocol uses models. We conduct experiments based on self-supervised learning front-end and simple back-end. The results indicate that models trained using data generated with LENS-DF consistently outperform those trained via conventional recipes, demonstrating the effectiveness and usefulness of LENS-DF for robust audio deepfake detection and localization.

| **[Approximating temporal modularity on graphs of small underlying treewidth](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17541v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modularity is a very widely used measure of the level of clustering or community structure in networks. Here we consider a recent generalisation of the definition of modularity to temporal graphs, whose edge-sets change over discrete timesteps; such graphs offer a more realistic model of many real-world networks in which connections between entities (for example, between individuals in a social network) evolve over time. Computing modularity is notoriously difficult: it is NP-hard even to approximate in general, and only admits efficient exact algorithms in very restricted special cases. Our main result is that a multiplicative approximation to temporal modularity can be computed efficiently when the underlying graph has small treewidth. This generalises a similar approximation algorithm for the static case, but requires some substantially new ideas to overcome technical challenges associated with the temporal nature of the problem.</p></details> |  |
| **[STQE: Spatial-Temporal Quality Enhancement for G-PCC Compressed Dynamic Point Clouds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17522v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Very few studies have addressed quality enhancement for compressed dynamic point clouds. In particular, the effective exploitation of spatial-temporal correlations between point cloud frames remains largely unexplored. Addressing this gap, we propose a spatial-temporal attribute quality enhancement (STQE) network that exploits both spatial and temporal correlations to improve the visual quality of G-PCC compressed dynamic point clouds. Our contributions include a recoloring-based motion compensation module that remaps reference attribute information to the current frame geometry to achieve precise inter-frame geometric alignment, a channel-aware temporal attention module that dynamically highlights relevant regions across bidirectional reference frames, a Gaussian-guided neighborhood feature aggregation module that efficiently captures spatial dependencies between geometry and color attributes, and a joint loss function based on the Pearson correlation coefficient, designed to alleviate over-smoothing effects typical of point-wise mean squared error optimization. When applied to the latest G-PCC test model, STQE achieved improvements of 0.855 dB, 0.682 dB, and 0.828 dB in delta PSNR, with Bj{\o}ntegaard Delta rate (BD-rate) reductions of -25.2%, -31.6%, and -32.5% for the Luma, Cb, and Cr components, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[LSDM: LLM-Enhanced Spatio-temporal Diffusion Model for Service-Level Mobile Traffic Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17795v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Service-level mobile traffic prediction for individual users is essential for network efficiency and quality of service enhancement. However, current prediction methods are limited in their adaptability across different urban environments and produce inaccurate results due to the high uncertainty in personal traffic patterns, the lack of detailed environmental context, and the complex dependencies among different network services. These challenges demand advanced modeling techniques that can capture dynamic traffic distributions and rich environmental features. Inspired by the recent success of diffusion models in distribution modeling and Large Language Models (LLMs) in contextual understanding, we propose an LLM-Enhanced Spatio-temporal Diffusion Model (LSDM). LSDM integrates the generative power of diffusion models with the adaptive learning capabilities of transformers, augmented by the ability to capture multimodal environmental information for modeling service-level patterns and dynamics. Extensive evaluations on real-world service-level datasets demonstrate that the model excels in traffic usage predictions, showing outstanding generalization and adaptability. After incorporating contextual information via LLM, the performance improves by at least 2.83% in terms of the coefficient of determination. Compared to models of a similar type, such as CSDI, the root mean squared error can be reduced by at least 8.29%. The code and dataset will be available at: https://github.com/SoftYuaneR/LSDM.</p></details> | 14 pages, 9 figures |
| **[LTLZinc: a Benchmarking Framework for Continual Learning and Neuro-Symbolic Temporal Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17482v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence aims to combine neural architectures with symbolic approaches that can represent knowledge in a human-interpretable formalism. Continual learning concerns with agents that expand their knowledge over time, improving their skills while avoiding to forget previously learned concepts. Most of the existing approaches for neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence are applied to static scenarios only, and the challenging setting where reasoning along the temporal dimension is necessary has been seldom explored. In this work we introduce LTLZinc, a benchmarking framework that can be used to generate datasets covering a variety of different problems, against which neuro-symbolic and continual learning methods can be evaluated along the temporal and constraint-driven dimensions. Our framework generates expressive temporal reasoning and continual learning tasks from a linear temporal logic specification over MiniZinc constraints, and arbitrary image classification datasets. Fine-grained annotations allow multiple neural and neuro-symbolic training settings on the same generated datasets. Experiments on six neuro-symbolic sequence classification and four class-continual learning tasks generated by LTLZinc, demonstrate the challenging nature of temporal learning and reasoning, and highlight limitations of current state-of-the-art methods. We release the LTLZinc generator and ten ready-to-use tasks to the neuro-symbolic and continual learning communities, in the hope of fostering research towards unified temporal learning and reasoning frameworks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Smoothness-Aware Rate-Distortion Optimized 4D Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17336v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) effectively extends the high-speed rendering capabilities of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to represent volumetric videos. However, the large number of Gaussians, substantial temporal redundancies, and especially the absence of an entropy-aware compression framework result in large storage requirements. Consequently, this poses significant challenges for practical deployment, efficient edge-device processing, and data transmission. In this paper, we introduce a novel end-to-end RD-optimized compression framework tailored for 4DGS, aiming to enable flexible, high-fidelity rendering across varied computational platforms. Leveraging Fully Explicit Dynamic Gaussian Splatting (Ex4DGS), one of the state-of-the-art 4DGS methods, as our baseline, we start from the existing 3DGS compression methods for compatibility while effectively addressing additional challenges introduced by the temporal axis. In particular, instead of storing motion trajectories independently per point, we employ a wavelet transform to reflect the real-world smoothness prior, significantly enhancing storage efficiency. This approach yields significantly improved compression ratios and provides a user-controlled balance between compression efficiency and rendering quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving up to 91x compression compared to the original Ex4DGS model while maintaining high visual fidelity. These results highlight the applicability of our framework for real-time dynamic scene rendering in diverse scenarios, from resource-constrained edge devices to high-performance environments.</p></details> | 21 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Temporal Point-Supervised Signal Reconstruction: A Human-Annotation-Free Framework for Weak Moving Target Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17334v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In low-altitude surveillance and early warning systems, detecting weak moving targets remains a significant challenge due to low signal energy, small spatial extent, and complex background clutter. Existing methods struggle with extracting robust features and suffer from the lack of reliable annotations. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Temporal Point-Supervised (TPS) framework that enables high-performance detection of weak targets without any manual annotations.Instead of conventional frame-based detection, our framework reformulates the task as a pixel-wise temporal signal modeling problem, where weak targets manifest as short-duration pulse-like responses. A Temporal Signal Reconstruction Network (TSRNet) is developed under the TPS paradigm to reconstruct these transient signals.TSRNet adopts an encoder-decoder architecture and integrates a Dynamic Multi-Scale Attention (DMSAttention) module to enhance its sensitivity to diverse temporal patterns. Additionally, a graph-based trajectory mining strategy is employed to suppress false alarms and ensure temporal consistency.Extensive experiments on a purpose-built low-SNR dataset demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods while requiring no human annotations. It achieves strong detection performance and operates at over 1000 FPS, underscoring its potential for real-time deployment in practical scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Conflict Detection for Temporal Knowledge Graphs:A Fast Constraint Mining Algorithm and New Benchmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11053v2)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal facts, which are used to describe events that occur during specific time periods, have become a topic of increased interest in the field of knowledge graph (KG) research. In terms of quality management, the introduction of time restrictions brings new challenges to maintaining the temporal consistency of KGs. Previous studies rely on manually enumerated temporal constraints to detect conflicts, which are labor-intensive and may have granularity issues. To address this problem, we start from the common pattern of temporal facts and propose a pattern-based temporal constraint mining method, PaTeCon. Unlike previous studies, PaTeCon uses graph patterns and statistical information relevant to the given KG to automatically generate temporal constraints, without the need for human experts. In this paper, we illustrate how this method can be optimized to achieve significant speed improvement. We also annotate Wikidata and Freebase to build two new benchmarks for conflict detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our pattern-based automatic constraint mining approach is highly effective in generating valuable temporal constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Spatio-Temporal Machine Learning Model for Mortgage Credit Risk: Default Probabilities and Loan Portfolios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02846v2)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel machine learning model for credit risk by combining tree-boosting with a latent spatio-temporal Gaussian process model accounting for frailty correlation. This allows for modeling non-linearities and interactions among predictor variables in a flexible data-driven manner and for accounting for spatio-temporal variation that is not explained by observable predictor variables. We also show how estimation and prediction can be done in a computationally efficient manner. In an application to a large U.S. mortgage credit risk data set, we find that both predictive default probabilities for individual loans and predictive loan portfolio loss distributions obtained with our novel approach are more accurate compared to conventional independent linear hazard models and also linear spatio-temporal models. Using interpretability tools for machine learning models, we find that the likely reasons for this outperformance are strong interaction and non-linear effects in the predictor variables and the presence of spatio-temporal frailty effects.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Temporal Guidance and Iterative Refinement in Audio Source Separation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17297v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial semantic segmentation of sound scenes (S5) involves the accurate identification of active sound classes and the precise separation of their sources from complex acoustic mixtures. Conventional systems rely on a two-stage pipeline - audio tagging followed by label-conditioned source separation - but are often constrained by the absence of fine-grained temporal information critical for effective separation. In this work, we address this limitation by introducing a novel approach for S5 that enhances the synergy between the event detection and source separation stages. Our key contributions are threefold. First, we fine-tune a pre-trained Transformer to detect active sound classes. Second, we utilize a separate instance of this fine-tuned Transformer to perform sound event detection (SED), providing the separation module with detailed, time-varying guidance. Third, we implement an iterative refinement mechanism that progressively enhances separation quality by recursively reusing the separator's output from previous iterations. These advancements lead to significant improvements in both audio tagging and source separation performance, as demonstrated by our system's second-place finish in Task 4 of the DCASE Challenge 2025. Our implementation and model checkpoints are available in our GitHub repository: https://github.com/theMoro/dcase25task4 .</p></details> |  |
| **[Triadic First-Order Logic Queries in Temporal Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17215v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motif counting is a fundamental problem in network analysis, and there is a rich literature of theoretical and applied algorithms for this problem. Given a large input network $G$, a motif $H$ is a small "pattern" graph indicative of special local structure. Motif/pattern mining involves finding all matches of this pattern in the input $G$. The simplest, yet challenging, case of motif counting is when $H$ has three vertices, often called a "triadic" query. Recent work has focused on "temporal graph mining", where the network $G$ has edges with timestamps (and directions) and $H$ has time constraints. Inspired by concepts in logic and database theory, we introduce the study of "thresholded First Order Logic (FOL) Motif Analysis" for massive temporal networks. A typical triadic motif query asks for the existence of three vertices that form a desired temporal pattern. An "FOL" motif query is obtained by having both existential and thresholded universal quantifiers. This allows for query semantics that can mine richer information from networks. A typical triadic query would be "find all triples of vertices $u,v,w$ such that they form a triangle within one hour". A thresholded FOL query can express "find all pairs $u,v$ such that for half of $w$ where $(u,w)$ formed an edge, $(v,w)$ also formed an edge within an hour". We design the first algorithm, FOLTY, for mining thresholded FOL triadic queries. The theoretical running time of FOLTY matches the best known running time for temporal triangle counting in sparse graphs. We give an efficient implementation of FOLTY using specialized temporal data structures. FOLTY has excellent empirical behavior, and can answer triadic FOL queries on graphs with nearly 70M edges is less than hour on commodity hardware. Our work has the potential to start a new research direction in the classic well-studied problem of motif analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamics of temporal influence in polarised networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17177v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In social networks, it is often of interest to identify the most influential users who can successfully spread information to others. This is particularly important for marketing (e.g., targeting influencers for a marketing campaign) and to understand the dynamics of information diffusion (e.g., who is the most central user in the spreading of a certain type of information). However, different opinions often split the audience and make the network polarised. In polarised networks, information becomes soiled within communities in the network, and the most influential user within a network might not be the most influential across all communities. Additionally, influential users and their influence may change over time as users may change their opinion or choose to decrease or halt their engagement on the subject. In this work, we aim to study the temporal dynamics of users' influence in a polarised social network. We compare the stability of influence ranking using temporal centrality measures, while extending them to account for community structure across a number of network evolution behaviours. We show that we can successfully aggregate nodes into influence bands, and how to aggregate centrality scores to analyse the influence of communities over time. A modified version of the temporal independent cascade model and the temporal degree centrality perform the best in this setting, as they are able to reliably isolate nodes into their bands.</p></details> | 35 pages, 16 figures |
| **[Attention-Based Multiscale Temporal Fusion Network for Uncertain-Mode Fault Diagnosis in Multimode Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05172v3)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fault diagnosis in multimode processes plays a critical role in ensuring the safe operation of industrial systems across multiple modes. It faces a great challenge yet to be addressed - that is, the significant distributional differences among monitoring data from multiple modes make it difficult for the models to extract shared feature representations related to system health conditions. In response to this problem, this paper introduces a novel method called attention-based multiscale temporal fusion network. The multiscale depthwise convolution and gated recurrent unit are employed to extract multiscale contextual local features and long-short-term features. Instance normalization is applied to suppress mode-specific information. Furthermore, a temporal attention mechanism is designed to focus on critical time points with higher cross-mode shared information, thereby enhancing the accuracy of fault diagnosis. The proposed model is applied to Tennessee Eastman process dataset and three-phase flow facility dataset. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior diagnostic performance and maintains a small model size. The source code will be available on GitHub at https://github.com/GuangqiangLi/AMTFNet.</p></details> | 32 pages,11 figures |

While scene graphs are adept at capturing spatial relationships between objects in individual frames, extending these representations to capture dynamic interactions across video sequences remains a significant challenge. To address this, we present TCDSG, Temporally Consistent Dynamic Scene Graphs, an innovative end-to-end framework that detects, tracks, and links subject-object relationships across time, generating action tracklets, temporally consistent sequences of entities and their interactions. Our approach leverages a novel bipartite matching mechanism, enhanced by adaptive decoder queries and feedback loops, ensuring temporal coherence and robust tracking over extended sequences. This method not only establishes a new benchmark by achieving over 60% improvement in temporal recall@k on the Action Genome, OpenPVSG, and MEVA datasets but also pioneers the augmentation of MEVA with persistent object ID annotations for comprehensive tracklet generation. By seamlessly integrating spatial and temporal dynamics, our work sets a new standard in multi-frame video analysis, opening new avenues for high-impact applications in surveillance, autonomous navigation, and beyond.</p></details> |  |
| **[Influence Maximization in Temporal Networks with Persistent and Reactive Behaviors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20936v2)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Influence maximization in temporal social networks presents unique challenges due to the dynamic interactions that evolve over time. Traditional diffusion models often fall short in capturing the real-world complexities of active-inactive transitions among nodes, obscuring the true behavior of influence spread. In dynamic networks, nodes do not simply transition to an active state once; rather, they can oscillate between active and inactive states, with the potential for reactivation and reinforcement over time. This reactivation allows previously influenced nodes to regain influence potency, enhancing their ability to spread influence to others and amplifying the overall diffusion process. Ignoring these transitions can thus conceal the cumulative impact of influence, making it essential to account for them in any effective diffusion model. To address these challenges, we introduce the Continuous Persistent Susceptible-Infected Model with Reinforcement and Re-activation (cpSI-R), which explicitly incorporates active-inactive transitions, capturing the progressive reinforcement that makes nodes more potent spreaders upon reactivation. This model naturally leads to a submodular and monotone objective function, which supports efficient optimization for seed selection in influence maximization tasks. Alongside cpSI-R, we propose an efficient temporal snapshot sampling method, simplifying the analysis of evolving networks. We then adapt the prior algorithms of seed selection to our model and sampling strategy, resulting in reduced computational costs and enhanced seed selection efficiency. Experimental evaluations on diverse datasets demonstrate substantial improvements in performance over baseline methods, underscoring the effectiveness of cpSI-R for real-world temporal networks</p></details> |  |

However, despite extensive benchmarking efforts, it remains unclear whether current Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) effectively capture core temporal patterns such as periodicity, cause-and-effect, and long-range dependencies. In this work, we introduce the Temporal Graph Reasoning Benchmark (T-GRAB), a comprehensive set of synthetic tasks designed to systematically probe the capabilities of TGNNs to reason across time. T-GRAB provides controlled, interpretable tasks that isolate key temporal skills: counting/memorizing periodic repetitions, inferring delayed causal effects, and capturing long-range dependencies over both spatial and temporal dimensions. We evaluate 11 temporal graph learning methods on these tasks, revealing fundamental shortcomings in their ability to generalize temporal patterns. Our findings offer actionable insights into the limitations of current models, highlight challenges hidden by traditional real-world benchmarks, and motivate the development of architectures with stronger temporal reasoning abilities.

| **[Temporally-Constrained Video Reasoning Segmentation and Automated Benchmark Construction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16718v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional approaches to video segmentation are confined to predefined object categories and cannot identify out-of-vocabulary objects, let alone objects that are not identified explicitly but only referred to implicitly in complex text queries. This shortcoming limits the utility for video segmentation in complex and variable scenarios, where a closed set of object categories is difficult to define and where users may not know the exact object category that will appear in the video. Such scenarios can arise in operating room video analysis, where different health systems may use different workflows and instrumentation, requiring flexible solutions for video analysis. Reasoning segmentation (RS) now offers promise towards such a solution, enabling natural language text queries as interaction for identifying object to segment. However, existing video RS formulation assume that target objects remain contextually relevant throughout entire video sequences. This assumption is inadequate for real-world scenarios in which objects of interest appear, disappear or change relevance dynamically based on temporal context, such as surgical instruments that become relevant only during specific procedural phases or anatomical structures that gain importance at particular moments during surgery. Our first contribution is the introduction of temporally-constrained video reasoning segmentation, a novel task formulation that requires models to implicitly infer when target objects become contextually relevant based on text queries that incorporate temporal reasoning. Since manual annotation of temporally-constrained video RS datasets would be expensive and limit scalability, our second contribution is an innovative automated benchmark construction method. Finally, we present TCVideoRSBenchmark, a temporally-constrained video RS dataset containing 52 samples using the videos from the MVOR dataset.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods typically necessitate supervised learning based on human-refined masks in the ventricular myocardium, which become impractical without contrast agents. We introduce a self-supervised framework, namely Codebook-based Temporal-Spatial Learning (CTSL), that learns dynamic, spatiotemporal representations from raw Cine data without requiring segmentation masks. CTSL decouples temporal and spatial features through a multi-view distillation strategy, where the teacher model processes multiple Cine views, and the student model learns from reduced-dimensional Cine-SA sequences. By leveraging codebook-based feature representations and dynamic lesion self-detection through motion cues, CTSL captures intricate temporal dependencies and motion patterns. High-confidence MACE risk predictions are achieved through our model, providing a rapid, non-invasive solution for cardiac risk assessment that outperforms traditional contrast-dependent methods, thereby enabling timely and accessible heart disease diagnosis in clinical settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at MICCAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Multimodal Deviation Perceiving Framework for Weakly-Supervised Temporal Forgery Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16596v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current researches on Deepfake forensics often treat detection as a classification task or temporal forgery localization problem, which are usually restrictive, time-consuming, and challenging to scale for large datasets. To resolve these issues, we present a multimodal deviation perceiving framework for weakly-supervised temporal forgery localization (MDP), which aims to identify temporal partial forged segments using only video-level annotations. The MDP proposes a novel multimodal interaction mechanism (MI) and an extensible deviation perceiving loss to perceive multimodal deviation, which achieves the refined start and end timestamps localization of forged segments. Specifically, MI introduces a temporal property preserving cross-modal attention to measure the relevance between the visual and audio modalities in the probabilistic embedding space. It could identify the inter-modality deviation and construct comprehensive video features for temporal forgery localization. To explore further temporal deviation for weakly-supervised learning, an extensible deviation perceiving loss has been proposed, aiming at enlarging the deviation of adjacent segments of the forged samples and reducing that of genuine samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and achieve comparable results to fully-supervised approaches in several evaluation metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 3 figures,conference</p></details> |

We propose COMPASS, a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework that enables decentralized agents to persistently monitor multiple moving targets efficiently. We model the environment as a graph, where nodes represent spatial locations and edges capture topological proximity, allowing agents to reason over structured layouts and revisit informative regions as needed. Each agent independently selects actions based on a shared spatio-temporal attention network that we design to integrate historical observations and spatial context. We model target dynamics using Gaussian Processes (GPs), which support principled belief updates and enable uncertainty-aware planning. We train COMPASS using centralized value estimation and decentralized policy execution under an adaptive reward setting. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that COMPASS consistently outperforms strong baselines in uncertainty reduction, target coverage, and coordination efficiency across dynamic multi-target scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[GroundFlow: A Plug-in Module for Temporal Reasoning on 3D Point Cloud Sequential Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21188v2)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential grounding in 3D point clouds (SG3D) refers to locating sequences of objects by following text instructions for a daily activity with detailed steps. Current 3D visual grounding (3DVG) methods treat text instructions with multiple steps as a whole, without extracting useful temporal information from each step. However, the instructions in SG3D often contain pronouns such as "it", "here" and "the same" to make language expressions concise. This requires grounding methods to understand the context and retrieve relevant information from previous steps to correctly locate object sequences. Due to the lack of an effective module for collecting related historical information, state-of-the-art 3DVG methods face significant challenges in adapting to the SG3D task. To fill this gap, we propose GroundFlow -- a plug-in module for temporal reasoning on 3D point cloud sequential grounding. Firstly, we demonstrate that integrating GroundFlow improves the task accuracy of 3DVG baseline methods by a large margin (+7.5\% and +10.2\%) in the SG3D benchmark, even outperforming a 3D large language model pre-trained on various datasets. Furthermore, we selectively extract both short-term and long-term step information based on its relevance to the current instruction, enabling GroundFlow to take a comprehensive view of historical information and maintain its temporal understanding advantage as step counts increase. Overall, our work introduces temporal reasoning capabilities to existing 3DVG models and achieves state-of-the-art performance in the SG3D benchmark across five datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reducing GPU Memory Fragmentation via Spatio-Temporal Planning for Efficient Large-Scale Model Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16274v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid scaling of large language models (LLMs) has significantly increased GPU memory pressure, which is further aggravated by training optimization techniques such as virtual pipeline and recomputation that disrupt tensor lifespans and introduce considerable memory fragmentation. Default GPU memory allocators of popular deep learning frameworks like PyTorch use online strategies without knowledge of tensor lifespans, which can waste up to 43\% of memory and cause out-of-memory errors, rendering optimization techniques ineffective or even unusable. To address this, we introduce STWeaver, a GPU memory allocator for deep learning frameworks that reduces fragmentation by exploiting the spatial and temporal regularity in memory allocation behaviors of training workloads. STWeaver introduces a novel paradigm that combines offline planning with online allocation. The offline planning leverages spatio-temporal regularities to generate a near-optimal allocation plan, while the online allocation handles complex and dynamic models such as Mixture-of-Experts (MoE). Built as a pluggable PyTorch allocator, STWeaver reduces fragmentation ratio on average by 79.2\% (up to 100\%) across both dense and sparse models, with negligible overhead. This enables more efficient, high-throughput training configurations and improves performance by up to 32.5\%.</p></details> |  |

Prior efforts have been made on accurate prediction of bike traffics, i.e., demand/pick-up and return/drop-off, to achieve system efficiency. However, bike station-level traffic prediction is difficult because of the spatial-temporal complexity of bike sharing systems. Moreover, such level of prediction over entire bike sharing systems is also challenging due to the large number of bike stations. To fill this gap, we propose BikeMAN, a multi-level spatio-temporal attention neural network to predict station-level bike traffic for entire bike sharing systems. The proposed network consists of an encoder and a decoder with an attention mechanism representing the spatial correlation between features of bike stations in the system and another attention mechanism describing the temporal characteristic of bike station traffic. Through experimental study on over 10 millions trips of bike sharing systems (> 700 stations) of New York City, our network showed high accuracy in predicting the bike station traffic of all stations in the city.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, UrbComp 2024</p></details> |
| **[The Other Mind: How Language Models Exhibit Human Temporal Cognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15851v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to advance, they exhibit certain cognitive patterns similar to those of humans that are not directly specified in training data. This study investigates this phenomenon by focusing on temporal cognition in LLMs. Leveraging the similarity judgment task, we find that larger models spontaneously establish a subjective temporal reference point and adhere to the Weber-Fechner law, whereby the perceived distance logarithmically compresses as years recede from this reference point. To uncover the mechanisms behind this behavior, we conducted multiple analyses across neuronal, representational, and informational levels. We first identify a set of temporal-preferential neurons and find that this group exhibits minimal activation at the subjective reference point and implements a logarithmic coding scheme convergently found in biological systems. Probing representations of years reveals a hierarchical construction process, where years evolve from basic numerical values in shallow layers to abstract temporal orientation in deep layers. Finally, using pre-trained embedding models, we found that the training corpus itself possesses an inherent, non-linear temporal structure, which provides the raw material for the model's internal construction. In discussion, we propose an experientialist perspective for understanding these findings, where the LLMs' cognition is viewed as a subjective construction of the external world by its internal representational system. This nuanced perspective implies the potential emergence of alien cognitive frameworks that humans cannot intuitively predict, pointing toward a direction for AI alignment that focuses on guiding internal constructions.

| **[TSkips: Efficiency Through Explicit Temporal Delay Connections in Spiking Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16711v2)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) with their bio-inspired Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons inherently capture temporal information. This makes them well-suited for sequential tasks like processing event-based data from Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS) and event-based speech tasks. Harnessing the temporal capabilities of SNNs requires mitigating vanishing spikes during training, capturing spatio-temporal patterns and enhancing precise spike timing. To address these challenges, we propose TSkips, augmenting SNN architectures with forward and backward skip connections that incorporate explicit temporal delays. These connections capture long-term spatio-temporal dependencies and facilitate better spike flow over long sequences. The introduction of TSkips creates a vast search space of possible configurations, encompassing skip positions and time delay values. To efficiently navigate this search space, this work leverages training-free Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to identify optimal network structures and corresponding delays. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on four event-based datasets: DSEC-flow for optical flow estimation, DVS128 Gesture for hand gesture recognition and Spiking Heidelberg Digits (SHD) and Spiking Speech Commands (SSC) for speech recognition. Our method achieves significant improvements across these datasets: up to 18% reduction in Average Endpoint Error (AEE) on DSEC-flow, 8% increase in classification accuracy on DVS128 Gesture, and up to 8% and 16% higher classification accuracy on SHD and SSC, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[DaMO: A Data-Efficient Multimodal Orchestrator for Temporal Reasoning with Video LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11558v3)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been extended to the video domain, enabling sophisticated video-language understanding. However, existing Video LLMs often exhibit limitations in fine-grained temporal reasoning, restricting their ability to precisely attribute responses to specific video moments, especially under constrained supervision. We introduce DaMO, a data-efficient Video LLM explicitly designed for accurate temporal reasoning and multimodal understanding. At its core, the proposed Temporal-aware Fuseformer employs a hierarchical dual-stream architecture that progressively captures temporal dynamics within each modality and effectively fuses complementary visual and audio information. To further enhance computational efficiency, DaMO integrates a global residual that reduces spatial redundancy while preserving essential semantic details. We train DaMO via a structured four-stage progressive training paradigm, incrementally equipping the model with multimodal alignment, semantic grounding, and temporal reasoning capabilities. This work also contributes multiple datasets augmented from existing ones with LLM-generated temporally grounded QA pairs for tasks requiring temporal supervision. Comprehensive experiments on temporal grounding and video QA benchmarks demonstrate that DaMO consistently surpasses prior methods, particularly in tasks demanding precise temporal alignment and reasoning. Our work establishes a promising direction for data-efficient video-language modeling.</p></details> |  |

Current DIR implementations rely on discrete volumetric motion representation, which often leads to compromised accuracy and uncertainty when handling significant anatomical changes and sliding boundaries. This limitation affects the reliability of subsequent contour propagation and dose accumulation procedures, particularly in regions with complex anatomical interfaces such as the lung-chest wall boundary. Given that organ motion is inherently a continuous process in both space and time, we aimed to develop a model that preserves these fundamental properties. Drawing inspiration from fluid mechanics, we propose a novel approach using implicit neural representation (INR) for continuous modeling of patient anatomical motion. This approach ensures spatial and temporal continuity while effectively unifying Eulerian and Lagrangian specifications to enable natural continuous motion modeling and frame interpolation. The integration of these specifications provides a more comprehensive understanding of anatomical deformation patterns. By leveraging the continuous representations, the CPT-DIR method significantly enhances registration and interpolation accuracy, automation, and speed. The method demonstrates superior performance in landmark and contour precision, particularly in challenging anatomical regions, representing a substantial advancement over conventional approaches in deformable image registration. The improved efficiency and accuracy of CPT-DIR make it particularly suitable for real-time adaptive radiotherapy applications.</p></details> |  |

It can estimate spatially accurate and temporally consistent disparities without relying on auxiliary information such as camera poses or optical flow. The strong capability is driven by rich priors from monocular video depth models, which are integrated with convolutional features to produce stable representations. To further enhance performance, key architectural innovations are introduced: all-to-all-pairs correlation, which constructs smooth and robust matching cost volumes, and temporal convex upsampling, which improves temporal coherence. These components collectively ensure robustness, accuracy, and temporal consistency, setting a new standard in video stereo matching. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets both qualitatively and quantitatively in zero-shot settings, as well as strong generalization to real-world indoor and outdoor scenarios.</p></details> | ICCV2025 |

Temporal reasoning, a critical component of natural language understanding, has raised increasing research attention. However, comprehensive testing of Allen's interval relations (e.g., before, after, during) -- a fundamental framework for temporal relationships -- remains underexplored. To fill this gap, we present ChronoSense, a new benchmark for evaluating LLMs' temporal understanding. It includes 16 tasks, focusing on identifying the Allen relation between two temporal events and temporal arithmetic, using both abstract events and real-world data from Wikidata. We assess the performance of seven recent LLMs using this benchmark and the results indicate that models handle Allen relations, even symmetrical ones, quite differently. Moreover, the findings suggest that the models may rely on memorization to answer time-related questions. Overall, the models' low performance highlights the need for improved temporal understanding in LLMs and ChronoSense offers a robust framework for future research in this area. Our dataset and the source code are available at https://github.com/duyguislakoglu/chronosense.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2025.

| **[Temporal Basis Function Models for Closed-Loop Neural Stimulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15274v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Closed-loop neural stimulation provides novel therapies for neurological diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD), but it is not yet clear whether artificial intelligence (AI) techniques can tailor closed-loop stimulation to individual patients or identify new therapies. Progress requires us to address a number of translational issues, including sample efficiency, training time, and minimizing loop latency such that stimulation may be shaped in response to changing brain activity. We propose temporal basis function models (TBFMs) to address these difficulties, and explore this approach in the context of excitatory optogenetic stimulation. We demonstrate the ability of TBF models to provide a single-trial, spatiotemporal forward prediction of the effect of optogenetic stimulation on local field potentials (LFPs) measured in two non-human primates. We further use simulations to demonstrate the use of TBF models for closed-loop stimulation, driving neural activity towards target patterns. The simplicity of TBF models allow them to be sample efficient, rapid to train (2-4min), and low latency (0.2ms) on desktop CPUs. We demonstrate the model on 40 sessions of previously published excitatory optogenetic stimulation data. For each session, the model required 15-20min of data collection to successfully model the remainder of the session. It achieved a prediction accuracy comparable to a baseline nonlinear dynamical systems model that requires hours to train, and superior accuracy to a linear state-space model. In our simulations, it also successfully allowed a closed-loop stimulator to control a neural circuit. Our approach begins to bridge the translational gap between complex AI-based approaches to modeling dynamical systems and the vision of using such forward prediction models to develop novel, clinically useful closed-loop stimulation protocols.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Demand Prediction for Food Delivery Using Attention-Driven Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15246v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate demand forecasting is critical for enhancing the efficiency and responsiveness of food delivery platforms, where spatial heterogeneity and temporal fluctuations in order volumes directly influence operational decisions. This paper proposes an attention-based Graph Neural Network framework that captures spatial-temporal dependencies by modeling the food delivery environment as a graph. In this graph, nodes represent urban delivery zones, while edges reflect spatial proximity and inter-regional order flow patterns derived from historical data. The attention mechanism dynamically weighs the influence of neighboring zones, enabling the model to focus on the most contextually relevant areas during prediction. Temporal trends are jointly learned alongside spatial interactions, allowing the model to adapt to evolving demand patterns. Extensive experiments on real-world food delivery datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model in forecasting future order volumes with high accuracy. The framework offers a scalable and adaptive solution to support proactive fleet positioning, resource allocation, and dispatch optimization in urban food delivery operations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Video LLMs for Temporal Reasoning in Long Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02930v4)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces TemporalVLM, a video large language model (video LLM) capable of effective temporal reasoning and fine-grained understanding in long videos. At the core, our approach includes a visual encoder for mapping a long-term input video into features which are time-aware and contain both local and global cues. In particular, it first divides the input video into short-term clips, which are jointly encoded with their timestamps and fused across overlapping temporal windows into time-sensitive local features. Next, the local features are passed through a bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) module for global feature aggregation. The extracted time-aware and multi-level features are important for accurate temporal reasoning and fine-grained understanding in long videos. Moreover, to facilitate the evaluation of TemporalVLM, we present a large-scale long video dataset of industry assembly processes, namely IndustryASM, which consists of videos recorded on factory floors with actions and timestamps annotated by industrial engineers for time and motion studies and temporal action segmentation evaluation. Finally, extensive experiments on datasets of long videos, including TimeIT and IndustryASM, show that TemporalVLM achieves superior performance than previous methods across temporal reasoning and fine-grained understanding tasks, namely dense video captioning, temporal video grounding, video highlight detection, and temporal action segmentation. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to incorporate LSTMs into video LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Conformal Prediction (TCP): A Distribution-Free Statistical and Machine Learning Framework for Adaptive Risk Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05470v2)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose Temporal Conformal Prediction (TCP), a principled framework for constructing well-calibrated prediction intervals for non-stationary time series. TCP integrates a machine learning-based quantile forecaster with an online conformal calibration layer. This layer's thresholds are updated via a modified Robbins-Monro scheme, allowing the model to dynamically adapt to volatility clustering and regime shifts without rigid parametric assumptions. We benchmark TCP against GARCH, Historical Simulation, and static Quantile Regression across diverse financial assets. Our empirical results reveal a critical flaw in static methods: while sharp, Quantile Regression is poorly calibrated, systematically over-covering the nominal 95% target. In contrast, TCP's adaptive mechanism actively works to achieve the correct coverage level, successfully navigating the coverage-sharpness tradeoff. Visualizations during the 2020 market crash confirm TCP's superior adaptive response, and a comprehensive sensitivity analysis demonstrates the framework's robustness to hyperparameter choices. Overall, TCP offers a practical and theoretically-grounded solution to the central challenge of calibrated uncertainty quantification for time series under distribution shift, advancing the interface between statistical inference and machine learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Temporal Point Process Modeling of Aggressive Behavior Onset in Psychiatric Inpatient Youth with Autism for Branching Factor Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12424v2)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aggressive behavior in autistic inpatient youth often arises in temporally clustered bursts complicating efforts to distinguish external triggers from internal escalation. The sample population branching factor-the expected number of new onsets triggered by a given event-is a key summary of self-excitation in behavior dynamics. Prior pooled models overestimate this quantity by ignoring patient-specific variability. We addressed this using a hierarchical Hawkes process with an exponential kernel and edge-effect correction allowing partial pooling across patients. This approach reduces bias from high-frequency individuals and stabilizes estimates for those with sparse data. Bayesian inference was performed using the No U-Turn Sampler with model evaluation via convergence diagnostics, power-scaling sensitivity analysis, and multiple Goodness-of-Fit (GOF) metrics: PSIS-LOO the Lewis test with Durbin's modification and residual analysis based on the Random Time Change Theorem (RTCT). The hierarchical model yielded a significantly lower and more precise branching factor estimate mean (0.742 +- 0.026) than the pooled model (0.899 +- 0.015) and narrower intervals than the unpooled model (0.717 +- 0.139). This led to a threefold smaller cascade of events per onset under the hierarchical model. Sensitivity analyses confirmed robustness to prior and likelihood perturbations while the unpooled model showed instability for sparse individuals. GOF measures consistently favored or on par to the hierarchical model. Hierarchical Hawkes modeling with edge-effect correction provides robust estimation of branching dynamics by capturing both within- and between-patient variability. This enables clearer separation of endogenous from exogenous events supports linkage to physiological signals and enhances early warning systems individualized treatment and resource allocation in inpatient care.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to BMC Bioinformatics</p></details> |
| **[STL-GO: Spatio-Temporal Logic with Graph Operators for Distributed Systems with Multiple Network Topologies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15147v1)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent systems (MASs) consisting of a number of autonomous agents that communicate, coordinate, and jointly sense the environment to achieve complex missions can be found in a variety of applications such as robotics, smart cities, and internet-of-things applications. Modeling and monitoring MAS requirements to guarantee overall mission objectives, safety, and reliability is an important problem. Such requirements implicitly require reasoning about diverse sensing and communication modalities between agents, analysis of the dependencies between agent tasks, and the spatial or virtual distance between agents. To capture such rich MAS requirements, we model agent interactions via multiple directed graphs, and introduce a new logic -- Spatio-Temporal Logic with Graph Operators (STL-GO). The key innovation in STL-GO are graph operators that enable us to reason about the number of agents along either the incoming or outgoing edges of the underlying interaction graph that satisfy a given property of interest; for example, the requirement that an agent should sense at least two neighboring agents whose task graphs indicate the ability to collaborate. We then propose novel distributed monitoring conditions for individual agents that use only local information to determine whether or not an STL-GO specification is satisfied. We compare the expressivity of STL-GO against existing spatio-temporal logic formalisms, and demonstrate the utility of STL-GO and our distributed monitors in a bike-sharing and a multi-drone case study.</p></details> |  |
| **[Frame-level Temporal Difference Learning for Partial Deepfake Speech Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15101v1)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting partial deepfake speech is essential due to its potential for subtle misinformation. However, existing methods depend on costly frame-level annotations during training, limiting real-world scalability. Also, they focus on detecting transition artifacts between bonafide and deepfake segments. As deepfake generation techniques increasingly smooth these transitions, detection has become more challenging. To address this, our work introduces a new perspective by analyzing frame-level temporal differences and reveals that deepfake speech exhibits erratic directional changes and unnatural local transitions compared to bonafide speech. Based on this finding, we propose a Temporal Difference Attention Module (TDAM) that redefines partial deepfake detection as identifying unnatural temporal variations, without relying on explicit boundary annotations. A dual-level hierarchical difference representation captures temporal irregularities at both fine and coarse scales, while adaptive average pooling preserves essential patterns across variable-length inputs to minimize information loss. Our TDAM-AvgPool model achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an EER of 0.59% on the PartialSpoof dataset and 0.03% on the HAD dataset, which significantly outperforms the existing methods without requiring frame-level supervision.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 4 figures, 4 tables.

While large language models (LLMs) achieve unification through task-agnostic data and generation, existing visual generation models fail to meet these principles. Current approaches either rely on per-task datasets and large-scale training or adapt pre-trained image models with task-specific modifications, limiting their generalizability. In this work, we explore video models as a foundation for unified image generation, leveraging their inherent ability to model temporal correlations. We introduce RealGeneral, a novel framework that reformulates image generation as a conditional frame prediction task, analogous to in-context learning in LLMs. To bridge the gap between video models and condition-image pairs, we propose (1) a Unified Conditional Embedding module for multi-modal alignment and (2) a Unified Stream DiT Block with decoupled adaptive LayerNorm and attention mask to mitigate cross-modal interference. RealGeneral demonstrates effectiveness in multiple important visual generation tasks, e.g., it achieves a 14.5% improvement in subject similarity for customized generation and a 10% enhancement in image quality for canny-to-image task.

| **[TopoStreamer: Temporal Lane Segment Topology Reasoning in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00709v2)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lane segment topology reasoning constructs a comprehensive road network by capturing the topological relationships between lane segments and their semantic types. This enables end-to-end autonomous driving systems to perform road-dependent maneuvers such as turning and lane changing. However, the limitations in consistent positional embedding and temporal multiple attribute learning in existing methods hinder accurate roadnet reconstruction. To address these issues, we propose TopoStreamer, an end-to-end temporal perception model for lane segment topology reasoning. Specifically, TopoStreamer introduces three key improvements: streaming attribute constraints, dynamic lane boundary positional encoding, and lane segment denoising. The streaming attribute constraints enforce temporal consistency in both centerline and boundary coordinates, along with their classifications. Meanwhile, dynamic lane boundary positional encoding enhances the learning of up-to-date positional information within queries, while lane segment denoising helps capture diverse lane segment patterns, ultimately improving model performance. Additionally, we assess the accuracy of existing models using a lane boundary classification metric, which serves as a crucial measure for lane-changing scenarios in autonomous driving. On the OpenLane-V2 dataset, TopoStreamer demonstrates significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, achieving substantial performance gains of +3.0% mAP in lane segment perception and +1.7% OLS in centerline perception tasks.</p></details> |  |

Mining temporal motifs is essential for applications such as fraud detection, cybersecurity, and dynamic network analysis. However, conventional motif mining approaches treat each query independently, incurring significant redundant computations when similar substructures exist across multiple motifs. In this paper, we propose Mayura, a novel framework that unifies the mining of multiple temporal motifs by exploiting their inherent structural and temporal commonalities. Central to our approach is the Motif-Group Tree (MG-Tree), a hierarchical data structure that organizes related motifs and enables the reuse of common search paths, thereby reducing redundant computation. We propose a co-mining algorithm that leverages the MG-Tree and develop a flexible runtime capable of exploiting both CPU and GPU architectures for scalable performance. Empirical evaluations on diverse real-world datasets demonstrate that Mayura achieves substantial improvements over the state-of-the-art techniques that mine each motif individually, with an average speed-up of 2.4x on the CPU and 1.7x on the GPU, while maintaining the exactness required for high-stakes applications.</p></details> |  |

While recent advances in multimodal learning have improved alignment and fusion, current approaches remain limited by two prevalent but fundamentally flawed strategies: (1) task-agnostic sampling indiscriminately processes all frames, overwhelming key events with irrelevant content; and (2) heuristic retrieval captures superficial patterns but misses causal-temporal structures needed for complex reasoning. To address these challenges, we introduce LeAdQA, an innovative approach that bridges these gaps through synergizing causal-aware query refinement with fine-grained visual grounding. Our method first leverages LLMs to reformulate question-option pairs, resolving causal ambiguities and sharpening temporal focus. These refined queries subsequently direct a temporal grounding model to precisely retrieve the most salient segments, complemented by an adaptive fusion mechanism dynamically integrating the evidence to maximize relevance. The integrated visual-textual cues are then processed by an MLLM to generate accurate, contextually-grounded answers. Experiments on NExT-QA, IntentQA, and NExT-GQA demonstrate that our method's precise visual grounding substantially enhances the understanding of video-question relationships, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on complex reasoning tasks while maintaining computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |

Chest X-rays (CXRs) are a vital diagnostic tool, providing insights into clinical trajectories, but their irregular acquisition limits their utility. Existing tools for CXR interpretation are constrained by cross-sectional analysis, failing to capture temporal dynamics. To address this, we introduce CXR-TFT, a novel multi-modal framework that integrates temporally sparse CXR imaging and radiology reports with high-frequency clinical data, such as vital signs, laboratory values, and respiratory flow sheets, to predict the trajectory of CXR findings in critically ill patients. CXR-TFT leverages latent embeddings from a vision encoder that are temporally aligned with hourly clinical data through interpolation. A transformer model is then trained to predict CXR embeddings at each hour, conditioned on previous embeddings and clinical measurements. In a retrospective study of 20,000 ICU patients, CXR-TFT demonstrated high accuracy in forecasting abnormal CXR findings up to 12 hours before they became radiographically evident. This predictive capability in clinical data holds significant potential for enhancing the management of time-sensitive conditions like acute respiratory distress syndrome, where early intervention is crucial and diagnoses are often delayed. By providing distinctive temporal resolution in prognostic CXR analysis, CXR-TFT offers actionable 'whole patient' insights that can directly improve clinical outcomes.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Re...</summary><p>In Review for MICCAI 2025</p></details> |

This paper proposes SST-CL, a novel framework integrating spatial-temporal transformers with curriculum learning. Our method introduces two core components: a spatial encoder that models inter-channel relationships and a temporal encoder that captures multi-scale dependencies through windowed attention mechanisms, enabling simultaneous extraction of spatial correlations and temporal dynamics from EEG signals. Complementing this architecture, an intensity-aware curriculum learning strategy progressively guides training from high-intensity to low-intensity emotional states through dynamic sample scheduling based on a dual difficulty assessment. Comprehensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across various emotional intensity levels, with ablation studies confirming the necessity of both architectural components and the curriculum learning mechanism.</p></details> |  |

Visual analytics combines computational techniques with interactive visualizations, enabling the identification of patterns, anomalies, and attribute interactions. However, existing approaches frequently overlook the interplay between temporal and multivariate attributes. We introduce EventBox, a novel data representation and visual encoding approach for analyzing groups of events and their multivariate attributes. We have integrated EventBox into Sequen-C, a visual analytics system for the analysis of event sequences. To enable the agile creation of EventBoxes in Sequen-C, we have added user-driven transformations, including alignment, sorting, substitution and aggregation. To enhance analytical depth, we incorporate automatically generated statistical analyses, providing additional insight into the significance of attribute interactions. We evaluated our approach involving 21 participants (3 domain experts, 18 novice data analysts). We used the ICE-T framework to assess visualization value, user performance metrics completing a series of tasks, and interactive sessions with domain experts. We also present three case studies with real-world healthcare data demonstrating how EventBox and its integration into Sequen-C reveal meaningful patterns, anomalies, and insights. These results demonstrate that our work advances visual analytics by providing a flexible solution for exploring temporal and multivariate attributes in event sequences.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the author's version of the article to be published in IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics, and presented at IEEE VIS 2025. 11 pages, 7 figures</p></details> |

Reinforcement learning can be applied on recommendation to study such a problem but is also subject to large search space, sparse user feedback and long interactive latency. Motivated by recent progress in hierarchical reinforcement learning, we propose a novel framework called mccHRL to provide different levels of temporal abstraction on listwise recommendation. Within the hierarchical framework, the high-level agent studies the evolution of user perception, while the low-level agent produces the item selection policy by modeling the process as a sequential decision-making problem. We argue that such framework has a well-defined decomposition of the outra-session context and the intra-session context, which are encoded by the high-level and low-level agents, respectively. To verify this argument, we implement both a simulator-based environment and an industrial dataset-based experiment. Results observe significant performance improvement by our method, compared with several well-known baselines. Data and codes have been made public.</p></details> | 18 pages, 4 figures |
| **[BT-TL-DMPs: A Novel Robot TAMP Framework Combining Behavior Tree, Temporal Logic and Dynamical Movement Primitives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14582v1)** | 2025-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the field of Learning from Demonstration (LfD), enabling robots to generalize learned manipulation skills to novel scenarios for long-horizon tasks remains challenging. Specifically, it is still difficult for robots to adapt the learned skills to new environments with different task and motion requirements, especially in long-horizon, multi-stage scenarios with intricate constraints. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical framework, called BT-TL-DMPs, that integrates Behavior Tree (BT), Temporal Logic (TL), and Dynamical Movement Primitives (DMPs) to address this problem. Within this framework, Signal Temporal Logic (STL) is employed to formally specify complex, long-horizon task requirements and constraints. These STL specifications are systematically transformed to generate reactive and modular BTs for high-level decision-making task structure. An STL-constrained DMP optimization method is proposed to optimize the DMP forcing term, allowing the learned motion primitives to adapt flexibly while satisfying intricate spatiotemporal requirements and, crucially, preserving the essential dynamics learned from demonstrations. The framework is validated through simulations demonstrating generalization capabilities under various STL constraints and real-world experiments on several long-horizon robotic manipulation tasks. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively bridges the symbolic-motion gap, enabling more reliable and generalizable autonomous manipulation for complex robotic tasks.</p></details> | 11 pages, 8 figures |

Most existing methods rely on binary classifiers trained using real and fake image sequences, therefore hindering their generalization capabilities to unseen generation methods. Moreover, with the constant progress in generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), deepfake artifacts are becoming imperceptible at both the spatial and the temporal levels, making them extremely difficult to capture. To address these issues, we propose a fine-grained deepfake video detection approach called FakeSTormer that enforces the modeling of subtle spatio-temporal inconsistencies while avoiding overfitting. Specifically, we introduce a multi-task learning framework that incorporates two auxiliary branches for explicitly attending artifact-prone spatial and temporal regions. Additionally, we propose a video-level data synthesis strategy that generates pseudo-fake videos with subtle spatio-temporal artifacts, providing high-quality samples and hand-free annotations for our additional branches. Extensive experiments on several challenging benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared to recent state-of-the-art methods.

With advancements in artificial intelligence, sophisticated visual decoding architectures have achieved remarkable success in fMRI research, enabling more precise and fine-grained spatial concept localization. This has provided new tools for exploring the spatial representation of concepts in the brain. However, despite the millisecond-scale temporal resolution of EEG, which offers unparalleled advantages in tracking the dynamic evolution of cognitive processes, the temporal dynamics of neural representations based on EEG remain underexplored. This is primarily due to EEG's inherently low signal-to-noise ratio and its complex spatiotemporal coupling characteristics. To bridge this research gap, we propose a novel approach that integrates advanced neural decoding algorithms to systematically investigate how low-dimensional object properties are temporally encoded in EEG signals. We are the first to attempt to identify the specificity and prototypical temporal characteristics of concepts within temporal distributions. Our framework not only enhances the interpretability of neural representations but also provides new insights into visual decoding in brain-computer interfaces (BCI).</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we demonstrate that effective information compression may occur over time or space during sequences of node communications in distributed algorithms, leading to the concept of spatio-temporal compressors. This abstraction classifies existing compressors and inspires new compressors as spatio-temporal compressors, with their effectiveness described by constructive stability criteria from nonlinear system theory. Subsequently, we incorporate these spatio-temporal compressors directly into standard continuous-time consensus flows and distributed primal-dual flows, establishing conditions ensuring exponential convergence. Additionally, we introduce a novel observer-based distributed primal-dual continuous flow integrated with spatio-temporal compressors, which provides broader convergence conditions. These continuous flows achieve exponential convergence to the global optimum when the objective function is strongly convex and can be discretized using Euler approximations.

However, existing works neglect the real-world challenges for temporal reasoning: (1) intensive temporal information, (2) fast-changing event dynamics, and (3) complex temporal dependencies in social interactions. To bridge this gap, we propose a multi-level benchmark TIME, designed for temporal reasoning in real-world scenarios. TIME consists of 38,522 QA pairs, covering 3 levels with 11 fine-grained sub-tasks. This benchmark encompasses 3 sub-datasets reflecting different real-world challenges: TIME-Wiki, TIME-News, and TIME-Dial. We conduct extensive experiments on reasoning models and non-reasoning models. And we conducted an in-depth analysis of temporal reasoning performance across diverse real-world scenarios and tasks, and summarized the impact of test-time scaling on temporal reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we release TIME-Lite, a human-annotated subset to foster future research and standardized evaluation in temporal reasoning.

| **[Towards Temporal Knowledge Graph Alignment in the Wild](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14475v1)** | 2025-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal Knowledge Graph Alignment (TKGA) seeks to identify equivalent entities across heterogeneous temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) for fusion to improve their completeness. Although some approaches have been proposed to tackle this task, most assume unified temporal element standards and simplified temporal structures across different TKGs. They cannot deal with TKGA in the wild (TKGA-Wild), where multi-scale temporal element entanglement and cross-source temporal structural imbalances are common. To bridge this gap, we study the task of TKGA-Wild and propose HyDRA, a new and effective solution. HyDRA is the first to reformulate the task via multi-scale hypergraph retrieval-augmented generation to address the challenges of TKGA-Wild.In addition, we design a new scale-weave synergy mechanism for HyDRA, which incorporates intra-scale interactions and cross-scale conflict detection. This mechanism is designed to alleviate the fragmentation caused by multi-source temporal incompleteness and resolves inconsistencies arising from complex and uneven temporal event density distributions, thereby enhancing the model capacity to handle the intricacies of real-world temporal alignment. Finally, there is no standard benchmark that captures these challenges of TKGA-Wild and effectively evaluates existing methods. To this end, we formally propose to benchmark challenges for TKGA-Wild and validate the effectiveness of the method by establishing two new datasets(BETA and WildBETA). Extensive experiments on the new datasets and six representative benchmarks show that BETA and WildBETA better reflect real-world challenges. Meanwhile, HyDRA proposes a new paradigm for TKGA-Wild, consistently outperforming 24 competitive baselines, while maintaining strong efficiency and scalability.</p></details> | 18 pages, 6 figures |

In this study, we investigate how LLMs process the temporal meaning of linguistic aspect in narratives that were previously used in human studies. Using an Expert-in-the-Loop probing pipeline, we conduct a series of targeted experiments to assess whether LLMs construct semantic representations and pragmatic inferences in a human-like manner. Our findings show that LLMs over-rely on prototypicality, produce inconsistent aspectual judgments, and struggle with causal reasoning derived from aspect, raising concerns about their ability to fully comprehend narratives. These results suggest that LLMs process aspect fundamentally differently from humans and lack robust narrative understanding. Beyond these empirical findings, we develop a standardized experimental framework for the reliable assessment of LLMs' cognitive and linguistic capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward Temporal Causal Representation Learning with Tensor Decomposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14126v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal causal representation learning is a powerful tool for uncovering complex patterns in observational studies, which are often represented as low-dimensional time series. However, in many real-world applications, data are high-dimensional with varying input lengths and naturally take the form of irregular tensors. To analyze such data, irregular tensor decomposition is critical for extracting meaningful clusters that capture essential information. In this paper, we focus on modeling causal representation learning based on the transformed information. First, we present a novel causal formulation for a set of latent clusters. We then propose CaRTeD, a joint learning framework that integrates temporal causal representation learning with irregular tensor decomposition. Notably, our framework provides a blueprint for downstream tasks using the learned tensor factors, such as modeling latent structures and extracting causal information, and offers a more flexible regularization design to enhance tensor decomposition. Theoretically, we show that our algorithm converges to a stationary point. More importantly, our results fill the gap in theoretical guarantees for the convergence of state-of-the-art irregular tensor decomposition. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world electronic health record (EHR) datasets (MIMIC-III), with extensive benchmarks from both phenotyping and network recovery perspectives, demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques and enhances the explainability of causal representations.</p></details> |  |
| **[DENSE: Longitudinal Progress Note Generation with Temporal Modeling of Heterogeneous Clinical Notes Across Hospital Visits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14079v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Progress notes are among the most clinically meaningful artifacts in an Electronic Health Record (EHR), offering temporally grounded insights into a patient's evolving condition, treatments, and care decisions. Despite their importance, they are severely underrepresented in large-scale EHR datasets. For instance, in the widely used Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) dataset, only about $8.56\%$ of hospital visits include progress notes, leaving gaps in longitudinal patient narratives. In contrast, the dataset contains a diverse array of other note types, each capturing different aspects of care. We present DENSE (Documenting Evolving Progress Notes from Scattered Evidence), a system designed to align with clinical documentation workflows by simulating how physicians reference past encounters while drafting progress notes. The system introduces a fine-grained note categorization and a temporal alignment mechanism that organizes heterogeneous notes across visits into structured, chronological inputs. At its core, DENSE leverages a clinically informed retrieval strategy to identify temporally and semantically relevant content from both current and prior visits. This retrieved evidence is used to prompt a large language model (LLM) to generate clinically coherent and temporally aware progress notes. We evaluate DENSE on a curated cohort of patients with multiple visits and complete progress note documentation. The generated notes demonstrate strong longitudinal fidelity, achieving a temporal alignment ratio of $1.089$, surpassing the continuity observed in original notes. By restoring narrative coherence across fragmented documentation, our system supports improved downstream tasks such as summarization, predictive modeling, and clinical decision support, offering a scalable solution for LLM-driven note synthesis in real-world healthcare settings.</p></details> |  |

RHYTHM partitions trajectories into daily segments encoded as discrete tokens with hierarchical attention, capturing both daily and weekly dependencies while substantially reducing the sequence length. Token representations are enriched with pre-computed prompt embeddings via a frozen LLM, enhancing the model's ability to capture interdependencies without extensive computational overhead. By freezing the LLM backbone, RHYTHM achieves significant computational efficiency. Evaluation on three real-world datasets demonstrates a 2.4% improvement in accuracy, 5.0% increase on weekends, and 24.6% reduction in training time compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

We thoroughly explore the rich spatio-temporal properties of transformers within a multi-stage architecture paradigm for the temporal action localization (TAL) task. This exploration led to the development of a hierarchical multi-stage transformer architecture called PCL-Former, where each subtask is handled by a dedicated transformer module with a specialized loss function. Specifically, the Proposal-Former identifies candidate segments in an untrimmed video that may contain actions, the Classification-Former classifies the action categories within those segments, and the Localization-Former precisely predicts the temporal boundaries (i.e., start and end) of the action instances. To evaluate the performance of our method, we have conducted extensive experiments on three challenging benchmark datasets: THUMOS-14, ActivityNet-1.3, and HACS Segments. We also conducted detailed ablation experiments to assess the impact of each individual module of our PCL-Former. The obtained quantitative results validate the effectiveness of the proposed PCL-Former, outperforming state-of-the-art TAL approaches by 2.8%, 1.2%, and 4.8% on THUMOS14, ActivityNet-1.3, and HACS datasets, respectively.</p></details> | 17 pages, 6 figures, |

To address this, we introduce and elaborate upon a novel temporal and constraint-based extension of the logic of Here-and-There and its nonmonotonic equilibrium extension, representing, to the best of our knowledge, the first approach to nonmonotonic temporal reasoning with constraints specifically tailored for ASP. This expressive system is achieved by a synergistic combination of two foundational ASP extensions: the linear-time logic of Here-and-There, providing robust nonmonotonic temporal reasoning capabilities, and the logic of Here-and-There with constraints, enabling the direct integration and manipulation of numeric constraints, among others. This work establishes the foundational logical framework for tackling complex dynamic systems with high resolution within the ASP paradigm.</p></details> |  |
| **[DVFL-Net: A Lightweight Distilled Video Focal Modulation Network for Spatio-Temporal Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12426v2)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The landscape of video recognition has evolved significantly, shifting from traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to Transformer-based architectures for improved accuracy. While 3D CNNs have been effective at capturing spatiotemporal dynamics, recent Transformer models leverage self-attention to model long-range spatial and temporal dependencies. Despite achieving state-of-the-art performance on major benchmarks, Transformers remain computationally expensive, particularly with dense video data. To address this, we propose a lightweight Video Focal Modulation Network, DVFL-Net, which distills spatiotemporal knowledge from a large pre-trained teacher into a compact nano student model, enabling efficient on-device deployment. DVFL-Net utilizes knowledge distillation and spatial-temporal feature modulation to significantly reduce computation while preserving high recognition performance. We employ forward Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence alongside spatio-temporal focal modulation to effectively transfer both local and global context from the Video-FocalNet Base (teacher) to the proposed VFL-Net (student). We evaluate DVFL-Net on UCF50, UCF101, HMDB51, SSV2, and Kinetics-400, benchmarking it against recent state-of-the-art methods in Human Action Recognition (HAR). Additionally, we conduct a detailed ablation study analyzing the impact of forward KL divergence. The results confirm the superiority of DVFL-Net in achieving an optimal balance between performance and efficiency, demonstrating lower memory usage, reduced GFLOPs, and strong accuracy, making it a practical solution for real-time HAR applications.</p></details> | 17 pages |

However, this task is inherently difficult due to variations in fruit size, shape, occlusion, orientation, and the dynamic nature of orchards where fruits may appear or disappear between observations. In this article, we propose a novel method for fruit instance segmentation and re-identification on 3D terrestrial point clouds collected over time. Our approach directly operates on dense colored point clouds, capturing fine-grained 3D spatial detail. We segment individual fruits using a learning-based instance segmentation method applied directly to the point cloud. For each segmented fruit, we extract a compact and discriminative descriptor using a 3D sparse convolutional neural network. To track fruits across different times, we introduce an attention-based matching network that associates fruits with their counterparts from previous sessions. Matching is performed using a probabilistic assignment scheme, selecting the most likely associations across time. We evaluate our approach on real-world datasets of strawberries and apples, demonstrating that it outperforms existing methods in both instance segmentation and temporal re-identification, enabling robust and precise fruit monitoring across complex and dynamic orchard environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Computers and Electronics in Agriculture</p></details> |

While existing Temporal Graph Neural Networks (T-GNNs) have achieved notable success by leveraging complex architectures to model temporal and structural dependencies, they often suffer from scalability and efficiency challenges due to high computational overhead. In this paper, we propose EAGLE, a lightweight framework that integrates short-term temporal recency and long-term global structural patterns. EAGLE consists of a time-aware module that aggregates information from a node's most recent neighbors to reflect its immediate preferences, and a structure-aware module that leverages temporal personalized PageRank to capture the influence of globally important nodes. To balance these attributes, EAGLE employs an adaptive weighting mechanism to dynamically adjust their contributions based on data characteristics. Also, EAGLE eliminates the need for complex multi-hop message passing or memory-intensive mechanisms, enabling significant improvements in efficiency. Extensive experiments on seven real-world temporal graphs demonstrate that EAGLE consistently achieves superior performance against state-of-the-art T-GNNs in both effectiveness and efficiency, delivering more than a 50x speedup over effective transformer-based T-GNNs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted in 2024.

Existing approaches, depending on the domain they operate, suffer from several issues (e.g. geometric distortions, excessive cropping, poor generalization) that degrade the user experience. To address these issues, we introduce \textbf{GaVS}, a novel 3D-grounded approach that reformulates video stabilization as a temporally-consistent `local reconstruction and rendering' paradigm. Given 3D camera poses, we augment a reconstruction model to predict Gaussian Splatting primitives, and finetune it at test-time, with multi-view dynamics-aware photometric supervision and cross-frame regularization, to produce temporally-consistent local reconstructions. The model are then used to render each stabilized frame. We utilize a scene extrapolation module to avoid frame cropping. Our method is evaluated on a repurposed dataset, instilled with 3D-grounded information, covering samples with diverse camera motions and scene dynamics. Quantitatively, our method is competitive with or superior to state-of-the-art 2D and 2.5D approaches in terms of conventional task metrics and new geometry consistency. Qualitatively, our method produces noticeably better results compared to alternatives, validated by the user study.</p></details> | <details><summary>siggr...</summary><p>siggraph 2025, project website: https://sinoyou.github.io/gavs. version 2, update discussion</p></details> |

We first introduce NarrativeReason, a novel dataset focused on temporal relationships among sequential events within narratives, distinguishing it from existing temporal reasoning datasets that primarily address pair-wise event relationships. Our approach then combines temporal reasoning with timeline summarisation through a knowledge distillation framework, where we first fine-tune a teacher model on temporal reasoning tasks and then distill this knowledge into a student model while simultaneously training it for the task of timeline summarisation. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves superior performance on out-of-domain mental health-related timeline summarisation tasks, which involve long social media threads with repetitions of events and a mix of emotions, highlighting the importance and generalisability of leveraging temporal reasoning to improve timeline summarisation.</p></details> |  |

Existing works have considered the problem where either all agents are controllable, the agent models are deterministic and known, or no safety guarantees are provided. We propose a predictive control synthesis framework that guarantees, with high probability, the satisfaction of signal temporal logic (STL) tasks that are defined over a controllable system in the presence of uncontrollable stochastic agents. We use trajectory predictors and conformal prediction to construct probabilistic prediction regions for each uncontrollable agent that are valid over multiple future time steps. Specifically, we construct a normalized prediction region over all agents and time steps to reduce conservatism and increase data efficiency. We then formulate a worst-case bilevel mixed integer program (MIP) that accounts for all agent realizations within the prediction region to obtain an open-loop controller that provably guarantee task satisfaction with high probability. To efficiently solve this bilevel MIP, we propose an equivalent MIP program based on KKT conditions of the original bilevel formulation. Building upon this, we design a closed-loop controller, where both recursive feasibility and task satisfaction can be guaranteed with high probability. We illustrate our control synthesis framework on two case studies.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances highlight the potential of fine-tuning pre-trained music foundation models for MSA tasks. However, these models are typically trained with high temporal feature resolution and short audio windows, which limits their efficiency and introduces bias when applied to long-form audio. This paper presents a temporal adaptation approach for fine-tuning music foundation models tailored to MSA. Our method enables efficient analysis of full-length songs in a single forward pass by incorporating two key strategies: (1) audio window extension and (2) low-resolution adaptation. Experiments on the Harmonix Set and RWC-Pop datasets show that our method significantly improves both boundary detection and structural function prediction, while maintaining comparable memory usage and inference speed.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WASPAA 2025.

Current methods, such as reducing inter-frame redundancy, employing separate models for image-text relevance assessment, or utilizing temporal video grounding for event localization, substantially adopt unsupervised learning paradigms, whereas they struggle to address the complex scenarios in long video understanding. We propose Instructed Temporal Grounding for Videos (VideoITG), featuring customized frame sampling aligned with user instructions. The core of VideoITG is the VidThinker pipeline, an automated annotation framework that explicitly mimics the human annotation process. First, it generates detailed clip-level captions conditioned on the instruction; then, it retrieves relevant video segments through instruction-guided reasoning; finally, it performs fine-grained frame selection to pinpoint the most informative visual evidence. Leveraging VidThinker, we construct the VideoITG-40K dataset, containing 40K videos and 500K instructed temporal grounding annotations. We then design a plug-and-play VideoITG model, which takes advantage of visual language alignment and reasoning capabilities of Video-LLMs, for effective frame selection in a discriminative manner. Coupled with Video-LLMs, VideoITG achieves consistent performance improvements across multiple multimodal video understanding benchmarks, showing its superiority and great potentials for video understanding.</p></details> | Technical Report |

Previous methods solve the issue of insufficient observation by leveraging 4D diffusion models to generate videos at novel viewpoints. However, the generated videos from these models often lack spatio-temporal consistency, thus degrading view synthesis quality. In this paper, we propose a novel sliding iterative denoising process to enhance the spatio-temporal consistency of the 4D diffusion model. Specifically, we define a latent grid in which each latent encodes the image, camera pose, and human pose for a certain viewpoint and timestamp, then alternately denoising the latent grid along spatial and temporal dimensions with a sliding window, and finally decode the videos at target viewpoints from the corresponding denoised latents. Through the iterative sliding, information flows sufficiently across the latent grid, allowing the diffusion model to obtain a large receptive field and thus enhance the 4D consistency of the output, while making the GPU memory consumption affordable. The experiments on the DNA-Rendering and ActorsHQ datasets demonstrate that our method is able to synthesize high-quality and consistent novel-view videos and significantly outperforms the existing approaches.

It serves as a cornerstone for achieving high-level autonomous driving. However, current approaches remain inadequate for accurately modeling the complex spatio-temporal interdependencies and the unpredictable variability of human driving behavior. To address these challenges, we propose CaSTFormer, a Causal Spatio-Temporal Transformer to explicitly model causal interactions between driver behavior and environmental context for robust intention prediction. Specifically, CaSTFormer introduces a novel Reciprocal Shift Fusion (RSF) mechanism for precise temporal alignment of internal and external feature streams, a Causal Pattern Extraction (CPE) module that systematically eliminates spurious correlations to reveal authentic causal dependencies, and an innovative Feature Synthesis Network (FSN) that adaptively synthesizes these purified representations into coherent spatio-temporal inferences. We evaluate the proposed CaSTFormer on the public Brain4Cars dataset, and it achieves state-of-the-art performance. It effectively captures complex causal spatio-temporal dependencies and enhances both the accuracy and transparency of driving intention prediction.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces RIDER (RIsk minimization under Dynamically Evolving Regimes) which derives optimally-weighted empirical risk minimization procedures under temporal distribution shifts. Our approach is theoretically grounded in the random distribution shift model, where random shifts arise as a superposition of numerous unpredictable changes in the data-generating process. We show that common weighting schemes, such as pooling all data, exponentially weighting data, and using only the most recent data, emerge naturally as special cases in our framework. We demonstrate that RIDER consistently improves out-of-sample predictive performance when applied as a fine-tuning step on the Yearbook dataset, across a range of benchmark methods in Wild-Time. Moreover, we show that RIDER outperforms standard weighting strategies in two other real-world tasks: predicting stock market volatility and forecasting ride durations in NYC taxi data.</p></details> |  |

Unlike existing approaches in the literature, our solution is designed to meet a broader range of key requirements. This includes estimating confidence levels for predictions, detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) cases, and controlling false alarms. The proposed solution is based on a temporal convolutional autoencoder to automatically extract low-dimensional features from raw sensor data. Fault detection and diagnosis are respectively carried out using a binary and a multiclass classifier trained on the autoencoder latent and residual spaces. The classifiers are histogram-based gradient boosting models calibrated to output probabilities that can be interpreted as confidence levels. A relatively simple technique, based on inductive conformal anomaly detection, is used to identify OOD data. We leverage other simple yet effective techniques, such as cumulative sum control chart (CUSUM) to limit the false alarms, and threshold moving to address class imbalance in fault detection. The proposed framework is highly configurable and has been evaluated on simulated data, covering both nominal and anomalous operational scenarios. The results indicate that our solution is a promising first step, though testing with real data will be necessary to ensure that it achieves the required maturity level for operational use.</p></details> | 53 pages, 16 figures |

While MLLMs have been extensively studied for visual semantic understanding tasks, their ability to perform precise and quantitative spatial-temporal understanding in real-world applications remains largely unexamined, leading to uncertain prospects. To evaluate models' Spatial-Temporal Intelligence, we introduce STI-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' spatial-temporal understanding through challenging tasks such as estimating and predicting the appearance, pose, displacement, and motion of objects. Our benchmark encompasses a wide range of robot and vehicle operations across desktop, indoor, and outdoor scenarios.

The main reason is that the trajectory is a kind of complex data, including spatial and temporal information, which is crucial for accurate prediction. Intuitively, the more information the model can capture, the more precise the future trajectory can be predicted. However, previous works based on deep learning methods processed spatial and temporal information separately, leading to inadequate spatial information capture, which means they failed to capture the complete spatial information. Therefore, it is of significance to capture information more fully and effectively on vehicle interactions. In this study, we introduced an integrated 3D graph that incorporates both spatial and temporal edges. Based on this, we proposed the integrated 3D graph, which considers the cross-time interaction information. In specific, we design a Spatial-Temporal Fusion (STF) model including Multi-layer perceptions (MLP) and Graph Attention (GAT) to capture the spatial and temporal information historical trajectories simultaneously on the 3D graph. Our experiment on the ApolloScape Trajectory Datasets shows that the proposed STF outperforms several baseline methods, especially on the long-time-horizon trajectory prediction.</p></details> | 6 pages, 6 figures |

Leveraging fine-scale weekly mortality and high-resolution climate data from Austria (2002 to 2019), we assess how interactions between temperature, humidity, age, and gender influence mortality patterns. Our approach goes beyond conventional modelling by capturing complex dependencies through structured interactions across space-time, space-age, and age-time dimensions, allowing us to capture complex demographic and environmental dependencies. The analysis identifies district-level mortality patterns and quantifies climate-related risks on a weekly basis, offering new insights for public health surveillance.</p></details> |  |

Skills in calisthenics encompass both static and dynamic elements performed by athletes. The evaluation of static skills is based on their difficulty level and the duration of the hold. Automated tools able to recognize isometric skills from a video by segmenting them to estimate their duration would be desirable to assist athletes in their training and judges during competitions. Although the video understanding literature on action recognition through body pose analysis is rich, no previous work has specifically addressed the problem of calisthenics skill temporal video segmentation. This study aims to provide an initial step towards the implementation of automated tools within the field of Calisthenics. To advance knowledge in this context, we propose a dataset of video footage of static calisthenics skills performed by athletes. Each video is annotated with a temporal segmentation which determines the extent of each skill. We hence report the results of a baseline approach to address the problem of skill temporal segmentation on the proposed dataset. The results highlight the feasibility of the proposed problem, while there is still room for improvement.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 6 figures, In Proceedings of the 19th International Joint Conference on Computer Vision, Imaging and Computer Graphics Theory and Applications - Volume 2</p></details> |

The suggested BTSS is organized as a hierarchical structure that entails various embedded processing layers. We posit that observable translation behaviour - i.e., eye and finger movements - is fundamental when executing the physical act of translation but it is caused and shaped by higher-order cognitive processes and affective translation states. We analyse records of keystrokes and gaze data as indicators of the hidden mental processing structure and organize the behavioural patterns as a multi-layered embedded BTSS. The BTSS serves as the basis for a computational translation agent to simulate the temporal dynamics of affect, automatized behaviour and cognition during human translation production.</p></details> |  |

Morphing of temporal envelopes in a perceptually intuitive manner should enable new methods for sound blending in creative media and for probing perceptual organization in psychoacoustics. However, existing audio morphing techniques often fail to produce intermediate temporal envelopes when input sounds have distinct temporal structures; many morphers effectively overlay both temporal structures, leading to perceptually unnatural results. In this paper, we introduce a novel workflow for learning envelope morphing with perceptual guidance: we first derive perceptually grounded morphing principles through human listening studies, then synthesize large-scale datasets encoding these principles, and finally train machine learning models to create perceptually intermediate morphs. Specifically, we present: (1) perceptual principles that guide envelope morphing, derived from our listening studies, (2) a supervised framework to learn these principles, (3) an autoencoder that learns to compress temporal envelope structures into latent representations, and (4) benchmarks for evaluating audio envelope morphs, using both synthetic and naturalistic data, and show that our approach outperforms existing methods in producing temporally intermediate morphs. All code, models, and datasets will be made publicly available upon publication.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at WASPAA 2025</p></details> |

Real-world measurements of such processes are often collected at irregularly distributed points in space, which can be effectively represented as graphs; however, there are currently only a few existing datasets. Our work aims to make advancements in the field of PDE-modeling accessible to the temporal graph machine learning community, while addressing the data scarcity problem, by creating and utilizing datasets based on PDEs. In this work, we create and use synthetic datasets based on PDEs to support spatio-temporal graph modeling in machine learning for different applications. More precisely, we showcase three equations to model different types of disasters and hazards in the fields of epidemiology, atmospheric particles, and tsunami waves. Further, we show how such created datasets can be used by benchmarking several machine learning models on the epidemiological dataset. Additionally, we show how pre-training on this dataset can improve model performance on real-world epidemiological data. The presented methods enable others to create datasets and benchmarks customized to individual requirements.

These tags are generated during an offline sleep phase and serve as compact references to past experience, allowing the learner to incorporate information beyond its immediate input range. We evaluate this idea in a controlled synthetic environment designed to reveal the limitations of traditional neural network based sequence learners, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), when facing temporal patterns on multiple timescales. We evaluate this idea in a controlled synthetic environment designed to reveal the limitations of traditional neural network based sequence learners, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), when facing temporal patterns on multiple timescales. Our results, while preliminary, suggest that temporal chunking can significantly enhance learning efficiency under resource constrained settings. A small-scale human pilot study using a Serial Reaction Time Task further motivates the idea of structural abstraction. Although limited to synthetic tasks, this work serves as an early proof-of-concept, with initial evidence that learned context tags can transfer across related task, offering potential for future applications in transfer learning.</p></details> |  |

| **[PatchTraj: Dynamic Patch Representation Learning for Time-Frequency Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19119v1)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pedestrian trajectory prediction is crucial for autonomous driving and robotics. While existing point-based and grid-based methods expose two key limitations: insufficiently modeling human motion dynamics, as they fail to balance local motion details with long-range spatiotemporal dependencies, and the time representation lacks interaction with the frequency domain in modeling trajectory sequences. To address these challenges, we propose PatchTraj, a dynamic patch-based trajectory prediction framework that unifies time-domain and frequency-domain representations. Specifically, we decompose the trajectory into raw time sequences and frequency components, employing dynamic patch partitioning for multi-scale trajectory segmentation to capture hierarchical motion patterns. Each patch is processed by an adaptive embedding layer with scale-aware feature extraction, followed by hierarchical feature aggregation to model both fine-grained and long-range dependencies. The outputs of two branches interact via cross-modal attention, enabling complementary fusion of temporal and spectral cues. Finally, a Transformer encoder-decoder integrates both modalities to autoregressively predict future trajectories. Extensive experiments on ETH-UCY, SDD, NBA, and JRDB datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with high efficiency.</p></details> |  |

While existing W2SG studies focus on simple tasks like binary classification, we extend this paradigm to complex interactive decision-making environments. Specifically, we fine-tune a strong model with trajectories of intermediate actions generated by a weak model. Motivated by the human learning process, we propose to generalize not only success knowledge but also failure experience so that the strong model can learn from failed trajectories accumulated by weak models. To effectively and efficiently elicit the potential of strong agents, we further construct ``trajectory trees," a hierarchical representation that organizes weak model-generated action trajectories, coupled with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to optimize the strong model. Through theoretical analysis, we provide formal guarantees for the effectiveness of our method in improving W2SG performance. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate substantial improvements in reasoning and decision-making capabilities across diverse task domains, validating the scalability and robustness of our proposed framework.

| **[R-Stitch: Dynamic Trajectory Stitching for Efficient Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17307v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning enhances the problem-solving capabilities of large language models by encouraging step-by-step intermediate reasoning during inference. While effective, CoT introduces substantial computational overhead due to its reliance on autoregressive decoding over long token sequences. Existing acceleration strategies either reduce sequence length through early stopping or compressive reward designs, or improve decoding speed via speculative decoding with smaller models. However, speculative decoding suffers from limited speedup when the agreement between small and large models is low, and fails to exploit the potential advantages of small models in producing concise intermediate reasoning. In this paper, we present R-Stitch, a token-level, confidence-based hybrid decoding framework that accelerates CoT inference by switching between a small language model (SLM) and a large language model (LLM) along the reasoning trajectory. R-Stitch uses the SLM to generate tokens by default and delegates to the LLM only when the SLM's confidence falls below a threshold. This design avoids full-sequence rollback and selectively invokes the LLM on uncertain steps, preserving both efficiency and answer quality. R-Stitch is model-agnostic, training-free, and compatible with standard decoding pipelines. Experiments on math reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that R-Stitch achieves up to 85\% reduction in inference latency with negligible accuracy drop, highlighting its practical effectiveness in accelerating CoT reasoning.</p></details> |  |

However, the reliability of these online-generated maps remains uncertain. While incorporating map uncertainty into downstream trajectory prediction tasks has shown potential for performance improvements, current strategies provide limited insights into the specific scenarios where this uncertainty is beneficial. In this work, we first analyze the driving scenarios in which mapping uncertainty has the greatest positive impact on trajectory prediction and identify a critical, previously overlooked factor: the agent's kinematic state. Building on these insights, we propose a novel Proprioceptive Scenario Gating that adaptively integrates map uncertainty into trajectory prediction based on forecasts of the ego vehicle's future kinematics. This lightweight, self-supervised approach enhances the synergy between online mapping and trajectory prediction, providing interpretability around where uncertainty is advantageous and outperforming previous integration methods. Additionally, we introduce a Covariance-based Map Uncertainty approach that better aligns with map geometry, further improving trajectory prediction. Extensive ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of our approach, achieving up to 23.6% improvement in mapless trajectory prediction performance over the state-of-the-art method using the real-world nuScenes driving dataset.

During the flight phases, where the ground reaction forces are not available for regulation, the limb swinging trajectories are significant for the stability of the next stance phase. Due to the conservation of angular momentum, improper leg and arm swinging results in highly tilted and unsustainable body configurations at the next stance phase landing. In such cases, the robotic system fails to maintain locomotion independent of the stability of the center of mass trajectories. This problem is more apparent for fast and high flight time trajectories. This paper proposes a real-time nonlinear limb trajectory optimization problem for humanoid running. The optimization problem is tested on two different humanoid robot models, and the generated trajectories are verified using a running algorithm for both robots in a simulation environment.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication at the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), Atlanta 2025.

Especially predicting the future states of other traffic participants imposes a non-trivial challenge. Current SotA-models already show promising results when trained on real datasets (e.g. Argoverse2, NuScenes). Problems arise when these models are deployed to new/unseen areas. Typically, performance drops significantly, indicating that the models lack generalization. In this work, we introduce a new Graph Neural Network (GNN) that utilizes a heterogeneous graph consisting of traffic participants and vectorized road network. Latter, is used to classify goals, i.e. endpoints of the predicted trajectories, in a multi-staged approach, leading to a better generalization to unseen scenarios. We show the effectiveness of the goal selection process via cross-dataset evaluation, i.e. training on Argoverse2 and evaluating on NuScenes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted on IEEE ITSC 2025</p></details> |
| **[In-Trajectory Inverse Reinforcement Learning: Learn Incrementally Before An Ongoing Trajectory Terminates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15612v7)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) aims to learn a reward function and a corresponding policy that best fit the demonstrated trajectories of an expert. However, current IRL works cannot learn incrementally from an ongoing trajectory because they have to wait to collect at least one complete trajectory to learn. To bridge the gap, this paper considers the problem of learning a reward function and a corresponding policy while observing the initial state-action pair of an ongoing trajectory and keeping updating the learned reward and policy when new state-action pairs of the ongoing trajectory are observed. We formulate this problem as an online bi-level optimization problem where the upper level dynamically adjusts the learned reward according to the newly observed state-action pairs with the help of a meta-regularization term, and the lower level learns the corresponding policy. We propose a novel algorithm to solve this problem and guarantee that the algorithm achieves sub-linear local regret $O(\sqrt{T}+\log T+\sqrt{T}\log T)$. If the reward function is linear, we prove that the proposed algorithm achieves sub-linear regret $O(\log T)$. Experiments are used to validate the proposed algorithm.</p></details> |  |

By explicitly conditioning on surrounding vehicles and road geometry, Ctx2TrajGen generates interaction-aware trajectories aligned with real-world context.

In order to ensure that construction robots can perform tasks efficiently and accurately in complex construction environments, traditional single-objective trajectory optimization methods are difficult to meet the complex requirements of the changing construction environment. Therefore, we propose a multi-objective trajectory optimization for the robotic arm used in the curtain wall installation. First, we design a robotic arm for curtain wall installation, integrating serial, parallel, and folding arm elements, while considering its physical properties and motion characteristics. In addition, this paper proposes an NSGA-III-FO algorithm (NSGA-III with Focused Operator, NSGA-III-FO) that incorporates a focus operator screening mechanism to accelerate the convergence of the algorithm towards the Pareto front, thereby effectively balancing the multi-objective constraints of construction robots. The proposed algorithm is tested against NSGA-III, MOEA/D, and MSOPS-II in ten consecutive trials on the DTLZ3 and WFG3 test functions, showing significantly better convergence efficiency than the other algorithms. Finally, we conduct two sets of experiments on the designed robotic arm platform, which confirm the efficiency and practicality of the NSGA-III-FO algorithm in solving multi-objective trajectory planning problems for curtain wall installation tasks.</p></details> |  |

To tackle this challenge, our study innovatively draws inspiration from the mechanics of human upper limb movements during weight lifting, proposing a bio-inspired trajectory planning framework that incorporates human energy conversion principles. By collecting motion trajectories and electromyography (EMG) signals during dumbbell curls, we construct an anthropomorphic trajectory planning that integrates human force exertion patterns and energy consumption patterns. Utilizing the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm, we achieve dynamic load distribution for robotic arm trajectory planning based on human-like movement features. In practical application, these bio-inspired movement characteristics are applied to curtain wall installation tasks, validating the correctness and superiority of our trajectory planning method. Simulation results demonstrate a 48.4% reduction in energy consumption through intelligent conversion between kinetic and potential energy. This approach provides new insights and theoretical support for optimizing energy use in curtain wall installation robots during actual handling tasks.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose the GFM-Planner, a perception-aware trajectory planning framework based on the geometric feature metric, which enhances LiDAR localization accuracy by guiding the robot to avoid degraded areas. First, we derive the Geometric Feature Metric (GFM) from the fundamental LiDAR localization problem. Next, we design a 2D grid-based Metric Encoding Map (MEM) to efficiently store GFM values across the environment. A constant-time decoding algorithm is further proposed to retrieve GFM values for arbitrary poses from the MEM. Finally, we develop a perception-aware trajectory planning algorithm that improves LiDAR localization capabilities by guiding the robot in selecting trajectories through feature-rich areas. Both simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that our approach enables the robot to actively select trajectories that significantly enhance LiDAR localization accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IROS 2025</p></details> |

The model applies the Adaboost algorithm to divide multiple weak learners, and each submodel utilizes CNN to extract spatial features, LSTM to capture temporal features, and attention mechanism to capture global features comprehensively. The strong learner model, combined with multiple sub-models, then optimizes the hyperparameters of the prediction model through the natural selection behavior pattern simulated by SO. In this study, based on the real ADS-B data from Xi'an to Tianjin, the comparison experiments and ablation studies of multiple optimizers are carried out, and a comprehensive test and evaluation analysis is carried out. The results show that SO-CLA-adaboost outperforms traditional optimizers such as particle swarm, whale, and gray wolf in handling large-scale high-dimensional trajectory data. In addition, introducing the full-strategy collaborative improvement SO algorithm improves the model's prediction accuracy by 39.89%.</p></details> | in Chinese language |

However, current automated methods are limited to establishing cell developmental trajectories within individual samples, necessitating biologists to manually link cells across samples to construct complete cross-sample evolutionary trajectories that consider cellular spatial dynamics. This process demands substantial human effort due to the complex spatial correspondence between each pair of samples. To address this challenge, we first proposed a GNN-based model to predict cross-sample cell developmental trajectories. We then developed TrajLens, a visual analytics system that supports biologists in exploring and refining the cell developmental trajectories based on predicted links. Specifically, we designed the visualization that integrates features on cell distribution and developmental direction across multiple samples, providing an overview of the spatial evolutionary patterns of cell populations along trajectories. Additionally, we included contour maps superimposed on the original cell distribution data, enabling biologists to explore them intuitively. To demonstrate our system's performance, we conducted quantitative evaluations of our model with two case studies and expert interviews to validate its usefulness and effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

The success of DMs lies in the iterative nature of diffusion: diffusion breaks down the complex process of mapping noise to data into a sequence of simple denoising tasks. Moreover, we are able to exert fine-grained control over the generation process by injecting guidance terms into each denoising step. However, the iterative process is also computationally intensive, often taking from tens up to thousands of function evaluations. Although consistency trajectory models (CTMs) enable traversal between any time points along the probability flow ODE (PFODE) and score inference with a single function evaluation, CTMs only allow translation from Gaussian noise to data. This work aims to unlock the full potential of CTMs by proposing generalized CTMs (GCTMs), which translate between arbitrary distributions via ODEs. We discuss the design space of GCTMs and demonstrate their efficacy in various image manipulation tasks such as image-to-image translation, restoration, and editing.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 (poster) |

Here, we propose a researcher population pyramids framework for tracking global demographic and gender trajectories using publication data. This framework provides a timely snapshot of historical and present demographics and gender balance, revealing three contrasting research systems: Emerging systems (e.g., Arab countries) exhibit high researcher inflows with widening gender gaps in cumulative productivity; Mature systems (e.g., the United States) show modest inflows with narrowing gender gaps; and Rigid systems (e.g., Japan) lag in both. Furthermore, by simulating future scenarios, the framework makes potential trajectories visible. If 2023 demographic patterns persist, Arab countries' systems could resemble mature or even rigid ones by 2050. Our framework provides a robust diagnostic tool for policymakers worldwide to foster sustainable talent pipelines and gender equality in academia.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 5 figures, 1 table, and SI</p></details> |

Functional connectivity can be represented by correlation matrices computed over time, where each matrix captures the Pearson correlation between the mean fMRI signals of different regions within a sliding window. We introduce several Log-Euclidean Riemannian framework for constructing smooth approximations of functional brain connectivity trajectories. Representing dynamic functional connectivity as time series of full-rank correlation matrices, we leverage recent theoretical Log-Euclidean diffeomorphisms to map these trajectories in practice into Euclidean spaces where polynomial regression becomes feasible. Pulling back the regressed curve ensures that each estimated point remains a valid correlation matrix, enabling a smooth, interpretable, and geometrically consistent approximation of the original brain connectivity dynamics. Experiments on fMRI-derived connectivity trajectories demonstrate the geometric consistency and computational efficiency of our approach.</p></details> |  |

Due to the restrictions on sensing capabilities in the underwater scenario, the AUV is limited to collecting only bearing measurements to the target. A framework called GBT is proposed with integration of online learning and planning. First, a Gaussian process learning method is proposed for the AUV to handle unknown target motion, wherein pseudo linear transformation of bearing measurements is introduced to address nonlinearity of bearings. A probabilistic bearing-data-dependent bound on tracking error is then rigorously established. Based on it, optimal desired bearings that can reduce tracking uncertainty are obtained analytically. Finally, the trajectory optimization problem is formulated and transformed into an easily solved one with parametric transformation. Numerical examples and comparison with existing methods verify the feasibility and superior performance of our proposed framework.</p></details> |  |

Chest X-rays (CXRs) are a vital diagnostic tool, providing insights into clinical trajectories, but their irregular acquisition limits their utility. Existing tools for CXR interpretation are constrained by cross-sectional analysis, failing to capture temporal dynamics. To address this, we introduce CXR-TFT, a novel multi-modal framework that integrates temporally sparse CXR imaging and radiology reports with high-frequency clinical data, such as vital signs, laboratory values, and respiratory flow sheets, to predict the trajectory of CXR findings in critically ill patients. CXR-TFT leverages latent embeddings from a vision encoder that are temporally aligned with hourly clinical data through interpolation. A transformer model is then trained to predict CXR embeddings at each hour, conditioned on previous embeddings and clinical measurements. In a retrospective study of 20,000 ICU patients, CXR-TFT demonstrated high accuracy in forecasting abnormal CXR findings up to 12 hours before they became radiographically evident. This predictive capability in clinical data holds significant potential for enhancing the management of time-sensitive conditions like acute respiratory distress syndrome, where early intervention is crucial and diagnoses are often delayed. By providing distinctive temporal resolution in prognostic CXR analysis, CXR-TFT offers actionable 'whole patient' insights that can directly improve clinical outcomes.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Re...</summary><p>In Review for MICCAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Consistency Trajectory Matching for One-Step Generative Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20349v4)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current diffusion-based super-resolution (SR) approaches achieve commendable performance at the cost of high inference overhead. Therefore, distillation techniques are utilized to accelerate the multi-step teacher model into one-step student model. Nevertheless, these methods significantly raise training costs and constrain the performance of the student model by the teacher model. To overcome these tough challenges, we propose Consistency Trajectory Matching for Super-Resolution (CTMSR), a distillation-free strategy that is able to generate photo-realistic SR results in one step. Concretely, we first formulate a Probability Flow Ordinary Differential Equation (PF-ODE) trajectory to establish a deterministic mapping from low-resolution (LR) images with noise to high-resolution (HR) images. Then we apply the Consistency Training (CT) strategy to directly learn the mapping in one step, eliminating the necessity of pre-trained diffusion model. To further enhance the performance and better leverage the ground-truth during the training process, we aim to align the distribution of SR results more closely with that of the natural images. To this end, we propose to minimize the discrepancy between their respective PF-ODE trajectories from the LR image distribution by our meticulously designed Distribution Trajectory Matching (DTM) loss, resulting in improved realism of our recovered HR images. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods can attain comparable or even superior capabilities on both synthetic and real datasets while maintaining minimal inference latency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |

Traditional Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) methods, while effective for offline planning, often struggle with premature convergence and latency in real-time scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose PE-PSO, an enhanced PSO-based online trajectory planner. The method introduces a persistent exploration mechanism to preserve swarm diversity and an entropy-based parameter adjustment strategy to dynamically adapt optimization behavior. UAV trajectories are modeled using B-spline curves, which ensure path smoothness while reducing optimization complexity. To extend this capability to UAV swarms, we develop a multi-agent framework that combines genetic algorithm (GA)-based task allocation with distributed PE-PSO, supporting scalable and coordinated trajectory generation. The distributed architecture allows for parallel computation and decentralized control, enabling effective cooperation among agents while maintaining real-time performance. Comprehensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms conventional PSO and other swarm-based planners across several metrics, including trajectory quality, energy efficiency, obstacle avoidance, and computation time. These results confirm the effectiveness and applicability of PE-PSO in real-time multi-UAV operations under complex environmental conditions.</p></details> | 8 papers,7 figures |

Real-world scenarios frequently present challenges such as occlusions and incomplete scene observations, which can compromise predictive accuracy. Thus, traditional video-based methods often struggle due to limited temporal and spatial perspectives. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative. Having been trained on a large text corpus describing human behaviors, LLMs likely encode plausible sequences of human actions in a home environment. However, LLMs, trained primarily on text data, lack inherent spatial awareness and real-time environmental perception. They struggle with understanding physical constraints and spatial geometry. Therefore, to be effective in a real-world spatial scenario, we propose a multimodal prediction framework that enhances LLM-based action prediction by integrating physical constraints derived from human trajectories. Our experiments demonstrate that combining LLM predictions with trajectory data significantly improves overall prediction performance. This enhancement is particularly notable in situations where the LLM receives limited scene information, highlighting the complementary nature of linguistic knowledge and physical constraints in understanding and anticipating human behavior.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IROS 2025</p></details> |

This paper investigates the generation of human-like trajectories using a receding horizon approach applied to the TickTacking interface in a target-tracking task. By analyzing user-generated trajectories, we identify key human behavioral features and incorporate them in a controller that mimics these behaviors. The performance of this human-inspired controller is evaluated against a baseline optimal-control-based agent, demonstrating the importance of specific control features for achieving human-like interaction. These findings contribute to the broader goal of developing rhythm-based human-machine interfaces by offering design insights that enhance user performance, improve intuitiveness, and reduce interaction frustration</p></details> |  |
| **[STF: Spatial Temporal Fusion for Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18149v2)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is a challenging task that aims to predict the future trajectory of vehicles or pedestrians over a short time horizon based on their historical positions. The main reason is that the trajectory is a kind of complex data, including spatial and temporal information, which is crucial for accurate prediction. Intuitively, the more information the model can capture, the more precise the future trajectory can be predicted. However, previous works based on deep learning methods processed spatial and temporal information separately, leading to inadequate spatial information capture, which means they failed to capture the complete spatial information. Therefore, it is of significance to capture information more fully and effectively on vehicle interactions. In this study, we introduced an integrated 3D graph that incorporates both spatial and temporal edges. Based on this, we proposed the integrated 3D graph, which considers the cross-time interaction information. In specific, we design a Spatial-Temporal Fusion (STF) model including Multi-layer perceptions (MLP) and Graph Attention (GAT) to capture the spatial and temporal information historical trajectories simultaneously on the 3D graph. Our experiment on the ApolloScape Trajectory Datasets shows that the proposed STF outperforms several baseline methods, especially on the long-time-horizon trajectory prediction.</p></details> | 6 pages, 6 figures |

However, existing trajectory optimization methods show weakness when dealing with large-scale long trajectories. Recent advances in parallel computing have accelerated optimization in some fields, but how to efficiently solve trajectory optimization via parallelism remains an open question. In this paper, we propose a novel trajectory optimization framework based on the Consensus Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (CADMM) algorithm, which decomposes the trajectory into multiple segments and solves the subproblems in parallel. The proposed framework reduces the time complexity to O(1) per iteration to the number of segments, compared to O(N) of the state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches. Furthermore, we introduce a closed-form solution that integrates convex linear and quadratic constraints to speed up the optimization, and we also present numerical solutions for general inequality constraints. A series of simulations and experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms the SOTA approach in terms of efficiency and smoothness. Especially for a large-scale trajectory, with one hundred segments, achieving over a tenfold speedup. To fully explore the potential of our algorithm on modern parallel computing architectures, we deploy our framework on a GPU and show high performance with thousands of segments.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, submitted to RA-L</p></details> |
| **[Reinforced Imitative Trajectory Planning for Urban Automated Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15607v2)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) faces challenges in trajectory planning for urban automated driving due to the poor convergence of RL and the difficulty in designing reward functions. Consequently, few RL-based trajectory planning methods can achieve performance comparable to that of imitation learning-based methods. The convergence problem is alleviated by combining RL with supervised learning. However, most existing approaches only reason one step ahead and lack the capability to plan for multiple future steps. Besides, although inverse reinforcement learning holds promise for solving the reward function design issue, existing methods for automated driving impose a linear structure assumption on reward functions, making them difficult to apply to urban automated driving. In light of these challenges, this paper proposes a novel RL-based trajectory planning method that integrates RL with imitation learning to enable multi-step planning. Furthermore, a transformer-based Bayesian reward function is developed, providing effective reward signals for RL in urban scenarios. Moreover, a hybrid-driven trajectory planning framework is proposed to enhance safety and interpretability. The proposed methods were validated on the large-scale real-world urban automated driving nuPlan dataset. Evaluated using closed-loop metrics, the results demonstrated that the proposed method significantly outperformed the baseline employing the identical policy model structure and achieved competitive performance compared to the state-of-the-art method. The code is available at https://github.com/Zigned/nuplan_zigned.</p></details> | 21 pages, 9 figures |
| **[InSyn: Modeling Complex Interactions for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13397v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate pedestrian trajectory prediction is crucial for intelligent applications, yet it remains highly challenging due to the complexity of interactions among pedestrians. Previous methods have primarily relied on relative positions to model pedestrian interactions; however, they tend to overlook specific interaction patterns such as paired walking or conflicting behaviors, limiting the prediction accuracy in crowded scenarios. To address this issue, we propose InSyn (Interaction-Synchronization Network), a novel Transformer-based model that explicitly captures diverse interaction patterns (e.g., walking in sync or conflicting) while effectively modeling direction-sensitive social behaviors. Additionally, we introduce a training strategy termed Seq-Start of Seq (SSOS), designed to alleviate the common issue of initial-step divergence in numerical time-series prediction. Experiments on the ETH and UCY datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms recent baselines significantly, especially in high-density scenarios. Furthermore, the SSOS strategy proves effective in improving sequential prediction performance, reducing the initial-step prediction error by approximately 6.58%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fast and Scalable Game-Theoretic Trajectory Planning with Intentional Uncertainties](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12174v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory planning involving multi-agent interactions has been a long-standing challenge in the field of robotics, primarily burdened by the inherent yet intricate interactions among agents. While game-theoretic methods are widely acknowledged for their effectiveness in managing multi-agent interactions, significant impediments persist when it comes to accommodating the intentional uncertainties of agents. In the context of intentional uncertainties, the heavy computational burdens associated with existing game-theoretic methods are induced, leading to inefficiencies and poor scalability. In this paper, we propose a novel game-theoretic interactive trajectory planning method to effectively address the intentional uncertainties of agents, and it demonstrates both high efficiency and enhanced scalability. As the underpinning basis, we model the interactions between agents under intentional uncertainties as a general Bayesian game, and we show that its agent-form equivalence can be represented as a potential game under certain minor assumptions. The existence and attainability of the optimal interactive trajectories are illustrated, as the corresponding Bayesian Nash equilibrium can be attained by optimizing a unified optimization problem. Additionally, we present a distributed algorithm based on the dual consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) tailored to the parallel solving of the problem, thereby significantly improving the scalability. The attendant outcomes from simulations and experiments demonstrate that the proposed method is effective across a range of scenarios characterized by general forms of intentional uncertainties. Its scalability surpasses that of existing centralized and decentralized baselines, allowing for real-time interactive trajectory planning in uncertain game settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Foresight in Motion: Reinforcing Trajectory Prediction with Reward Heuristics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12083v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motion forecasting for on-road traffic agents presents both a significant challenge and a critical necessity for ensuring safety in autonomous driving systems. In contrast to most existing data-driven approaches that directly predict future trajectories, we rethink this task from a planning perspective, advocating a "First Reasoning, Then Forecasting" strategy that explicitly incorporates behavior intentions as spatial guidance for trajectory prediction. To achieve this, we introduce an interpretable, reward-driven intention reasoner grounded in a novel query-centric Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) scheme. Our method first encodes traffic agents and scene elements into a unified vectorized representation, then aggregates contextual features through a query-centric paradigm. This enables the derivation of a reward distribution, a compact yet informative representation of the target agent's behavior within the given scene context via IRL. Guided by this reward heuristic, we perform policy rollouts to reason about multiple plausible intentions, providing valuable priors for subsequent trajectory generation. Finally, we develop a hierarchical DETR-like decoder integrated with bidirectional selective state space models to produce accurate future trajectories along with their associated probabilities. Extensive experiments on the large-scale Argoverse and nuScenes motion forecasting datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances trajectory prediction confidence, achieving highly competitive performance relative to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[Schrödinger Bridge Consistency Trajectory Models for Speech Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11925v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speech enhancement (SE) utilizing diffusion models is a promising technology that improves speech quality in noisy speech data. Furthermore, the Schr\"odinger bridge (SB) has recently been used in diffusion-based SE to improve speech quality by resolving a mismatch between the endpoint of the forward process and the starting point of the reverse process. However, the SB still exhibits slow inference owing to the necessity of a large number of function evaluations (NFE) for inference to obtain high-quality results. While Consistency Models (CMs) address this issue by employing consistency training that uses distillation from pretrained models in the field of image generation, it does not improve generation quality when the number of steps increases. As a solution to this problem, Consistency Trajectory Models (CTMs) not only accelerate inference speed but also maintain a favorable trade-off between quality and speed. Furthermore, SoundCTM demonstrates the applicability of CTM techniques to the field of sound generation. In this paper, we present Schr\"odinger bridge Consistency Trajectory Models (SBCTM) by applying the CTM's technique to the Schr\"odinger bridge for SE. Additionally, we introduce a novel auxiliary loss, including a perceptual loss, into the original CTM's training framework. As a result, SBCTM achieves an approximately 16x improvement in the real-time factor (RTF) compared to the conventional Schr\"odinger bridge for SE. Furthermore, the favorable trade-off between quality and speed in SBCTM allows for time-efficient inference by limiting multi-step refinement to cases where 1-step inference is insufficient. Our code, pretrained models, and audio samples are available at https://github.com/sony/sbctm/.</p></details> |  |

This research addresses a gap in delay prediction studies within the Dutch railway network by employing an XGBoost Classifier with a focus on topological features. Current research predominantly emphasizes short-term predictions and neglects the broader network-wide patterns essential for mitigating ripple effects. This research implements and improves an existing methodology, originally designed to forecast the evolution of the fast-changing US air network, to predict delays in the Dutch Railways. By integrating Node Centrality Measures and comparing multiple classifiers like RandomForest, DecisionTree, GradientBoosting, AdaBoost, and LogisticRegression, the goal is to predict delayed trajectories. However, the results reveal limited performance, especially in non-simultaneous testing scenarios, suggesting the necessity for more context-specific adaptations. Regardless, this research contributes to the understanding of transportation network evaluation and proposes future directions for developing more robust predictive models for delays.</p></details> |  |
| **[LF: Online Multi-Robot Path Planning Meets Optimal Trajectory Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11464v1)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a multi-robot control paradigm to solve point-to-point navigation tasks for a team of holonomic robots with access to the full environment information. The framework invokes two processes asynchronously at high frequency: (i) a centralized, discrete, and full-horizon planner for computing collision- and deadlock-free paths rapidly, leveraging recent advances in multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF), and (ii) dynamics-aware, robot-wise optimal trajectory controllers that ensure all robots independently follow their assigned paths reliably. This hierarchical shift in planning representation from (i) discrete and coupled to (ii) continuous and decoupled domains enables the framework to maintain long-term scalable motion synthesis. As an instantiation of this idea, we present LF, which combines a fast state-of-the-art MAPF solver (LaCAM), and a robust feedback control stack (Freyja) for executing agile robot maneuvers. LF provides a robust and versatile mechanism for lifelong multi-robot navigation even under asynchronous and partial goal updates, and adapts to dynamic workspaces simply by quick replanning. We present various multirotor and ground robot demonstrations, including the deployment of 15 real multirotors with random, consecutive target updates while a person walks through the operational workspace.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages; under review for IEEE Robotics & Automation - Letters (RA-L)</p></details> |

While many imputation methods have been proposed for spatiotemporal data, they are not well-suited for multi-agent sports scenarios where player movements are highly dynamic and inter-agent interactions continuously evolve. To address these challenges, we propose MIDAS (Multi-agent Imputer with Derivative-Accumulating Self-ensemble), a framework that imputes multi-agent trajectories with high accuracy and physical plausibility. It jointly predicts positions, velocities, and accelerations through a Set Transformer-based neural network and generates alternative estimates by recursively accumulating predicted velocity and acceleration values. These predictions are then combined using a learnable weighted ensemble to produce final imputed trajectories. Experiments on three sports datasets demonstrate that MIDAS significantly outperforms existing baselines in both positional accuracy and physical plausibility. Lastly, we showcase use cases of MIDAS, such as approximating total distance and pass success probability, to highlight its applicability to practical downstream tasks that require complete tracking data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ECML/PKDD 2025</p></details> |

However, expert-provided instructions are limited in quantity, while synthesized annotations often lack quality, making them insufficient for large-scale research. To address this, we propose NavComposer, a novel framework for automatically generating high-quality navigation instructions. NavComposer explicitly decomposes semantic entities such as actions, scenes, and objects, and recomposes them into natural language instructions. Its modular architecture allows flexible integration of state-of-the-art techniques, while the explicit use of semantic entities enhances both the richness and accuracy of instructions. Moreover, it operates in a data-agnostic manner, supporting adaptation to diverse navigation trajectories without domain-specific training. Complementing NavComposer, we introduce NavInstrCritic, a comprehensive annotation-free evaluation system that assesses navigation instructions on three dimensions: contrastive matching, semantic consistency, and linguistic diversity. NavInstrCritic provides a holistic evaluation of instruction quality, addressing limitations of traditional metrics that rely heavily on expert annotations. By decoupling instruction generation and evaluation from specific navigation agents, our method enables more scalable and generalizable research. Extensive experiments provide direct and practical evidence for the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> |  |

While the lack of exact latent inversion is a core advantage of these methods, it often results in unstable editing trajectories and poor source consistency. To address this limitation, we propose {\em FlowAlign}, a novel inversion-free flow-based framework for consistent image editing with optimal control-based trajectory control. Specifically, FlowAlign introduces source similarity at the terminal point as a regularization term to promote smoother and more consistent trajectories during the editing process. Notably, our terminal point regularization is shown to explicitly balance semantic alignment with the edit prompt and structural consistency with the source image along the trajectory. Furthermore, FlowAlign naturally supports reverse editing by simply reversing the ODE trajectory, highliting the reversible and consistent nature of the transformation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlowAlign outperforms existing methods in both source preservation and editing controllability.</p></details> |  |

While existing methods primarily focus on modeling observed motion patterns and interactions with other vehicles, they often neglect the potential risks posed by the uncertain or aggressive behaviors of surrounding vehicles. In this paper, we propose a novel spatial-temporal risk-attentive trajectory prediction framework that incorporates a risk potential field to assess perceived risks arising from behaviors of nearby vehicles. The framework leverages a spatial-temporal encoder and a risk-attentive feature fusion decoder to embed the risk potential field into the extracted spatial-temporal feature representations for trajectory prediction. A risk-scaled loss function is further designed to improve the prediction accuracy of high-risk scenarios, such as short relative spacing. Experiments on the widely used NGSIM and HighD datasets demonstrate that our method reduces average prediction errors by 4.8% and 31.2% respectively compared to state-of-the-art approaches, especially in high-risk scenarios. The proposed framework provides interpretable, risk-aware predictions, contributing to more robust decision-making for autonomous driving systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, accepted at ITSC 2025</p></details> |

In this work, we explore their potential and introduce the surprising result that naively applying standards MDMs severely degrades the performance. We identify the critical cause of this issue as a state-clashing problem-where the forward diffusion of distinct molecules collapse into a common state, resulting in a mixture of reconstruction targets that cannot be learned using typical reverse diffusion process with unimodal predictions. To mitigate this, we propose Masked Element-wise Learnable Diffusion (MELD) that orchestrates per-element corruption trajectories to avoid collision between distinct molecular graphs. This is achieved through a parameterized noise scheduling network that assigns distinct corruption rates to individual graph elements, i.e., atoms and bonds. Extensive experiments on diverse molecular benchmarks reveal that MELD markedly enhances overall generation quality compared to element-agnostic noise scheduling, increasing the chemical validity of vanilla MDMs on ZINC250K from 15% to 93%, Furthermore, it achieves state-of-the-art property alignment in conditional generation tasks.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods for detecting driving trajectories typically rely on map-matching the path using Global Positioning System (GPS) data, which is susceptible to GPS data outage. This paper introduces CAN-Trace, a novel privacy attack mechanism that leverages Controller Area Network (CAN) messages to uncover driving trajectories, posing a significant risk to drivers' long-term privacy. A new trajectory reconstruction algorithm is proposed to transform the CAN messages, specifically vehicle speed and accelerator pedal position, into weighted graphs accommodating various driving statuses. CAN-Trace identifies driving trajectories using graph-matching algorithms applied to the created graphs in comparison to road networks. We also design a new metric to evaluate matched candidates, which allows for potential data gaps and matching inaccuracies. Empirical validation under various real-world conditions, encompassing different vehicles and driving regions, demonstrates the efficacy of CAN-Trace: it achieves an attack success rate of up to 90.59% in the urban region, and 99.41% in the suburban region.</p></details> |  |

CTP supports fast, single-step trajectory generation without significant degradation in policy quality. We evaluate CTP on the D4RL benchmark and show that it consistently outperforms existing diffusion-based planning methods in long-horizon, goal-conditioned tasks. Notably, CTP achieves higher normalized returns while using significantly fewer denoising steps. In particular, CTP achieves comparable performance with over $120\times$ speedup in inference time, demonstrating its practicality and effectiveness for high-performance, low-latency offline planning.</p></details> |  |

These include heavy computational burdens for mapping, sensor occlusion failures for UAVs, and traversal challenges on irregular terrain for UGVs, all compounded by a lack of perception-aware strategies. To address these challenges, we introduce Random Mapping and Random Projection (RMRP). This method constructs a lightweight linear parametric map by first mapping data to a high-dimensional space, followed by a sparse random projection for dimensionality reduction. Our novel Residual Energy Preservation Theorem provides theoretical guarantees for this process, ensuring critical geometric properties are preserved. Based on this map, we propose the RPATR (Robust Perception-Aware Trajectory Planner) framework. For UAVs, our method unifies grid and Euclidean Signed Distance Field (ESDF) maps. The front-end uses an analytical occupancy gradient to refine initial paths for safety and smoothness, while the back-end uses a closed-form ESDF for trajectory optimization. Leveraging the trained RMRP model's generalization, the planner predicts unobserved areas for proactive navigation. For UGVs, the model characterizes terrain and provides closed-form gradients, enabling online planning to circumvent large holes. Validated in diverse scenarios, our framework demonstrates superior mapping performance in time, memory, and accuracy, and enables computationally efficient, safe navigation for high-speed UAVs and UGVs. The code will be released to foster community collaboration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Robotics (TRO) in July 2025</p></details> |
| **[Shortening the Trajectories: Identity-Aware Gaussian Approximation for Efficient 3D Molecular Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09043v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gaussian-based Probabilistic Generative Models (GPGMs) generate data by reversing a stochastic process that progressively corrupts samples with Gaussian noise. While these models have achieved state-of-the-art performance across diverse domains, their practical deployment remains constrained by the high computational cost of long generative trajectories, which often involve hundreds to thousands of steps during training and sampling. In this work, we introduce a theoretically grounded and empirically validated framework that improves generation efficiency without sacrificing training granularity or inference fidelity. Our key insight is that for certain data modalities, the noising process causes data to rapidly lose its identity and converge toward a Gaussian distribution. We analytically identify a characteristic step at which the data has acquired sufficient Gaussianity, and then replace the remaining generation trajectory with a closed-form Gaussian approximation. Unlike existing acceleration techniques that coarsening the trajectories by skipping steps, our method preserves the full resolution of learning dynamics while avoiding redundant stochastic perturbations between `Gaussian-like' distributions. Empirical results across multiple data modalities demonstrate substantial improvements in both sample quality and computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[GoalNet: Goal Areas Oriented Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19002v2)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting the future trajectories of pedestrians on the road is an important task for autonomous driving. The pedestrian trajectory prediction is affected by scene paths, pedestrian's intentions and decision-making, which is a multi-modal problem. Most recent studies use past trajectories to predict a variety of potential future trajectory distributions, which do not account for the scene context and pedestrian targets. Instead of predicting the future trajectory directly, we propose to use scene context and observed trajectory to predict the goal points first, and then reuse the goal points to predict the future trajectories. By leveraging the information from scene context and observed trajectory, the uncertainty can be limited to a few target areas, which represent the "goals" of the pedestrians. In this paper, we propose GoalNet, a new trajectory prediction neural network based on the goal areas of a pedestrian. Our network can predict both pedestrian's trajectories and bounding boxes. The overall model is efficient and modular, and its outputs can be changed according to the usage scenario. Experimental results show that GoalNet significantly improves the previous state-of-the-art performance by 48.7% on the JAAD and 40.8% on the PIE dataset.</p></details> |  |

| **[TPK: Trustworthy Trajectory Prediction Integrating Prior Knowledge For Interpretability and Kinematic Feasibility](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06743v2)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is crucial for autonomous driving, enabling vehicles to navigate safely by anticipating the movements of surrounding road users. However, current deep learning models often lack trustworthiness as their predictions can be physically infeasible and illogical to humans. To make predictions more trustworthy, recent research has incorporated prior knowledge, like the social force model for modeling interactions and kinematic models for physical realism. However, these approaches focus on priors that suit either vehicles or pedestrians and do not generalize to traffic with mixed agent classes. We propose incorporating interaction and kinematic priors of all agent classes--vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists with class-specific interaction layers to capture agent behavioral differences. To improve the interpretability of the agent interactions, we introduce DG-SFM, a rule-based interaction importance score that guides the interaction layer. To ensure physically feasible predictions, we proposed suitable kinematic models for all agent classes with a novel pedestrian kinematic model. We benchmark our approach on the Argoverse 2 dataset, using the state-of-the-art transformer HPTR as our baseline. Experiments demonstrate that our method improves interaction interpretability, revealing a correlation between incorrect predictions and divergence from our interaction prior. Even though incorporating the kinematic models causes a slight decrease in accuracy, they eliminate infeasible trajectories found in the dataset and the baseline model. Thus, our approach fosters trust in trajectory prediction as its interaction reasoning is interpretable, and its predictions adhere to physics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in the 36th IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV 2025) for oral presentation.

| **[Boundary-Guided Trajectory Prediction for Road Aware and Physically Feasible Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06740v2)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of surrounding road users' trajectories is essential for safe and efficient autonomous driving. While deep learning models have improved performance, challenges remain in preventing off-road predictions and ensuring kinematic feasibility. Existing methods incorporate road-awareness modules and enforce kinematic constraints but lack plausibility guarantees and often introduce trade-offs in complexity and flexibility. This paper proposes a novel framework that formulates trajectory prediction as a constrained regression guided by permissible driving directions and their boundaries. Using the agent's current state and an HD map, our approach defines the valid boundaries and ensures on-road predictions by training the network to learn superimposed paths between left and right boundary polylines. To guarantee feasibility, the model predicts acceleration profiles that determine the vehicle's travel distance along these paths while adhering to kinematic constraints. We evaluate our approach on the Argoverse-2 dataset against the HPTR baseline. Our approach shows a slight decrease in benchmark metrics compared to HPTR but notably improves final displacement error and eliminates infeasible trajectories. Moreover, the proposed approach has superior generalization to less prevalent maneuvers and unseen out-of-distribution scenarios, reducing the off-road rate under adversarial attacks from 66% to just 1%. These results highlight the effectiveness of our approach in generating feasible and robust predictions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in the 36th IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV 2025)</p></details> |
| **[T-GVC: Trajectory-Guided Generative Video Coding at Ultra-Low Bitrates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07633v2)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in video generation techniques have given rise to an emerging paradigm of generative video coding, aiming to achieve semantically accurate reconstructions in Ultra-Low Bitrate (ULB) scenarios by leveraging strong generative priors. However, most existing methods are limited by domain specificity (e.g., facial or human videos) or an excessive dependence on high-level text guidance, which often fails to capture motion details and results in unrealistic reconstructions. To address these challenges, we propose a Trajectory-Guided Generative Video Coding framework (dubbed T-GVC). T-GVC employs a semantic-aware sparse motion sampling pipeline to effectively bridge low-level motion tracking with high-level semantic understanding by extracting pixel-wise motion as sparse trajectory points based on their semantic importance, not only significantly reducing the bitrate but also preserving critical temporal semantic information. In addition, by incorporating trajectory-aligned loss constraints into diffusion processes, we introduce a training-free latent space guidance mechanism to ensure physically plausible motion patterns without sacrificing the inherent capabilities of generative models. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms both traditional codecs and state-of-the-art end-to-end video compression methods under ULB conditions. Furthermore, additional experiments confirm that our approach achieves more precise motion control than existing text-guided methods, paving the way for a novel direction of generative video coding guided by geometric motion modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Offline Trajectory Optimization for Offline Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10393v2)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn policies without online explorations. To enlarge the training data, model-based offline RL learns a dynamics model which is utilized as a virtual environment to generate simulation data and enhance policy learning. However, existing data augmentation methods for offline RL suffer from (i) trivial improvement from short-horizon simulation; and (ii) the lack of evaluation and correction for generated data, leading to low-qualified augmentation. In this paper, we propose offline trajectory optimization for offline reinforcement learning (OTTO). The key motivation is to conduct long-horizon simulation and then utilize model uncertainty to evaluate and correct the augmented data. Specifically, we propose an ensemble of Transformers, a.k.a. World Transformers, to predict environment state dynamics and the reward function. Three strategies are proposed to use World Transformers to generate long-horizon trajectory simulation by perturbing the actions in the offline data. Then, an uncertainty-based World Evaluator is introduced to firstly evaluate the confidence of the generated trajectories and then perform the correction for low-confidence data. Finally, we jointly use the original data with the corrected augmentation data to train an offline RL algorithm. OTTO serves as a plug-in module and can be integrated with existing model-free offline RL methods. Experiments on various benchmarks show that OTTO can effectively improve the performance of representative offline RL algorithms, including in complex environments with sparse rewards like AntMaze.

Existing approaches struggle as they rely on static augmentations that fail under object deformations, occlusions, and camera movement, leading to inconsistent feature learning over time. We propose a motion-guided self-supervised learning framework that clusters dense point tracks to learn spatiotemporally consistent representations. By leveraging an off-the-shelf point tracker, we extract long-range motion trajectories and optimize feature clustering through a momentum-encoder-based optimal transport mechanism. To ensure temporal coherence, we propagate cluster assignments along tracked points, enforcing feature consistency across views despite viewpoint changes. Integrating motion as an implicit supervisory signal, our method learns representations that generalize across frames, improving robustness in dynamic scenes and challenging occlusion scenarios. By initializing from strong image-pretrained models and leveraging video data for training, we improve state-of-the-art by 1% to 6% on six image and video datasets and four evaluation benchmarks. The implementation is publicly available at our GitHub repository: https://github.com/SMSD75/MoSiC/tree/main</p></details> | Accepted to ICCV2025 |

In autonomous driving scenarios, there is rarely a single suitable trajectory. Recent methods have increasingly focused on modeling multimodal trajectory distributions. However, they suffer from trajectory selection complexity and reduced trajectory quality due to high trajectory divergence and inconsistencies between guidance and scene information. To address these issues, we introduce GoalFlow, a novel method that effectively constrains the generative process to produce high-quality, multimodal trajectories. To resolve the trajectory divergence problem inherent in diffusion-based methods, GoalFlow constrains the generated trajectories by introducing a goal point. GoalFlow establishes a novel scoring mechanism that selects the most appropriate goal point from the candidate points based on scene information. Furthermore, GoalFlow employs an efficient generative method, Flow Matching, to generate multimodal trajectories, and incorporates a refined scoring mechanism to select the optimal trajectory from the candidates. Our experimental results, validated on the Navsim\cite{Dauner2024_navsim}, demonstrate that GoalFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering robust multimodal trajectories for autonomous driving. GoalFlow achieved PDMS of 90.3, significantly surpassing other methods. Compared with other diffusion-policy-based methods, our approach requires only a single denoising step to obtain excellent performance.

We present a perception-aware framework that couples an evidential learning-based SCR pose estimator with a receding horizon trajectory optimizer. The optimizer steers the onboard camera toward pixels whose uncertainty predicts reliable scene coordinates, while a fixed-lag smoother fuses the low rate SCR stream with high rate IMU data to close the perception control loop in real time. In simulation, our planner reduces translation (rotation) mean error by 54% / 15% (40% / 31%) relative to yaw fixed and forward-looking baselines, respectively.

Current approaches tokenize videos using space-time patches, leading to excessive tokens and computational inefficiencies. The best token reduction strategies degrade performance and barely reduce the number of tokens when the camera moves. We introduce grounded video tokenization, a paradigm that organizes tokens based on panoptic sub-object trajectories rather than fixed patches. Our method aligns with fundamental perceptual principles, ensuring that tokenization reflects scene complexity rather than video duration. We propose TrajViT, a video encoder that extracts object trajectories and converts them into semantically meaningful tokens, significantly reducing redundancy while maintaining temporal coherence. Trained with contrastive learning, TrajViT significantly outperforms space-time ViT (ViT3D) across multiple video understanding benchmarks, e.g., TrajViT outperforms ViT3D by a large margin of 6% top-5 recall in average at video-text retrieval task with 10x token deduction. We also show TrajViT as a stronger model than ViT3D for being the video encoder for modern VideoLLM, obtaining an average of 5.2% performance improvement across 6 VideoQA benchmarks while having 4x faster training time and 18x less inference FLOPs. TrajViT is the first efficient encoder to consistently outperform ViT3D across diverse video analysis tasks, making it a robust and scalable solution.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |
| **[Physics-Grounded Motion Forecasting via Equation Discovery for Trajectory-Guided Image-to-Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06830v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in diffusion-based and autoregressive video generation models have achieved remarkable visual realism. However, these models typically lack accurate physical alignment, failing to replicate real-world dynamics in object motion. This limitation arises primarily from their reliance on learned statistical correlations rather than capturing mechanisms adhering to physical laws. To address this issue, we introduce a novel framework that integrates symbolic regression (SR) and trajectory-guided image-to-video (I2V) models for physics-grounded video forecasting. Our approach extracts motion trajectories from input videos, uses a retrieval-based pre-training mechanism to enhance symbolic regression, and discovers equations of motion to forecast physically accurate future trajectories. These trajectories then guide video generation without requiring fine-tuning of existing models. Evaluated on scenarios in Classical Mechanics, including spring-mass, pendulums, and projectile motions, our method successfully recovers ground-truth analytical equations and improves the physical alignment of generated videos over baseline methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[ILNet: Trajectory Prediction with Inverse Learning Attention for Enhancing Intention Capture](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06531v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction for multi-agent interaction scenarios is a crucial challenge. Most advanced methods model agent interactions by efficiently factorized attention based on the temporal and agent axes. However, this static and foward modeling lacks explicit interactive spatio-temporal coordination, capturing only obvious and immediate behavioral intentions. Alternatively, the modern trajectory prediction framework refines the successive predictions by a fixed-anchor selection strategy, which is difficult to adapt in different future environments. It is acknowledged that human drivers dynamically adjust initial driving decisions based on further assumptions about the intentions of surrounding vehicles. Motivated by human driving behaviors, this paper proposes ILNet, a multi-agent trajectory prediction method with Inverse Learning (IL) attention and Dynamic Anchor Selection (DAS) module. IL Attention employs an inverse learning paradigm to model interactions at neighboring moments, introducing proposed intentions to dynamically encode the spatio-temporal coordination of interactions, thereby enhancing the model's ability to capture complex interaction patterns. Then, the learnable DAS module is proposed to extract multiple trajectory change keypoints as anchors in parallel with almost no increase in parameters. Experimental results show that the ILNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the INTERACTION and Argoverse motion forecasting datasets. Particularly, in challenged interaction scenarios, ILNet achieves higher accuracy and more multimodal distributions of trajectories over fewer parameters.

However, quality growing data of plants at scale is difficult to generate. Here we use a mobile robotic platform to capture high-resolution environmental sensing and phenotyping measurements of a large-scale hydroponic leafy greens system. We describe a self-supervised modeling approach to build a map from observed growing data to the entire plant growth trajectory. We demonstrate our approach by forecasting future plant height and harvest mass of crops in this system. This approach represents a significant advance in combining robotic automation and machine learning, as well as providing actionable insights for agronomic research and operational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Driving View Synthesis on Free-form Trajectories with Generative Prior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01717v3)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Driving view synthesis along free-form trajectories is essential for realistic driving simulations, enabling closed-loop evaluation of end-to-end driving policies. Existing methods excel at view interpolation along recorded paths but struggle to generalize to novel trajectories due to limited viewpoints in driving videos. To tackle this challenge, we propose DriveX, a novel free-form driving view synthesis framework, that progressively distills generative prior into the 3D Gaussian model during its optimization. Within this framework, we utilize a video diffusion model to refine the degraded novel trajectory renderings from the in-training Gaussian model, while the restored videos in turn serve as additional supervision for optimizing the 3D Gaussian. Concretely, we craft an inpainting-based video restoration task, which can disentangle the identification of degraded regions from the generative capability of the diffusion model and remove the need of simulating specific degraded pattern in the training of the diffusion model. To further enhance the consistency and fidelity of generated contents, the pseudo ground truth is progressively updated with gradually improved novel trajectory rendering, allowing both components to co-adapt and reinforce each other while minimizing the disruption on the optimization. By tightly integrating 3D scene representation with generative prior, DriveX achieves high-quality view synthesis beyond recorded trajectories in real time--unlocking new possibilities for flexible and realistic driving simulations on free-form trajectories.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |

The context itself can be static (lanes, regulatory elements, etc) or dynamic (traffic participants). This paper presents a lane graph-based motion prediction model that first predicts graph-based goal proposals and later fuses them with cross attention over multiple contextual elements. We follow the famous encoder-interactor-decoder architecture where the encoder encodes scene context using lightweight Gated Recurrent Units, the interactor applies cross-context attention over encoded scene features and graph goal proposals, and the decoder regresses multimodal trajectories via Laplacian Mixture Density Network from the aggregated encodings. Using cross-attention over graph-based goal proposals gives robust trajectory estimates since the model learns to attend to future goal-relevant scene elements for the intended agent. We evaluate our work on nuScenes motion prediction dataset, achieving state-of-the-art results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging the Spatial Hierarchy: Coarse-to-fine Trajectory Generation via Cascaded Hybrid Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13366v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban mobility data has significant connections with economic growth and plays an essential role in various smart-city applications. However, due to privacy concerns and substantial data collection costs, fine-grained human mobility trajectories are difficult to become publicly available on a large scale. A promising solution to address this issue is trajectory synthesizing. However, existing works often ignore the inherent structural complexity of trajectories, unable to handle complicated high-dimensional distributions and generate realistic fine-grained trajectories. In this paper, we propose Cardiff, a coarse-to-fine Cascaded hybrid diffusion-based trajectory synthesizing framework for fine-grained and privacy-preserving mobility generation. By leveraging the hierarchical nature of urban mobility, Cardiff decomposes the generation process into two distinct levels, i.e., discrete road segment-level and continuous fine-grained GPS-level: (i) In the segment-level, to reduce computational costs and redundancy in raw trajectories, we first encode the discrete road segments into low-dimensional latent embeddings and design a diffusion transformer-based latent denoising network for segment-level trajectory synthesis. (ii) Taking the first stage of generation as conditions, we then design a fine-grained GPS-level conditional denoising network with a noise augmentation mechanism to achieve robust and high-fidelity generation. Additionally, the Cardiff framework not only progressively generates high-fidelity trajectories through cascaded denoising but also flexibly enables a tunable balance between privacy preservation and utility. Experimental results on three large real-world trajectory datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in various metrics.</p></details> |  |

However, due to the imbalance between self-consistency and cross-consistency, these CD-based methods inherently suffer from improper conditional guidance, leading to sub-optimal generation results. To address this issue, we present SegmentDreamer, a novel framework designed to fully unleash the potential of consistency models for high-fidelity text-to-3D generation. Specifically, we reformulate SDS through the proposed Segmented Consistency Trajectory Distillation (SCTD), effectively mitigating the imbalance issues by explicitly defining the relationship between self- and cross-consistency. Moreover, SCTD partitions the Probability Flow Ordinary Differential Equation (PF-ODE) trajectory into multiple sub-trajectories and ensures consistency within each segment, which can theoretically provide a significantly tighter upper bound on distillation error. Additionally, we propose a distillation pipeline for a more swift and stable generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our SegmentDreamer outperforms state-of-the-art methods in visual quality, enabling high-fidelity 3D asset creation through 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025, project page: https://zjhjojo.github.io/</p></details> |

Marginal prediction models commonly forecast each agent's future trajectories independently, often leading to sub-optimal planning decisions for an automated vehicle. In contrast, joint prediction models explicitly account for the interactions between agents, yielding socially and physically consistent predictions on a scene level. However, existing approaches differ not only in their problem formulation but also in the model architectures and implementation details used, making it difficult to compare them. In this work, we systematically investigate different approaches to joint motion prediction, including post-processing of the marginal predictions, explicitly training the model for joint predictions, and framing the problem as a generative task. We evaluate each approach in terms of prediction accuracy, multi-modality, and inference efficiency, offering a comprehensive analysis of the strengths and limitations of each approach.

Testing on a longitudinal dataset of N=45 individuals affected by General Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and/or Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) derived from Fisher et al. 2017, we propose a novel pipeline for the analysis of the temporal dynamics of psychopathological symptoms. First, we employ the PCMCI+ algorithm with nonparametric independence test to determine the causal network of nonlinear dependencies between symptoms in individuals with different mental disorders. We found that the PCMCI+ effectively highlights the individual peculiarities of each symptom network, which could be leveraged towards personalized therapies. At the same time, aggregating the networks by diagnosis sheds light to disorder-specific causal mechanisms, in agreement with previous psychopathological literature. Then, we enrich the dataset by computing complexity-based measures (e.g. entropy, fractal dimension, recurrence) from the symptom time series, and feed it to a suitably selected machine learning algorithm to aid the diagnosis of each individual. The new dataset yields 91% accuracy in the classification of the symptom dynamics, proving to be an effective diagnostic support tool. Overall, these findings highlight how integrating causal modeling and temporal complexity can enhance diagnostic differentiation, offering a principled, data-driven foundation for both personalized assessment in clinical psychology and structural advances in psychological research.</p></details> |  |

We evaluate a state-of-the-art model using our novel L4 Motion Forecasting dataset based on our own data recordings in Germany and the US. This includes enhanced map and agent features. We compare our dataset to the US-centric Argoverse 2 benchmark. First, we find that incorporating supplementary map and agent features unique to our dataset, yields no measurable improvement over baseline features, demonstrating that modern architectures do not need extensive feature sets for optimal performance. The limited features of public datasets are sufficient to capture convoluted interactions without added complexity. Second, we perform cross-dataset experiments to evaluate how effective domain knowledge can be transferred between datasets. Third, we group our dataset by country and check the knowledge transfer between different driving cultures.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by the success of RL in language models, there is growing interest in further improving the models by alignment with a certain reward. In this work, we propose a novel preference optimization method for masked discrete diffusion models through a principled diffusion trajectory alignment. Instead of applying the reward on the final output and backpropagating the gradient to the entire discrete denoising process, we decompose the problem into a set of stepwise alignment objectives. This framework enables efficient diffusion optimization, is compatible with arbitrary reward functions, and importantly, guarantees an equivalent optimal solution under additive factorization of the trajectory reward. Experiments across multiple domains including DNA sequence design, protein inverse folding, and language modeling consistently demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Notably, it achieves an up to 12\% improvement over the most competitive RL-based baseline in terms of predicted activity on DNA sequence design, and further improves the GSM8K score from 78.6 to 80.7 on LLaDA-8B-Instruct for language modeling.</p></details> | 22 pages, 3 figures |

We use the Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis as the source of supervision during the training process, allowing us to consider general nonlinear dynamics and arbitrary constraints. The proposed method is extensively evaluated against relevant baselines in simulations for different environments and robot dynamics. The results show an increase in success rate of up to 52% compared to the best baseline while maintaining comparable execution speed.

As each state of an agent is closely related to the states of adjacent time steps, capturing the local temporal dependency is beneficial for prediction, while most studies often overlook it. Besides, learning the high-order motion state attributes is expected to enhance spatial interaction modeling, but it is rarely seen in previous works. To address this, we propose a lightweight framework, LTMSformer, to extract temporal-spatial interaction features for multi-modal trajectory prediction. Specifically, we introduce a Local Trend-Aware Attention mechanism to capture the local temporal dependency by leveraging a convolutional attention mechanism with hierarchical local time boxes. Next, to model the spatial interaction dependency, we build a Motion State Encoder to incorporate high-order motion state attributes, such as acceleration, jerk, heading, etc. To further refine the trajectory prediction, we propose a Lightweight Proposal Refinement Module that leverages Multi-Layer Perceptrons for trajectory embedding and generates the refined trajectories with fewer model parameters. Experiment results on the Argoverse 1 dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms the baseline HiVT-64, reducing the minADE by approximately 4.35%, the minFDE by 8.74%, and the MR by 20%. We also achieve higher accuracy than HiVT-128 with a 68% reduction in model size.</p></details> |  |

Accurate pedestrian trajectory prediction benefits autonomous vehicles and robots in planning their motion. Pedestrians' trajectories are greatly influenced by their intentions. Prior studies having introduced various deep learning methods only pay attention to the spatial and temporal information of trajectory, overlooking the explicit intention information. In this study, we introduce a novel model, termed the \textbf{S-T CRF}: \textbf{S}patial-\textbf{T}emporal \textbf{C}onditional \textbf{R}andom \textbf{F}ield, which judiciously incorporates intention information besides spatial and temporal information of trajectory. This model uses a Conditional Random Field (CRF) to generate a representation of future intentions, greatly improving the prediction of subsequent trajectories when combined with spatial-temporal representation. Furthermore, the study innovatively devises a space CRF loss and a time CRF loss, meticulously designed to enhance interaction constraints and temporal dynamics, respectively. Extensive experimental evaluations on dataset ETH/UCY and SDD demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses existing baseline approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predicting Drivers' Route Trajectories in Last-Mile Delivery Using A Pair-wise Attention-based Pointer Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03802v2)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In last-mile delivery, drivers frequently deviate from planned delivery routes because of their tacit knowledge of the road and curbside infrastructure, customer availability, and other characteristics of the respective service areas. Hence, the actual stop sequences chosen by an experienced human driver may be potentially preferable to the theoretical shortest-distance routing under real-life operational conditions. Thus, being able to predict the actual stop sequence that a human driver would follow can help to improve route planning in last-mile delivery. This paper proposes a pair-wise attention-based pointer neural network for this prediction task using drivers' historical delivery trajectory data. In addition to the commonly used encoder-decoder architecture for sequence-to-sequence prediction, we propose a new attention mechanism based on an alternative specific neural network to capture the local pair-wise information for each pair of stops. To further capture the global efficiency of the route, we propose a new iterative sequence generation algorithm that is used after model training to identify the first stop of a route that yields the lowest operational cost. Results from an extensive case study on real operational data from Amazon's last-mile delivery operations in the US show that our proposed method can significantly outperform traditional optimization-based approaches and other machine learning methods (such as the Long Short-Term Memory encoder-decoder and the original pointer network) in finding stop sequences that are closer to high-quality routes executed by experienced drivers in the field. Compared to benchmark models, the proposed model can increase the average prediction accuracy of the first four stops from around 0.229 to 0.312, and reduce the disparity between the predicted route and the actual route by around 15%.</p></details> |  |
| **[D4orm: Multi-Robot Trajectories with Dynamics-aware Diffusion Denoised Deformations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12204v2)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work presents an optimization method for generating kinodynamically feasible and collision-free multi-robot trajectories that exploits an incremental denoising scheme in diffusion models. Our key insight is that high-quality trajectories can be discovered merely by denoising noisy trajectories sampled from a distribution. This approach has no learning component, relying instead on only two ingredients: a dynamical model of the robots to obtain feasible trajectories via rollout, and a fitness function to guide denoising with Monte Carlo gradient approximation. The proposed framework iteratively optimizes a deformation for the previous trajectory with the current denoising process, allows anytime refinement as time permits, supports different dynamics, and benefits from GPU acceleration. Our evaluations for differential-drive and holonomic teams with up to 16 robots in 2D and 3D worlds show its ability to discover high-quality solutions faster than other black-box optimization methods such as MPPI. In a 2D holonomic case with 16 robots, it is almost twice as fast. As evidence for feasibility, we demonstrate zero-shot deployment of the planned trajectories on eight multirotors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 2025 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)</p></details> |
| **[VLM-TDP: VLM-guided Trajectory-conditioned Diffusion Policy for Robust Long-Horizon Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04524v1)** | 2025-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion policy has demonstrated promising performance in the field of robotic manipulation. However, its effectiveness has been primarily limited in short-horizon tasks, and its performance significantly degrades in the presence of image noise. To address these limitations, we propose a VLM-guided trajectory-conditioned diffusion policy (VLM-TDP) for robust and long-horizon manipulation. Specifically, the proposed method leverages state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) to decompose long-horizon tasks into concise, manageable sub-tasks, while also innovatively generating voxel-based trajectories for each sub-task. The generated trajectories serve as a crucial conditioning factor, effectively steering the diffusion policy and substantially enhancing its performance. The proposed Trajectory-conditioned Diffusion Policy (TDP) is trained on trajectories derived from demonstration data and validated using the trajectories generated by the VLM. Simulation experimental results indicate that our method significantly outperforms classical diffusion policies, achieving an average 44% increase in success rate, over 100% improvement in long-horizon tasks, and a 20% reduction in performance degradation in challenging conditions, such as noisy images or altered environments. These findings are further reinforced by our real-world experiments, where the performance gap becomes even more pronounced in long-horizon tasks.

| **[Rapid and Safe Trajectory Planning over Diverse Scenes through Diffusion Composition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04384v1)** | 2025-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safe trajectory planning remains a significant challenge in complex environments, where traditional methods often trade off computational efficiency for safety. Comprehensive obstacle modeling improves safety but is computationally expensive, while approximate methods are more efficient but may compromise safety. To address this issue, this paper introduces a rapid and safe trajectory planning framework based on state-based diffusion models. Leveraging only low-dimensional vehicle states, the diffusion models achieve notable inference efficiency while ensuring sufficient collision-free characteristics. By composing diffusion models, the proposed framework can safely generalize across diverse scenarios, planning collision-free trajectories even in unseen scenes. To further ensure the safety of the generated trajectories, an efficient, rule-based safety filter is proposed, which selects optimal trajectories that satisfy both sufficient safety and control feasibility from among candidate trajectories. Both in seen and unseen scenarios, the proposed method achieves efficient inference time while maintaining high safety and stability. Evaluations on the F1TENTH vehicle further demonstrate that the proposed method is practical in real-world applications.

However, effectively navigating complex and dynamic web environments still requires more advanced trajectory-level planning and execution. Prior studies have addressed self-improving agents by collecting extensive GUI trajectories from real-environment interactions. Despite their effectiveness, these approaches encounter two critical challenges: (1) Uncontrollable environment states, where real or sandboxed web environments often yield unstable and non-deterministic feedback, complicating the reproduction and debugging of agent behaviors; and (2) High API costs, as generating even a single interaction trajectory can involve hundreds of queries, leading to considerable API usage and computational expenses. To address these limitations and enable scalable self-improvement for agents, we propose WebSynthesis, a novel framework for trajectory synthesis and training. WebSynthesis leverages a learned world model to simulate virtual web environments, allowing a policy agent to perform efficient and reversible tree-based planning. This approach supports the large-scale generation of diverse and high-quality trajectories, which are subsequently utilized to refine the agent's policy. Experimental results demonstrate that an agent trained using WebSynthesis on a small-scale synthetic dataset achieves performance comparable to or even surpassing that of models trained on large-scale real-world data.</p></details> |  |
| **[K Nearest Neighbor-Guided Trajectory Similarity Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00285v2)** | 2025-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory similarity is fundamental to many spatio-temporal data mining applications. Recent studies propose deep learning models to approximate conventional trajectory similarity measures, exploiting their fast inference time once trained. Although efficient inference has been reported, challenges remain in similarity approximation accuracy due to difficulties in trajectory granularity modeling and in exploiting similarity signals in the training data. To fill this gap, we propose TSMini, a highly effective trajectory similarity model with a sub-view modeling mechanism capable of learning multi-granularity trajectory patterns and a k nearest neighbor-based loss that guides TSMini to learn not only absolute similarity values between trajectories but also their relative similarity ranks. Together, these two innovations enable highly accurate trajectory similarity approximation. Experiments show that TSMini can outperform the state-of-the-art models by 22% in accuracy on average when learning trajectory similarity measures.</p></details> |  |

Trajectory refinement has emerged as a key strategy to enhance prediction accuracy. However, existing refinement methods often overlook the topological relationships between trajectories, which are vital for improving prediction precision. Inspired by braid theory, we propose a novel trajectory refinement approach, Soft-Braid Refiner (SRefiner), guided by the soft-braid topological structure of trajectories using Soft-Braid Attention. Soft-Braid Attention captures spatio-temporal topological relationships between trajectories by considering both spatial proximity and vehicle motion states at ``soft intersection points". Additionally, we extend this approach to model interactions between trajectories and lanes, further improving the prediction accuracy. SRefiner is a multi-iteration, multi-agent framework that iteratively refines trajectories, incorporating topological information to enhance interactions within traffic scenarios. SRefiner achieves significant performance improvements over four baseline methods across two datasets, establishing a new state-of-the-art in trajectory refinement.

| **[AMD: Adaptive Momentum and Decoupled Contrastive Learning Framework for Robust Long-Tail Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01801v2)** | 2025-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately predicting the future trajectories of traffic agents is essential in autonomous driving. However, due to the inherent imbalance in trajectory distributions, tail data in natural datasets often represents more complex and hazardous scenarios. Existing studies typically rely solely on a base model's prediction error, without considering the diversity and uncertainty of long-tail trajectory patterns. We propose an adaptive momentum and decoupled contrastive learning framework (AMD), which integrates unsupervised and supervised contrastive learning strategies. By leveraging an improved momentum contrast learning (MoCo-DT) and decoupled contrastive learning (DCL) module, our framework enhances the model's ability to recognize rare and complex trajectories. Additionally, we design four types of trajectory random augmentation methods and introduce an online iterative clustering strategy, allowing the model to dynamically update pseudo-labels and better adapt to the distributional shifts in long-tail data. We propose three different criteria to define long-tail trajectories and conduct extensive comparative experiments on the nuScenes and ETH$/$UCY datasets. The results show that AMD not only achieves optimal performance in long-tail trajectory prediction but also demonstrates outstanding overall prediction accuracy.</p></details> |  |

While many promising methods have been developed using online corpora and captioned photographs, their application to scientific domains, where data encodes highly specialized knowledge, remains a challenge. Liquid Argon Time Projection Chambers (LArTPCs) provide high-resolution 3D imaging for fundamental physics, but analysis of their sparse, complex point cloud data often relies on supervised methods trained on large simulations, introducing potential biases. We introduce the Point-based Liquid Argon Masked Autoencoder (PoLAr-MAE), applying masked point modeling to unlabeled LArTPC images using domain-specific volumetric tokenization and energy prediction. We show this SSL approach learns physically meaningful trajectory representations directly from data. This yields remarkable data efficiency: fine-tuning on just 100 labeled events achieves track/shower semantic segmentation performance comparable to the state-of-the-art supervised baseline trained on $>$100,000 events. Furthermore, internal attention maps exhibit emergent instance segmentation of particle trajectories. While challenges remain, particularly for fine-grained features, we make concrete SSL's potential for building a foundation model for LArTPC image analysis capable of serving as a common base for all data reconstruction tasks. To facilitate further progress, we release PILArNet-M, a large dataset of 1M LArTPC events.

In this work, we propose DIVER, an end-to-end driving framework that integrates reinforcement learning with diffusion-based generation to produce diverse and feasible trajectories. At the core of DIVER lies a reinforced diffusion-based generation mechanism. First, the model conditions on map elements and surrounding agents to generate multiple reference trajectories from a single ground-truth trajectory, alleviating the limitations of imitation learning that arise from relying solely on single expert demonstrations. Second, reinforcement learning is employed to guide the diffusion process, where reward-based supervision enforces safety and diversity constraints on the generated trajectories, thereby enhancing their practicality and generalization capability. Furthermore, to address the limitations of L2-based open-loop metrics in capturing trajectory diversity, we propose a novel Diversity metric to evaluate the diversity of multi-mode predictions.Extensive experiments on the closed-loop NAVSIM and Bench2Drive benchmarks, as well as the open-loop nuScenes dataset, demonstrate that DIVER significantly improves trajectory diversity, effectively addressing the mode collapse problem inherent in imitation learning.</p></details> | 16 pages, 6 figures |

While existing point-based and grid-based methods expose two key limitations: insufficiently modeling human motion dynamics, as they fail to balance local motion details with long-range spatiotemporal dependencies, and the time representation lacks interaction with the frequency domain in modeling trajectory sequences. To address these challenges, we propose PatchTraj, a dynamic patch-based trajectory prediction framework that unifies time-domain and frequency-domain representations. Specifically, we decompose the trajectory into raw time sequences and frequency components, employing dynamic patch partitioning for multi-scale trajectory segmentation to capture hierarchical motion patterns. Each patch is processed by an adaptive embedding layer with scale-aware feature extraction, followed by hierarchical feature aggregation to model both fine-grained and long-range dependencies. The outputs of two branches interact via cross-modal attention, enabling complementary fusion of temporal and spectral cues. Finally, a Transformer encoder-decoder integrates both modalities to autoregressively predict future trajectories. Extensive experiments on ETH-UCY, SDD, NBA, and JRDB datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with high efficiency.</p></details> |  |

While existing W2SG studies focus on simple tasks like binary classification, we extend this paradigm to complex interactive decision-making environments. Specifically, we fine-tune a strong model with trajectories of intermediate actions generated by a weak model. Motivated by the human learning process, we propose to generalize not only success knowledge but also failure experience so that the strong model can learn from failed trajectories accumulated by weak models. To effectively and efficiently elicit the potential of strong agents, we further construct ``trajectory trees," a hierarchical representation that organizes weak model-generated action trajectories, coupled with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to optimize the strong model. Through theoretical analysis, we provide formal guarantees for the effectiveness of our method in improving W2SG performance. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate substantial improvements in reasoning and decision-making capabilities across diverse task domains, validating the scalability and robustness of our proposed framework.

While effective, CoT introduces substantial computational overhead due to its reliance on autoregressive decoding over long token sequences. Existing acceleration strategies either reduce sequence length through early stopping or compressive reward designs, or improve decoding speed via speculative decoding with smaller models. However, speculative decoding suffers from limited speedup when the agreement between small and large models is low, and fails to exploit the potential advantages of small models in producing concise intermediate reasoning. In this paper, we present R-Stitch, a token-level, confidence-based hybrid decoding framework that accelerates CoT inference by switching between a small language model (SLM) and a large language model (LLM) along the reasoning trajectory. R-Stitch uses the SLM to generate tokens by default and delegates to the LLM only when the SLM's confidence falls below a threshold. This design avoids full-sequence rollback and selectively invokes the LLM on uncertain steps, preserving both efficiency and answer quality. R-Stitch is model-agnostic, training-free, and compatible with standard decoding pipelines. Experiments on math reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that R-Stitch achieves up to 85\% reduction in inference latency with negligible accuracy drop, highlighting its practical effectiveness in accelerating CoT reasoning.</p></details> |  |

However, the reliability of these online-generated maps remains uncertain. While incorporating map uncertainty into downstream trajectory prediction tasks has shown potential for performance improvements, current strategies provide limited insights into the specific scenarios where this uncertainty is beneficial. In this work, we first analyze the driving scenarios in which mapping uncertainty has the greatest positive impact on trajectory prediction and identify a critical, previously overlooked factor: the agent's kinematic state. Building on these insights, we propose a novel Proprioceptive Scenario Gating that adaptively integrates map uncertainty into trajectory prediction based on forecasts of the ego vehicle's future kinematics. This lightweight, self-supervised approach enhances the synergy between online mapping and trajectory prediction, providing interpretability around where uncertainty is advantageous and outperforming previous integration methods. Additionally, we introduce a Covariance-based Map Uncertainty approach that better aligns with map geometry, further improving trajectory prediction. Extensive ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of our approach, achieving up to 23.6% improvement in mapless trajectory prediction performance over the state-of-the-art method using the real-world nuScenes driving dataset.

During the flight phases, where the ground reaction forces are not available for regulation, the limb swinging trajectories are significant for the stability of the next stance phase. Due to the conservation of angular momentum, improper leg and arm swinging results in highly tilted and unsustainable body configurations at the next stance phase landing. In such cases, the robotic system fails to maintain locomotion independent of the stability of the center of mass trajectories. This problem is more apparent for fast and high flight time trajectories. This paper proposes a real-time nonlinear limb trajectory optimization problem for humanoid running. The optimization problem is tested on two different humanoid robot models, and the generated trajectories are verified using a running algorithm for both robots in a simulation environment.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication at the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), Atlanta 2025.

However, current IRL works cannot learn incrementally from an ongoing trajectory because they have to wait to collect at least one complete trajectory to learn. To bridge the gap, this paper considers the problem of learning a reward function and a corresponding policy while observing the initial state-action pair of an ongoing trajectory and keeping updating the learned reward and policy when new state-action pairs of the ongoing trajectory are observed. We formulate this problem as an online bi-level optimization problem where the upper level dynamically adjusts the learned reward according to the newly observed state-action pairs with the help of a meta-regularization term, and the lower level learns the corresponding policy. We propose a novel algorithm to solve this problem and guarantee that the algorithm achieves sub-linear local regret $O(\sqrt{T}+\log T+\sqrt{T}\log T)$. If the reward function is linear, we prove that the proposed algorithm achieves sub-linear regret $O(\log T)$. Experiments are used to validate the proposed algorithm.</p></details> |  |

In order to ensure that construction robots can perform tasks efficiently and accurately in complex construction environments, traditional single-objective trajectory optimization methods are difficult to meet the complex requirements of the changing construction environment. Therefore, we propose a multi-objective trajectory optimization for the robotic arm used in the curtain wall installation. First, we design a robotic arm for curtain wall installation, integrating serial, parallel, and folding arm elements, while considering its physical properties and motion characteristics. In addition, this paper proposes an NSGA-III-FO algorithm (NSGA-III with Focused Operator, NSGA-III-FO) that incorporates a focus operator screening mechanism to accelerate the convergence of the algorithm towards the Pareto front, thereby effectively balancing the multi-objective constraints of construction robots. The proposed algorithm is tested against NSGA-III, MOEA/D, and MSOPS-II in ten consecutive trials on the DTLZ3 and WFG3 test functions, showing significantly better convergence efficiency than the other algorithms. Finally, we conduct two sets of experiments on the designed robotic arm platform, which confirm the efficiency and practicality of the NSGA-III-FO algorithm in solving multi-objective trajectory planning problems for curtain wall installation tasks.</p></details> |  |

To tackle this challenge, our study innovatively draws inspiration from the mechanics of human upper limb movements during weight lifting, proposing a bio-inspired trajectory planning framework that incorporates human energy conversion principles. By collecting motion trajectories and electromyography (EMG) signals during dumbbell curls, we construct an anthropomorphic trajectory planning that integrates human force exertion patterns and energy consumption patterns. Utilizing the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm, we achieve dynamic load distribution for robotic arm trajectory planning based on human-like movement features. In practical application, these bio-inspired movement characteristics are applied to curtain wall installation tasks, validating the correctness and superiority of our trajectory planning method. Simulation results demonstrate a 48.4% reduction in energy consumption through intelligent conversion between kinetic and potential energy. This approach provides new insights and theoretical support for optimizing energy use in curtain wall installation robots during actual handling tasks.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose the GFM-Planner, a perception-aware trajectory planning framework based on the geometric feature metric, which enhances LiDAR localization accuracy by guiding the robot to avoid degraded areas. First, we derive the Geometric Feature Metric (GFM) from the fundamental LiDAR localization problem. Next, we design a 2D grid-based Metric Encoding Map (MEM) to efficiently store GFM values across the environment. A constant-time decoding algorithm is further proposed to retrieve GFM values for arbitrary poses from the MEM. Finally, we develop a perception-aware trajectory planning algorithm that improves LiDAR localization capabilities by guiding the robot in selecting trajectories through feature-rich areas. Both simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that our approach enables the robot to actively select trajectories that significantly enhance LiDAR localization accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IROS 2025</p></details> |

The model applies the Adaboost algorithm to divide multiple weak learners, and each submodel utilizes CNN to extract spatial features, LSTM to capture temporal features, and attention mechanism to capture global features comprehensively. The strong learner model, combined with multiple sub-models, then optimizes the hyperparameters of the prediction model through the natural selection behavior pattern simulated by SO. In this study, based on the real ADS-B data from Xi'an to Tianjin, the comparison experiments and ablation studies of multiple optimizers are carried out, and a comprehensive test and evaluation analysis is carried out. The results show that SO-CLA-adaboost outperforms traditional optimizers such as particle swarm, whale, and gray wolf in handling large-scale high-dimensional trajectory data. In addition, introducing the full-strategy collaborative improvement SO algorithm improves the model's prediction accuracy by 39.89%.</p></details> | in Chinese language |

However, current automated methods are limited to establishing cell developmental trajectories within individual samples, necessitating biologists to manually link cells across samples to construct complete cross-sample evolutionary trajectories that consider cellular spatial dynamics. This process demands substantial human effort due to the complex spatial correspondence between each pair of samples. To address this challenge, we first proposed a GNN-based model to predict cross-sample cell developmental trajectories. We then developed TrajLens, a visual analytics system that supports biologists in exploring and refining the cell developmental trajectories based on predicted links. Specifically, we designed the visualization that integrates features on cell distribution and developmental direction across multiple samples, providing an overview of the spatial evolutionary patterns of cell populations along trajectories. Additionally, we included contour maps superimposed on the original cell distribution data, enabling biologists to explore them intuitively. To demonstrate our system's performance, we conducted quantitative evaluations of our model with two case studies and expert interviews to validate its usefulness and effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalized Consistency Trajectory Models for Image Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12510v4)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models (DMs) excel in unconditional generation, as well as on applications such as image editing and restoration. The success of DMs lies in the iterative nature of diffusion: diffusion breaks down the complex process of mapping noise to data into a sequence of simple denoising tasks. Moreover, we are able to exert fine-grained control over the generation process by injecting guidance terms into each denoising step. However, the iterative process is also computationally intensive, often taking from tens up to thousands of function evaluations. Although consistency trajectory models (CTMs) enable traversal between any time points along the probability flow ODE (PFODE) and score inference with a single function evaluation, CTMs only allow translation from Gaussian noise to data. This work aims to unlock the full potential of CTMs by proposing generalized CTMs (GCTMs), which translate between arbitrary distributions via ODEs. We discuss the design space of GCTMs and demonstrate their efficacy in various image manipulation tasks such as image-to-image translation, restoration, and editing.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 (poster) |
| **[Researcher Population Pyramids for Tracking Global Demographic and Gender Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15500v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The sustainability of the global academic ecosystem relies on researcher demographics and gender balance, yet assessing these dynamics in a timely manner for policy is challenging. Here, we propose a researcher population pyramids framework for tracking global demographic and gender trajectories using publication data. This framework provides a timely snapshot of historical and present demographics and gender balance, revealing three contrasting research systems: Emerging systems (e.g., Arab countries) exhibit high researcher inflows with widening gender gaps in cumulative productivity; Mature systems (e.g., the United States) show modest inflows with narrowing gender gaps; and Rigid systems (e.g., Japan) lag in both. Furthermore, by simulating future scenarios, the framework makes potential trajectories visible. If 2023 demographic patterns persist, Arab countries' systems could resemble mature or even rigid ones by 2050. Our framework provides a robust diagnostic tool for policymakers worldwide to foster sustainable talent pipelines and gender equality in academia.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 5 figures, 1 table, and SI</p></details> |
| **[Log-Euclidean Frameworks for Smooth Brain Connectivity Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15374v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The brain is often studied from a network perspective, where functional activity is assessed using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to estimate connectivity between predefined neuronal regions. Functional connectivity can be represented by correlation matrices computed over time, where each matrix captures the Pearson correlation between the mean fMRI signals of different regions within a sliding window. We introduce several Log-Euclidean Riemannian framework for constructing smooth approximations of functional brain connectivity trajectories. Representing dynamic functional connectivity as time series of full-rank correlation matrices, we leverage recent theoretical Log-Euclidean diffeomorphisms to map these trajectories in practice into Euclidean spaces where polynomial regression becomes feasible. Pulling back the regressed curve ensures that each estimated point remains a valid correlation matrix, enabling a smooth, interpretable, and geometrically consistent approximation of the original brain connectivity dynamics. Experiments on fMRI-derived connectivity trajectories demonstrate the geometric consistency and computational efficiency of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Optimization for Unknown Maneuvering Target Tracking with Bearing-only Measurements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18669v3)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies trajectory optimization of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to track an unknown maneuvering target. Due to the restrictions on sensing capabilities in the underwater scenario, the AUV is limited to collecting only bearing measurements to the target. A framework called GBT is proposed with integration of online learning and planning. First, a Gaussian process learning method is proposed for the AUV to handle unknown target motion, wherein pseudo linear transformation of bearing measurements is introduced to address nonlinearity of bearings. A probabilistic bearing-data-dependent bound on tracking error is then rigorously established. Based on it, optimal desired bearings that can reduce tracking uncertainty are obtained analytically. Finally, the trajectory optimization problem is formulated and transformed into an easily solved one with parametric transformation. Numerical examples and comparison with existing methods verify the feasibility and superior performance of our proposed framework.</p></details> |  |

Chest X-rays (CXRs) are a vital diagnostic tool, providing insights into clinical trajectories, but their irregular acquisition limits their utility. Existing tools for CXR interpretation are constrained by cross-sectional analysis, failing to capture temporal dynamics. To address this, we introduce CXR-TFT, a novel multi-modal framework that integrates temporally sparse CXR imaging and radiology reports with high-frequency clinical data, such as vital signs, laboratory values, and respiratory flow sheets, to predict the trajectory of CXR findings in critically ill patients. CXR-TFT leverages latent embeddings from a vision encoder that are temporally aligned with hourly clinical data through interpolation. A transformer model is then trained to predict CXR embeddings at each hour, conditioned on previous embeddings and clinical measurements. In a retrospective study of 20,000 ICU patients, CXR-TFT demonstrated high accuracy in forecasting abnormal CXR findings up to 12 hours before they became radiographically evident. This predictive capability in clinical data holds significant potential for enhancing the management of time-sensitive conditions like acute respiratory distress syndrome, where early intervention is crucial and diagnoses are often delayed. By providing distinctive temporal resolution in prognostic CXR analysis, CXR-TFT offers actionable 'whole patient' insights that can directly improve clinical outcomes.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Re...</summary><p>In Review for MICCAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Consistency Trajectory Matching for One-Step Generative Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20349v4)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current diffusion-based super-resolution (SR) approaches achieve commendable performance at the cost of high inference overhead. Therefore, distillation techniques are utilized to accelerate the multi-step teacher model into one-step student model. Nevertheless, these methods significantly raise training costs and constrain the performance of the student model by the teacher model. To overcome these tough challenges, we propose Consistency Trajectory Matching for Super-Resolution (CTMSR), a distillation-free strategy that is able to generate photo-realistic SR results in one step. Concretely, we first formulate a Probability Flow Ordinary Differential Equation (PF-ODE) trajectory to establish a deterministic mapping from low-resolution (LR) images with noise to high-resolution (HR) images. Then we apply the Consistency Training (CT) strategy to directly learn the mapping in one step, eliminating the necessity of pre-trained diffusion model. To further enhance the performance and better leverage the ground-truth during the training process, we aim to align the distribution of SR results more closely with that of the natural images. To this end, we propose to minimize the discrepancy between their respective PF-ODE trajectories from the LR image distribution by our meticulously designed Distribution Trajectory Matching (DTM) loss, resulting in improved realism of our recovered HR images. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods can attain comparable or even superior capabilities on both synthetic and real datasets while maintaining minimal inference latency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |

Traditional Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) methods, while effective for offline planning, often struggle with premature convergence and latency in real-time scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose PE-PSO, an enhanced PSO-based online trajectory planner. The method introduces a persistent exploration mechanism to preserve swarm diversity and an entropy-based parameter adjustment strategy to dynamically adapt optimization behavior. UAV trajectories are modeled using B-spline curves, which ensure path smoothness while reducing optimization complexity. To extend this capability to UAV swarms, we develop a multi-agent framework that combines genetic algorithm (GA)-based task allocation with distributed PE-PSO, supporting scalable and coordinated trajectory generation. The distributed architecture allows for parallel computation and decentralized control, enabling effective cooperation among agents while maintaining real-time performance. Comprehensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms conventional PSO and other swarm-based planners across several metrics, including trajectory quality, energy efficiency, obstacle avoidance, and computation time. These results confirm the effectiveness and applicability of PE-PSO in real-time multi-UAV operations under complex environmental conditions.</p></details> | 8 papers,7 figures |

Real-world scenarios frequently present challenges such as occlusions and incomplete scene observations, which can compromise predictive accuracy. Thus, traditional video-based methods often struggle due to limited temporal and spatial perspectives. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative. Having been trained on a large text corpus describing human behaviors, LLMs likely encode plausible sequences of human actions in a home environment. However, LLMs, trained primarily on text data, lack inherent spatial awareness and real-time environmental perception. They struggle with understanding physical constraints and spatial geometry. Therefore, to be effective in a real-world spatial scenario, we propose a multimodal prediction framework that enhances LLM-based action prediction by integrating physical constraints derived from human trajectories. Our experiments demonstrate that combining LLM predictions with trajectory data significantly improves overall prediction performance. This enhancement is particularly notable in situations where the LLM receives limited scene information, highlighting the complementary nature of linguistic knowledge and physical constraints in understanding and anticipating human behavior.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IROS 2025</p></details> |

This paper investigates the generation of human-like trajectories using a receding horizon approach applied to the TickTacking interface in a target-tracking task. By analyzing user-generated trajectories, we identify key human behavioral features and incorporate them in a controller that mimics these behaviors. The performance of this human-inspired controller is evaluated against a baseline optimal-control-based agent, demonstrating the importance of specific control features for achieving human-like interaction. These findings contribute to the broader goal of developing rhythm-based human-machine interfaces by offering design insights that enhance user performance, improve intuitiveness, and reduce interaction frustration</p></details> |  |
| **[STF: Spatial Temporal Fusion for Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18149v2)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is a challenging task that aims to predict the future trajectory of vehicles or pedestrians over a short time horizon based on their historical positions. The main reason is that the trajectory is a kind of complex data, including spatial and temporal information, which is crucial for accurate prediction. Intuitively, the more information the model can capture, the more precise the future trajectory can be predicted. However, previous works based on deep learning methods processed spatial and temporal information separately, leading to inadequate spatial information capture, which means they failed to capture the complete spatial information. Therefore, it is of significance to capture information more fully and effectively on vehicle interactions. In this study, we introduced an integrated 3D graph that incorporates both spatial and temporal edges. Based on this, we proposed the integrated 3D graph, which considers the cross-time interaction information. In specific, we design a Spatial-Temporal Fusion (STF) model including Multi-layer perceptions (MLP) and Graph Attention (GAT) to capture the spatial and temporal information historical trajectories simultaneously on the 3D graph. Our experiment on the ApolloScape Trajectory Datasets shows that the proposed STF outperforms several baseline methods, especially on the long-time-horizon trajectory prediction.</p></details> | 6 pages, 6 figures |

However, existing trajectory optimization methods show weakness when dealing with large-scale long trajectories. Recent advances in parallel computing have accelerated optimization in some fields, but how to efficiently solve trajectory optimization via parallelism remains an open question. In this paper, we propose a novel trajectory optimization framework based on the Consensus Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (CADMM) algorithm, which decomposes the trajectory into multiple segments and solves the subproblems in parallel. The proposed framework reduces the time complexity to O(1) per iteration to the number of segments, compared to O(N) of the state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches. Furthermore, we introduce a closed-form solution that integrates convex linear and quadratic constraints to speed up the optimization, and we also present numerical solutions for general inequality constraints. A series of simulations and experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms the SOTA approach in terms of efficiency and smoothness. Especially for a large-scale trajectory, with one hundred segments, achieving over a tenfold speedup. To fully explore the potential of our algorithm on modern parallel computing architectures, we deploy our framework on a GPU and show high performance with thousands of segments.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, submitted to RA-L</p></details> |
| **[Reinforced Imitative Trajectory Planning for Urban Automated Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15607v2)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) faces challenges in trajectory planning for urban automated driving due to the poor convergence of RL and the difficulty in designing reward functions. Consequently, few RL-based trajectory planning methods can achieve performance comparable to that of imitation learning-based methods. The convergence problem is alleviated by combining RL with supervised learning. However, most existing approaches only reason one step ahead and lack the capability to plan for multiple future steps. Besides, although inverse reinforcement learning holds promise for solving the reward function design issue, existing methods for automated driving impose a linear structure assumption on reward functions, making them difficult to apply to urban automated driving. In light of these challenges, this paper proposes a novel RL-based trajectory planning method that integrates RL with imitation learning to enable multi-step planning. Furthermore, a transformer-based Bayesian reward function is developed, providing effective reward signals for RL in urban scenarios. Moreover, a hybrid-driven trajectory planning framework is proposed to enhance safety and interpretability. The proposed methods were validated on the large-scale real-world urban automated driving nuPlan dataset. Evaluated using closed-loop metrics, the results demonstrated that the proposed method significantly outperformed the baseline employing the identical policy model structure and achieved competitive performance compared to the state-of-the-art method. The code is available at https://github.com/Zigned/nuplan_zigned.</p></details> | 21 pages, 9 figures |
| **[InSyn: Modeling Complex Interactions for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13397v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate pedestrian trajectory prediction is crucial for intelligent applications, yet it remains highly challenging due to the complexity of interactions among pedestrians. Previous methods have primarily relied on relative positions to model pedestrian interactions; however, they tend to overlook specific interaction patterns such as paired walking or conflicting behaviors, limiting the prediction accuracy in crowded scenarios. To address this issue, we propose InSyn (Interaction-Synchronization Network), a novel Transformer-based model that explicitly captures diverse interaction patterns (e.g., walking in sync or conflicting) while effectively modeling direction-sensitive social behaviors. Additionally, we introduce a training strategy termed Seq-Start of Seq (SSOS), designed to alleviate the common issue of initial-step divergence in numerical time-series prediction. Experiments on the ETH and UCY datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms recent baselines significantly, especially in high-density scenarios. Furthermore, the SSOS strategy proves effective in improving sequential prediction performance, reducing the initial-step prediction error by approximately 6.58%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fast and Scalable Game-Theoretic Trajectory Planning with Intentional Uncertainties](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12174v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory planning involving multi-agent interactions has been a long-standing challenge in the field of robotics, primarily burdened by the inherent yet intricate interactions among agents. While game-theoretic methods are widely acknowledged for their effectiveness in managing multi-agent interactions, significant impediments persist when it comes to accommodating the intentional uncertainties of agents. In the context of intentional uncertainties, the heavy computational burdens associated with existing game-theoretic methods are induced, leading to inefficiencies and poor scalability. In this paper, we propose a novel game-theoretic interactive trajectory planning method to effectively address the intentional uncertainties of agents, and it demonstrates both high efficiency and enhanced scalability. As the underpinning basis, we model the interactions between agents under intentional uncertainties as a general Bayesian game, and we show that its agent-form equivalence can be represented as a potential game under certain minor assumptions. The existence and attainability of the optimal interactive trajectories are illustrated, as the corresponding Bayesian Nash equilibrium can be attained by optimizing a unified optimization problem. Additionally, we present a distributed algorithm based on the dual consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) tailored to the parallel solving of the problem, thereby significantly improving the scalability. The attendant outcomes from simulations and experiments demonstrate that the proposed method is effective across a range of scenarios characterized by general forms of intentional uncertainties. Its scalability surpasses that of existing centralized and decentralized baselines, allowing for real-time interactive trajectory planning in uncertain game settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Foresight in Motion: Reinforcing Trajectory Prediction with Reward Heuristics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12083v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motion forecasting for on-road traffic agents presents both a significant challenge and a critical necessity for ensuring safety in autonomous driving systems. In contrast to most existing data-driven approaches that directly predict future trajectories, we rethink this task from a planning perspective, advocating a "First Reasoning, Then Forecasting" strategy that explicitly incorporates behavior intentions as spatial guidance for trajectory prediction. To achieve this, we introduce an interpretable, reward-driven intention reasoner grounded in a novel query-centric Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) scheme. Our method first encodes traffic agents and scene elements into a unified vectorized representation, then aggregates contextual features through a query-centric paradigm. This enables the derivation of a reward distribution, a compact yet informative representation of the target agent's behavior within the given scene context via IRL. Guided by this reward heuristic, we perform policy rollouts to reason about multiple plausible intentions, providing valuable priors for subsequent trajectory generation. Finally, we develop a hierarchical DETR-like decoder integrated with bidirectional selective state space models to produce accurate future trajectories along with their associated probabilities. Extensive experiments on the large-scale Argoverse and nuScenes motion forecasting datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances trajectory prediction confidence, achieving highly competitive performance relative to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[Schrödinger Bridge Consistency Trajectory Models for Speech Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11925v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speech enhancement (SE) utilizing diffusion models is a promising technology that improves speech quality in noisy speech data. Furthermore, the Schr\"odinger bridge (SB) has recently been used in diffusion-based SE to improve speech quality by resolving a mismatch between the endpoint of the forward process and the starting point of the reverse process. However, the SB still exhibits slow inference owing to the necessity of a large number of function evaluations (NFE) for inference to obtain high-quality results. While Consistency Models (CMs) address this issue by employing consistency training that uses distillation from pretrained models in the field of image generation, it does not improve generation quality when the number of steps increases. As a solution to this problem, Consistency Trajectory Models (CTMs) not only accelerate inference speed but also maintain a favorable trade-off between quality and speed. Furthermore, SoundCTM demonstrates the applicability of CTM techniques to the field of sound generation. In this paper, we present Schr\"odinger bridge Consistency Trajectory Models (SBCTM) by applying the CTM's technique to the Schr\"odinger bridge for SE. Additionally, we introduce a novel auxiliary loss, including a perceptual loss, into the original CTM's training framework. As a result, SBCTM achieves an approximately 16x improvement in the real-time factor (RTF) compared to the conventional Schr\"odinger bridge for SE. Furthermore, the favorable trade-off between quality and speed in SBCTM allows for time-efficient inference by limiting multi-step refinement to cases where 1-step inference is insufficient. Our code, pretrained models, and audio samples are available at https://github.com/sony/sbctm/.</p></details> |  |

This research addresses a gap in delay prediction studies within the Dutch railway network by employing an XGBoost Classifier with a focus on topological features. Current research predominantly emphasizes short-term predictions and neglects the broader network-wide patterns essential for mitigating ripple effects. This research implements and improves an existing methodology, originally designed to forecast the evolution of the fast-changing US air network, to predict delays in the Dutch Railways. By integrating Node Centrality Measures and comparing multiple classifiers like RandomForest, DecisionTree, GradientBoosting, AdaBoost, and LogisticRegression, the goal is to predict delayed trajectories. However, the results reveal limited performance, especially in non-simultaneous testing scenarios, suggesting the necessity for more context-specific adaptations. Regardless, this research contributes to the understanding of transportation network evaluation and proposes future directions for developing more robust predictive models for delays.</p></details> |  |

The framework invokes two processes asynchronously at high frequency: (i) a centralized, discrete, and full-horizon planner for computing collision- and deadlock-free paths rapidly, leveraging recent advances in multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF), and (ii) dynamics-aware, robot-wise optimal trajectory controllers that ensure all robots independently follow their assigned paths reliably. This hierarchical shift in planning representation from (i) discrete and coupled to (ii) continuous and decoupled domains enables the framework to maintain long-term scalable motion synthesis. As an instantiation of this idea, we present LF, which combines a fast state-of-the-art MAPF solver (LaCAM), and a robust feedback control stack (Freyja) for executing agile robot maneuvers. LF provides a robust and versatile mechanism for lifelong multi-robot navigation even under asynchronous and partial goal updates, and adapts to dynamic workspaces simply by quick replanning. We present various multirotor and ground robot demonstrations, including the deployment of 15 real multirotors with random, consecutive target updates while a person walks through the operational workspace.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages; under review for IEEE Robotics & Automation - Letters (RA-L)</p></details> |

While many imputation methods have been proposed for spatiotemporal data, they are not well-suited for multi-agent sports scenarios where player movements are highly dynamic and inter-agent interactions continuously evolve. To address these challenges, we propose MIDAS (Multi-agent Imputer with Derivative-Accumulating Self-ensemble), a framework that imputes multi-agent trajectories with high accuracy and physical plausibility. It jointly predicts positions, velocities, and accelerations through a Set Transformer-based neural network and generates alternative estimates by recursively accumulating predicted velocity and acceleration values. These predictions are then combined using a learnable weighted ensemble to produce final imputed trajectories. Experiments on three sports datasets demonstrate that MIDAS significantly outperforms existing baselines in both positional accuracy and physical plausibility. Lastly, we showcase use cases of MIDAS, such as approximating total distance and pass success probability, to highlight its applicability to practical downstream tasks that require complete tracking data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ECML/PKDD 2025</p></details> |

However, expert-provided instructions are limited in quantity, while synthesized annotations often lack quality, making them insufficient for large-scale research. To address this, we propose NavComposer, a novel framework for automatically generating high-quality navigation instructions. NavComposer explicitly decomposes semantic entities such as actions, scenes, and objects, and recomposes them into natural language instructions. Its modular architecture allows flexible integration of state-of-the-art techniques, while the explicit use of semantic entities enhances both the richness and accuracy of instructions. Moreover, it operates in a data-agnostic manner, supporting adaptation to diverse navigation trajectories without domain-specific training. Complementing NavComposer, we introduce NavInstrCritic, a comprehensive annotation-free evaluation system that assesses navigation instructions on three dimensions: contrastive matching, semantic consistency, and linguistic diversity. NavInstrCritic provides a holistic evaluation of instruction quality, addressing limitations of traditional metrics that rely heavily on expert annotations. By decoupling instruction generation and evaluation from specific navigation agents, our method enables more scalable and generalizable research. Extensive experiments provide direct and practical evidence for the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> |  |

While the lack of exact latent inversion is a core advantage of these methods, it often results in unstable editing trajectories and poor source consistency. To address this limitation, we propose {\em FlowAlign}, a novel inversion-free flow-based framework for consistent image editing with optimal control-based trajectory control. Specifically, FlowAlign introduces source similarity at the terminal point as a regularization term to promote smoother and more consistent trajectories during the editing process. Notably, our terminal point regularization is shown to explicitly balance semantic alignment with the edit prompt and structural consistency with the source image along the trajectory. Furthermore, FlowAlign naturally supports reverse editing by simply reversing the ODE trajectory, highliting the reversible and consistent nature of the transformation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlowAlign outperforms existing methods in both source preservation and editing controllability.</p></details> |  |

While existing methods primarily focus on modeling observed motion patterns and interactions with other vehicles, they often neglect the potential risks posed by the uncertain or aggressive behaviors of surrounding vehicles. In this paper, we propose a novel spatial-temporal risk-attentive trajectory prediction framework that incorporates a risk potential field to assess perceived risks arising from behaviors of nearby vehicles. The framework leverages a spatial-temporal encoder and a risk-attentive feature fusion decoder to embed the risk potential field into the extracted spatial-temporal feature representations for trajectory prediction. A risk-scaled loss function is further designed to improve the prediction accuracy of high-risk scenarios, such as short relative spacing. Experiments on the widely used NGSIM and HighD datasets demonstrate that our method reduces average prediction errors by 4.8% and 31.2% respectively compared to state-of-the-art approaches, especially in high-risk scenarios. The proposed framework provides interpretable, risk-aware predictions, contributing to more robust decision-making for autonomous driving systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, accepted at ITSC 2025</p></details> |

In this work, we explore their potential and introduce the surprising result that naively applying standards MDMs severely degrades the performance. We identify the critical cause of this issue as a state-clashing problem-where the forward diffusion of distinct molecules collapse into a common state, resulting in a mixture of reconstruction targets that cannot be learned using typical reverse diffusion process with unimodal predictions. To mitigate this, we propose Masked Element-wise Learnable Diffusion (MELD) that orchestrates per-element corruption trajectories to avoid collision between distinct molecular graphs. This is achieved through a parameterized noise scheduling network that assigns distinct corruption rates to individual graph elements, i.e., atoms and bonds. Extensive experiments on diverse molecular benchmarks reveal that MELD markedly enhances overall generation quality compared to element-agnostic noise scheduling, increasing the chemical validity of vanilla MDMs on ZINC250K from 15% to 93%, Furthermore, it achieves state-of-the-art property alignment in conditional generation tasks.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods for detecting driving trajectories typically rely on map-matching the path using Global Positioning System (GPS) data, which is susceptible to GPS data outage. This paper introduces CAN-Trace, a novel privacy attack mechanism that leverages Controller Area Network (CAN) messages to uncover driving trajectories, posing a significant risk to drivers' long-term privacy. A new trajectory reconstruction algorithm is proposed to transform the CAN messages, specifically vehicle speed and accelerator pedal position, into weighted graphs accommodating various driving statuses. CAN-Trace identifies driving trajectories using graph-matching algorithms applied to the created graphs in comparison to road networks. We also design a new metric to evaluate matched candidates, which allows for potential data gaps and matching inaccuracies. Empirical validation under various real-world conditions, encompassing different vehicles and driving regions, demonstrates the efficacy of CAN-Trace: it achieves an attack success rate of up to 90.59% in the urban region, and 99.41% in the suburban region.</p></details> |  |

CTP supports fast, single-step trajectory generation without significant degradation in policy quality. We evaluate CTP on the D4RL benchmark and show that it consistently outperforms existing diffusion-based planning methods in long-horizon, goal-conditioned tasks. Notably, CTP achieves higher normalized returns while using significantly fewer denoising steps. In particular, CTP achieves comparable performance with over $120\times$ speedup in inference time, demonstrating its practicality and effectiveness for high-performance, low-latency offline planning.</p></details> |  |

These include heavy computational burdens for mapping, sensor occlusion failures for UAVs, and traversal challenges on irregular terrain for UGVs, all compounded by a lack of perception-aware strategies. To address these challenges, we introduce Random Mapping and Random Projection (RMRP). This method constructs a lightweight linear parametric map by first mapping data to a high-dimensional space, followed by a sparse random projection for dimensionality reduction. Our novel Residual Energy Preservation Theorem provides theoretical guarantees for this process, ensuring critical geometric properties are preserved. Based on this map, we propose the RPATR (Robust Perception-Aware Trajectory Planner) framework. For UAVs, our method unifies grid and Euclidean Signed Distance Field (ESDF) maps. The front-end uses an analytical occupancy gradient to refine initial paths for safety and smoothness, while the back-end uses a closed-form ESDF for trajectory optimization. Leveraging the trained RMRP model's generalization, the planner predicts unobserved areas for proactive navigation. For UGVs, the model characterizes terrain and provides closed-form gradients, enabling online planning to circumvent large holes. Validated in diverse scenarios, our framework demonstrates superior mapping performance in time, memory, and accuracy, and enables computationally efficient, safe navigation for high-speed UAVs and UGVs. The code will be released to foster community collaboration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Robotics (TRO) in July 2025</p></details> |
| **[Shortening the Trajectories: Identity-Aware Gaussian Approximation for Efficient 3D Molecular Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09043v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gaussian-based Probabilistic Generative Models (GPGMs) generate data by reversing a stochastic process that progressively corrupts samples with Gaussian noise. While these models have achieved state-of-the-art performance across diverse domains, their practical deployment remains constrained by the high computational cost of long generative trajectories, which often involve hundreds to thousands of steps during training and sampling. In this work, we introduce a theoretically grounded and empirically validated framework that improves generation efficiency without sacrificing training granularity or inference fidelity. Our key insight is that for certain data modalities, the noising process causes data to rapidly lose its identity and converge toward a Gaussian distribution. We analytically identify a characteristic step at which the data has acquired sufficient Gaussianity, and then replace the remaining generation trajectory with a closed-form Gaussian approximation. Unlike existing acceleration techniques that coarsening the trajectories by skipping steps, our method preserves the full resolution of learning dynamics while avoiding redundant stochastic perturbations between `Gaussian-like' distributions. Empirical results across multiple data modalities demonstrate substantial improvements in both sample quality and computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[GoalNet: Goal Areas Oriented Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19002v2)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting the future trajectories of pedestrians on the road is an important task for autonomous driving. The pedestrian trajectory prediction is affected by scene paths, pedestrian's intentions and decision-making, which is a multi-modal problem. Most recent studies use past trajectories to predict a variety of potential future trajectory distributions, which do not account for the scene context and pedestrian targets. Instead of predicting the future trajectory directly, we propose to use scene context and observed trajectory to predict the goal points first, and then reuse the goal points to predict the future trajectories. By leveraging the information from scene context and observed trajectory, the uncertainty can be limited to a few target areas, which represent the "goals" of the pedestrians. In this paper, we propose GoalNet, a new trajectory prediction neural network based on the goal areas of a pedestrian. Our network can predict both pedestrian's trajectories and bounding boxes. The overall model is efficient and modular, and its outputs can be changed according to the usage scenario. Experimental results show that GoalNet significantly improves the previous state-of-the-art performance by 48.7% on the JAAD and 40.8% on the PIE dataset.</p></details> |  |

| **[TPK: Trustworthy Trajectory Prediction Integrating Prior Knowledge For Interpretability and Kinematic Feasibility](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06743v2)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is crucial for autonomous driving, enabling vehicles to navigate safely by anticipating the movements of surrounding road users. However, current deep learning models often lack trustworthiness as their predictions can be physically infeasible and illogical to humans. To make predictions more trustworthy, recent research has incorporated prior knowledge, like the social force model for modeling interactions and kinematic models for physical realism. However, these approaches focus on priors that suit either vehicles or pedestrians and do not generalize to traffic with mixed agent classes. We propose incorporating interaction and kinematic priors of all agent classes--vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists with class-specific interaction layers to capture agent behavioral differences. To improve the interpretability of the agent interactions, we introduce DG-SFM, a rule-based interaction importance score that guides the interaction layer. To ensure physically feasible predictions, we proposed suitable kinematic models for all agent classes with a novel pedestrian kinematic model. We benchmark our approach on the Argoverse 2 dataset, using the state-of-the-art transformer HPTR as our baseline. Experiments demonstrate that our method improves interaction interpretability, revealing a correlation between incorrect predictions and divergence from our interaction prior. Even though incorporating the kinematic models causes a slight decrease in accuracy, they eliminate infeasible trajectories found in the dataset and the baseline model. Thus, our approach fosters trust in trajectory prediction as its interaction reasoning is interpretable, and its predictions adhere to physics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in the 36th IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV 2025) for oral presentation.

| **[Boundary-Guided Trajectory Prediction for Road Aware and Physically Feasible Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06740v2)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of surrounding road users' trajectories is essential for safe and efficient autonomous driving. While deep learning models have improved performance, challenges remain in preventing off-road predictions and ensuring kinematic feasibility. Existing methods incorporate road-awareness modules and enforce kinematic constraints but lack plausibility guarantees and often introduce trade-offs in complexity and flexibility. This paper proposes a novel framework that formulates trajectory prediction as a constrained regression guided by permissible driving directions and their boundaries. Using the agent's current state and an HD map, our approach defines the valid boundaries and ensures on-road predictions by training the network to learn superimposed paths between left and right boundary polylines. To guarantee feasibility, the model predicts acceleration profiles that determine the vehicle's travel distance along these paths while adhering to kinematic constraints. We evaluate our approach on the Argoverse-2 dataset against the HPTR baseline. Our approach shows a slight decrease in benchmark metrics compared to HPTR but notably improves final displacement error and eliminates infeasible trajectories. Moreover, the proposed approach has superior generalization to less prevalent maneuvers and unseen out-of-distribution scenarios, reducing the off-road rate under adversarial attacks from 66% to just 1%. These results highlight the effectiveness of our approach in generating feasible and robust predictions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in the 36th IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV 2025)</p></details> |
| **[T-GVC: Trajectory-Guided Generative Video Coding at Ultra-Low Bitrates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07633v2)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in video generation techniques have given rise to an emerging paradigm of generative video coding, aiming to achieve semantically accurate reconstructions in Ultra-Low Bitrate (ULB) scenarios by leveraging strong generative priors. However, most existing methods are limited by domain specificity (e.g., facial or human videos) or an excessive dependence on high-level text guidance, which often fails to capture motion details and results in unrealistic reconstructions. To address these challenges, we propose a Trajectory-Guided Generative Video Coding framework (dubbed T-GVC). T-GVC employs a semantic-aware sparse motion sampling pipeline to effectively bridge low-level motion tracking with high-level semantic understanding by extracting pixel-wise motion as sparse trajectory points based on their semantic importance, not only significantly reducing the bitrate but also preserving critical temporal semantic information. In addition, by incorporating trajectory-aligned loss constraints into diffusion processes, we introduce a training-free latent space guidance mechanism to ensure physically plausible motion patterns without sacrificing the inherent capabilities of generative models. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms both traditional codecs and state-of-the-art end-to-end video compression methods under ULB conditions. Furthermore, additional experiments confirm that our approach achieves more precise motion control than existing text-guided methods, paving the way for a novel direction of generative video coding guided by geometric motion modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Offline Trajectory Optimization for Offline Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10393v2)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn policies without online explorations. To enlarge the training data, model-based offline RL learns a dynamics model which is utilized as a virtual environment to generate simulation data and enhance policy learning. However, existing data augmentation methods for offline RL suffer from (i) trivial improvement from short-horizon simulation; and (ii) the lack of evaluation and correction for generated data, leading to low-qualified augmentation. In this paper, we propose offline trajectory optimization for offline reinforcement learning (OTTO). The key motivation is to conduct long-horizon simulation and then utilize model uncertainty to evaluate and correct the augmented data. Specifically, we propose an ensemble of Transformers, a.k.a. World Transformers, to predict environment state dynamics and the reward function. Three strategies are proposed to use World Transformers to generate long-horizon trajectory simulation by perturbing the actions in the offline data. Then, an uncertainty-based World Evaluator is introduced to firstly evaluate the confidence of the generated trajectories and then perform the correction for low-confidence data. Finally, we jointly use the original data with the corrected augmentation data to train an offline RL algorithm. OTTO serves as a plug-in module and can be integrated with existing model-free offline RL methods. Experiments on various benchmarks show that OTTO can effectively improve the performance of representative offline RL algorithms, including in complex environments with sparse rewards like AntMaze.

| **[MoSiC: Optimal-Transport Motion Trajectory for Dense Self-Supervised Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08694v2)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dense self-supervised learning has shown great promise for learning pixel- and patch-level representations, but extending it to videos remains challenging due to the complexity of motion dynamics. Existing approaches struggle as they rely on static augmentations that fail under object deformations, occlusions, and camera movement, leading to inconsistent feature learning over time. We propose a motion-guided self-supervised learning framework that clusters dense point tracks to learn spatiotemporally consistent representations. By leveraging an off-the-shelf point tracker, we extract long-range motion trajectories and optimize feature clustering through a momentum-encoder-based optimal transport mechanism. To ensure temporal coherence, we propagate cluster assignments along tracked points, enforcing feature consistency across views despite viewpoint changes. Integrating motion as an implicit supervisory signal, our method learns representations that generalize across frames, improving robustness in dynamic scenes and challenging occlusion scenarios. By initializing from strong image-pretrained models and leveraging video data for training, we improve state-of-the-art by 1% to 6% on six image and video datasets and four evaluation benchmarks. The implementation is publicly available at our GitHub repository: https://github.com/SMSD75/MoSiC/tree/main</p></details> | Accepted to ICCV2025 |
| **[GoalFlow: Goal-Driven Flow Matching for Multimodal Trajectories Generation in End-to-End Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05689v4)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose GoalFlow, an end-to-end autonomous driving method for generating high-quality multimodal trajectories. In autonomous driving scenarios, there is rarely a single suitable trajectory. Recent methods have increasingly focused on modeling multimodal trajectory distributions. However, they suffer from trajectory selection complexity and reduced trajectory quality due to high trajectory divergence and inconsistencies between guidance and scene information. To address these issues, we introduce GoalFlow, a novel method that effectively constrains the generative process to produce high-quality, multimodal trajectories. To resolve the trajectory divergence problem inherent in diffusion-based methods, GoalFlow constrains the generated trajectories by introducing a goal point. GoalFlow establishes a novel scoring mechanism that selects the most appropriate goal point from the candidate points based on scene information. Furthermore, GoalFlow employs an efficient generative method, Flow Matching, to generate multimodal trajectories, and incorporates a refined scoring mechanism to select the optimal trajectory from the candidates. Our experimental results, validated on the Navsim\cite{Dauner2024_navsim}, demonstrate that GoalFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering robust multimodal trajectories for autonomous driving. GoalFlow achieved PDMS of 90.3, significantly surpassing other methods. Compared with other diffusion-policy-based methods, our approach requires only a single denoising step to obtain excellent performance.

We present a perception-aware framework that couples an evidential learning-based SCR pose estimator with a receding horizon trajectory optimizer. The optimizer steers the onboard camera toward pixels whose uncertainty predicts reliable scene coordinates, while a fixed-lag smoother fuses the low rate SCR stream with high rate IMU data to close the perception control loop in real time. In simulation, our planner reduces translation (rotation) mean error by 54% / 15% (40% / 31%) relative to yaw fixed and forward-looking baselines, respectively.

| **[One Trajectory, One Token: Grounded Video Tokenization via Panoptic Sub-object Trajectory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23617v2)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective video tokenization is critical for scaling transformer models for long videos. Current approaches tokenize videos using space-time patches, leading to excessive tokens and computational inefficiencies. The best token reduction strategies degrade performance and barely reduce the number of tokens when the camera moves. We introduce grounded video tokenization, a paradigm that organizes tokens based on panoptic sub-object trajectories rather than fixed patches. Our method aligns with fundamental perceptual principles, ensuring that tokenization reflects scene complexity rather than video duration. We propose TrajViT, a video encoder that extracts object trajectories and converts them into semantically meaningful tokens, significantly reducing redundancy while maintaining temporal coherence. Trained with contrastive learning, TrajViT significantly outperforms space-time ViT (ViT3D) across multiple video understanding benchmarks, e.g., TrajViT outperforms ViT3D by a large margin of 6% top-5 recall in average at video-text retrieval task with 10x token deduction. We also show TrajViT as a stronger model than ViT3D for being the video encoder for modern VideoLLM, obtaining an average of 5.2% performance improvement across 6 VideoQA benchmarks while having 4x faster training time and 18x less inference FLOPs. TrajViT is the first efficient encoder to consistently outperform ViT3D across diverse video analysis tasks, making it a robust and scalable solution.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |
| **[Physics-Grounded Motion Forecasting via Equation Discovery for Trajectory-Guided Image-to-Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06830v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in diffusion-based and autoregressive video generation models have achieved remarkable visual realism. However, these models typically lack accurate physical alignment, failing to replicate real-world dynamics in object motion. This limitation arises primarily from their reliance on learned statistical correlations rather than capturing mechanisms adhering to physical laws. To address this issue, we introduce a novel framework that integrates symbolic regression (SR) and trajectory-guided image-to-video (I2V) models for physics-grounded video forecasting. Our approach extracts motion trajectories from input videos, uses a retrieval-based pre-training mechanism to enhance symbolic regression, and discovers equations of motion to forecast physically accurate future trajectories. These trajectories then guide video generation without requiring fine-tuning of existing models. Evaluated on scenarios in Classical Mechanics, including spring-mass, pendulums, and projectile motions, our method successfully recovers ground-truth analytical equations and improves the physical alignment of generated videos over baseline methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[ILNet: Trajectory Prediction with Inverse Learning Attention for Enhancing Intention Capture](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06531v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction for multi-agent interaction scenarios is a crucial challenge. Most advanced methods model agent interactions by efficiently factorized attention based on the temporal and agent axes. However, this static and foward modeling lacks explicit interactive spatio-temporal coordination, capturing only obvious and immediate behavioral intentions. Alternatively, the modern trajectory prediction framework refines the successive predictions by a fixed-anchor selection strategy, which is difficult to adapt in different future environments. It is acknowledged that human drivers dynamically adjust initial driving decisions based on further assumptions about the intentions of surrounding vehicles. Motivated by human driving behaviors, this paper proposes ILNet, a multi-agent trajectory prediction method with Inverse Learning (IL) attention and Dynamic Anchor Selection (DAS) module. IL Attention employs an inverse learning paradigm to model interactions at neighboring moments, introducing proposed intentions to dynamically encode the spatio-temporal coordination of interactions, thereby enhancing the model's ability to capture complex interaction patterns. Then, the learnable DAS module is proposed to extract multiple trajectory change keypoints as anchors in parallel with almost no increase in parameters. Experimental results show that the ILNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the INTERACTION and Argoverse motion forecasting datasets. Particularly, in challenged interaction scenarios, ILNet achieves higher accuracy and more multimodal distributions of trajectories over fewer parameters. Our codes are available at https://github.com/mjZeng11/ILNet.</p></details> |  |

However, quality growing data of plants at scale is difficult to generate. Here we use a mobile robotic platform to capture high-resolution environmental sensing and phenotyping measurements of a large-scale hydroponic leafy greens system. We describe a self-supervised modeling approach to build a map from observed growing data to the entire plant growth trajectory. We demonstrate our approach by forecasting future plant height and harvest mass of crops in this system. This approach represents a significant advance in combining robotic automation and machine learning, as well as providing actionable insights for agronomic research and operational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Driving View Synthesis on Free-form Trajectories with Generative Prior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01717v3)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Driving view synthesis along free-form trajectories is essential for realistic driving simulations, enabling closed-loop evaluation of end-to-end driving policies. Existing methods excel at view interpolation along recorded paths but struggle to generalize to novel trajectories due to limited viewpoints in driving videos. To tackle this challenge, we propose DriveX, a novel free-form driving view synthesis framework, that progressively distills generative prior into the 3D Gaussian model during its optimization. Within this framework, we utilize a video diffusion model to refine the degraded novel trajectory renderings from the in-training Gaussian model, while the restored videos in turn serve as additional supervision for optimizing the 3D Gaussian. Concretely, we craft an inpainting-based video restoration task, which can disentangle the identification of degraded regions from the generative capability of the diffusion model and remove the need of simulating specific degraded pattern in the training of the diffusion model. To further enhance the consistency and fidelity of generated contents, the pseudo ground truth is progressively updated with gradually improved novel trajectory rendering, allowing both components to co-adapt and reinforce each other while minimizing the disruption on the optimization. By tightly integrating 3D scene representation with generative prior, DriveX achieves high-quality view synthesis beyond recorded trajectories in real time--unlocking new possibilities for flexible and realistic driving simulations on free-form trajectories.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |

The context itself can be static (lanes, regulatory elements, etc) or dynamic (traffic participants). This paper presents a lane graph-based motion prediction model that first predicts graph-based goal proposals and later fuses them with cross attention over multiple contextual elements. We follow the famous encoder-interactor-decoder architecture where the encoder encodes scene context using lightweight Gated Recurrent Units, the interactor applies cross-context attention over encoded scene features and graph goal proposals, and the decoder regresses multimodal trajectories via Laplacian Mixture Density Network from the aggregated encodings. Using cross-attention over graph-based goal proposals gives robust trajectory estimates since the model learns to attend to future goal-relevant scene elements for the intended agent. We evaluate our work on nuScenes motion prediction dataset, achieving state-of-the-art results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging the Spatial Hierarchy: Coarse-to-fine Trajectory Generation via Cascaded Hybrid Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13366v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban mobility data has significant connections with economic growth and plays an essential role in various smart-city applications. However, due to privacy concerns and substantial data collection costs, fine-grained human mobility trajectories are difficult to become publicly available on a large scale. A promising solution to address this issue is trajectory synthesizing. However, existing works often ignore the inherent structural complexity of trajectories, unable to handle complicated high-dimensional distributions and generate realistic fine-grained trajectories. In this paper, we propose Cardiff, a coarse-to-fine Cascaded hybrid diffusion-based trajectory synthesizing framework for fine-grained and privacy-preserving mobility generation. By leveraging the hierarchical nature of urban mobility, Cardiff decomposes the generation process into two distinct levels, i.e., discrete road segment-level and continuous fine-grained GPS-level: (i) In the segment-level, to reduce computational costs and redundancy in raw trajectories, we first encode the discrete road segments into low-dimensional latent embeddings and design a diffusion transformer-based latent denoising network for segment-level trajectory synthesis. (ii) Taking the first stage of generation as conditions, we then design a fine-grained GPS-level conditional denoising network with a noise augmentation mechanism to achieve robust and high-fidelity generation. Additionally, the Cardiff framework not only progressively generates high-fidelity trajectories through cascaded denoising but also flexibly enables a tunable balance between privacy preservation and utility. Experimental results on three large real-world trajectory datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in various metrics.</p></details> |  |

However, due to the imbalance between self-consistency and cross-consistency, these CD-based methods inherently suffer from improper conditional guidance, leading to sub-optimal generation results. To address this issue, we present SegmentDreamer, a novel framework designed to fully unleash the potential of consistency models for high-fidelity text-to-3D generation. Specifically, we reformulate SDS through the proposed Segmented Consistency Trajectory Distillation (SCTD), effectively mitigating the imbalance issues by explicitly defining the relationship between self- and cross-consistency. Moreover, SCTD partitions the Probability Flow Ordinary Differential Equation (PF-ODE) trajectory into multiple sub-trajectories and ensures consistency within each segment, which can theoretically provide a significantly tighter upper bound on distillation error. Additionally, we propose a distillation pipeline for a more swift and stable generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our SegmentDreamer outperforms state-of-the-art methods in visual quality, enabling high-fidelity 3D asset creation through 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025, project page: https://zjhjojo.github.io/</p></details> |

Marginal prediction models commonly forecast each agent's future trajectories independently, often leading to sub-optimal planning decisions for an automated vehicle. In contrast, joint prediction models explicitly account for the interactions between agents, yielding socially and physically consistent predictions on a scene level. However, existing approaches differ not only in their problem formulation but also in the model architectures and implementation details used, making it difficult to compare them. In this work, we systematically investigate different approaches to joint motion prediction, including post-processing of the marginal predictions, explicitly training the model for joint predictions, and framing the problem as a generative task. We evaluate each approach in terms of prediction accuracy, multi-modality, and inference efficiency, offering a comprehensive analysis of the strengths and limitations of each approach.

Testing on a longitudinal dataset of N=45 individuals affected by General Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and/or Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) derived from Fisher et al. 2017, we propose a novel pipeline for the analysis of the temporal dynamics of psychopathological symptoms. First, we employ the PCMCI+ algorithm with nonparametric independence test to determine the causal network of nonlinear dependencies between symptoms in individuals with different mental disorders. We found that the PCMCI+ effectively highlights the individual peculiarities of each symptom network, which could be leveraged towards personalized therapies. At the same time, aggregating the networks by diagnosis sheds light to disorder-specific causal mechanisms, in agreement with previous psychopathological literature. Then, we enrich the dataset by computing complexity-based measures (e.g. entropy, fractal dimension, recurrence) from the symptom time series, and feed it to a suitably selected machine learning algorithm to aid the diagnosis of each individual. The new dataset yields 91% accuracy in the classification of the symptom dynamics, proving to be an effective diagnostic support tool. Overall, these findings highlight how integrating causal modeling and temporal complexity can enhance diagnostic differentiation, offering a principled, data-driven foundation for both personalized assessment in clinical psychology and structural advances in psychological research.</p></details> |  |

We evaluate a state-of-the-art model using our novel L4 Motion Forecasting dataset based on our own data recordings in Germany and the US. This includes enhanced map and agent features. We compare our dataset to the US-centric Argoverse 2 benchmark. First, we find that incorporating supplementary map and agent features unique to our dataset, yields no measurable improvement over baseline features, demonstrating that modern architectures do not need extensive feature sets for optimal performance. The limited features of public datasets are sufficient to capture convoluted interactions without added complexity. Second, we perform cross-dataset experiments to evaluate how effective domain knowledge can be transferred between datasets. Third, we group our dataset by country and check the knowledge transfer between different driving cultures.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by the success of RL in language models, there is growing interest in further improving the models by alignment with a certain reward. In this work, we propose a novel preference optimization method for masked discrete diffusion models through a principled diffusion trajectory alignment. Instead of applying the reward on the final output and backpropagating the gradient to the entire discrete denoising process, we decompose the problem into a set of stepwise alignment objectives. This framework enables efficient diffusion optimization, is compatible with arbitrary reward functions, and importantly, guarantees an equivalent optimal solution under additive factorization of the trajectory reward. Experiments across multiple domains including DNA sequence design, protein inverse folding, and language modeling consistently demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Notably, it achieves an up to 12\% improvement over the most competitive RL-based baseline in terms of predicted activity on DNA sequence design, and further improves the GSM8K score from 78.6 to 80.7 on LLaDA-8B-Instruct for language modeling.</p></details> | 22 pages, 3 figures |

The neural representation of a set is used as the terminal set constraint for a model predictive control (MPC) local planner, resulting in improved recursive feasibility and safety. To achieve real-time performance and desired generalization properties, we employ the idea of hypernetworks. We use the Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis as the source of supervision during the training process, allowing us to consider general nonlinear dynamics and arbitrary constraints. The proposed method is extensively evaluated against relevant baselines in simulations for different environments and robot dynamics. The results show an increase in success rate of up to 52% compared to the best baseline while maintaining comparable execution speed. Additionally, we deploy our proposed method, NTC-MPC, on a physical robot and demonstrate its ability to safely avoid obstacles in scenarios where the baselines fail.</p></details> |  |
| **[Risk-Aware Trajectory Optimization and Control for an Underwater Suspended Robotic System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04640v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper focuses on the trajectory optimization of an underwater suspended robotic system comprising an uncrewed surface vessel (USV) and an uncrewed underwater vehicle (UUV) for autonomous litter collection. The key challenge lies in the significant uncertainty in drag and weight parameters introduced by the collected litter. We propose a dynamical model for the coupled UUV-USV system in the primary plane of motion and a risk-aware optimization approach incorporating parameter uncertainty and noise to ensure safe interactions with the environment. A stochastic optimization problem is solved using a conditional value-at-risk framework. Simulations demonstrate that our approach reduces collision risks and energy consumption, highlighting its reliability compared to existing control methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[LTMSformer: A Local Trend-Aware Attention and Motion State Encoding Transformer for Multi-Agent Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04634v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It has been challenging to model the complex temporal-spatial dependencies between agents for trajectory prediction. As each state of an agent is closely related to the states of adjacent time steps, capturing the local temporal dependency is beneficial for prediction, while most studies often overlook it. Besides, learning the high-order motion state attributes is expected to enhance spatial interaction modeling, but it is rarely seen in previous works. To address this, we propose a lightweight framework, LTMSformer, to extract temporal-spatial interaction features for multi-modal trajectory prediction. Specifically, we introduce a Local Trend-Aware Attention mechanism to capture the local temporal dependency by leveraging a convolutional attention mechanism with hierarchical local time boxes. Next, to model the spatial interaction dependency, we build a Motion State Encoder to incorporate high-order motion state attributes, such as acceleration, jerk, heading, etc. To further refine the trajectory prediction, we propose a Lightweight Proposal Refinement Module that leverages Multi-Layer Perceptrons for trajectory embedding and generates the refined trajectories with fewer model parameters. Experiment results on the Argoverse 1 dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms the baseline HiVT-64, reducing the minADE by approximately 4.35%, the minFDE by 8.74%, and the MR by 20%. We also achieve higher accuracy than HiVT-128 with a 68% reduction in model size.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial-Temporal Conditional Random Field for Human Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18198v2)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is of significant importance in computer vision. Accurate pedestrian trajectory prediction benefits autonomous vehicles and robots in planning their motion. Pedestrians' trajectories are greatly influenced by their intentions. Prior studies having introduced various deep learning methods only pay attention to the spatial and temporal information of trajectory, overlooking the explicit intention information. In this study, we introduce a novel model, termed the \textbf{S-T CRF}: \textbf{S}patial-\textbf{T}emporal \textbf{C}onditional \textbf{R}andom \textbf{F}ield, which judiciously incorporates intention information besides spatial and temporal information of trajectory. This model uses a Conditional Random Field (CRF) to generate a representation of future intentions, greatly improving the prediction of subsequent trajectories when combined with spatial-temporal representation. Furthermore, the study innovatively devises a space CRF loss and a time CRF loss, meticulously designed to enhance interaction constraints and temporal dynamics, respectively. Extensive experimental evaluations on dataset ETH/UCY and SDD demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses existing baseline approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predicting Drivers' Route Trajectories in Last-Mile Delivery Using A Pair-wise Attention-based Pointer Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03802v2)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In last-mile delivery, drivers frequently deviate from planned delivery routes because of their tacit knowledge of the road and curbside infrastructure, customer availability, and other characteristics of the respective service areas. Hence, the actual stop sequences chosen by an experienced human driver may be potentially preferable to the theoretical shortest-distance routing under real-life operational conditions. Thus, being able to predict the actual stop sequence that a human driver would follow can help to improve route planning in last-mile delivery. This paper proposes a pair-wise attention-based pointer neural network for this prediction task using drivers' historical delivery trajectory data. In addition to the commonly used encoder-decoder architecture for sequence-to-sequence prediction, we propose a new attention mechanism based on an alternative specific neural network to capture the local pair-wise information for each pair of stops. To further capture the global efficiency of the route, we propose a new iterative sequence generation algorithm that is used after model training to identify the first stop of a route that yields the lowest operational cost. Results from an extensive case study on real operational data from Amazon's last-mile delivery operations in the US show that our proposed method can significantly outperform traditional optimization-based approaches and other machine learning methods (such as the Long Short-Term Memory encoder-decoder and the original pointer network) in finding stop sequences that are closer to high-quality routes executed by experienced drivers in the field. Compared to benchmark models, the proposed model can increase the average prediction accuracy of the first four stops from around 0.229 to 0.312, and reduce the disparity between the predicted route and the actual route by around 15%.</p></details> |  |
| **[D4orm: Multi-Robot Trajectories with Dynamics-aware Diffusion Denoised Deformations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12204v2)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work presents an optimization method for generating kinodynamically feasible and collision-free multi-robot trajectories that exploits an incremental denoising scheme in diffusion models. Our key insight is that high-quality trajectories can be discovered merely by denoising noisy trajectories sampled from a distribution. This approach has no learning component, relying instead on only two ingredients: a dynamical model of the robots to obtain feasible trajectories via rollout, and a fitness function to guide denoising with Monte Carlo gradient approximation. The proposed framework iteratively optimizes a deformation for the previous trajectory with the current denoising process, allows anytime refinement as time permits, supports different dynamics, and benefits from GPU acceleration. Our evaluations for differential-drive and holonomic teams with up to 16 robots in 2D and 3D worlds show its ability to discover high-quality solutions faster than other black-box optimization methods such as MPPI. In a 2D holonomic case with 16 robots, it is almost twice as fast. As evidence for feasibility, we demonstrate zero-shot deployment of the planned trajectories on eight multirotors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 2025 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)</p></details> |
| **[VLM-TDP: VLM-guided Trajectory-conditioned Diffusion Policy for Robust Long-Horizon Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04524v1)** | 2025-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion policy has demonstrated promising performance in the field of robotic manipulation. However, its effectiveness has been primarily limited in short-horizon tasks, and its performance significantly degrades in the presence of image noise. To address these limitations, we propose a VLM-guided trajectory-conditioned diffusion policy (VLM-TDP) for robust and long-horizon manipulation. Specifically, the proposed method leverages state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) to decompose long-horizon tasks into concise, manageable sub-tasks, while also innovatively generating voxel-based trajectories for each sub-task. The generated trajectories serve as a crucial conditioning factor, effectively steering the diffusion policy and substantially enhancing its performance. The proposed Trajectory-conditioned Diffusion Policy (TDP) is trained on trajectories derived from demonstration data and validated using the trajectories generated by the VLM. Simulation experimental results indicate that our method significantly outperforms classical diffusion policies, achieving an average 44% increase in success rate, over 100% improvement in long-horizon tasks, and a 20% reduction in performance degradation in challenging conditions, such as noisy images or altered environments. These findings are further reinforced by our real-world experiments, where the performance gap becomes even more pronounced in long-horizon tasks.

| **[Rapid and Safe Trajectory Planning over Diverse Scenes through Diffusion Composition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04384v1)** | 2025-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safe trajectory planning remains a significant challenge in complex environments, where traditional methods often trade off computational efficiency for safety. Comprehensive obstacle modeling improves safety but is computationally expensive, while approximate methods are more efficient but may compromise safety. To address this issue, this paper introduces a rapid and safe trajectory planning framework based on state-based diffusion models. Leveraging only low-dimensional vehicle states, the diffusion models achieve notable inference efficiency while ensuring sufficient collision-free characteristics. By composing diffusion models, the proposed framework can safely generalize across diverse scenarios, planning collision-free trajectories even in unseen scenes. To further ensure the safety of the generated trajectories, an efficient, rule-based safety filter is proposed, which selects optimal trajectories that satisfy both sufficient safety and control feasibility from among candidate trajectories. Both in seen and unseen scenarios, the proposed method achieves efficient inference time while maintaining high safety and stability. Evaluations on the F1TENTH vehicle further demonstrate that the proposed method is practical in real-world applications.

| **[WebSynthesis: World-Model-Guided MCTS for Efficient WebUI-Trajectory Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04370v1)** | 2025-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved the capabilities of web agents. However, effectively navigating complex and dynamic web environments still requires more advanced trajectory-level planning and execution. Prior studies have addressed self-improving agents by collecting extensive GUI trajectories from real-environment interactions. Despite their effectiveness, these approaches encounter two critical challenges: (1) Uncontrollable environment states, where real or sandboxed web environments often yield unstable and non-deterministic feedback, complicating the reproduction and debugging of agent behaviors; and (2) High API costs, as generating even a single interaction trajectory can involve hundreds of queries, leading to considerable API usage and computational expenses. To address these limitations and enable scalable self-improvement for agents, we propose WebSynthesis, a novel framework for trajectory synthesis and training. WebSynthesis leverages a learned world model to simulate virtual web environments, allowing a policy agent to perform efficient and reversible tree-based planning. This approach supports the large-scale generation of diverse and high-quality trajectories, which are subsequently utilized to refine the agent's policy. Experimental results demonstrate that an agent trained using WebSynthesis on a small-scale synthetic dataset achieves performance comparable to or even surpassing that of models trained on large-scale real-world data.</p></details> |  |
| **[K Nearest Neighbor-Guided Trajectory Similarity Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00285v2)** | 2025-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory similarity is fundamental to many spatio-temporal data mining applications. Recent studies propose deep learning models to approximate conventional trajectory similarity measures, exploiting their fast inference time once trained. Although efficient inference has been reported, challenges remain in similarity approximation accuracy due to difficulties in trajectory granularity modeling and in exploiting similarity signals in the training data. To fill this gap, we propose TSMini, a highly effective trajectory similarity model with a sub-view modeling mechanism capable of learning multi-granularity trajectory patterns and a k nearest neighbor-based loss that guides TSMini to learn not only absolute similarity values between trajectories but also their relative similarity ranks. Together, these two innovations enable highly accurate trajectory similarity approximation. Experiments show that TSMini can outperform the state-of-the-art models by 22% in accuracy on average when learning trajectory similarity measures.</p></details> |  |

Trajectory refinement has emerged as a key strategy to enhance prediction accuracy. However, existing refinement methods often overlook the topological relationships between trajectories, which are vital for improving prediction precision. Inspired by braid theory, we propose a novel trajectory refinement approach, Soft-Braid Refiner (SRefiner), guided by the soft-braid topological structure of trajectories using Soft-Braid Attention. Soft-Braid Attention captures spatio-temporal topological relationships between trajectories by considering both spatial proximity and vehicle motion states at ``soft intersection points". Additionally, we extend this approach to model interactions between trajectories and lanes, further improving the prediction accuracy. SRefiner is a multi-iteration, multi-agent framework that iteratively refines trajectories, incorporating topological information to enhance interactions within traffic scenarios. SRefiner achieves significant performance improvements over four baseline methods across two datasets, establishing a new state-of-the-art in trajectory refinement.

| **[AMD: Adaptive Momentum and Decoupled Contrastive Learning Framework for Robust Long-Tail Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01801v2)** | 2025-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately predicting the future trajectories of traffic agents is essential in autonomous driving. However, due to the inherent imbalance in trajectory distributions, tail data in natural datasets often represents more complex and hazardous scenarios. Existing studies typically rely solely on a base model's prediction error, without considering the diversity and uncertainty of long-tail trajectory patterns. We propose an adaptive momentum and decoupled contrastive learning framework (AMD), which integrates unsupervised and supervised contrastive learning strategies. By leveraging an improved momentum contrast learning (MoCo-DT) and decoupled contrastive learning (DCL) module, our framework enhances the model's ability to recognize rare and complex trajectories. Additionally, we design four types of trajectory random augmentation methods and introduce an online iterative clustering strategy, allowing the model to dynamically update pseudo-labels and better adapt to the distributional shifts in long-tail data. We propose three different criteria to define long-tail trajectories and conduct extensive comparative experiments on the nuScenes and ETH$/$UCY datasets. The results show that AMD not only achieves optimal performance in long-tail trajectory prediction but also demonstrates outstanding overall prediction accuracy.</p></details> |  |

While many promising methods have been developed using online corpora and captioned photographs, their application to scientific domains, where data encodes highly specialized knowledge, remains a challenge. Liquid Argon Time Projection Chambers (LArTPCs) provide high-resolution 3D imaging for fundamental physics, but analysis of their sparse, complex point cloud data often relies on supervised methods trained on large simulations, introducing potential biases. We introduce the Point-based Liquid Argon Masked Autoencoder (PoLAr-MAE), applying masked point modeling to unlabeled LArTPC images using domain-specific volumetric tokenization and energy prediction. We show this SSL approach learns physically meaningful trajectory representations directly from data. This yields remarkable data efficiency: fine-tuning on just 100 labeled events achieves track/shower semantic segmentation performance comparable to the state-of-the-art supervised baseline trained on $>$100,000 events. Furthermore, internal attention maps exhibit emergent instance segmentation of particle trajectories. While challenges remain, particularly for fine-grained features, we make concrete SSL's potential for building a foundation model for LArTPC image analysis capable of serving as a common base for all data reconstruction tasks. To facilitate further progress, we release PILArNet-M, a large dataset of 1M LArTPC events.

In this work, we propose DIVER, an end-to-end driving framework that integrates reinforcement learning with diffusion-based generation to produce diverse and feasible trajectories. At the core of DIVER lies a reinforced diffusion-based generation mechanism. First, the model conditions on map elements and surrounding agents to generate multiple reference trajectories from a single ground-truth trajectory, alleviating the limitations of imitation learning that arise from relying solely on single expert demonstrations. Second, reinforcement learning is employed to guide the diffusion process, where reward-based supervision enforces safety and diversity constraints on the generated trajectories, thereby enhancing their practicality and generalization capability. Furthermore, to address the limitations of L2-based open-loop metrics in capturing trajectory diversity, we propose a novel Diversity metric to evaluate the diversity of multi-mode predictions.Extensive experiments on the closed-loop NAVSIM and Bench2Drive benchmarks, as well as the open-loop nuScenes dataset, demonstrate that DIVER significantly improves trajectory diversity, effectively addressing the mode collapse problem inherent in imitation learning.</p></details> | 16 pages, 6 figures |

| **[Advancing Event Forecasting through Massive Training of Large Language Models: Challenges, Solutions, and Broader Impacts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19477v1)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many recent papers have studied the development of superforecaster-level event forecasting LLMs. While methodological problems with early studies cast doubt on the use of LLMs for event forecasting, recent studies with improved evaluation methods have shown that state-of-the-art LLMs are gradually reaching superforecaster-level performance, and reinforcement learning has also been reported to improve future forecasting. Additionally, the unprecedented success of recent reasoning models and Deep Research-style models suggests that technology capable of greatly improving forecasting performance has been developed. Therefore, based on these positive recent trends, we argue that the time is ripe for research on large-scale training of superforecaster-level event forecasting LLMs. We discuss two key research directions: training methods and data acquisition. For training, we first introduce three difficulties of LLM-based event forecasting training: noisiness-sparsity, knowledge cut-off, and simple reward structure problems. Then, we present related ideas to mitigate these problems: hypothetical event Bayesian networks, utilizing poorly-recalled and counterfactual events, and auxiliary reward signals. For data, we propose aggressive use of market, public, and crawling datasets to enable large-scale training and evaluation. Finally, we explain how these technical advances could enable AI to provide predictive intelligence to society in broader areas. This position paper presents promising specific paths and considerations for getting closer to superforecaster-level AI technology, aiming to call for researchers' interest in these directions.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces Step-3, a 321B-parameter VLM with hardware-aware model-system co-design optimized for minimizing decoding costs. Step-3 innovates in two key dimensions: (1) A novel Multi-Matrix Factorization Attention (MFA) mechanism that significantly reduces both KV cache size and computation while maintaining high attention expressiveness, and (2) Attention-FFN Disaggregation (AFD), a distributed inference system that decouples attention and Feed-Forward Network (FFN) layers into specialized subsystems. This co-design achieves unprecedented cost efficiency: Step-3 significantly reduces theoretical decoding costs compared with models like DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen3 MoE 235B, with the gains widening at longer context. Step-3 achieves low cost while activating 38B parameters per token (more than DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen3 MoE 235B), demonstrating that hardware-aligned attention arithmetic intensity, MoE sparsity, and AFD are critical to cost-effectiveness. We perform a head-to-head comparison with DeepSeek-V3 in its favorable scenarios. Our implementation on Hopper GPUs achieves a decoding throughput of up to 4,039 tokens per second per GPU under 50ms TPOT SLA (4K context, FP8, no MTP). It is higher than DeepSeek-V3's 2,324 in the same setup and sets a new Pareto frontier for LLM decoding.</p></details> |  |

These methods exhibited excellent generalization capabilities in instruction understanding and task reasoning. However, they were constrained by the fixed knowledge bases and reasoning abilities of LLMs, preventing fully incorporating experiential knowledge and thus resulting in a lack of efficient evolutionary capacity. To address this, we drew inspiration from the evolution capabilities of natural agents, and proposed a self-evolving VLN framework (SE-VLN) to endow VLN agents with the ability to continuously evolve during testing. To the best of our knowledge, it was the first time that an multimodal LLM-powered self-evolving VLN framework was proposed. Specifically, SE-VLN comprised three core modules, i.e., a hierarchical memory module to transfer successful and failure cases into reusable knowledge, a retrieval-augmented thought-based reasoning module to retrieve experience and enable multi-step decision-making, and a reflection module to realize continual evolution. Comprehensive tests illustrated that the SE-VLN achieved navigation success rates of 57% and 35.2% in unseen environments, representing absolute performance improvements of 23.9% and 15.0% over current state-of-the-art methods on R2R and REVERSE datasets, respectively. Moreover, the SE-VLN showed performance improvement with increasing experience repository, elucidating its great potential as a self-evolving agent framework for VLN.</p></details> |  |

PAD introduces Multi-Point Attention Attack, which guides parallel generative processes toward harmful outputs that inspired by affirmative response patterns in LLMs. Experimental evaluations across four LLDMs demonstrate that PAD achieves jailbreak attack success rates by 97%, revealing significant safety vulnerabilities. Furthermore, compared to autoregressive LLMs of the same size, LLDMs increase the harmful generation speed by 2x, significantly highlighting risks of uncontrolled misuse.Through comprehensive analysis, we provide an investigation into LLDM architecture, offering critical insights for the secure deployment of diffusion-based language models.</p></details> |  |

Benchmarking Overestimation under the One-Time-Pad-Based Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19219v1)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Overestimation in evaluating large language models (LLMs) has become an increasing concern. Due to the contamination of public benchmarks or imbalanced model training, LLMs may achieve unreal evaluation results on public benchmarks, either intentionally or unintentionally, which leads to unfair comparisons among LLMs and undermines their realistic capability assessments. Existing benchmarks attempt to address these issues by keeping test cases permanently secret, mitigating contamination through human evaluation, or repeatedly collecting and constructing new samples. However, these approaches fail to ensure reproducibility, transparency, and high efficiency simultaneously. Moreover, the extent of overestimation in current LLMs remains unquantified. To address these issues, we propose ArxivRoll, a dynamic evaluation framework inspired by one-time pad encryption in cryptography. ArxivRoll comprises two key components: \emph{i) SCP (Sequencing, Cloze, and Prediction)}, an automated generator for private test cases, and \emph{ii) Rugged Scores (RS)}, metrics that measure the proportion of public benchmark contamination and training bias. Leveraging SCP, ArxivRoll constructs a new benchmark every six months using recent articles from ArXiv and employs them for one-time evaluations of LLM performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the high quality of our benchmark, and we provide a systematic evaluation of current LLMs. The source code is available at https://github.com/liangzid/ArxivRoll/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Sourc...</summary><p>Source code: https://github.com/liangzid/ArxivRoll/ Website: https://arxivroll.moreoverai.com/</p></details> |

This study examines how dialectal variation, specifically African American Vernacular English (AAVE) versus Standard American English (SAE), interacts with data poisoning to influence toxicity in outputs. Using both small- and medium-scale LLaMA models, we show that even minimal exposure to poisoned data significantly increases toxicity for AAVE inputs, while it remains comparatively unaffected for SAE. Larger models exhibit a more significant amplification effect which suggests heightened susceptibility with scale. To further assess these disparities, we employed GPT-4o as a fairness auditor, which identified harmful stereotypical patterns disproportionately tied to AAVE inputs, including portrayals of aggression, criminality, and intellectual inferiority. These findings underscore the compounding impact of data poisoning and dialectal bias and emphasize the need for dialect-aware evaluation, targeted debiasing interventions, and socially responsible training protocols during development.</p></details> |  |

With a focus on gender and professional bias, this work examines in which manner LLMs shape responses to ungendered prompts, contributing to biased outputs. This analysis uses a structured experimental method, giving different prompts involving three different professional job combinations, which are also characterized by a hierarchical relationship. This study uses Italian, a language with extensive grammatical gender differences, to highlight potential limitations in current LLMs' ability to generate objective text in non-English languages. Two popular LLM-based chatbots are examined, namely OpenAI ChatGPT (gpt-4o-mini) and Google Gemini (gemini-1.5-flash). Through APIs, we collected a range of 3600 responses. The results highlight how content generated by LLMs can perpetuate stereotypes. For example, Gemini associated 100% (ChatGPT 97%) of 'she' pronouns to the 'assistant' rather than the 'manager'. The presence of bias in AI-generated text can have significant implications in many fields, such as in the workplaces or in job selections, raising ethical concerns about its use. Understanding these risks is pivotal to developing mitigation strategies and assuring that AI-based systems do not increase social inequalities, but rather contribute to more equitable outcomes. Future research directions include expanding the study to additional chatbots or languages, refining prompt engineering methods or further exploiting a larger experimental base.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (ECML PKDD 2025) - 5th Workshop on Bias and Fairness in AI (BIAS25)</p></details> |
| **[Accelerating Multimodal Large Language Models via Dynamic Visual-Token Exit and the Empirical Findings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19628v2)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The excessive use of visual tokens in existing Multimoal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often exhibits obvious redundancy and brings in prohibitively expensive computation. To gain insights into this problem, we first conduct extensive empirical studies on the attention behaviors of MLLMs, and summarize three main inference stages in MLLMs: (i) Early fusion between tokens is first accomplished quickly. (ii) Intra-modality modeling then comes to play. (iii) Multimodal reasoning} resumes and lasts until the end of inference. In particular, we reveal that visual tokens will stop contributing to reasoning when the text tokens receive enough image information, yielding obvious visual redundancy. Based on these generalized observations, we propose a simple yet effective method to improve the efficiency of MLLMs, termed dynamic visual-token exit (DyVTE). DyVTE uses lightweight hyper-networks to perceive the text token status and decide the removal of all visual tokens after a certain layer, thereby addressing the observed visual redundancy. To validate VTE, we apply it to a set of MLLMs, including LLaVA, VILA, Eagle and InternVL, and conduct extensive experiments on a bunch of benchmarks. The experiment results not only show the effectiveness of our VTE in improving MLLMs' efficiency, but also yield the general modeling patterns of MLLMs, well facilitating the in-depth understanding of MLLMs. Our code is released at https://github.com/DoubtedSteam/DyVTE.</p></details> |  |
| **[Solar Photovoltaic Assessment with Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19144v1)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate detection and localization of solar photovoltaic (PV) panels in satellite imagery is essential for optimizing microgrids and active distribution networks (ADNs), which are critical components of renewable energy systems. Existing methods lack transparency regarding their underlying algorithms or training datasets, rely on large, high-quality PV training data, and struggle to generalize to new geographic regions or varied environmental conditions without extensive re-training. These limitations lead to inconsistent detection outcomes, hindering large-scale deployment and data-driven grid optimization. In this paper, we investigate how large language models (LLMs) can be leveraged to overcome these challenges. Despite their promise, LLMs face several challenges in solar panel detection, including difficulties with multi-step logical processes, inconsistent output formatting, frequent misclassification of visually similar objects (e.g., shadows, parking lots), and low accuracy in complex tasks such as spatial localization and quantification. To overcome these issues, we propose the PV Assessment with LLMs (PVAL) framework, which incorporates task decomposition for more efficient workflows, output standardization for consistent and scalable formatting, few-shot prompting to enhance classification accuracy, and fine-tuning using curated PV datasets with detailed annotations. PVAL ensures transparency, scalability, and adaptability across heterogeneous datasets while minimizing computational overhead. By combining open-source accessibility with robust methodologies, PVAL establishes an automated and reproducible pipeline for solar panel detection, paving the way for large-scale renewable energy integration and optimized grid management.</p></details> | 27 pages, 7 figures |

Recently, the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture has emerged as an efficient alternative, promising efficient inference with less activated weights per token. Nevertheless, fine-grained MoE-based LLMs face several challenges: 1) Variable workloads during runtime create arbitrary GEMV-GEMM ratios that reduce hardware utilization, 2) Traditional MoE-based scheduling for LLM serving cannot fuse attention operations with MoE operations, leading to increased latency and decreased hardware utilization, and 3) Despite being more efficient than conventional LLMs, loading experts from DRAM still consumes significant energy and requires substantial DRAM bandwidth. Addressing these challenges, we propose: 1) A3D-MoE, a 3D Heterogeneous Integration system that employs state-of-the-art vertical integration technology to significantly enhance memory bandwidth while reducing Network-on-Chip (NoC) overhead and energy consumption. 2) A 3D-Adaptive GEMV-GEMM-ratio systolic array with V-Cache efficient data reuse and a novel unified 3D dataflow to solve the problem of reduced hardware utilization caused by arbitrary GEMV-GEMM ratios from different workloads, 3) A Hardware resource-aware operation fusion scheduler that fuses attention operations with MoE operations to enhance hardware performance, and 4) MoE Score-Aware HBM access reduction with even-odd expert placement that reduces DRAM access and bandwidth requirements. Our evaluation results indicate that A3D-MoE delivers significant performance enhancements, reducing latency by a factor of 1.8x to 2x and energy consumption by 2x to 4x, while improving throughput by 1.44x to 1.8x compared to the state-of-the-art.</p></details> |  |

Here we present MOFh6, a large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent system designed to extract, structure, and apply synthesis knowledge from diverse input formats, including raw literature and crystal codes. Built on gpt-4o-mini and fine-tuned with up to few-shot expert-annotated data, MOFh6 achieves 99% accuracy in synthesis data parsing and resolves 94.1% of complex co-reference abbreviations. It processes a single full-text document in 9.6 seconds and localizes structured synthesis descriptions within 36 seconds, with the cost per 100 papers reduced to USD 4.24, a 76% saving over existing systems. By addressing long-standing limitations in cross-paragraph semantic fusion and terminology standardization, MOFh6 reshapes the LLM-based paradigm for MOF synthesis research, transforming static retrieval into an integrated and dynamic knowledge acquisition process. This shift bridges the gap between scientific literature and actionable synthesis design, providing a scalable framework for accelerating materials discovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Models as Attribution Regularizers for Efficient Model Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20268v3)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across diverse domains. However, effectively leveraging their vast knowledge for training smaller downstream models remains an open challenge, especially in domains like tabular data learning, where simpler models are often preferred due to interpretability and efficiency. In this paper, we introduce a novel yet straightforward method for incorporating LLM-generated global task feature attributions into the training process of smaller networks. Specifically, we propose an attribution-matching regularization term that aligns the training dynamics of the smaller model with the insights provided by the LLM. By doing so, our approach yields superior performance in few-shot learning scenarios. Notably, our method requires only black-box API access to the LLM, making it easy to integrate into existing training pipelines with minimal computational overhead. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this method can be used to address common issues in real-world datasets, such as skewness and bias. By integrating high-level knowledge from LLMs, our approach improves generalization, even when training data is limited or imbalanced. We validate its effectiveness through extensive experiments across multiple tasks, demonstrating improved learning efficiency and model robustness.</p></details> |  |

However, code review requires experienced developers who may not always have the time to perform an in-depth review of code. Thus, automating code review can help alleviate the cognitive burden on experienced software developers allowing them to focus on their primary activities of writing code to add new features and fix bugs. In this paper, we describe our experience in using Large Language Models towards automating the code review process in Ericsson. We describe the development of a lightweight tool using LLMs and static program analysis. We then describe our preliminary experiments with experienced developers in evaluating our code review tool and the encouraging results.</p></details> |  |

To mitigate this, we propose \textbf{LISA}, a \textbf{L}ayer-wise \textbf{I}ntegration and \textbf{S}uppression \textbf{A}pproach that enhances generation consistency through hierarchical modulation and multi-layer fusion. LISA leverages the functional hierarchy within MLLMs, where shallow layers provide visual grounding, middle layers encode semantics, and deep layers tend to amplify spurious signals. First, zone-specific spectral modulation stabilizes attention by suppressing over-amplified activations in deeper layers while preserving alignment cues in earlier layers. Second, token-level logits from selected layers are fused via anchor-based routing, with token-wise anchor selection and soft logit fusion enabling adaptive integration during decoding. LISA is fully \textbf{plug-and-play} and can be seamlessly integrated into existing MLLMs, including Qwen2.5-VL. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that LISA reduces hallucinations by up to 53.6\% in $\mathrm{CHAIR}_I$ and improves POPE F1 by 4.5\%, demonstrating strong generalization across models and tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional meta-heuristic and artificial intelligence-based planning methods face significant challenges due to the intricate interplay between indoor environments (IEs) and IWN demands. In this article, we present an indoor wireless network Planning with large LANguage models (iPLAN) framework, which integrates multi-modal IE representations into large language model (LLM)-powered optimizers to improve IWN planning. First, we instate the role of LLMs as optimizers, outlining embedding techniques for IEs, and introducing two core applications of iPLAN: (i) IWN planning based on pre-existing IEs and (ii) joint design of IWN and IE for new wireless-friendly buildings. For the former, we embed essential information into LLM optimizers by leveraging indoor descriptions, domain-specific knowledge, and performance-driven perception. For the latter, we conceptualize a multi-agent strategy, where intelligent agents collaboratively address key planning sub-tasks in a step-by-step manner while ensuring optimal trade-offs between the agents. The simulation results demonstrate that iPLAN achieves superior performance in IWN planning tasks and optimizes building wireless performance through the joint design of IEs and IWNs, exemplifying a paradigm shift in IWN planning.</p></details> |  |

As these professionals handle sensitive information, and the training of text-based GenAI models involves the use of extensive data, there are thus concerns about privacy, security, and broader compliance with regulations and laws. While existing research has addressed privacy and security concerns, the specific compliance risks faced by highly-skilled knowledge workers when using the LLMs, and their mitigation strategies, remain underexplored. As understanding these risks and strategies is crucial for the development of industry-specific compliant LLM mechanisms, this research conducted semi-structured interviews with 24 knowledge workers from knowledge-intensive industries to understand their practices and experiences when integrating LLMs into their workflows. Our research explored how these workers ensure compliance and the resources and challenges they encounter when minimizing risks. Our preliminary findings showed that knowledge workers were concerned about the leakage of sensitive information and took proactive measures such as distorting input data and limiting prompt details to mitigate such risks. Their ability to identify and mitigate risks, however, was significantly hampered by a lack of LLM-specific compliance guidance and training. Our findings highlight the importance of improving knowledge workers' compliance awareness and establishing support systems and compliance cultures within organizations.</p></details> |  |

While recent work has advanced the identification and clustering of argumentative components, the generation stage remains underexplored. Existing approaches typically rely on single-pass generation, offering limited support for factual correction or structural refinement. To address this gap, we introduce Arg-LLaDA, a novel large language diffusion framework that iteratively improves summaries via sufficiency-guided remasking and regeneration. Our method combines a flexible masking controller with a sufficiency-checking module to identify and revise unsupported, redundant, or incomplete spans, yielding more faithful, concise, and coherent outputs. Empirical results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that Arg-LLaDA surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in 7 out of 10 automatic evaluation metrics. In addition, human evaluations reveal substantial improvements across core dimensions, coverage, faithfulness, and conciseness, validating the effectiveness of our iterative, sufficiency-aware generation strategy.</p></details> | Preprint |

Each vehicle generates multiple computing tasks within a time slot, leading to queuing challenges when offloading tasks to the server. The study investigates task offloading strategies, queue stability, and resource allocation. Lyapunov optimization is employed to transform long-term constraints into tractable short-term decisions. To solve the resulting problem, an in-context learning approach based on large language model (LLM) is adopted, replacing the conventional multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework. Experimental results demonstrate that the LLM-based method achieves comparable or even superior performance to MARL.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been submitted to IEEE TMC</p></details> |

However, few studies have focused on the credibility assessment of CTI, and this work still requires manual analysis by cybersecurity experts. In this paper, we propose Knowledge Graph-based Verifier (KGV), the first framework integrating large language models (LLMs) with simple structured knowledge graphs (KGs) for automated CTI credibility assessment. Unlike entity-centric KGs, KGV constructs paragraph-level semantic graphs where nodes represent text segments connected through similarity analysis, which effectively enhances the semantic understanding ability of the model, reduces KG density and greatly improves response speed. Experimental results demonstrate that our KGV outperforms state-of-the-art fact reasoning methods on the CTI-200 dataset, achieving a 5.7\% improvement in F1. Additionally, it shows strong scalability on factual QA and fake news detection datasets. Compared to entity-based knowledge graphs (KGs) for equivalent-length texts, our structurally simple KG reduces node quantities by nearly two-thirds while boosting precision by 1.7\% and cutting response time by 46.7\%. In addition, we have created and publicly released the first CTI credibility assessment dataset, CTI-200. Distinct from CTI identification datasets, CTI-200 refines CTI summaries and key sentences to focus specifically on credibility assessment.</p></details> |  |

HIV management is a compelling use case due to its complexity, including diverse treatment options, comorbidities, and adherence challenges. However, integrating LLMs into clinical practice raises concerns about accuracy, potential harm, and clinician acceptance. Despite their promise, AI applications in HIV care remain underexplored, and LLM benchmarking studies are scarce. This study evaluates the current capabilities of LLMs in HIV management, highlighting their strengths and limitations. We introduce HIVMedQA, a benchmark designed to assess open-ended medical question answering in HIV care. The dataset consists of curated, clinically relevant questions developed with input from an infectious disease physician. We evaluated seven general-purpose and three medically specialized LLMs, applying prompt engineering to enhance performance. Our evaluation framework incorporates both lexical similarity and an LLM-as-a-judge approach, extended to better reflect clinical relevance. We assessed performance across key dimensions: question comprehension, reasoning, knowledge recall, bias, potential harm, and factual accuracy. Results show that Gemini 2.5 Pro consistently outperformed other models across most dimensions. Notably, two of the top three models were proprietary. Performance declined as question complexity increased. Medically fine-tuned models did not always outperform general-purpose ones, and larger model size was not a reliable predictor of performance. Reasoning and comprehension were more challenging than factual recall, and cognitive biases such as recency and status quo were observed. These findings underscore the need for targeted development and evaluation to ensure safe, effective LLM integration in clinical care.</p></details> |  |

The spikes degrade the performance of large language models and sometimes ruin the pre-training. Since the pre-training needs a vast computational budget, we should avoid such spikes. Based on the assumption that the loss spike is caused by the sudden growth of the gradient norm, we explore factors to keep the gradient norm small through an analysis of the spectral norms of the Jacobian matrices for the sub-layers. Our findings suggest that stabilizing the pre-training process requires two conditions: small sub-layers and large shortcut. We conduct various experiments to empirically verify our theoretical analyses. Experimental results demonstrate that methods satisfying the conditions effectively prevent loss spikes during pre-training.</p></details> | COLM 2025 |

Despite advances in automated diagnostic systems across various medical fields, the development of Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) applications for apical periodontitis is still constrained by the lack of a large-scale, high-quality annotated dataset. To address this issue, we release a large-scale panoramic radiograph benchmark called "PerioXrays", comprising 3,673 images and 5,662 meticulously annotated instances of apical periodontitis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first benchmark dataset for automated apical periodontitis diagnosis. This paper further proposes a clinical-oriented apical periodontitis detection (PerioDet) paradigm, which jointly incorporates Background-Denoising Attention (BDA) and IoU-Dynamic Calibration (IDC) mechanisms to address the challenges posed by background noise and small targets in automated detection. Extensive experiments on the PerioXrays dataset demonstrate the superiority of PerioDet in advancing automated apical periodontitis detection. Additionally, a well-designed human-computer collaborative experiment underscores the clinical applicability of our method as an auxiliary diagnostic tool for professional dentists.</p></details> | <details><summary>MICCA...</summary><p>MICCAI 2025(Early Accept)</p></details> |

Therefore, we revisit the private CMS, correct errors in the original CMS paper regarding expectation and variance, modify the CMS implementation to eliminate existing bias, and optimize CMS using randomized response (RR) as the perturbation method. The optimized CMS with RR is shown to outperform CMS variants with other known perturbations in reducing the worst-case mean squared error (MSE), $l_1$ loss, and $l_2$ loss. Additionally, we prove that pairwise-independent hashing is sufficient for CMS, reducing its communication cost to the logarithm of the cardinality of all possible values (i.e., a dictionary). As a result, the optimized CMS with RR is proven theoretically and empirically as the leading algorithm for reducing the aforementioned loss functions when dealing with a very large dictionary. Furthermore, we demonstrate that randomness is necessary to ensure the correctness of CMS, and the communication cost of CMS, though low, is unavoidable despite the randomness being public or private.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 IEEE Computer Security Foundations Symposium, 362-377</p></details> |

This physician-led red-teaming study compares the safety of four publicly available chatbots--Claude by Anthropic, Gemini by Google, GPT-4o by OpenAI, and Llama3-70B by Meta--on a new dataset, HealthAdvice, using an evaluation framework that enables quantitative and qualitative analysis. In total, 888 chatbot responses are evaluated for 222 patient-posed advice-seeking medical questions on primary care topics spanning internal medicine, women's health, and pediatrics. We find statistically significant differences between chatbots. The rate of problematic responses varies from 21.6 percent (Claude) to 43.2 percent (Llama), with unsafe responses varying from 5 percent (Claude) to 13 percent (GPT-4o, Llama). Qualitative results reveal chatbot responses with the potential to lead to serious patient harm. This study suggests that millions of patients could be receiving unsafe medical advice from publicly available chatbots, and further work is needed to improve the clinical safety of these powerful tools.</p></details> | 20 pages |

Automatic Dictionary Selection for Translation on Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18902v1)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There are more than 7,000 languages around the world, and current Large Language Models (LLMs) only support hundreds of languages. Dictionary-based prompting methods can enhance translation on them, but most methods use all the available dictionaries, which could be expensive. Instead, it will be flexible to have a trade-off between token consumption and translation performance. This paper proposes a novel task called \textbf{A}utomatic \textbf{D}ictionary \textbf{S}election (\textbf{ADS}). The goal of the task is to automatically select which dictionary to use to enhance translation. We propose a novel and effective method which we call \textbf{S}elect \textbf{Lo}w-frequency \textbf{W}ords! (\textbf{SLoW}) which selects those dictionaries that have a lower frequency. Our methods have unique advantages. First, there is no need for access to the training data for frequency estimation (which is usually unavailable). Second, it inherits the advantage of dictionary-based methods, where no additional tuning is required on LLMs. Experimental results on 100 languages from FLORES indicate that SLoW surpasses strong baselines, and it can obviously save token usage, with many languages even surpassing the translation performance of the full dictionary baseline.\footnote{A shocking fact is that there is no need to use the actual training data (often unobtainable) for frequency estimation, and an estimation frequency obtained using public resources is still apparently effective in improving translation with ChatGPT and Llama, and DeepSeek.}\footnote{Code and data available upon publication.}</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods are mainly based on traditional signal processing, which cannot effectively process the complex background and dense space debris. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based Space Debris Tracking Network~(SDT-Net) to achieve highly accurate debris tracking. SDT-Net effectively represents the feature of debris, enhancing the efficiency and stability of end-to-end model learning. To train and evaluate this model effectively, we also produce a large-scale dataset Space Debris Tracking Dataset (SDTD) by a novel observation-based data simulation scheme. SDTD contains 18,040 video sequences with a total of 62,562 frames and covers 250,000 synthetic space debris. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our model and the challenging of our dataset. Furthermore, we test our model on real data from the Antarctic Station, achieving a MOTA score of 73.2%, which demonstrates its strong transferability to real-world scenarios. Our dataset and code will be released soon.</p></details> |  |

This paper explores the integration of two emerging paradigms enabled by large language models: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) and Large Action Models (LAMs). We argue that LRMs address the challenges of semantic reasoning and ecosystem complexity while LAMs excel in dynamic action execution and system interoperability. However, each paradigm has complementary limitations - LRMs lack grounded action capabilities, and LAMs often struggle with deep reasoning. We propose an integrated LRM-LAM architectural framework as a promising direction for advancing automated service composition. Such a system can reason about service requirements and constraints while dynamically executing workflows, thus bridging the gap between intention and execution. This integration has the potential to transform service composition into a fully automated, user-friendly process driven by high-level natural language intent.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 3 figures, 19th Symposium and Summer School on Service-Oriented Computing (SummerSOC)</p></details> |

Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery, with its all-weather capability, is essential in remote sensing, yet the lack of large-scale, high-quality SAR image-text datasets hinders its semantic understanding. In this paper, we construct SAR-Text, a large-scale and high-quality dataset consisting of over 130,000 SAR image-text pairs. To construct the SAR-Text dataset, we design the SAR-Narrator framework, which generates textual descriptions for SAR images through a multi-stage progressive transfer learning strategy. To verify the effectiveness of the SAR-TEXT dataset, we conduct experiments on three typical vision-language tasks: image-text retrieval, image captioning, and visual question answering (VQA). Specifically, we construct three representative models on SAR-TEXT: SAR-RS-CLIP, SAR-RS-CoCa, and SAR-GPT. SAR-RS-CLIP achieves notable improvements in retrieval performance, boosting average recall by 16.43% and 10.54% on the OSdataset-512 and HRSID test sets, respectively. In the captioning task, SAR-RS-CoCa achieves BLEU-4, SPICE, and CIDEr scores exceeding those of the original CoCa model by more than 8x, 4x, and 10x, respectively. In the VQA task, SAR-GPT outperforms baseline and single-stage models on multiple SAR-VQA datasets, demonstrating stronger semantic understanding and reasoning ability, as further confirmed by qualitative results. It is worth noting that, as a flexible captioning tool, SAR-Narrator can be readily adopted by the community to construct larger-scale SAR image-text datasets.</p></details> | IEEE Submission |

Existing token reduction methods primarily prune tokens based on importance metrics, such as cumulative attention scores. However, even important tokens may exhibit high redundancy caused by similarity among adjacent video frames and repetitive visual elements. To address this limitation, we propose FrameFusion, a novel token reduction approach integrating similarity-based merging with importance-based pruning. We conduct a thorough study on token similarity characteristics, revealing three key insights: (1) spatially corresponding visual tokens between adjacent frames have higher cosine similarities compared to other token pairs; (2) high token similarities prominently decrease in deeper model layers; and (3) token similarity rankings are highly consistent across different layers. Guided by these observations, FrameFusion computes token similarities exclusively between corresponding visual tokens from adjacent frames, applies token merging at initial successive layers followed by pruning in deeper layers, and adopts a cascaded merging strategy to further enhance efficiency. We evaluate FrameFusion comprehensively across six diverse LVLMs, ranging from 2B to 72B parameters, using five video benchmarks encompassing video retrieval, question-answering, and spatial-temporal understanding tasks. Experiments show that FrameFusion reduces visual tokens by 70%, achieving 1.6-3.6x end-to-end speedups, with an average performance impact of less than 3%. Our code is available at: https://github.com/thu-nics/FrameFusion.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |

Traditional maintenance and rehabilitation planning methods often face scalability and computational challenges, particularly for large-scale networks with thousands of assets under budget constraints. This paper presents a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that optimizes asset management strategies for large infrastructure networks. By decomposing the network-level Markov Decision Process (MDP) into individual asset-level MDPs while using a unified neural network architecture, the proposed framework reduces computational complexity, improves learning efficiency, and enhances scalability. The framework directly incorporates annual budget constraints through a budget allocation mechanism, ensuring maintenance plans are both optimal and cost-effective. Through a case study on a large-scale pavement network of 68,800 segments, the proposed DRL framework demonstrates significant improvements over traditional methods like Progressive Linear Programming and genetic algorithms, both in efficiency and network performance.

It has been demonstrated that distilling high-quality chain-of-thought (CoT) rationales from advanced general reasoning models offers a promising and efficient path to the financial reasoning model. However, existing CoT synthesis methods suffer from shallow CoT sampling, leaving the question of how to construct a well-designed knowledge space for finance reasoning unexplored. In this paper, we present Agentar-DeepFinance-100K, a large-scale financial reasoning dataset characterized by its systematic CoT synthesis optimization. We first introduce a comprehensive CoT synthesis pipeline featuring Multi-perspective Knowledge Extraction (MKE) and Self-Corrective Rewriting (SCR) to generate exhaustive and deep financial reasoning trajectories. Furthermore, a systematic investigation, termed CoT Cube, is conducted to analyze critical factors that influence CoT effectiveness, such as necessity, length and synthesizer, yielding valuable insights for high-quality financial CoT construction. Experiments demonstrate that models trained on our Agentar-DeepFinance-100K achieve significant improvements on financial benchmarks. We publicly release Agentar-DeepFinance-100K , hoping to advance the research in financial reasoning models.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Moral Gap of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18523v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Moral foundation detection is crucial for analyzing social discourse and developing ethically-aligned AI systems. While large language models excel across diverse tasks, their performance on specialized moral reasoning remains unclear. This study provides the first comprehensive comparison between state-of-the-art LLMs and fine-tuned transformers across Twitter and Reddit datasets using ROC, PR, and DET curve analysis. Results reveal substantial performance gaps, with LLMs exhibiting high false negative rates and systematic under-detection of moral content despite prompt engineering efforts. These findings demonstrate that task-specific fine-tuning remains superior to prompting for moral reasoning applications.</p></details> | preprint |
| **[Towards Large Scale Geostatistical Methane Monitoring with Part-based Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18513v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object detection is one of the main applications of computer vision in remote sensing imagery. Despite its increasing availability, the sheer volume of remote sensing data poses a challenge when detecting rare objects across large geographic areas. Paradoxically, this common challenge is crucial to many applications, such as estimating environmental impact of certain human activities at scale. In this paper, we propose to address the problem by investigating the methane production and emissions of bio-digesters in France. We first introduce a novel dataset containing bio-digesters, with small training and validation sets, and a large test set with a high imbalance towards observations without objects since such sites are rare. We develop a part-based method that considers essential bio-digester sub-elements to boost initial detections. To this end, we apply our method to new, unseen regions to build an inventory of bio-digesters. We then compute geostatistical estimates of the quantity of methane produced that can be attributed to these infrastructures in a given area at a given time.</p></details> |  |

Consumer-grade hardware is growing more powerful, with expanding memory and storage sizes and enhanced processor capabilities. Forensics investigators often have to sift through gigabytes of data during an ongoing investigation making the process tedious. Memory forensics, disk analysis all are well supported by state of the art tools that significantly lower the effort required to be put in by a forensic investigator by providing string searches, analyzing images file etc. During the course of the investigation a lot of false positives are identified that need to be lowered. This work presents Scout, a digital forensics framework that performs preliminary evidence processing and prioritizing using large language models. Scout deploys foundational language models to identify relevant artifacts from a large number of potential evidence files (disk images, captured network packets, memory dumps etc.) which would have taken longer to get identified. Scout employs text based large language models can easily process files with textual information. For the forensic analysis of multimedia files like audio, image, video, office documents etc. multimodal models are employed by Scout. Scout was able to identify and realize the evidence file that were of potential interest for the investigator.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Code Review Using Large Language Models with Symbolic Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18476v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code review is one of the key processes in the software development lifecycle and is essential to maintain code quality. However, manual code review is subjective and time consuming. Given its rule-based nature, code review is well suited for automation. In recent years, significant efforts have been made to automate this process with the help of artificial intelligence. Recent developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) have also emerged as a promising tool in this area, but these models often lack the logical reasoning capabilities needed to fully understand and evaluate code. To overcome this limitation, this study proposes a hybrid approach that integrates symbolic reasoning techniques with LLMs to automate the code review process. We tested our approach using the CodexGlue dataset, comparing several models, including CodeT5, CodeBERT, and GraphCodeBERT, to assess the effectiveness of combining symbolic reasoning and prompting techniques with LLMs. Our results show that this approach improves the accuracy and efficiency of automated code review.</p></details> |  |
| **[DIFFA: Large Language Diffusion Models Can Listen and Understand](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18452v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities across textual and multimodal domains. In parallel, diffusion-based language models have emerged as a promising alternative to the autoregressive paradigm, offering improved controllability, bidirectional context modeling, and robust generation. However, their application to the audio modality remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce \textbf{DIFFA}, the first diffusion-based Large Audio-Language Model designed to perform spoken language understanding. DIFFA integrates a frozen diffusion language model with a lightweight dual-adapter architecture that bridges speech understanding and natural language reasoning. We employ a two-stage training pipeline: first, aligning semantic representations via an ASR objective; then, learning instruction-following abilities through synthetic audio-caption pairs automatically generated by prompting LLMs. Despite being trained on only 960 hours of ASR and 127 hours of synthetic instruction data, DIFFA demonstrates competitive performance on major benchmarks, including MMSU, MMAU, and VoiceBench, outperforming several autoregressive open-source baselines. Our results reveal the potential of diffusion-based language models for efficient and scalable audio understanding, opening a new direction for speech-driven AI. Our code will be available at https://github.com/NKU-HLT/DIFFA.git.</p></details> |  |

Safety and driver assistance systems can be tailored to individual drivers' behavior, significantly enhancing their effectiveness. However, existing datasets are limited in describing and explaining general vehicle movements based on external visual evidence. This paper introduces a benchmark, PDB-Eval, for a detailed understanding of Personalized Driver Behavior, and aligning Large Multimodal Models (MLLMs) with driving comprehension and reasoning. Our benchmark consists of two main components, PDB-X and PDB-QA. PDB-X can evaluate MLLMs' understanding of temporal driving scenes. Our dataset is designed to find valid visual evidence from the external view to explain the driver's behavior from the internal view. To align MLLMs' reasoning abilities with driving tasks, we propose PDB-QA as a visual explanation question-answering task for MLLM instruction fine-tuning. As a generic learning task for generative models like MLLMs, PDB-QA can bridge the domain gap without harming MLLMs' generalizability. Our evaluation indicates that fine-tuning MLLMs on fine-grained descriptions and explanations can effectively bridge the gap between MLLMs and the driving domain, which improves zero-shot performance on question-answering tasks by up to 73.2%. We further evaluate the MLLMs fine-tuned on PDB-X in Brain4Cars' intention prediction and AIDE's recognition tasks. We observe up to 12.5% performance improvements on the turn intention prediction task in Brain4Cars, and consistent performance improvements up to 11.0% on all tasks in AIDE.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-D12: A Dual-Dimensional Scale of Instrumental and Relational Dependencies on Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06874v3)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There is growing interest in understanding how people interact with large language models (LLMs) and whether such models elicit dependency or even addictive behaviour. Validated tools to assess the extent to which individuals may become dependent on LLMs are scarce and primarily build on classic behavioral addiction symptoms, adapted to the context of LLM use. We view this as a conceptual limitation, as the LLM-human relationship is more nuanced and warrants a fresh and distinct perspective. To address this gap, we developed and validated a new 12-item questionnaire to measure LLM dependency, referred to as LLM-D12. The scale was based on the authors' prior theoretical work, with items developed accordingly and responses collected from 526 participants in the UK. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, performed on separate halves of the total sample using a split-sample approach, supported a two-factor structure: Instrumental Dependency (six items) and Relationship Dependency (six items). Instrumental Dependency reflects the extent to which individuals rely on LLMs to support or collaborate in decision-making and cognitive tasks. Relationship Dependency captures the tendency to perceive LLMs as socially meaningful, sentient, or companion-like entities. The two-factor structure demonstrated excellent internal consistency and clear discriminant validity. External validation confirmed both the conceptual foundation and the distinction between the two subscales. The psychometric properties and structure of our LLM-D12 scale were interpreted in light of the emerging view that dependency on LLMs does not necessarily indicate dysfunction but may still reflect reliance levels that could become problematic in certain contexts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Personalization Toolkit: Training Free Personalization of Large Vision Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02452v3)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Personalization of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) involves customizing models to recognize specific users and object instances, and to generate contextually tailored responses. Existing approaches typically rely on time-consuming test-time training for each user or object, making them impractical for real-world deployment, a limitation reflected in current personalization benchmarks, which are focused on object-centric, single-concept evaluations. In this paper, we present a novel training-free approach to LVLM personalization and introduce a comprehensive real-world benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate various aspects of the personalization task. Our method leverages pre-trained vision foundation models to extract distinctive features, applies retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques to identify instances within visual inputs, and employs visual prompting strategies to guide model outputs. Our model-agnostic vision toolkit enables efficient and flexible multi-concept personalization across both images and videos, without any additional training. We achieve state-of-the-art results, surpassing existing training-based methods.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce ExpliCa, a new dataset for evaluating LLMs in explicit causal reasoning. ExpliCa uniquely integrates both causal and temporal relations presented in different linguistic orders and explicitly expressed by linguistic connectives. The dataset is enriched with crowdsourced human acceptability ratings. We tested LLMs on ExpliCa through prompting and perplexity-based metrics. We assessed seven commercial and open-source LLMs, revealing that even top models struggle to reach 0.80 accuracy. Interestingly, models tend to confound temporal relations with causal ones, and their performance is also strongly influenced by the linguistic order of the events. Finally, perplexity-based scores and prompting performance are differently affected by model size.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in Findings of ACL 2025</p></details> |
| **[Mechanistic Indicators of Understanding in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08017v3)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent findings in mechanistic interpretability (MI), the field probing the inner workings of Large Language Models (LLMs), challenge the view that these models rely solely on superficial statistics. We offer an accessible synthesis of these findings that doubles as an introduction to MI while integrating these findings within a novel theoretical framework for thinking about machine understanding. We argue that LLMs develop internal structures that are functionally analogous to the kind of understanding that consists in seeing connections. To sharpen this idea, we propose a three-tiered conception of understanding. First, conceptual understanding emerges when a model forms "features" as directions in latent space, learning the connections between diverse manifestations of something. Second, state-of-the-world understanding emerges when a model learns contingent factual connections between features and dynamically tracks changes in the world. Third, principled understanding emerges when a model ceases to rely on a collection of memorized facts and discovers a "circuit" connecting these facts. However, these forms of understanding remain radically different from human understanding, as the phenomenon of "parallel mechanisms" shows. We conclude that the debate should move beyond the yes-or-no question of whether LLMs understand to investigate how their strange minds work and forge conceptions that fit them.</p></details> | 32 pages |

Towards File Localisation from Issues at Large](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18319v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bug localisation, the study of developing methods to localise the files requiring changes to resolve bugs, has been researched for a long time to develop methods capable of saving developers' time. Recently, researchers are starting to consider issues outside of bugs. Nevertheless, most existing research into file localisation from issues focusses on bugs or uses other selection methods to ensure only certain types of issues are considered as part of the focus of the work. Our goal is to work on all issues at large, without any specific selection. In this work, we provide a data pipeline for the creation of issue file localisation datasets, capable of dealing with arbitrary branching and merging practices. We provide a baseline performance evaluation for the file localisation problem using traditional information retrieval approaches. Finally, we use statistical analysis to investigate the influence of biases known in the bug localisation community on our dataset. Our results show that methods designed using bug-specific heuristics perform poorly on general issue types, indicating a need for research into general purpose models. Furthermore, we find that there are small, but statistically significant differences in performance between different issue types. Finally, we find that the presence of identifiers have a small effect on performance for most issue types. Many results are project-dependent, encouraging the development of methods which can be tuned to project-specific characteristics.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Improving Large Vision-Language Models' Understanding for Field Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18311v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown impressive capabilities across a range of tasks that integrate visual and textual understanding, such as image captioning and visual question answering. These models are trained on large-scale image and video datasets paired with text, enabling them to bridge visual perception and natural language processing. However, their application to scientific domains, especially in interpreting complex field data commonly used in the natural sciences, remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce FieldLVLM, a novel framework designed to improve large vision-language models' understanding of field data. FieldLVLM consists of two main components: a field-aware language generation strategy and a data-compressed multimodal model tuning. The field-aware language generation strategy leverages a special-purpose machine learning pipeline to extract key physical features from field data, such as flow classification, Reynolds number, and vortex patterns. This information is then converted into structured textual descriptions that serve as a dataset. The data-compressed multimodal model tuning focuses on LVLMs with these generated datasets, using a data compression strategy to reduce the complexity of field inputs and retain only the most informative values. This ensures compatibility with the models language decoder and guides its learning more effectively. Experimental results on newly proposed benchmark datasets demonstrate that FieldLVLM significantly outperforms existing methods in tasks involving scientific field data. Our findings suggest that this approach opens up new possibilities for applying large vision-language models to scientific research, helping bridge the gap between large models and domain-specific discovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[BadReasoner: Planting Tunable Overthinking Backdoors into Large Reasoning Models for Fun or Profit](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18305v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large reasoning models (LRMs) have emerged as a significant advancement in artificial intelligence, representing a specialized class of large language models (LLMs) designed to tackle complex reasoning tasks. The defining characteristic of LRMs lies in their extensive chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we identify a previously unexplored attack vector against LRMs, which we term "overthinking backdoors". We advance this concept by proposing a novel tunable backdoor, which moves beyond simple on/off attacks to one where an attacker can precisely control the extent of the model's reasoning verbosity. Our attack is implemented through a novel data poisoning methodology. It pairs a tunable trigger-where the number of repetitions signals the desired intensity-with a correspondingly verbose CoT response. These responses are programmatically generated by instructing a teacher LLM to inject a controlled number of redundant refinement steps into a correct reasoning process. The approach preserves output correctness, which ensures stealth and establishes the attack as a pure resource-consumption vector. Extensive empirical results on various LRMs demonstrate that our method can reliably trigger a controllable, multi-fold increase in the length of the reasoning process, without degrading the final answer's correctness. Our source code is available at https://github.com/FZaKK/BadReasoner.</p></details> |  |

While LMMs have demonstrated promising results in tackling multimodal tasks like image captioning, visual question answering, and visual grounding, the object detection capabilities of LMMs exhibit a significant gap compared to specialist detectors. To bridge the gap, we depart from the conventional methods of integrating heavy detectors with LMMs and propose LMM-Det, a simple yet effective approach that leverages a Large Multimodal Model for vanilla object Detection without relying on specialized detection modules. Specifically, we conduct a comprehensive exploratory analysis when a large multimodal model meets with object detection, revealing that the recall rate degrades significantly compared with specialist detection models. To mitigate this, we propose to increase the recall rate by introducing data distribution adjustment and inference optimization tailored for object detection. We re-organize the instruction conversations to enhance the object detection capabilities of large multimodal models. We claim that a large multimodal model possesses detection capability without any extra detection modules. Extensive experiments support our claim and show the effectiveness of the versatile LMM-Det. The datasets, models, and codes are available at https://github.com/360CVGroup/LMM-Det.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV 2025</p></details> |

This conventional process is labor-intensive, inaccessible to non-experts, and inflexible to changes in mission requirements. Here, we propose LAN2CB (Language to Collective Behavior), a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to streamline and generalize the multi-robot coordination pipeline. LAN2CB transforms natural language (NL) mission descriptions into executable Python code for multi-robot systems through two core modules: (1) Mission Analysis, which parses mission descriptions into behavior trees, and (2) Code Generation, which leverages the behavior tree and a structured knowledge base to generate robot control code. We further introduce a dataset of natural language mission descriptions to support development and benchmarking. Experiments in both simulation and real-world environments demonstrate that LAN2CB enables robust and flexible multi-robot coordination from natural language, significantly reducing manual engineering effort and supporting broad generalization across diverse mission types.

This study introduces SCOPE, an evaluation framework designed to measure and mitigate such selection bias in a dataset-independent manner. By repeatedly invoking a null prompt that lacks semantic content, SCOPE estimates each model's unique position-bias distribution. It then redistributes the answer slot according to the inverse-bias distribution, thereby equalizing the lucky-rate, the probability of selecting the correct answer by chance. Furthermore, it prevents semantically similar distractors from being placed adjacent to the answer, thereby blocking near-miss guesses based on superficial proximity cues. Across multiple benchmark experiments, SCOPE consistently outperformed existing debiasing methods in terms of stable performance improvements and showed clearer confidence distributions over correct options. This framework thus offers a new standard for enhancing the fairness and reliability of LLM evaluations.</p></details> | 34 pages, 1 figure |

Current Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) typically employ limited pre-defined grids to process images, leading to information loss when handling gigapixel RSIs. Conversely, using unlimited grids significantly increases computational costs. To preserve image details while reducing computational complexity, we propose a text-guided token pruning method with Dynamic Image Pyramid (DIP) integration. Our method introduces: (i) a Region Focus Module (RFM) that leverages text-aware region localization capability to identify critical vision tokens, and (ii) a coarse-to-fine image tile selection and vision token pruning strategy based on DIP, which is guided by RFM outputs and avoids directly processing the entire large imagery. Additionally, existing benchmarks for evaluating LVLMs' perception ability on large RSI suffer from limited question diversity and constrained image sizes. We construct a new benchmark named LRS-VQA, which contains 7,333 QA pairs across 8 categories, with image length up to 27,328 pixels. Our method outperforms existing high-resolution strategies on four datasets using the same data. Moreover, compared to existing token reduction methods, our approach demonstrates higher efficiency under high-resolution settings.

The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has profoundly transformed AM, enabling advanced in-context learning, prompt-based generation, and robust cross-domain adaptability. This survey systematically synthesizes recent advancements in LLM-driven AM. We provide a concise review of foundational theories and annotation frameworks, alongside a meticulously curated catalog of datasets. A key contribution is our comprehensive taxonomy of AM subtasks, elucidating how contemporary LLM techniques -- such as prompting, chain-of-thought reasoning, and retrieval augmentation -- have reconfigured their execution. We further detail current LLM architectures and methodologies, critically assess evaluation practices, and delineate pivotal challenges including long-context reasoning, interpretability, and annotation bottlenecks. Conclusively, we highlight emerging trends and propose a forward-looking research agenda for LLM-based computational argumentation, aiming to strategically guide researchers in this rapidly evolving domain.</p></details> | Work draft |
| **[Policy Disruption in Reinforcement Learning:Adversarial Attack with Large Language Models and Critical State Identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18113v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in fields like robotics and autonomous driving, but adversarial attacks designed to mislead RL systems remain challenging. Existing approaches often rely on modifying the environment or policy, limiting their practicality. This paper proposes an adversarial attack method in which existing agents in the environment guide the target policy to output suboptimal actions without altering the environment. We propose a reward iteration optimization framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate adversarial rewards explicitly tailored to the vulnerabilities of the target agent, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of inducing the target agent toward suboptimal decision-making. Additionally, a critical state identification algorithm is designed to pinpoint the target agent's most vulnerable states, where suboptimal behavior from the victim leads to significant degradation in overall performance. Experimental results in diverse environments demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding the Supply Chain and Risks of Large Language Model Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18105v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to the widespread deployment of LLM-based systems across diverse domains. As these systems proliferate, understanding the risks associated with their complex supply chains is increasingly important. LLM-based systems are not standalone as they rely on interconnected supply chains involving pretrained models, third-party libraries, datasets, and infrastructure. Yet, most risk assessments narrowly focus on model or data level, overlooking broader supply chain vulnerabilities. While recent studies have begun to address LLM supply chain risks, there remains a lack of benchmarks for systematic research. To address this gap, we introduce the first comprehensive dataset for analyzing and benchmarking LLM supply chain security. We collect 3,859 real-world LLM applications and perform interdependency analysis, identifying 109,211 models, 2,474 datasets, and 9,862 libraries. We extract model fine-tuning paths, dataset reuse, and library reliance, mapping the ecosystem's structure. To evaluate security, we gather 1,555 risk-related issues-50 for applications, 325 for models, 18 for datasets, and 1,229 for libraries from public vulnerability databases. Using this dataset, we empirically analyze component dependencies and risks. Our findings reveal deeply nested dependencies in LLM applications and significant vulnerabilities across the supply chain, underscoring the need for comprehensive security analysis. We conclude with practical recommendations to guide researchers and developers toward safer, more trustworthy LLM-enabled systems.</p></details> | 26 pages |

This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques, including LoRA, BOFT, LoRA-GA, and uRNN, and introduces a novel hybrid strategy that dynamically integrates BOFT's orthogonal stability with LoRA-GA's gradient-aligned rapid convergence. By computing per-layer adaptive updates guided by gradient norms, the hybrid method achieves superior convergence efficiency and generalization across diverse tasks. We also explore, for the first time, the adaptation of unitary RNN (uRNN) principles to transformer-based LLMs, enhancing gradient stability through structured unitary constraints. Empirical evaluations on four benchmarks -- GLUE, GSM8K, MT-Bench, and HumanEval -- using models ranging from 7B to 405B parameters demonstrate that our hybrid method consistently outperforms individual PEFT baselines, approaching full fine-tuning accuracy while reducing resource consumption by up to 2.1 times in training time and 50 percent in memory usage. These findings establish the hybrid approach as a practical and scalable fine-tuning solution for real-world deployment of LLMs under resource constraints.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 2 figures and 1 table</p></details> |

This limitation hinders their effectiveness in complex lighting conditions. In this paper, we propose VLM-IMI, a novel framework that leverages large vision-language models (VLMs) with iterative and manual instructions (IMIs) for LLIE. VLM-IMI incorporates textual descriptions of the desired normal-light content as enhancement cues, enabling semantically informed restoration. To effectively integrate cross-modal priors, we introduce an instruction prior fusion module, which dynamically aligns and fuses image and text features, promoting the generation of detailed and semantically coherent outputs. During inference, we adopt an iterative and manual instruction strategy to refine textual instructions, progressively improving visual quality. This refinement enhances structural fidelity, semantic alignment, and the recovery of fine details under extremely low-light conditions. Extensive experiments across diverse scenarios demonstrate that VLM-IMI outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative metrics and perceptual quality.

Despite the potential benefits, concerns regarding privacy leakage have surfaced, especially when personal information is utilized in the training datasets. In addition, there is an absence of a comprehensive evaluation framework capable of quantitatively measuring the quality of the generated synthetic data and their utility for downstream tasks. In response to this gap, we introduce SynEval, an open-source evaluation framework designed to assess the fidelity, utility, and privacy preservation of synthetically generated tabular data via a suite of diverse evaluation metrics. We validate the efficacy of our proposed framework - SynEval - by applying it to synthetic product review data generated by three state-of-the-art LLMs: ChatGPT, Claude, and Llama. Our experimental findings illuminate the trade-offs between various evaluation metrics in the context of synthetic data generation. Furthermore, SynEval stands as a critical instrument for researchers and practitioners engaged with synthetic tabular data,, empowering them to judiciously determine the suitability of the generated data for their specific applications, with an emphasis on upholding user privacy.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 1 figure, 4 tables</p></details> |

With the integration of vision modalities, additional attack vectors exacerbate the risk of RCAs in large vision-language models (LVLMs). However, existing red-teaming studies have largely overlooked visual inputs as a potential attack surface, resulting in insufficient mitigation strategies against RCAs in LVLMs. To address this gap, we propose RECALLED (\textbf{RE}source \textbf{C}onsumption \textbf{A}ttack on \textbf{L}arge Vision-\textbf{L}anguag\textbf{E} Mo\textbf{D}els), the first approach for exploiting visual modalities to trigger unbounded RCAs red-teaming. First, we present \textit{Vision Guided Optimization}, a fine-grained pixel-level optimization, to obtain \textit{Output Recall} adversarial perturbations, which can induce repeating output. Then, we inject the perturbations into visual inputs, triggering unbounded generations to achieve the goal of RCAs. Additionally, we introduce \textit{Multi-Objective Parallel Losses} to generate universal attack templates and resolve optimization conflicts when intending to implement parallel attacks. Empirical results demonstrate that RECALLED increases service response latency by over 26 $\uparrow$, resulting in an additional 20\% increase in GPU utilization and memory consumption. Our study exposes security vulnerabilities in LVLMs and establishes a red-teaming framework that can facilitate future defense development against RCAs.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, we present an optimized framework featuring four synergistic improvements: (1) Asynchronous listener threads are introduced to address event monitoring latency in large-scale scenarios, instead of synchronous polling mechanisms, (2) METIS-based load rebalancing strategy is incorporated to address the issue of dynamic event allocation during real-world simulation, (3) Entity interaction solver with constraint satisfaction mechanisms is designed to mitigate state conflicts, and (4) Spatial hashing algorithm to overcome O(n^2) complexity bottlenecks in large-scale nearest-neighbor searches. Experimental validation through a GridWorld demo demonstrates significant enhancements in temporal fidelity and computational efficiency. Benchmark results show our framework achieves 16x acceleration over baseline implementations and maintains 8x speedup over 1-thread configuration across MPI and Pthreads implementations.The combined load balancing and LP migration strategy reduces synchronization overhead by 58.18%, with load balancing accounting for 57% of the total improvement as the dominant optimization factor. These improvements provide an enhanced solution for PDES implementation in large-scale simulation scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Synthetic Data Generation for Phrase Break Prediction with Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18044v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current approaches to phrase break prediction address crucial prosodic aspects of text-to-speech systems but heavily rely on vast human annotations from audio or text, incurring significant manual effort and cost. Inherent variability in the speech domain, driven by phonetic factors, further complicates acquiring consistent, high-quality data. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown success in addressing data challenges in NLP by generating tailored synthetic data while reducing manual annotation needs. Motivated by this, we explore leveraging LLM to generate synthetic phrase break annotations, addressing the challenges of both manual annotation and speech-related tasks by comparing with traditional annotations and assessing effectiveness across multiple languages. Our findings suggest that LLM-based synthetic data generation effectively mitigates data challenges in phrase break prediction and highlights the potential of LLMs as a viable solution for the speech domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Interspeech 2025</p></details> |

However, despite recent progress, bridging the gap between language descriptions and actual robot actions in the open-world, beyond merely invoking limited predefined motion primitives, remains an open challenge. In this work, we aim to enable robots to interpret and decompose complex language instructions, ultimately synthesizing a sequence of trajectory points to complete diverse navigation tasks given open-set instructions and open-set objects. We observe that multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit strong cross-modal understanding when processing free-form language instructions, demonstrating robust scene comprehension. More importantly, leveraging their code-generation capability, MLLMs can interact with vision-language perception models to generate compositional 2D bird-eye-view value maps, effectively integrating semantic knowledge from MLLMs with spatial information from maps to reinforce the robot's spatial understanding. To further validate our approach, we effectively leverage large-scale autonomous vehicle datasets (AVDs) to validate our proposed zero-shot vision-language navigation framework in outdoor navigation tasks, demonstrating its capability to execute a diverse range of free-form natural language navigation instructions while maintaining robustness against object detection errors and linguistic ambiguities. Furthermore, we validate our system on a Husky robot in both indoor and outdoor scenes, demonstrating its real-world robustness and applicability.

Addressing this challenge requires datasets that are not only large-scale but also rich in forgery diversity. However, most existing datasets, despite their scale, include only a limited variety of forgery types, making them insufficient for developing generalizable detection methods. Therefore, we build upon our earlier Celeb-DF dataset and introduce {Celeb-DF++}, a new large-scale and challenging video DeepFake benchmark dedicated to the generalizable forensics challenge. Celeb-DF++ covers three commonly encountered forgery scenarios: Face-swap (FS), Face-reenactment (FR), and Talking-face (TF). Each scenario contains a substantial number of high-quality forged videos, generated using a total of 22 various recent DeepFake methods. These methods differ in terms of architectures, generation pipelines, and targeted facial regions, covering the most prevalent DeepFake cases witnessed in the wild. We also introduce evaluation protocols for measuring the generalizability of 24 recent detection methods, highlighting the limitations of existing detection methods and the difficulty of our new dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/OUC-VAS/Celeb-DF-PP</p></details> |
| **[Predictive Scaling Laws for Efficient GRPO Training of Large Reasoning Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18014v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for reasoning tasks using reinforcement learning methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is computationally expensive. To address this, we propose a predictive framework that models training dynamics and helps optimize resource usage. Through experiments on Llama and Qwen models (3B 8B), we derive an empirical scaling law based on model size, initial performance, and training progress. This law predicts reward trajectories and identifies three consistent training phases: slow start, rapid improvement, and plateau. We find that training beyond certain number of an epoch offers little gain, suggesting earlier stopping can significantly reduce compute without sacrificing performance. Our approach generalizes across model types, providing a practical guide for efficient GRPO-based fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |
| **[C-Koordinator: Interference-aware Management for Large-scale and Co-located Microservice Clusters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18005v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Microservices transform traditional monolithic applications into lightweight, loosely coupled application components and have been widely adopted in many enterprises. Cloud platform infrastructure providers enhance the resource utilization efficiency of microservices systems by co-locating different microservices. However, this approach also introduces resource competition and interference among microservices. Designing interference-aware strategies for large-scale, co-located microservice clusters is crucial for enhancing resource utilization and mitigating competition-induced interference. These challenges are further exacerbated by unreliable metrics, application diversity, and node heterogeneity. In this paper, we first analyze the characteristics of large-scale and co-located microservices clusters at Alibaba and further discuss why cycle per instruction (CPI) is adopted as a metric for interference measurement in large-scale production clusters, as well as how to achieve accurate prediction of CPI through multi-dimensional metrics. Based on CPI interference prediction and analysis, we also present the design of the C-Koordinator platform, an open-source solution utilized in Alibaba cluster, which incorporates co-location and interference mitigation strategies. The interference prediction models consistently achieve over 90.3% accuracy, enabling precise prediction and rapid mitigation of interference in operational environments. As a result, application latency is reduced and stabilized across all percentiles (P50, P90, P99) response time (RT), achieving improvements ranging from 16.7% to 36.1% under various system loads compared with state-of-the-art system. These results demonstrate the system's ability to maintain smooth application performance in co-located environments.</p></details> | 15 pages |

This stems from the fact that existing MLLMs are trained on images with limited diverse camera-object relations and corresponding textual descriptions. To address this, we propose a synthetic generation pipeline to create large-scale 3D visual instruction datasets. Our framework takes 3D assets as input and uses rendering and diffusion-based image generation models to create photorealistic images preserving precise camera-object relations. Additionally, large language models (LLMs) are used to generate text prompts for guiding visual instruction tuning and controlling image generation. We create Ultimate3D, a dataset of 240K VQAs with precise camera-object annotations, and corresponding benchmark. MLLMs fine-tuned on our proposed dataset outperform commercial models by a large margin, achieving an average accuracy improvement of 33.4% on camera-object relation recognition tasks. Our code, dataset, and benchmark will contribute to broad MLLM applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[LIFBench: Evaluating the Instruction Following Performance and Stability of Large Language Models in Long-Context Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07037v3)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) evolve in natural language processing (NLP), their ability to stably follow instructions in long-context inputs has become critical for real-world applications. However, existing benchmarks seldom focus on instruction-following in long-context scenarios or stability on different inputs. To bridge this gap, we introduce LIFBench, a scalable dataset designed to evaluate LLMs' instruction-following capabilities and stability across long contexts. LIFBench comprises three long-context scenarios and eleven diverse tasks, featuring 2,766 instructions generated through an automated expansion method across three dimensions: length, expression, and variables. For evaluation, we propose LIFEval, a rubric-based assessment method that enables precise, automated scoring of complex LLM responses without reliance on LLM-assisted assessments or human judgment. This method allows for a comprehensive analysis of model performance and stability from multiple perspectives. We conduct detailed experiments on 20 prominent LLMs across six length intervals. Our work contributes LIFBench and LIFEval as robust tools for assessing LLM performance in complex and long-context settings, offering valuable insights to guide future advancements in LLM development.</p></details> | 17 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Discriminative Finetuning of Generative Large Language Models without Reward Models and Human Preference Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18679v3)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) has become a crucial step for aligning pretrained large language models (LLMs) using supervised datasets of input-output pairs. However, despite being supervised, SFT is inherently limited by its generative training objective. To address its limitations, the existing common strategy is to follow SFT with a separate phase of preference optimization (PO), which relies on either human-labeled preference data or a strong reward model to guide the learning process. In this paper, we address the limitations of SFT by exploring one of the most successful techniques in conventional supervised learning: discriminative learning. We introduce Discriminative Fine-Tuning (DFT), an improved variant of SFT, which mitigates the burden of collecting human-labeled preference data or training strong reward models. Unlike SFT that employs a generative approach and overlooks negative data, DFT adopts a discriminative paradigm that increases the probability of positive answers while suppressing potentially negative ones, aiming for data prediction instead of token prediction. Our contributions include: (i) a discriminative probabilistic framework for fine-tuning LLMs by explicitly modeling the discriminative likelihood of an answer among all possible outputs given an input; (ii) efficient algorithms to optimize this discriminative likelihood; and (iii) extensive experiments demonstrating DFT's effectiveness, achieving performance better than SFT and comparable to if not better than SFT$\rightarrow$PO.

| **[Weak-to-Strong Jailbreaking on Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17256v5)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks - resulting in harmful, unethical, or biased text generations. However, existing jailbreaking methods are computationally costly. In this paper, we propose the weak-to-strong jailbreaking attack, an efficient inference time attack for aligned LLMs to produce harmful text. Our key intuition is based on the observation that jailbroken and aligned models only differ in their initial decoding distributions. The weak-to-strong attack's key technical insight is using two smaller models (a safe and an unsafe one) to adversarially modify a significantly larger safe model's decoding probabilities. We evaluate the weak-to-strong attack on 5 diverse open-source LLMs from 3 organizations. The results show our method can increase the misalignment rate to over 99% on two datasets with just one forward pass per example. Our study exposes an urgent safety issue that needs to be addressed when aligning LLMs. As an initial attempt, we propose a defense strategy to protect against such attacks, but creating more advanced defenses remains challenging. The code for replicating the method is available at https://github.com/XuandongZhao/weak-to-strong</p></details> | ICML 2025 |

Many studies have focused on analyzing the impact of resource allocation for complex deployments using mathematical models, queue theories, or even Artificial Intelligence (AI). This paper elucidates the effects of chaotic workloads, generated by Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) on different Network Functions (NFs) on User Equipment registration performance. Our findings highlight the necessity of diverse resource profiles to ensure Service-Level Agreement (SLA) compliance in large-scale 5G core deployments. Additionally, our analysis of packet capture approaches demonstrates the potential of kernel-based monitoring for scalable security threat defense. Finally, our empirical evaluation provides insights into the effective deployment of 5G NFs in complex scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, achieving them jointly remains a challenge. In this paper, we position high learning rates as a facilitator for simultaneously achieving robustness to spurious correlations and network compressibility. We demonstrate that large learning rates also produce desirable representation properties such as invariant feature utilization, class separation, and activation sparsity. Importantly, our findings indicate that large learning rates compare favorably to other hyperparameters and regularization methods, in consistently satisfying these properties in tandem. In addition to demonstrating the positive effect of large learning rates across diverse spurious correlation datasets, models, and optimizers, we also present strong evidence that the previously documented success of large learning rates in standard classification tasks is likely due to its effect on addressing hidden/rare spurious correlations in the training dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV 2025, 23 pages</p></details> |

To address this gap, we present DataWink, a system that enables users to create custom visualizations by adapting high-quality examples. Our approach combines large multimodal models (LMMs) to extract data encoding from existing SVG-based visualization examples, featuring an intermediate representation of visualizations that bridges primitive SVG and visualization programs. Users may express adaptation goals to a conversational agent and control the visual appearance through widgets generated on demand. With an interactive interface, users can modify both data mappings and visual design elements while maintaining the original visualization's aesthetic quality. To evaluate DataWink, we conduct a user study (N=12) with replication and free-form exploration tasks. As a result, DataWink is recognized for its learnability and effectiveness in personalized authoring tasks.

| **[Balans: Multi-Armed Bandits-based Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search for Mixed-Integer Programming Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14382v3)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mixed-integer programming (MIP) is a powerful paradigm for modeling and solving various important combinatorial optimization problems. Recently, learning-based approaches have shown a potential to speed up MIP solving via offline training that then guides important design decisions during the search. However, a significant drawback of these methods is their heavy reliance on offline training, which requires collecting training datasets and computationally costly training epochs yet offering only limited generalization to unseen (larger) instances. In this paper, we propose Balans, an adaptive meta-solver for MIPs with online learning capability that does not require any supervision or apriori training. At its core, Balans is based on adaptive large-neighborhood search, operating on top of an MIP solver by successive applications of destroy and repair neighborhood operators. During the search, the selection among different neighborhood definitions is guided on the fly for the instance at hand via multi-armed bandit algorithms. Our extensive experiments on hard optimization instances show that Balans offers significant performance gains over the default MIP solver, is better than committing to any single best neighborhood, and improves over the state-of-the-art large-neighborhood search for MIPs. Finally, we release Balans as a highly configurable, MIP solver agnostic, open-source software.</p></details> |  |

To enable alternative, simulation-based exploration of different stakeholder perspectives, we develop the HoPeS (Human-Oriented Perspective Shifting) modelling framework. HoPeS employs agents powered by large language models (LLMs) to represent various stakeholders; users can step into the agent roles to experience perspectival differences. A simulation protocol serves as a "scaffold" to streamline multiple perspective-taking simulations, supporting users in reflecting on, transitioning between, and integrating across perspectives. A prototype system is developed to demonstrate HoPeS in the context of institutional dynamics and land use change, enabling both narrative-driven and numerical experiments. In an illustrative experiment, a user successively adopts the perspectives of a system observer and a researcher - a role that analyses data from the embedded land use model to inform evidence-based decision-making for other LLM agents representing various institutions. Despite the user's effort to recommend technically sound policies, discrepancies persist between the policy recommendation and implementation due to stakeholders' competing advocacies, mirroring real-world misalignment between researcher and policymaker perspectives. The user's reflection highlights the subjective feelings of frustration and disappointment as a researcher, especially due to the challenge of maintaining political neutrality while attempting to gain political influence. Despite this, the user exhibits high motivation to experiment with alternative narrative framing strategies, suggesting the system's potential in exploring different perspectives. Further system and protocol refinement are likely to enable new forms of interdisciplinary collaboration in socio-ecological simulations.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Hybrid Early-Exit Algorithm for Large Language Models Based on Space Alignment Decoding (SPADE)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17618v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models are computationally expensive due to their deep structures. Prior research has shown that intermediate layers contain sufficient information to generate accurate answers, leading to the development of early-exit algorithms that reduce inference costs by terminating computation at earlier layers. However, these methods often suffer from poor performance due to misalignment between intermediate and output layer representations that lead to decoding inaccuracy. To address these challenges, we propose SPADE (SPace Alignment DEcoding), a novel decoding method that aligns intermediate layer representations with the output layer by propagating a minimally reduced sequence consisting of only the start token and the answer token. We further optimize the early-exit decision-making process by training a linear approximation of SPADE that computes entropy-based confidence metrics. Putting them together, we create a hybrid early-exit algorithm that monitors confidence levels and stops inference at intermediate layers while using SPADE to generate high-quality outputs. This approach significantly reduces inference costs without compromising accuracy, offering a scalable and efficient solution for deploying large language models in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[RemixFusion: Residual-based Mixed Representation for Large-scale Online RGB-D Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17594v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The introduction of the neural implicit representation has notably propelled the advancement of online dense reconstruction techniques. Compared to traditional explicit representations, such as TSDF, it improves the mapping completeness and memory efficiency. However, the lack of reconstruction details and the time-consuming learning of neural representations hinder the widespread application of neural-based methods to large-scale online reconstruction. We introduce RemixFusion, a novel residual-based mixed representation for scene reconstruction and camera pose estimation dedicated to high-quality and large-scale online RGB-D reconstruction. In particular, we propose a residual-based map representation comprised of an explicit coarse TSDF grid and an implicit neural module that produces residuals representing fine-grained details to be added to the coarse grid. Such mixed representation allows for detail-rich reconstruction with bounded time and memory budget, contrasting with the overly-smoothed results by the purely implicit representations, thus paving the way for high-quality camera tracking. Furthermore, we extend the residual-based representation to handle multi-frame joint pose optimization via bundle adjustment (BA). In contrast to the existing methods, which optimize poses directly, we opt to optimize pose changes. Combined with a novel technique for adaptive gradient amplification, our method attains better optimization convergence and global optimality. Furthermore, we adopt a local moving volume to factorize the mixed scene representation with a divide-and-conquer design to facilitate efficient online learning in our residual-based framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses all state-of-the-art ones, including those based either on explicit or implicit representations, in terms of the accuracy of both mapping and tracking on large-scale scenes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fairness Evaluation of Large Language Models in Academic Library Reference Services](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04224v2)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As libraries explore large language models (LLMs) for use in virtual reference services, a key question arises: Can LLMs serve all users equitably, regardless of demographics or social status? While they offer great potential for scalable support, LLMs may also reproduce societal biases embedded in their training data, risking the integrity of libraries' commitment to equitable service. To address this concern, we evaluate whether LLMs differentiate responses across user identities by prompting six state-of-the-art LLMs to assist patrons differing in sex, race/ethnicity, and institutional role. We found no evidence of differentiation by race or ethnicity, and only minor evidence of stereotypical bias against women in one model. LLMs demonstrated nuanced accommodation of institutional roles through the use of linguistic choices related to formality, politeness, and domain-specific vocabularies, reflecting professional norms rather than discriminatory treatment. These findings suggest that current LLMs show a promising degree of readiness to support equitable and contextually appropriate communication in academic library reference services.</p></details> |  |

Existing alignment benchmarks primarily focus on sentence embeddings, but prior research has shown that neural models tend to induce a non-smooth representation space, which impact of semantic alignment evaluation on low-resource languages. Inspired by neuroscientific findings that similar information activates overlapping neuronal regions, we propose a novel Neuron State-Based Cross-Lingual Alignment (NeuronXA) to assess the cross-lingual a lignment capabilities of LLMs, which offers a more semantically grounded approach to assess cross-lingual alignment. We evaluate NeuronXA on several prominent multilingual LLMs (LLaMA, Qwen, Mistral, GLM, and OLMo) across two transfer tasks and three multilingual benchmarks. The results demonstrate that with only 100 parallel sentence pairs, NeuronXA achieves a Pearson correlation of 0.9556 with downstream tasks performance and 0.8514 with transferability. These findings demonstrate NeuronXA's effectiveness in assessing both cross-lingual alignment and transferability, even with a small dataset. This highlights its potential to advance cross-lingual alignment research and to improve the semantic understanding of multilingual LLMs.</p></details> | ACL main 2025 |

However, existing recommender systems primarily focus on users' interaction behaviors with videos, neglecting comment content and interaction in user preference modeling. In this paper, we propose a novel recommendation approach called LSVCR that utilizes user interaction histories with both videos and comments to jointly perform personalized video and comment recommendation. Specifically, our approach comprises two key components: sequential recommendation (SR) model and supplemental large language model (LLM) recommender. The SR model functions as the primary recommendation backbone (retained in deployment) of our method for efficient user preference modeling. Concurrently, we employ a LLM as the supplemental recommender (discarded in deployment) to better capture underlying user preferences derived from heterogeneous interaction behaviors. In order to integrate the strengths of the SR model and the supplemental LLM recommender, we introduce a two-stage training paradigm. The first stage, personalized preference alignment, aims to align the preference representations from both components, thereby enhancing the semantics of the SR model. The second stage, recommendation-oriented fine-tuning, involves fine-tuning the alignment-enhanced SR model according to specific objectives. Extensive experiments in both video and comment recommendation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of LSVCR. Moreover, online A/B testing on KuaiShou platform verifies the practical benefits of our approach. In particular, we attain a cumulative gain of 4.13% in comment watch time.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by RecSys2025</p></details> |

This separation creates a complex, resource-intensive pipeline and suffers from a performance ceiling due to a static reward signal. We propose a novel framework, Unified Reward & Policy Optimization (URPO), that unifies instruction-following ("player") and reward modeling ("referee") within a single model and a single training phase. Our method recasts all alignment data-including preference pairs, verifiable reasoning, and open-ended instructions-into a unified generative format optimized by a single Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) loop. This enables the model to learn from ground-truth preferences and verifiable logic while simultaneously generating its own rewards for open-ended tasks. Experiments on the Qwen2.5-7B model demonstrate URPO's superiority. Our unified model significantly outperforms a strong baseline using a separate generative reward model, boosting the instruction-following score on AlpacaEval from 42.24 to 44.84 and the composite reasoning average from 32.66 to 35.66. Furthermore, URPO cultivates a superior internal evaluator as a byproduct of training, achieving a RewardBench score of 85.15 and surpassing the dedicated reward model it replaces (83.55). By eliminating the need for a separate reward model and fostering a co-evolutionary dynamic between generation and evaluation, URPO presents a simpler, more efficient, and more effective path towards robustly aligned language models.</p></details> |  |

To address this gap, we curate the largest Tibetan pre-training corpus to date, aggregating data from diverse sources and applying a dedicated data cleaning and processing pipeline tailored for Tibetan. With the curated data, we continue pre/post-training a multilingual base model to enhance its generative capabilities in Tibetan. To evaluate the Tibetan capabilities of the model, we create new high-quality Tibetan benchmarks, and complement them with existing public benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our model consistently and significantly outperforms both open-source models of similar scale and Tibetan-tailored models across a wide range of tasks.</p></details> |  |

Further, we show that this surprisingly close match between optimization theory and practice can be exploited for learning-rate tuning: we achieve noticeable improvements for training 124M and 210M Llama-type models by (i) extending the schedule for continued training with optimal learning-rate, and (ii) transferring the optimal learning-rate across schedules.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose an Uncertainty-Driven Adaptive Self-Alignment (UDASA) framework designed to improve LLM alignment in a fully automated manner. UDASA first generates multiple responses for each input and quantifies output uncertainty across three dimensions: semantics, factuality, and value alignment. Based on these uncertainty scores, the framework constructs preference pairs and categorizes training samples into three stages, conservative, moderate, and exploratory, according to their uncertainty difference. The model is then optimized progressively across these stages. In addition, we conduct a series of preliminary studies to validate the core design assumptions and provide strong empirical motivation for the proposed framework. Experimental results show that UDASA outperforms existing alignment methods across multiple tasks, including harmlessness, helpfulness, truthfulness, and controlled sentiment generation, significantly improving model performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Demonstration of Efficient Predictive Surrogates for Large-scale Quantum Processors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17470v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ongoing development of quantum processors is driving breakthroughs in scientific discovery. Despite this progress, the formidable cost of fabricating large-scale quantum processors means they will remain rare for the foreseeable future, limiting their widespread application. To address this bottleneck, we introduce the concept of predictive surrogates, which are classical learning models designed to emulate the mean-value behavior of a given quantum processor with provably computational efficiency. In particular, we propose two predictive surrogates that can substantially reduce the need for quantum processor access in diverse practical scenarios. To demonstrate their potential in advancing digital quantum simulation, we use these surrogates to emulate a quantum processor with up to 20 programmable superconducting qubits, enabling efficient pre-training of variational quantum eigensolvers for families of transverse-field Ising models and identification of non-equilibrium Floquet symmetry-protected topological phases. Experimental results reveal that the predictive surrogates not only reduce measurement overhead by orders of magnitude, but can also surpass the performance of conventional, quantum-resource-intensive approaches. Collectively, these findings establish predictive surrogates as a practical pathway to broadening the impact of advanced quantum processors.</p></details> | <details><summary>53 pa...</summary><p>53 pages, 15 figures, comments are welcome</p></details> |

However, their proficiency within the chemistry domain remains restricted, especially in solving molecule-related tasks. This challenge is attributed to their inherent limitations in comprehending molecules using only common textual representations, i.e. SMILES strings. In this study, we seek to enhance the ability of LLMs to comprehend molecules by equipping them with a multi-modal external module, termed MolX. Instead of directly using SMILES strings to represent a molecule, we utilize specific encoders to extract fine-grained features from both SMILES string and 2D molecular graph representations for feeding into an LLM. A hand-crafted molecular fingerprint is incorporated to leverage its embedded domain knowledge. To establish an alignment between MolX and the LLM's textual input space, the model in which the LLM is frozen, is pre-trained with a strategy including a diverse set of tasks. Experimental evaluations show that our proposed method outperforms baselines across 4 downstream molecule-related tasks ranging from molecule-to-text translation to retrosynthesis, with and without fine-tuning the LLM, while only introducing a small number of trainable parameters--0.53\% and 0.82\%, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>MLoG-...</summary><p>MLoG-GenAI@KDD '25 (Oral)</p></details> |

Nevertheless, existing methods frequently face limitations in both applicability and explainability. Traditional graph-based and sequence-to-sequence models often lack generalized chemical knowledge, leading to predictions that are neither consistently accurate nor easily explainable. To address these challenges, we introduce RetroDFM-R, a reasoning-based large language model (LLM) designed specifically for chemical retrosynthesis. Leveraging large-scale reinforcement learning guided by chemically verifiable rewards, RetroDFM-R significantly enhances prediction accuracy and explainability. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that RetroDFM-R significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a top-1 accuracy of 65.0% on the USPTO-50K benchmark. Double-blind human assessments further validate the chemical plausibility and practical utility of RetroDFM-R's predictions. RetroDFM-R also accurately predicts multistep retrosynthetic routes reported in the literature for both real-world drug molecules and perovskite materials. Crucially, the model's explicit reasoning process provides human-interpretable insights, thereby enhancing trust and practical value in real-world retrosynthesis applications.</p></details> | Preprint |

Based on our experiments, we found that the effectiveness of jailbreak strategies is influenced by the comprehension ability of the attacked LLM. Building on this insight, we propose a capability-aware Multi-Encryption Framework (MEF) for evaluating vulnerabilities in black-box LLMs. Specifically, MEF first categorizes the comprehension ability level of the LLM, then applies different strategies accordingly: For models with limited comprehension ability, MEF adopts the Fu+En1 strategy, which integrates layered semantic mutations with an encryption technique, more effectively contributing to evasion of the LLM's defenses at the input and inference stages. For models with strong comprehension ability, MEF uses a more complex Fu+En1+En2 strategy, in which additional dual-ended encryption techniques are applied to the LLM's responses, further contributing to evasion of the LLM's defenses at the output stage. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving attack success rates of 98.9% on GPT-4o (29 May 2025 release) and 99.8% on GPT-4.1 (8 July 2025 release). Our work contributes to a deeper understanding of the vulnerabilities in current LLM alignment mechanisms.</p></details> |  |

In robotic grasping, CoG deviation often leads to postural instability, where existing keypoint-based or affordance-driven methods exhibit limitations. We constructed a dataset of 790 images featuring unevenly distributed objects with keypoint annotations for CoG localization. A vision-driven framework based on foundation models was developed to achieve CoG-aware grasping. Experimental evaluations across real-world scenarios demonstrate that our method achieves a 49\% higher success rate compared to conventional keypoint-based approaches and an 11\% improvement over state-of-the-art affordance-driven methods. The system exhibits strong generalization with a 76\% CoG localization accuracy on unseen objects, providing a novel solution for precise and stable grasping tasks.</p></details> |  |

Traditional sequence models struggle to capture long-range dependencies and biological features inherent in DNA. In this work, we propose TrinityDNA, a novel DNA foundational model designed to address these challenges. The model integrates biologically informed components, including Groove Fusion for capturing DNA's structural features and Gated Reverse Complement (GRC) to handle the inherent symmetry of DNA sequences. Additionally, we introduce a multi-scale attention mechanism that allows the model to attend to varying levels of sequence dependencies, and an evolutionary training strategy that progressively adapts the model to both prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes. TrinityDNA provides a more accurate and efficient approach to genomic sequence modeling, offering significant improvements in gene function prediction, regulatory mechanism discovery, and other genomics applications. Our model bridges the gap between machine learning techniques and biological insights, paving the way for more effective analysis of genomic data. Additionally, we introduced a new DNA long-sequence CDS annotation benchmark to make evaluations more comprehensive and oriented toward practical applications.</p></details> |  |

Existing medical IQA methods, however, struggle to generalize across diverse modalities and clinical scenarios. In response, we introduce MedIQA, the first comprehensive foundation model for medical IQA, designed to handle variability in image dimensions, modalities, anatomical regions, and types. We developed a large-scale multi-modality dataset with plentiful manually annotated quality scores to support this. Our model integrates a salient slice assessment module to focus on diagnostically relevant regions feature retrieval and employs an automatic prompt strategy that aligns upstream physical parameter pre-training with downstream expert annotation fine-tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MedIQA significantly outperforms baselines in multiple downstream tasks, establishing a scalable framework for medical IQA and advancing diagnostic workflows and clinical decision-making.</p></details> | <details><summary>We no...</summary><p>We note that the version after peer review of this paper has been provisionally accepted by The 28th International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI 2025)</p></details> |

However, training such a model requires high-quality, local datasets at the deployment site, which are often difficult to collect. We propose a transformer-based foundation model for mMIMO precoding that seeks to minimize the energy consumption of the transmitter while dynamically adapting to per-user rate requirements. At equal energy consumption, zero-shot deployment of the proposed foundation model significantly outperforms zero forcing, and approaches weighted minimum mean squared error performance with 8x less complexity. To address model adaptation in data-scarce settings, we introduce a data augmentation method that finds training samples similar to the target distribution by computing the cosine similarity between the outputs of the pre-trained feature extractor. Our work enables the implementation of DL-based solutions in practice by addressing challenges of data availability and training complexity. Moreover, the ability to dynamically configure per-user rate requirements can be leveraged by higher level resource allocation and scheduling algorithms for greater control over energy efficiency, spectral efficiency and fairness.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures.

We investigate whether foundation models, trained on a large number and variety of objects, can perform object segmentation without fine-tuning on specific images containing everyday objects, but in highly cluttered visual scenes. The ''in the wild'' context is driven by the target application of vision guided upper limb neuroprostheses. We propose a method for generating prompts based on gaze fixations to guide the Segment Anything Model (SAM) in our segmentation scenario, and fine-tune it on egocentric visual data. Evaluation results of our approach show an improvement of the IoU segmentation quality metric by up to 0.51 points on real-world challenging data of Grasping-in-the-Wild corpus which is made available on the RoboFlow Platform (https://universe.roboflow.com/iwrist/grasping-in-the-wild)</p></details> |  |

The framework addresses the complexities of legal compliance and fundamental rights protection by itegrating definitional balancing and defeasible reasoning. Definitional balancing employs proportionality analysis to resolve conflicts between competing rights, while defeasible reasoning accommodates the dynamic nature of legal decision-making. Our approach stresses the need for an analysis of AI deployment scenarios and for identifying potential legal violations and multi-layered impacts on fundamental rights. On the basis of this analysis, we provide philosophical foundations for a logical account of AI risk analysis. In particular, we consider the basic building blocks for conceptually grasping the interaction between AI deployment scenarios and fundamental rights, incorporating in defeasible reasoning definitional balancing and arguments about the contextual promotion or demotion of rights. This layered approach allows for more operative models of assessment of both high-risk AI systems and General Purpose AI (GPAI) systems, emphasizing the broader applicability of the latter. Future work aims to develop a formal model and effective algorithms to enhance AI risk assessment, bridging theoretical insights with practical applications to support responsible AI governance.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 1 figure.

| **[Adaptive Articulated Object Manipulation On The Fly with Foundation Model Reasoning and Part Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18276v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Articulated objects pose diverse manipulation challenges for robots. Since their internal structures are not directly observable, robots must adaptively explore and refine actions to generate successful manipulation trajectories. While existing works have attempted cross-category generalization in adaptive articulated object manipulation, two major challenges persist: (1) the geometric diversity of real-world articulated objects complicates visual perception and understanding, and (2) variations in object functions and mechanisms hinder the development of a unified adaptive manipulation strategy. To address these challenges, we propose AdaRPG, a novel framework that leverages foundation models to extract object parts, which exhibit greater local geometric similarity than entire objects, thereby enhancing visual affordance generalization for functional primitive skills. To support this, we construct a part-level affordance annotation dataset to train the affordance model. Additionally, AdaRPG utilizes the common knowledge embedded in foundation models to reason about complex mechanisms and generate high-level control codes that invoke primitive skill functions based on part affordance inference. Simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate AdaRPG's strong generalization ability across novel articulated object categories.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |

In this paper, we introduce Pulse-PPG, the first open-source PPG foundation model trained exclusively on raw PPG data collected over a 100-day field study with 120 participants. Existing PPG foundation models are either open-source but trained on clinical data or closed-source, limiting their applicability in real-world settings. We evaluate Pulse-PPG across multiple datasets and downstream tasks, comparing its performance against a state-of-the-art foundation model trained on clinical data. Our results demonstrate that Pulse-PPG, trained on uncurated field data, exhibits superior generalization across clinical and mobile health applications in both lab and field settings. This suggests that exposure to real-world variability enables the model to learn fine-grained representations, making it more adaptable across tasks. Furthermore, pre-training on field data surprisingly outperforms its pre-training on clinical data in many tasks, reinforcing the importance of training on real-world, diverse datasets. To encourage further advancements in robust foundation models leveraging field data, we plan to release Pulse-PPG, providing researchers with a powerful resource for developing more generalizable PPG-based models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Saha ...</summary><p>Saha and Xu are co-first authors</p></details> |

The inability of supervised EEG encoders to learn robust EEG patterns and their over-reliance on expensive signal annotations have sparked a transition towards general-purpose self-supervised EEG encoders, i.e., EEG foundation models (EEG-FMs), for robust and scalable EEG feature extraction. However, the real-world readiness of early EEG-FMs and the rubric for long-term research progress remain unclear. A systematic and comprehensive review of first-generation EEG-FMs is therefore necessary to understand the current state-of-the-art and identify key directions for future EEG-FMs. To that end, this study reviews 10 early EEG-FMs and presents a critical synthesis of their methodology, empirical findings, and outstanding research gaps. We find that most EEG-FMs adopt a sequence-based modeling scheme that relies on transformer-based backbones and the reconstruction of masked sequences for self-supervision. However, model evaluations remain heterogeneous and largely limited, making it challenging to assess their practical off-the-shelf utility. In addition to adopting standardized and realistic evaluations, future work should demonstrate more substantial scaling effects and make principled and trustworthy choices throughout the EEG representation learning pipeline. We believe that developing benchmarks, software tools, technical methodologies, and applications in collaboration with domain experts may further advance the translational utility and real-world adoption of EEG-FMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables (main + supplement)</p></details> |

Building foundational models for ST can significantly enhance the analysis of vast and complex data sources, unlocking new perspectives on the intricacies of biological tissues. However, modeling ST data is inherently challenging due to the need to extract multi-scale information from tissue slices containing vast numbers of cells. This process requires integrating macro-scale tissue morphology, micro-scale cellular microenvironment, and gene-scale gene expression profile. To address this challenge, we propose SToFM, a multi-scale Spatial Transcriptomics Foundation Model. SToFM first performs multi-scale information extraction on each ST slice, to construct a set of ST sub-slices that aggregate macro-, micro- and gene-scale information. Then an SE(2) Transformer is used to obtain high-quality cell representations from the sub-slices. Additionally, we construct \textbf{SToCorpus-88M}, the largest high-resolution spatial transcriptomics corpus for pretraining. SToFM achieves outstanding performance on a variety of downstream tasks, such as tissue region semantic segmentation and cell type annotation, demonstrating its comprehensive understanding of ST data through capturing and integrating multi-scale information.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accpe...</summary><p>Accpeted by ICML 2025</p></details> |

However, existing generalist time series foundation models struggle to handle medical time series data due to their inherent challenges, including irregular intervals, heterogeneous sampling rates, and frequent missing values. To address these challenges, we introduce MIRA, a unified foundation model specifically designed for medical time series forecasting. MIRA incorporates a Continuous-Time Rotary Positional Encoding that enables fine-grained modeling of variable time intervals, a frequency-specific mixture-of-experts layer that routes computation across latent frequency regimes to further promote temporal specialization, and a Continuous Dynamics Extrapolation Block based on Neural ODE that models the continuous trajectory of latent states, enabling accurate forecasting at arbitrary target timestamps. Pretrained on a large-scale and diverse medical corpus comprising over 454 billion time points collect from publicly available datasets, MIRA achieves reductions in forecasting errors by an average of 10% and 7% in out-of-distribution and in-distribution scenarios, respectively, when compared to other zero-shot and fine-tuned baselines. We also introduce a comprehensive benchmark spanning multiple downstream clinical tasks, establishing a foundation for future research in medical time series modeling.</p></details> |  |

Evaluating Multimodal Foundation Models on Standard Computer Vision Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01955v2)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal foundation models, such as GPT-4o, have recently made remarkable progress, but it is not clear where exactly these models stand in terms of understanding vision. In this paper, we benchmark the performance of popular multimodal foundation models (GPT-4o, o4-mini, Gemini 1.5 Pro and Gemini 2.0 Flash, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Qwen2-VL, Llama 3.2) on standard computer vision tasks (semantic segmentation, object detection, image classification, depth and surface normal prediction) using established datasets (e.g., COCO, ImageNet and its variants, etc). The main challenges to performing this are: 1) most models are trained to output text and cannot natively express versatile domains, such as segments or 3D geometry, and 2) many leading models are proprietary and accessible only at an API level, i.e., there is no weight access to adapt them. We address these challenges by translating standard vision tasks into equivalent text-promptable and API-compatible tasks via prompt chaining to create a standardized benchmarking framework. We observe that 1) the models are not close to the state-of-the-art specialist models at any task. However, 2) they are respectable generalists; this is remarkable as they are presumably trained on primarily image-text-based tasks. 3) They perform semantic tasks notably better than geometric ones. 4) While the prompt-chaining techniques affect performance, better models exhibit less sensitivity to prompt variations. 5) GPT-4o performs the best among non-reasoning models, securing the top position in 4 out of 6 tasks, 6) reasoning models, e.g. o3, show improvements in geometric tasks, and 7) a preliminary analysis of models with native image generation, like the latest GPT-4o, shows they exhibit quirks like hallucinations and spatial misalignments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page at https://fm-vision-evals.epfl.ch/</p></details> |

However, recent studies have shown fundamental limitations of these models: (1) limited representational capacity, (2) lower adaptability, and (3) diminishing scalability. These shortcomings raise a critical question: is Euclidean geometry truly the optimal inductive bias for all foundation models, or could incorporating alternative geometric spaces enable models to better align with the intrinsic structure of real-world data and improve reasoning processes? Hyperbolic spaces, a class of non-Euclidean manifolds characterized by exponential volume growth with respect to distance, offer a mathematically grounded solution. These spaces enable low-distortion embeddings of hierarchical structures (e.g., trees, taxonomies) and power-law distributions with substantially fewer dimensions compared to Euclidean counterparts. Recent advances have leveraged these properties to enhance foundation models, including improving LLMs' complex reasoning ability, VLMs' zero-shot generalization, and cross-modal semantic alignment, while maintaining parameter efficiency. This paper provides a comprehensive review of hyperbolic neural networks and their recent development for foundation models. We further outline key challenges and research directions to advance the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 Pa...</summary><p>11 Pages, SIGKDD 2025</p></details> |
| **[Risk In Context: Benchmarking Privacy Leakage of Foundation Models in Synthetic Tabular Data Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17066v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthetic tabular data is essential for machine learning workflows, especially for expanding small or imbalanced datasets and enabling privacy-preserving data sharing. However, state-of-the-art generative models (GANs, VAEs, diffusion models) rely on large datasets with thousands of examples. In low-data settings, often the primary motivation for synthetic data, these models can overfit, leak sensitive records, and require frequent retraining. Recent work uses large pre-trained transformers to generate rows via in-context learning (ICL), which needs only a few seed examples and no parameter updates, avoiding retraining. But ICL repeats seed rows verbatim, introducing a new privacy risk that has only been studied in text. The severity of this risk in tabular synthesis-where a single row may identify a person-remains unclear. We address this gap with the first benchmark of three foundation models (GPT-4o-mini, LLaMA 3.3 70B, TabPFN v2) against four baselines on 35 real-world tables from health, finance, and policy. We evaluate statistical fidelity, downstream utility, and membership inference leakage. Results show foundation models consistently have the highest privacy risk. LLaMA 3.3 70B reaches up to 54 percentage points higher true-positive rate at 1% FPR than the safest baseline. GPT-4o-mini and TabPFN are also highly vulnerable. We plot the privacy-utility frontier and show that CTGAN and GPT-4o-mini offer better tradeoffs. A factorial study finds that three zero-cost prompt tweaks-small batch size, low temperature, and using summary statistics-can reduce worst-case AUC by 14 points and rare-class leakage by up to 39 points while maintaining over 90% fidelity. Our benchmark offers a practical guide for safer low-data synthesis with foundation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Agentic & GenAI Evaluation KDD2025, poster presentation</p></details> |

It begins by outlining the characteristics of terahertz UM-MIMO systems and identifies three primary challenges for transceiver design: computational complexity, modeling difficulty, and measurement limitations. The study posits that AI provides a promising solution to these challenges. Three systematic research roadmaps are proposed for developing AI algorithms tailored to terahertz UM-MIMO systems. The first roadmap, model-driven deep learning (DL), emphasizes the importance of leveraging available domain knowledge and advocates the adoption of AI only to enhance bottleneck modules within an established signal processing or optimization framework. Four essential steps are discussed: algorithmic frameworks, basis algorithms, loss-function design, and neural architecture design. The second roadmap presents channel state information (CSI) foundation models, aimed at unifying the design of different transceiver modules by focusing on their shared foundation, that is, the wireless channel. The training of a single compact foundation model is proposed to estimate the score function of wireless channels, which serve as a versatile prior for designing a wide variety of transceiver modules. Four essential steps are outlined: general frameworks, conditioning, site-specific adaptation, joint design of CSI foundation models, and model-driven DL. The third roadmap aims to explore potential directions for applying pretrained large language models (LLMs) to terahertz UM-MIMO systems. Several application scenarios are envisioned, including LLM-based estimation, optimization, search, network management, and protocol understanding. Finally, the study highlights open problems and future research directions.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 8 figures, 1 table, accepted by Engineering.

This gap is primarily due to the absence of domain-specific foundational models, with existing solutions often relying on general-purpose LLMs that fail to address the unique challenges and technical intricacies of O-RAN. To bridge this gap, we introduce ORANSight-2.0 (O-RAN Insights), a pioneering initiative to develop specialized foundational LLMs tailored for O-RAN. Built on 18 models spanning five open-source LLM frameworks -- Mistral, Qwen, Llama, Phi, and Gemma -- ORANSight-2.0 fine-tunes models ranging from 1B to 70B parameters, significantly reducing reliance on proprietary, closed-source models while enhancing performance in O-RAN-specific tasks. At the core of ORANSight-2.0 is RANSTRUCT, a novel Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based instruction-tuning framework that employs two LLM agents -- a Mistral-based Question Generator and a Qwen-based Answer Generator -- to create high-quality instruction-tuning datasets. The generated dataset is then used to fine-tune the 18 pre-trained open-source LLMs via QLoRA. To evaluate ORANSight-2.0, we introduce srsRANBench, a novel benchmark designed for code generation and codebase understanding in the context of srsRAN, a widely used 5G O-RAN stack.</p></details> |  |

Our work (i) introduces measures to quantify FM robustness, (ii) demonstrates the consequences of limited robustness, and (iii) proposes a framework for FM robustification to mitigate these issues. Specifically, we developed PathoROB, a robustness benchmark with three novel metrics, including the robustness index, and four datasets covering 28 biological classes from 34 medical centers. Our experiments reveal robustness deficits across all 20 evaluated FMs, and substantial robustness differences between them. We found that non-robust FM representations can cause major diagnostic downstream errors and clinical blunders that prevent safe clinical adoption. Using more robust FMs and post-hoc robustification considerably reduced (but did not yet eliminate) the risk of such errors. This work establishes that robustness evaluation is essential for validating pathology FMs before clinical adoption and demonstrates that future FM development must integrate robustness as a core design principle. PathoROB provides a blueprint for assessing robustness across biomedical domains, guiding FM improvement efforts towards more robust, representative, and clinically deployable AI systems that prioritize biological information over technical artifacts.</p></details> |  |
| **[FISHER: A Foundation Model for Multi-Modal Industrial Signal Comprehensive Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16696v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid deployment of SCADA systems, how to effectively analyze industrial signals and detect abnormal states is an urgent need for the industry. Due to the significant heterogeneity of these signals, which we summarize as the M5 problem, previous works only focus on small sub-problems and employ specialized models, failing to utilize the synergies between modalities and the powerful scaling law. However, we argue that the M5 signals can be modeled in a unified manner due to the intrinsic similarity. As a result, we propose FISHER, a Foundation model for multi-modal Industrial Signal compreHEnsive Representation. To support arbitrary sampling rates, FISHER considers the increment of sampling rate as the concatenation of sub-band information. Specifically, FISHER takes the STFT sub-band as the modeling unit and adopts a teacher student SSL framework for pre-training. We also develop the RMIS benchmark, which evaluates the representations of M5 industrial signals on multiple health management tasks. Compared with top SSL models, FISHER showcases versatile and outstanding capabilities with a general performance gain up to 5.03%, along with much more efficient scaling curves. We also investigate the scaling law on downstream tasks and derive potential avenues for future works. FISHER is now open-sourced on https://github.com/jianganbai/FISHER</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |

However, current vision-language models in EO, particularly CLIP-based variants, remain confined to individual modalities, limiting generalization and scalability across diverse tasks. We present DOFA-CLIP (Dynamic-One-For-All CLIP), a unified vision-language foundation model that dynamically adapts to EO modalities with flexible spectral configurations through a single Transformer backbone. Our approach introduces three key contributions: 1) the construction of GeoLangBind-2M, a large-scale EO image-text dataset covering six heterogeneous modalities with rich natural language descriptions; 2) a novel training strategy called VECT (Vision-models Enhanced Contrastive Text-image pretraining), which enhances the spatial awareness of CLIP features with multiple vision foundation models; and 3) a Modality-aware Knowledge Agglomeration (MaKA) module that refines feature distillation with modality-specific awareness. DOFA-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance across a wide range of EO benchmarks, including unseen modalities and a diverse number of input spectral bands. Together, these contributions establish a scalable foundation for multimodal EO understanding and open new avenues for integrating heterogeneous EO data with large language models. Code and datasets will be released.

Since most resources are developed primarily for English, cross-linguistic applications of moral foundation theory remain limited. Using Chinese as a case study, this paper evaluates the effectiveness of applying English resources to machine translated text, local language lexicons, multilingual language models, and large language models (LLMs) in measuring MFs in non-English texts. The results indicate that machine translation and local lexicon approaches are insufficient for complex moral assessments, frequently resulting in a substantial loss of cultural information. In contrast, multilingual models and LLMs demonstrate reliable cross-language performance with transfer learning, with LLMs excelling in terms of data efficiency. Importantly, this study also underscores the need for human-in-the-loop validation of automated MF assessment, as the most advanced models may overlook cultural nuances in cross-language measurements. The findings highlight the potential of LLMs for cross-language MF measurements and other complex multilingual deductive coding tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 2 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

These attacks are mostly easy to create and, by executing them against the system's capture device, the malicious actor can impersonate an authorised subject and thus gain access to the latter's information (e.g., financial transactions). To protect facial recognition schemes against presentation attacks, state-of-the-art deep learning presentation attack detection (PAD) approaches require a large amount of data to produce reliable detection performances and even then, they decrease their performance for unknown presentation attack instruments (PAI) or database (information not seen during training), i.e. they lack generalisability. To mitigate the above problems, this paper focuses on zero-shot PAD. To do so, we first assess the effectiveness and generalisability of foundation models in established and challenging experimental scenarios and then propose a simple but effective framework for zero-shot PAD. Experimental results show that these models are able to achieve performance in difficult scenarios with minimal effort of the more advanced PAD mechanisms, whose weights were optimised mainly with training sets that included APs and bona fide presentations. The top-performing foundation model outperforms by a margin the best from the state of the art observed with the leaving-one-out protocol on the SiW-Mv2 database, which contains challenging unknown 2D and 3D attacks</p></details> | Accepted at FG 2025 |

Most RGBT tasks follow a case-by-case research paradigm, relying on manually customized models to learn task-oriented representations. Nevertheless, this paradigm is inherently constrained by artificial inductive bias, modality bias, and data bottleneck. To address these limitations, we make the initial attempt to build a Generalized RGBT MultiSpectral foundation model (M-SpecGene), which aims to learn modality-invariant representations from large-scale broad data in a self-supervised manner. M-SpecGene provides new insights into multispectral fusion and integrates prior case-by-case studies into a unified paradigm. Considering the unique characteristic of information imbalance in RGBT data, we introduce the Cross-Modality Structural Sparsity (CMSS) metric to quantify the information density across two modalities. Then we develop the GMM-CMSS progressive masking strategy to facilitate a flexible, easy-to-hard, and object-centric pre-training process. Comprehensive experiments validate M-SpecGene's generalizability across eleven datasets for four RGBT downstream tasks. The code will be available at https://github.com/CalayZhou/M-SpecGene.</p></details> | accepted by ICCV2025 |

Most existing methods are limited to predicting a single geometry quantity from input images. However, geometric quantities such as depth, surface normals, and point maps are inherently correlated, and estimating them in isolation often fails to ensure consistency, thereby limiting both accuracy and practical applicability. This motivates us to explore a unified framework that explicitly models the structural coupling among different geometric properties to enable joint regression. In this paper, we present Dens3R, a 3D foundation model designed for joint geometric dense prediction and adaptable to a wide range of downstream tasks. Dens3R adopts a two-stage training framework to progressively build a pointmap representation that is both generalizable and intrinsically invariant. Specifically, we design a lightweight shared encoder-decoder backbone and introduce position-interpolated rotary positional encoding to maintain expressive power while enhancing robustness to high-resolution inputs. By integrating image-pair matching features with intrinsic invariance modeling, Dens3R accurately regresses multiple geometric quantities such as surface normals and depth, achieving consistent geometry perception from single-view to multi-view inputs. Additionally, we propose a post-processing pipeline that supports geometrically consistent multi-view inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of Dens3R across various dense 3D prediction tasks and highlight its potential for broader applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://g-1nonly.github.io/Dens3R/, Code: https://github.com/G-1nOnly/Dens3R</p></details> |

Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSSS) has emerged as a solution to alleviate the labeling burden by leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data through self-training techniques. Meanwhile, the advent of foundational segmentation models pre-trained on massive data, has shown the potential to generalize across domains effectively. This work explores whether a foundational segmentation model can address label scarcity in the pixel-level vision task as an annotator for unlabeled images. Specifically, we investigate the efficacy of using SEEM, a Segment Anything Model (SAM) variant fine-tuned for textual input, to generate predictive masks for unlabeled data. To address the shortcomings of using SEEM-generated masks as supervision, we propose ConformalSAM, a novel SSSS framework which first calibrates the foundation model using the target domain's labeled data and then filters out unreliable pixel labels of unlabeled data so that only high-confidence labels are used as supervision. By leveraging conformal prediction (CP) to adapt foundation models to target data through uncertainty calibration, ConformalSAM exploits the strong capability of the foundational segmentation model reliably which benefits the early-stage learning, while a subsequent self-reliance training strategy mitigates overfitting to SEEM-generated masks in the later training stage. Our experiment demonstrates that, on three standard benchmarks of SSSS, ConformalSAM achieves superior performance compared to recent SSSS methods and helps boost the performance of those methods as a plug-in.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |

We explore how these architectures, with their global receptive fields and adaptability, address challenges such as long-range dependency modeling, contextual modeling and data scarcity. The survey categorizes VAD methods into reconstruction-based, feature-based and zero/few-shot approaches, highlighting the paradigm shift brought about by foundation models. By integrating attention mechanisms and leveraging large-scale pre-training, Transformers and foundation models enable more robust, interpretable, and scalable anomaly detection solutions. This work provides a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art techniques, their strengths, limitations, and emerging trends in leveraging these architectures for VAD.</p></details> |  |
| **[PDEformer-2: A Versatile Foundation Model for Two-Dimensional Partial Differential Equations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15409v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Partial differential equations (PDEs) play a central role in describing many physical phenomena. Various scientific and engineering applications demand a versatile and differentiable PDE solver that can quickly generate solutions with adequate accuracy, and limitations of the traditional solvers and specialized neural operators motivate the development of foundation models for solving PDEs. This paper introduces PDEformer-2, a versatile foundation model for two-dimensional PDEs. Based on our previous one-dimensional PDEformer-1 model, PDEformer-2 receives the PDE form as network input via computational graph representation, which has the flexibility to encode most common PDEs. The mesh-free predicted solutions can be directly queried at arbitrary spatio-temporal coordinates. A large (40TB) diverse dataset is employed to pretrain the current model, making it capable of simultaneously addressing PDEs with different symbolic forms, domain shapes, boundary conditions, number of variables, and time-dependency. Accurate zero-shot prediction is allowed for PDEs that resemble the pretraining ones. When adapted to new unseen PDEs, PDEformer-2 demonstrates faster learning than many specialized models, and has smaller errors given limited (less than 100) samples. Additionally, PDEformer-2 can be employed in the inverse problems thanks to its fast and differentiable nature and produces reasonable results in our experiments to recover coefficient scalars and fields of a PDE.</p></details> |  |

We present a method for self-supervised domain adaptation for the scenario where annotated source domain data (e.g. from synthetic generation) is available, but the target domain data is completely unannotated. Our method targets the semantic segmentation task and leverages a segmentation foundation model (Segment Anything Model) to obtain segment information on unannotated data. We take inspiration from recent advances in unsupervised local feature learning and propose an invariance-variance loss over the detected segments for regularizing feature representations in the target domain. Crucially, this loss structure and network architecture can handle overlapping segments and oversegmentation as produced by Segment Anything. We demonstrate the advantage of our method on the challenging YCB-Video and HomebrewedDB datasets and show that it outperforms prior work and, on YCB-Video, even a network trained with real annotations. Additionally, we provide insight through model ablations and show applicability to a custom robotic application.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for IEEE International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE) 2025.

Recent advancements in deep learning have led to powerful depth foundation models (DFMs), yet their evaluation remains challenging due to inconsistencies in existing protocols. Traditional benchmarks rely on alignment-based metrics that introduce biases, favor certain depth representations, and complicate fair comparisons. In this work, we propose BenchDepth, a new benchmark that evaluates DFMs through five carefully selected downstream proxy tasks: depth completion, stereo matching, monocular feed-forward 3D scene reconstruction, SLAM, and vision-language spatial understanding. Unlike conventional evaluation protocols, our approach assesses DFMs based on their practical utility in real-world applications, bypassing problematic alignment procedures. We benchmark eight state-of-the-art DFMs and provide an in-depth analysis of key findings and observations. We hope our work sparks further discussion in the community on best practices for depth model evaluation and paves the way for future research and advancements in depth estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Webpa...</summary><p>Webpage: https://zhyever.github.io/benchdepth</p></details> |

Central to our approach is the Universal Embedding and Linear Approximation Theorem (UELAT), which establishes that functions in broad spaces -- including C(K), Sobolev spaces W^{k,p}(Omega), and distributions D'(Omega) -- can be explicitly approximated by finite-rank linear projections, each with a constructive, algorithmically verifiable certificate of accuracy. These constructions are governed categorically by a functorial adjunction between local logical probes and analytic models, making analytic existence both formally certifiable and programmatically extractable. As a key result, we prove a uniform certificate stability theorem, ensuring that approximation certificates persist under uniform convergence. The CCP avoids classical pathologies (e.g., non-measurable sets, Banach--Tarski paradoxes) by eliminating non-constructive choice and replacing it with a coherent, local-to-global semantic logic. Our framework strengthens the foundations of constructive analysis while contributing tools relevant to formal verification, type-theoretic proof systems, and computational mathematics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Advances in Mathematics.

| **[Calibrated and Robust Foundation Models for Vision-Language and Medical Image Tasks Under Distribution Shift](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09222v2)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models like CLIP and SAM have advanced computer vision and medical imaging via low-shot transfer learning, aiding CADD with limited data. However, their deployment faces two key challenges. \textit{distribution shift} where pre-training and post-training data distributions differ (e.g., due to inter-center image acquisition) and \textit{confidence misalignment}, which leads to overconfident errors. These issues surface differently, vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) suffer from 2D embedding shift (image-text misalignment), while medical models (e.g., SAM) encounter 3D domain shifts (e.g., scanner variation) and voxel-wise calibration need. Existing solutions are domain-specific. We propose \textbf{StaRFM}, a fusion of Fisher information penalty (FIP) and confidence misalignment penalty (CMP) tackling both challenges. It applies FIP, extended to 3D via patch-wise regularization, to reduce embedding shift, and CMP, reformulated for voxel-level predictions, to calibrate segmentation uncertainty. We derive PAC-Bayes bounds. FIP controls generalization via the Fisher-Rao norm, and CMP reduces calibration error via Brier score minimization. StaRFM surpasses baselines by \texttt{+}3.5\% accuracy and 28\% lower ECE on 19 vision datasets (e.g., ImageNet, Office-Home), achieves +4.2\% DSC over SAM-FT and 4.8mm HD95 on medical benchmarks (e.g., BraTS, ATLAS), and reduces cross-domain gaps by up to 20\%. The framework is plug-and-play, requiring minimal architectural changes.

In this study, we present a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates the performance, fairness, and interpretability of foundation models, both as unimodal encoders and as multimodal learners, using the publicly available MIMIC-IV database. To support consistent and reproducible evaluation, we developed a standardized data processing pipeline that harmonizes heterogeneous clinical records into an analysis-ready format. We systematically compared eight foundation models, encompassing both unimodal and multimodal models, as well as domain-specific and general-purpose variants. Our findings demonstrate that incorporating multiple data modalities leads to consistent improvements in predictive performance without introducing additional bias. Through this benchmark, we aim to support the development of effective and trustworthy multimodal artificial intelligence (AI) systems for real-world clinical applications.

Meanwhile, conventional GSR models often lack generalization ability, falling short in recognizing unseen and rare situations. In this paper, we exploit transferring knowledge from a teacher MLLM to a small GSR model to enhance its generalization and zero-shot abilities, thereby introducing the task of Open-vocabulary Grounded Situation Recognition (Ov-GSR). To achieve this, we propose Multimodal Interactive Prompt Distillation (MIPD), a novel framework that distills enriched multimodal knowledge from the foundation model, enabling the student Ov-GSR model to recognize unseen situations and be better aware of rare situations. Specifically, the MIPD framework first leverages the LLM-based Judgmental Rationales Generator (JRG) to construct positive and negative glimpse and gaze rationales enriched with contextual semantic information. The proposed scene-aware and instance-perception prompts are then introduced to align rationales with visual information from the MLLM teacher via the Negative-Guided Multimodal Prompting Alignment (NMPA) module, effectively capturing holistic and perceptual multimodal knowledge. Finally, the aligned multimodal knowledge is distilled into the student Ov-GSR model, providing a stronger foundation for generalization that enhances situation understanding, bridges the gap between seen and unseen scenarios, and mitigates prediction bias in rare cases. We evaluate MIPD on the refined Ov-SWiG dataset, achieving superior performance on seen, rare, and unseen situations, and further demonstrate improved unseen detection on the HICO-DET dataset.</p></details> |  |

However, existing models rely heavily on real-world data, which is costly and labor-intensive to collect. Synthetic data offers a cost-effective alternative, yet its potential remains largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we explore the feasibility of training Vision-Language-Action models entirely with large-scale synthetic action data. We curate SynGrasp-1B, a billion-frame robotic grasping dataset generated in simulation with photorealistic rendering and extensive domain randomization. Building on this, we present GraspVLA, a VLA model pretrained on large-scale synthetic action data as a foundational model for grasping tasks. GraspVLA integrates autoregressive perception tasks and flow-matching-based action generation into a unified Chain-of-Thought process, enabling joint training on synthetic action data and Internet semantics data. This design helps mitigate sim-to-real gaps and facilitates the transfer of learned actions to a broader range of Internet-covered objects, achieving open-vocabulary generalization in grasping. Extensive evaluations across real-world and simulation benchmarks demonstrate GraspVLA's advanced zero-shot generalizability and few-shot adaptability to specific human preferences. We will release SynGrasp-1B dataset and pre-trained weights to benefit the community.</p></details> |  |

While several VFM adapters have shown promising results by leveraging the prior knowledge of VFMs, we identify two inefficiencies in these approaches. First, the interaction between convolutional neural network (CNN) and VFM backbone triggers early layer gradient backpropagation. Second, existing methods require tuning all components, adding complexity. Besides, these adapters alter VFM features, underutilizing the prior knowledge. To tackle these challenges, we propose a new approach called ViT-Split, based on a key observation: the layers of several VFMs, like DINOv2, can be divided into two distinct components: an extractor for learning low-level features and an adapter for learning task-specific features. Leveraging this insight, we eliminate the CNN branch and introduce two heads, task head and prior head, to the frozen VFM. The task head is designed to learn task-specific features, mitigating the early gradient propagation issue. The prior head is used to leverage the multi-scale prior features from the frozen VFM, reducing tuning parameters and overfitting. Extensive experiments on various tasks (e.g., segmentation, detection, depth estimation, and visual question answering) validate the effectiveness and efficiency of ViT-Split. Specifically, ViT-Split reduces training time up to $4\times$ while achieving comparable or even better results on ADE20K, compared to other VFM adapters.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The project is available: https://jackyfl.github.io/vitsplit.github.io/</p></details> |

The emergence of foundation models (FM) pretrained on large datasets presents new opportunities for CIL by offering rich, transferable representations. However, their potential for enabling incremental learning in dermatology remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we systematically evaluate frozen FMs pretrained on large-scale skin lesion datasets for CIL in dermatological disease classification. We propose a simple yet effective approach where the backbone remains frozen, and a lightweight MLP is trained incrementally for each task. This setup achieves state-of-the-art performance without forgetting, outperforming regularization, replay, and architecture based methods. To further explore the capabilities of frozen FMs, we examine zero training scenarios using nearest mean classifiers with prototypes derived from their embeddings. Through extensive ablation studies, we demonstrate that this prototype based variant can also achieve competitive results. Our findings highlight the strength of frozen FMs for continual learning in dermatology and support their broader adoption in real world medical applications.

Accurate characterisation of tissue morphology in melanoma is crucial for prognosis and treatment planning. However, manual segmentation of tissue regions from haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained whole-slide images (WSIs) is labour-intensive and prone to inter-observer variability, this motivates the need for reliable automated tissue segmentation methods. In this study, we propose a novel deep learning network for the segmentation of five tissue classes in melanoma H&E images. Our approach leverages Virchow2, a pathology foundation model trained on 3.1 million histopathology images as a feature extractor. These features are fused with the original RGB images and subsequently processed by an encoder-decoder segmentation network (Efficient-UNet) to produce accurate segmentation maps. The proposed model achieved first place in the tissue segmentation task of the PUMA Grand Challenge, demonstrating robust performance and generalizability.

In particular, DepthAnything offers dense and reliable geometric priors from monocular RGB images, which can complement sparse LiDAR data in autonomous driving scenarios. However, such priors remain underutilized in LiDAR-based 3D object detection. In this paper, we address the limited expressiveness of raw LiDAR point features, especially the weak discriminative capability of the reflectance attribute, by introducing depth priors predicted by DepthAnything. These priors are fused with the original LiDAR attributes to enrich each point's representation. To leverage the enhanced point features, we propose a point-wise feature extraction module. Then, a Dual-Path RoI feature extraction framework is employed, comprising a voxel-based branch for global semantic context and a point-based branch for fine-grained structural details. To effectively integrate the complementary RoI features, we introduce a bidirectional gated RoI feature fusion module that balances global and local cues. Extensive experiments on the KITTI benchmark show that our method consistently improves detection accuracy, demonstrating the value of incorporating visual foundation model priors into LiDAR-based 3D object detection.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we explore whether DL can extract meaningful concepts from less human-interpretable scientific data, such as vision foundation models trained on cell microscopy images, where limited prior knowledge exists about which high-level concepts should arise. We propose a novel combination of a sparse DL algorithm, Iterative Codebook Feature Learning (ICFL), with a PCA whitening pre-processing step derived from control data. Using this combined approach, we successfully retrieve biologically meaningful concepts, such as cell types and genetic perturbations. Moreover, we demonstrate how our method reveals subtle morphological changes arising from human-interpretable interventions, offering a promising new direction for scientific discovery via mechanistic interpretability in bioimaging.</p></details> |  |
| **[SkySense V2: A Unified Foundation Model for Multi-modal Remote Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13812v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The multi-modal remote sensing foundation model (MM-RSFM) has significantly advanced various Earth observation tasks, such as urban planning, environmental monitoring, and natural disaster management. However, most existing approaches generally require the training of separate backbone networks for each data modality, leading to redundancy and inefficient parameter utilization. Moreover, prevalent pre-training methods typically apply self-supervised learning (SSL) techniques from natural images without adequately accommodating the characteristics of remote sensing (RS) images, such as the complicated semantic distribution within a single RS image. In this work, we present SkySense V2, a unified MM-RSFM that employs a single transformer backbone to handle multiple modalities. This backbone is pre-trained with a novel SSL strategy tailored to the distinct traits of RS data. In particular, SkySense V2 incorporates an innovative adaptive patch merging module and learnable modality prompt tokens to address challenges related to varying resolutions and limited feature diversity across modalities. In additional, we incorporate the mixture of experts (MoE) module to further enhance the performance of the foundation model. SkySense V2 demonstrates impressive generalization abilities through an extensive evaluation involving 16 datasets over 7 tasks, outperforming SkySense by an average of 1.8 points.</p></details> | Accepted by ICCV25 |
| **[On-the-Fly Fine-Tuning of Foundational Neural Network Potentials: A Bayesian Neural Network Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13805v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the computational complexity of evaluating interatomic forces from first principles, the creation of interatomic machine learning force fields has become a highly active field of research. However, the generation of training datasets of sufficient size and sample diversity itself comes with a computational burden that can make this approach impractical for modeling rare events or systems with a large configuration space. Fine-tuning foundation models that have been pre-trained on large-scale material or molecular databases offers a promising opportunity to reduce the amount of training data necessary to reach a desired level of accuracy. However, even if this approach requires less training data overall, creating a suitable training dataset can still be a very challenging problem, especially for systems with rare events and for end-users who don't have an extensive background in machine learning. In on-the-fly learning, the creation of a training dataset can be largely automated by using model uncertainty during the simulation to decide if the model is accurate enough or if a structure should be recalculated with classical methods and used to update the model. A key challenge for applying this form of active learning to the fine-tuning of foundation models is how to assess the uncertainty of those models during the fine-tuning process, even though most foundation models lack any form of uncertainty quantification. In this paper, we overcome this challenge by introducing a fine-tuning approach based on Bayesian neural network methods and a subsequent on-the-fly workflow that automatically fine-tunes the model while maintaining a pre-specified accuracy and can detect rare events such as transition states and sample them at an increased rate relative to their occurrence.</p></details> |  |

However, achieving efficient whole-body control (WBC) in humanoids remains a fundamental challenge due to sophisticated dynamics, underactuation, and diverse task requirements. While learning-based controllers have shown promise for complex tasks, their reliance on labor-intensive and costly retraining for new scenarios limits real-world applicability. To address these limitations, behavior(al) foundation models (BFMs) have emerged as a new paradigm that leverages large-scale pre-training to learn reusable primitive skills and broad behavioral priors, enabling zero-shot or rapid adaptation to a wide range of downstream tasks. In this paper, we present a comprehensive overview of BFMs for humanoid WBC, tracing their development across diverse pre-training pipelines. Furthermore, we discuss real-world applications, current limitations, urgent challenges, and future opportunities, positioning BFMs as a key approach toward scalable and general-purpose humanoid intelligence. Finally, we provide a curated and long-term list of BFM papers and projects to facilitate more subsequent research, which is available at https://github.com/yuanmingqi/awesome-bfm-papers.</p></details> | 18 pages, 9 figures |

Yet, the crucial task of out-of-domain imputation of missing values remains largely underexplored. We propose a first step to fill this gap by leveraging implicit neural representations (INRs). INRs model time series as continuous functions and naturally handle various missing data scenarios and sampling rates. While they have shown strong performance within specific distributions, they struggle under distribution shifts. To address this, we introduce MoTM (Mixture of Timeflow Models), a step toward a foundation model for time series imputation. Building on the idea that a new time series is a mixture of previously seen patterns, MoTM combines a basis of INRs, each trained independently on a distinct family of time series, with a ridge regressor that adapts to the observed context at inference. We demonstrate robust in-domain and out-of-domain generalization across diverse imputation scenarios (e.g., block and pointwise missingness, variable sampling rates), paving the way for adaptable foundation imputation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>10th ...</summary><p>10th Workshop on Advanced Analytics and Learning on Temporal Data (AALTD), ECML 2025</p></details> |

However, progress has been hindered by limited datasets and the restricted generalizability of existing models. Here, we propose NanoPro-3M, the largest nanomaterial-protein interaction dataset to date, comprising over 3.2 million samples and 37,000 unique proteins. Leveraging this, we present NanoProFormer, a foundational model that predicts nanomaterial-protein affinities through multimodal representation learning, demonstrating strong generalization, handling missing features, and unseen nanomaterials or proteins. We show that multimodal modeling significantly outperforms single-modality approaches and identifies key determinants of corona formation. Furthermore, we demonstrate its applicability to a range of downstream tasks through zero-shot inference and fine-tuning. Together, this work establishes a solid foundation for high-performance and generalized prediction of nanomaterial-protein interaction endpoints, reducing experimental reliance and accelerating various in vitro applications.</p></details> | 31 pages, 6 figures |

Both models are trained on large-scale multilingual and multimodal datasets sourced via responsible web crawling, licensed corpora, and high-quality synthetic data, then further refined with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning on a new asynchronous platform. The resulting models support several additional languages while understanding images and executing tool calls. In public benchmarks and human evaluations, both the server model and the on-device model match or surpass comparably sized open baselines. A new Swift-centric Foundation Models framework exposes guided generation, constrained tool calling, and LoRA adapter fine-tuning, allowing developers to integrate these capabilities with a few lines of code.

| **[Temporal Adaptation of Pre-trained Foundation Models for Music Structure Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13572v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Audio-based music structure analysis (MSA) is an essential task in Music Information Retrieval that remains challenging due to the complexity and variability of musical form. Recent advances highlight the potential of fine-tuning pre-trained music foundation models for MSA tasks. However, these models are typically trained with high temporal feature resolution and short audio windows, which limits their efficiency and introduces bias when applied to long-form audio. This paper presents a temporal adaptation approach for fine-tuning music foundation models tailored to MSA. Our method enables efficient analysis of full-length songs in a single forward pass by incorporating two key strategies: (1) audio window extension and (2) low-resolution adaptation. Experiments on the Harmonix Set and RWC-Pop datasets show that our method significantly improves both boundary detection and structural function prediction, while maintaining comparable memory usage and inference speed.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WASPAA 2025.

Recent advances in visual foundation models, such as DINOv2, have improved robustness and generalization in various vision tasks, yet their integration in VO remains limited due to coarse feature granularity. In this paper, we present DINO-VO, a feature-based VO system leveraging DINOv2 visual foundation model for its sparse feature matching. To address the integration challenge, we propose a salient keypoints detector tailored to DINOv2's coarse features. Furthermore, we complement DINOv2's robust-semantic features with fine-grained geometric features, resulting in more localizable representations. Finally, a transformer-based matcher and differentiable pose estimation layer enable precise camera motion estimation by learning good matches. Against prior detector-descriptor networks like SuperPoint, DINO-VO demonstrates greater robustness in challenging environments. Furthermore, we show superior accuracy and generalization of the proposed feature descriptors against standalone DINOv2 coarse features. DINO-VO outperforms prior frame-to-frame VO methods on the TartanAir and KITTI datasets and is competitive on EuRoC dataset, while running efficiently at 72 FPS with less than 1GB of memory usage on a single GPU. Moreover, it performs competitively against Visual SLAM systems on outdoor driving scenarios, showcasing its generalization capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures.

| **[(Almost) Free Modality Stitching of Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10015v3)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation multi-modal models are often designed by stitching of multiple existing pretrained uni-modal models: for example, an image classifier with an text model. This stitching process is performed by training a connector module that aims to align the representation spaces of these uni-modal models towards a multi-modal objective. However, given the complexity of training such connectors on large scale web-based datasets coupled with the ever-increasing number of available pretrained uni-modal models, the task of uni-modal models selection and subsequent connector module training becomes computationally demanding. To address this under-studied critical problem, we propose Hypernetwork Model Alignment (Hyma), a novel all-in-one solution for optimal uni-modal model selection and connector training by leveraging hypernetworks. Specifically, our framework utilizes the parameter prediction capability of a hypernetwork to obtain jointly trained connector modules for $N \times M$ combinations of uni-modal models. In our experiments, Hyma reduces the cost of searching for the best performing uni-modal model pair by $10\times$, while matching the ranking and trained connector performance obtained via grid search across a suite of diverse multi-modal benchmarks.</p></details> | Pre-print |
| **[Unleashing Vision Foundation Models for Coronary Artery Segmentation: Parallel ViT-CNN Encoding and Variational Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12938v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate coronary artery segmentation is critical for computeraided diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD), yet it remains challenging due to the small size, complex morphology, and low contrast with surrounding tissues. To address these challenges, we propose a novel segmentation framework that leverages the power of vision foundation models (VFMs) through a parallel encoding architecture. Specifically, a vision transformer (ViT) encoder within the VFM captures global structural features, enhanced by the activation of the final two ViT blocks and the integration of an attention-guided enhancement (AGE) module, while a convolutional neural network (CNN) encoder extracts local details. These complementary features are adaptively fused using a cross-branch variational fusion (CVF) module, which models latent distributions and applies variational attention to assign modality-specific weights. Additionally, we introduce an evidential-learning uncertainty refinement (EUR) module, which quantifies uncertainty using evidence theory and refines uncertain regions by incorporating multi-scale feature aggregation and attention mechanisms, further enhancing segmentation accuracy. Extensive evaluations on one in-house and two public datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior performance in accurate coronary artery segmentation and showcasing strong generalization across multiple datasets.

Despite recent progress in general-purpose manipulation, data scarcity and embodiment heterogeneity remain serious obstacles to further scaling up in bimanual settings. In this paper, we introduce VIdeo Diffusion for Action Reasoning (VIDAR), a two-stage framework that leverages large-scale, diffusion-based video pre-training and a novel masked inverse dynamics model for action prediction. We pre-train the video diffusion model on 750K multi-view videos from three real-world bimanual robot platforms, utilizing a unified observation space that encodes robot, camera, task, and scene contexts. Our masked inverse dynamics model learns masks to extract action-relevant information from generated trajectories without requiring pixel-level labels, and the masks can effectively generalize to unseen backgrounds. Our experiments demonstrate that with only 20 minutes of human demonstrations on an unseen robot platform (only 1% of typical data requirements), VIDAR generalizes to unseen tasks and backgrounds with strong semantic understanding, surpassing state-of-the-art methods. Our findings highlight the potential of video foundation models, coupled with masked action prediction, to enable scalable and generalizable robotic manipulation in diverse real-world settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semantic-guided Fine-tuning of Foundation Model for Long-tailed Visual Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12807v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The variance in class-wise sample sizes within long-tailed scenarios often results in degraded performance in less frequent classes. Fortunately, foundation models, pre-trained on vast open-world datasets, demonstrate strong potential for this task due to their generalizable representation, which promotes the development of adaptive strategies on pre-trained models in long-tailed learning. Advanced fine-tuning methods typically adjust visual encoders while neglecting the semantics derived from the frozen text encoder, overlooking the visual and textual alignment. To strengthen this alignment, we propose a novel approach, Semantic-guided fine-tuning of foundation model for long-tailed visual recognition (Sage), which incorporates semantic guidance derived from textual modality into the visual fine-tuning process. Specifically, we introduce an SG-Adapter that integrates class descriptions as semantic guidance to guide the fine-tuning of the visual encoder. The introduced guidance is passesed through the attention mechanism and enables the model to focus more on semantically relevant content, strengthening the alignment between the visual and textual modalities. Due to the inconsistent class-conditional distributions neglected by the existing loss function, the resulting prediction bias causes performance improvements for the tail class less than for the head class, even when the multi-modal alignment is enhanced. To address this challenge, we propose a novel distribution mismatch-aware compensation factor, which is specifically designed to rectify the prediction bias caused by the ignored inconsistent distribution based on our theoretical analysis, and is seamlessly integrated into the loss function. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed Sage in enhancing performance in long-tailed learning.</p></details> |  |

We present a foundation model framework for universal human mobility patterns that leverages cross-domain data fusion and large language models to address these limitations. Our approach integrates multi-modal data of distinct nature and spatio-temporal resolution, including geographical, mobility, socio-demographic, and traffic information, to construct a privacy-preserving and semantically enriched human travel trajectory dataset. Our framework demonstrates adaptability through domain transfer techniques that ensure transferability across diverse urban contexts, as evidenced in case studies of Los Angeles (LA) and Egypt. The framework employs LLMs for semantic enrichment of trajectory data, enabling comprehensive understanding of mobility patterns. Quantitative evaluation shows that our generated synthetic dataset accurately reproduces mobility patterns observed in empirical data. The practical utility of this foundation model approach is demonstrated through large-scale traffic simulations for LA County, where results align well with observed traffic data. On California's I-405 corridor, the simulation yields a Mean Absolute Percentage Error of 5.85% for traffic volume and 4.36% for speed compared to Caltrans PeMS observations, illustrating the framework's potential for intelligent transportation systems and urban mobility applications.</p></details> |  |

We present a foundational model, PinFM, for understanding user activity sequences across multiple applications at a billion-scale visual discovery platform. We pretrain a transformer model with 20B+ parameters using extensive user activity data, then fine-tune it for specific applications, efficiently coupling it with existing models. While this pretraining-and-fine-tuning approach has been popular in other domains, such as Vision and NLP, its application in industrial recommender systems presents numerous challenges. The foundational model must be scalable enough to score millions of items every second while meeting tight cost and latency constraints imposed by these systems. Additionally, it should capture the interactions between user activities and other features and handle new items that were not present during the pretraining stage. We developed innovative techniques to address these challenges. Our infrastructure and algorithmic optimizations, such as the Deduplicated Cross-Attention Transformer (DCAT), improved our throughput by 600% on Pinterest internal data. We demonstrate that PinFM can learn interactions between user sequences and candidate items by altering input sequences, leading to a 20% increase in engagement with new items. PinFM is now deployed to help improve the experience of more than a half billion users across various applications.</p></details> | RecSys 2025 |

Traditional generative architectures such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) or Variational Auto Encoder (VAEs) have shown great promise for high-resolution image generation but struggle with preserving fine-grained details that are key for accurate diagnosis. To address this issue, we introduce Pixel Perfect MegaMed, the first vision-language foundation model to synthesize images at resolutions of 1024x1024. Our method deploys a multi-scale transformer architecture designed specifically for ultra-high resolution medical image generation, enabling the preservation of both global anatomical context and local image-level details. By leveraging vision-language alignment techniques tailored to medical terminology and imaging modalities, Pixel Perfect MegaMed bridges the gap between textual descriptions and visual representations at unprecedented resolution levels. We apply our model to the CheXpert dataset and demonstrate its ability to generate clinically faithful chest X-rays from text prompts. Beyond visual quality, these high-resolution synthetic images prove valuable for downstream tasks such as classification, showing measurable performance gains when used for data augmentation, particularly in low-data regimes.

However, atypical mitosis classification remains challenging due to low prevalence, at times subtle morphological differences from normal mitotic figures, low inter-rater agreement among pathologists, and class imbalance in datasets. Building on the Atypical Mitosis dataset for Breast Cancer (AMi-Br), this study presents a comprehensive benchmark comparing deep learning approaches for automated atypical mitotic figure (AMF) classification, including end-to-end trained deep learning models, foundation models with linear probing, and foundation models fine-tuned with low-rank adaptation (LoRA). For rigorous evaluation, we further introduce two new held-out AMF datasets - AtNorM-Br, a dataset of mitotic figures from the TCGA breast cancer cohort, and AtNorM-MD, a multi-domain dataset of mitotic figures from a subset of the MIDOG++ training set. We found average balanced accuracy values of up to 0.8135, 0.7788, and 0.7723 on the in-domain AMi-Br and the out-of-domain AtNorm-Br and AtNorM-MD datasets, respectively. Our work shows that atypical mitotic figure classification, while being a challenging problem, can be effectively addressed through the use of recent advances in transfer learning and model fine-tuning techniques.

However, it is difficult to train a 3D foundation network directly due to the limited dataset and it remains under explored whether existing foundation models can be lifted to 3D space seamlessly. In this paper, we present PointSeg, a novel training-free paradigm that leverages off-the-shelf vision foundation models to address 3D scene perception tasks. PointSeg can segment anything in 3D scene by acquiring accurate 3D prompts to align their corresponding pixels across frames. Concretely, we design a two-branch prompts learning structure to construct the 3D point-box prompts pairs, combining with the bidirectional matching strategy for accurate point and proposal prompts generation. Then, we perform the iterative post-refinement adaptively when cooperated with different vision foundation models. Moreover, we design a affinity-aware merging algorithm to improve the final ensemble masks. PointSeg demonstrates impressive segmentation performance across various datasets, all without training. Specifically, our approach significantly surpasses the state-of-the-art specialist training-free model by 14.1$\%$, 12.3$\%$, and 12.6$\%$ mAP on ScanNet, ScanNet++, and KITTI-360 datasets, respectively. On top of that, PointSeg can incorporate with various foundation models and even surpasses the specialist training-based methods by 3.4$\%$-5.4$\%$ mAP across various datasets, serving as an effective generalist model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025 E2E3D Workshop</p></details> |

This has sparked growing interest in developing practical and efficient strategies for bringing foundation models to edge environments. In this work, we propose PRISM, a communication-efficient and compute-aware strategy for distributed Transformer inference on edge devices. Our method leverages a Segment Means representation to approximate intermediate output features, drastically reducing inter-device communication. Additionally, we restructure the self-attention mechanism to eliminate redundant computations caused by per-device Key/Value calculation in position-wise partitioning and design a partition-aware causal masking scheme tailored for autoregressive models. We evaluate PRISM on ViT, BERT, and GPT-2 across diverse datasets, namely CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-1k, GLUE, and CBT. Our results demonstrate substantial reductions in communication overhead (up to 99.2% for BERT at compression rate CR = 128) and per-device computation (51.24% for BERT at the same setting), with only minor accuracy degradation. This method offers a scalable and practical solution for deploying foundation models in distributed resource-constrained environments.</p></details> |  |

However, fundamental questions persist regarding its stopping rules, residual risk estimation, debug effectiveness, and the impact of simulation fidelity on safety claims. This paper argues that a rigorous statistical foundation is essential to address these challenges and enable rigorous safety assurance. By drawing parallels between AV testing and established software testing methods, we identify shared research gaps and reusable solutions. We propose proof-of-concept models to quantify the probability of failure per scenario (\textit{pfs}) and evaluate testing effectiveness under varying conditions. Our analysis reveals that neither scenario-based nor mile-based testing universally outperforms the other. Furthermore, we give an example of formal reasoning about alignment of synthetic and real-world testing outcomes, a first step towards supporting statistically defensible simulation-based safety claims.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ITSC 2025</p></details> |

We develop Multi-view Molecular Embedding with Late Fusion (MMELON), an approach that integrates graph, image and text views in a foundation model setting and may be readily extended to additional representations. Single-view foundation models are each pre-trained on a dataset of up to 200M molecules. The multi-view model performs robustly, matching the performance of the highest-ranked single-view. It is validated on over 120 tasks, including molecular solubility, ADME properties, and activity against G Protein-Coupled receptors (GPCRs). We identify 33 GPCRs that are related to Alzheimer's disease and employ the multi-view model to select strong binders from a compound screen. Predictions are validated through structure-based modeling and identification of key binding motifs.</p></details> | <details><summary>40 pa...</summary><p>40 pages including supplement. 10 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |
| **[A computationally frugal open-source foundation model for thoracic disease detection in lung cancer screening programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01881v2)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) imaging employed in lung cancer screening (LCS) programs is increasing in uptake worldwide. LCS programs herald a generational opportunity to simultaneously detect cancer and non-cancer-related early-stage lung disease. Yet these efforts are hampered by a shortage of radiologists to interpret scans at scale. Here, we present TANGERINE, a computationally frugal, open-source vision foundation model for volumetric LDCT analysis. Designed for broad accessibility and rapid adaptation, TANGERINE can be fine-tuned off the shelf for a wide range of disease-specific tasks with limited computational resources and training data. Relative to models trained from scratch, TANGERINE demonstrates fast convergence during fine-tuning, thereby requiring significantly fewer GPU hours, and displays strong label efficiency, achieving comparable or superior performance with a fraction of fine-tuning data. Pretrained using self-supervised learning on over 98,000 thoracic LDCTs, including the UK's largest LCS initiative to date and 27 public datasets, TANGERINE achieves state-of-the-art performance across 14 disease classification tasks, including lung cancer and multiple respiratory diseases, while generalising robustly across diverse clinical centres. By extending a masked autoencoder framework to 3D imaging, TANGERINE offers a scalable solution for LDCT analysis, departing from recent closed, resource-intensive models by combining architectural simplicity, public availability, and modest computational requirements. Its accessible, open-source lightweight design lays the foundation for rapid integration into next-generation medical imaging tools that could transform LCS initiatives, allowing them to pivot from a singular focus on lung cancer detection to comprehensive respiratory disease management in high-risk populations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Depth Foundation Model: Recent Trends in Vision-Based Depth Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11540v1)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Depth estimation is a fundamental task in 3D computer vision, crucial for applications such as 3D reconstruction, free-viewpoint rendering, robotics, autonomous driving, and AR/VR technologies. Traditional methods relying on hardware sensors like LiDAR are often limited by high costs, low resolution, and environmental sensitivity, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. Recent advances in vision-based methods offer a promising alternative, yet they face challenges in generalization and stability due to either the low-capacity model architectures or the reliance on domain-specific and small-scale datasets. The emergence of scaling laws and foundation models in other domains has inspired the development of "depth foundation models": deep neural networks trained on large datasets with strong zero-shot generalization capabilities. This paper surveys the evolution of deep learning architectures and paradigms for depth estimation across the monocular, stereo, multi-view, and monocular video settings. We explore the potential of these models to address existing challenges and provide a comprehensive overview of large-scale datasets that can facilitate their development. By identifying key architectures and training strategies, we aim to highlight the path towards robust depth foundation models, offering insights into their future research and applications.</p></details> |  |

Although tools like ReExtractor+, RefactoringMiner, and RefDiff have been developed to detect refactorings automatically, they rely on complex rule definitions and static analysis, making them difficult to extend and generalize to other programming languages. In this paper, we investigate the viability of using foundation models for refactoring detection, implemented in a tool named RefModel. We evaluate Phi4-14B, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet on a dataset of 858 single-operation transformations applied to artificially generated Java programs, covering widely-used refactoring types. We also extend our evaluation by including Gemini 2.5 Pro and o4-mini-high, assessing their performance on 44 real-world refactorings extracted from four open-source projects. These models are compared against RefactoringMiner, RefDiff, and ReExtractor+. RefModel is competitive with, and in some cases outperform, traditional tools. In real-world settings, Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Gemini 2.5 Pro jointly identified 97% of all refactorings, surpassing the best-performing static-analysis-based tools. The models showed encouraging generalization to Python and Golang. They provide natural language explanations and require only a single sentence to define each refactoring type.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Brazilian Symposium on Software Engineering (SBES 2025)</p></details> |

This poses a serious threat to privacy as motion extraction from video and motion capture are increasingly used for a variety of applications, including mixed reality, robotics, medicine, and the quantified self. In order to protect the privacy of the tracked individuals, anonymization techniques that preserve the utility of the data are required. However, anonymizing motion data is a challenging task because there are many dependencies in motion sequences (such as physiological constraints) that, if ignored, make the anonymized motion sequence appear unnatural. In this paper, we propose Pantomime, a full-body anonymization technique for motion data, which uses foundation motion models to generate motion sequences that adhere to the dependencies in the data, thus keeping the utility of the anonymized data high. Our results show that Pantomime can maintain the naturalness of the motion sequences while reducing the identification accuracy to 10%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking the Foundations for Continual Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08161v3)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the traditional view of reinforcement learning, the agent's goal is to find an optimal policy that maximizes its expected sum of rewards. Once the agent finds this policy, the learning ends. This view contrasts with \emph{continual reinforcement learning}, where learning does not end, and agents are expected to continually learn and adapt indefinitely. Despite the clear distinction between these two paradigms of learning, much of the progress in continual reinforcement learning has been shaped by foundations rooted in the traditional view of reinforcement learning. In this paper, we first examine whether the foundations of traditional reinforcement learning are suitable for the continual reinforcement learning paradigm. We identify four key pillars of the traditional reinforcement learning foundations that are antithetical to the goals of continual learning: the Markov decision process formalism, the focus on atemporal artifacts, the expected sum of rewards as an evaluation metric, and episodic benchmark environments that embrace the other three foundations. We then propose a new formalism that sheds the first and the third foundations and replaces them with the history process as a mathematical formalism and a new definition of deviation regret, adapted for continual learning, as an evaluation metric. Finally, we discuss possible approaches to shed the other two foundations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Test-time Adaptation for Foundation Medical Segmentation Model without Parametric Updates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02008v2)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation medical segmentation models, with MedSAM being the most popular, have achieved promising performance across organs and lesions. However, MedSAM still suffers from compromised performance on specific lesions with intricate structures and appearance, as well as bounding box prompt-induced perturbations. Although current test-time adaptation (TTA) methods for medical image segmentation may tackle this issue, partial (e.g., batch normalization) or whole parametric updates restrict their effectiveness due to limited update signals or catastrophic forgetting in large models. Meanwhile, these approaches ignore the computational complexity during adaptation, which is particularly significant for modern foundation models. To this end, our theoretical analyses reveal that directly refining image embeddings is feasible to approach the same goal as parametric updates under the MedSAM architecture, which enables us to realize high computational efficiency and segmentation performance without the risk of catastrophic forgetting. Under this framework, we propose to encourage maximizing factorized conditional probabilities of the posterior prediction probability using a proposed distribution-approximated latent conditional random field loss combined with an entropy minimization loss. Experiments show that we achieve about 3\% Dice score improvements across three datasets while reducing computational complexity by over 7 times.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |

However, current structure-based scoring functions often lack generalizability across diverse biomolecular systems. We present BioScore, a foundational scoring function that addresses key challenges -- data sparsity, cross-system representation, and task compatibility -- through a dual-scale geometric graph learning framework with tailored modules for structure assessment and affinity prediction. BioScore supports a wide range of tasks, including affinity prediction, conformation ranking, and structure-based virtual screening. Evaluated on 16 benchmarks spanning proteins, nucleic acids, small molecules, and carbohydrates, BioScore consistently outperforms or matches 70 traditional and deep learning methods. Our newly proposed PPI Benchmark further enables comprehensive evaluation of protein-protein complex scoring. BioScore demonstrates broad applicability: (1) pretraining on mixed-structure data boosts protein-protein affinity prediction by up to 40% and antigen-antibody binding correlation by over 90%; (2) cross-system generalizability enables zero- and few-shot prediction with up to 71% correlation gain; and (3) its unified representation captures chemically challenging systems such as cyclic peptides, improving affinity prediction by over 60%. BioScore establishes a robust and generalizable framework for structural assessment across complex biomolecular landscapes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Are Vision Foundation Models Ready for Out-of-the-Box Medical Image Registration?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11569v1)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models, pre-trained on large image datasets and capable of capturing rich feature representations, have recently shown potential for zero-shot image registration. However, their performance has mostly been tested in the context of rigid or less complex structures, such as the brain or abdominal organs, and it remains unclear whether these models can handle more challenging, deformable anatomy. Breast MRI registration is particularly difficult due to significant anatomical variation between patients, deformation caused by patient positioning, and the presence of thin and complex internal structure of fibroglandular tissue, where accurate alignment is crucial. Whether foundation model-based registration algorithms can address this level of complexity remains an open question. In this study, we provide a comprehensive evaluation of foundation model-based registration algorithms for breast MRI. We assess five pre-trained encoders, including DINO-v2, SAM, MedSAM, SSLSAM, and MedCLIP, across four key breast registration tasks that capture variations in different years and dates, sequences, modalities, and patient disease status (lesion versus no lesion). Our results show that foundation model-based algorithms such as SAM outperform traditional registration baselines for overall breast alignment, especially under large domain shifts, but struggle with capturing fine details of fibroglandular tissue. Interestingly, additional pre-training or fine-tuning on medical or breast-specific images in MedSAM and SSLSAM, does not improve registration performance and may even decrease it in some cases. Further work is needed to understand how domain-specific training influences registration and to explore targeted strategies that improve both global alignment and fine structure accuracy. We also publicly release our code at \href{https://github.com/mazurowski-lab/Foundation-based-reg}{Github}.</p></details> | 3 figures, 9 pages |
| **[PhysiX: A Foundation Model for Physics Simulations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17774v2)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have achieved remarkable success across video, image, and language domains. By scaling up the number of parameters and training datasets, these models acquire generalizable world knowledge and often surpass task-specific approaches. However, such progress has yet to extend to the domain of physics simulation. A primary bottleneck is data scarcity: while millions of images, videos, and textual resources are readily available on the internet, the largest physics simulation datasets contain only tens of thousands of samples. This data limitation hinders the use of large models, as overfitting becomes a major concern. As a result, physics applications typically rely on small models, which struggle with long-range prediction due to limited context understanding. Additionally, unlike images, videos, or text-which typically exhibit fixed granularity-physics datasets often vary drastically in scale, amplifying the challenges of scaling up multitask training. We introduce PhysiX, the first large-scale foundation model for physics simulation. PhysiX is a 4.5B parameter autoregressive generative model. It uses a discrete tokenizer to encode physical processes at different scales into a sequence of discrete tokens, and employs an autoregressive next-token prediction objective to model such processes in the token space. To mitigate the rounding error in the discretization process, PhysiX incorporates a specialized refinement module. Through extensive experiments, we show that PhysiX effectively addresses the data bottleneck, outperforming task-specific baselines under comparable settings as well as the previous absolute state-of-the-art approaches on The Well benchmark. Our results indicate that knowledge learned from natural videos can be successfully transferred to physics simulation, and that joint training across diverse simulation tasks enables synergistic learning.</p></details> | 21 pages, 10 figures |

An Empirical Study on Information-Seeking QA over Scientific Papers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10787v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces MISS-QA, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the ability of models to interpret schematic diagrams within scientific literature. MISS-QA comprises 1,500 expert-annotated examples over 465 scientific papers. In this benchmark, models are tasked with interpreting schematic diagrams that illustrate research overviews and answering corresponding information-seeking questions based on the broader context of the paper. We assess the performance of 18 frontier multimodal foundation models, including o4-mini, Gemini-2.5-Flash, and Qwen2.5-VL. We reveal a significant performance gap between these models and human experts on MISS-QA. Our analysis of model performance on unanswerable questions and our detailed error analysis further highlight the strengths and limitations of current models, offering key insights to enhance models in comprehending multimodal scientific literature.</p></details> | ACL 2025 Findings |
| **[XGeM: A Multi-Prompt Foundation Model for Multimodal Medical Data Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04614v4)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The adoption of Artificial Intelligence in medical imaging holds great promise, yet it remains hindered by challenges such as data scarcity, privacy concerns, and the need for robust multimodal integration. While recent advances in generative modeling have enabled high-quality synthetic data generation, existing approaches are often limited to unimodal, unidirectional synthesis and therefore lack the ability to jointly synthesize multiple modalities while preserving clinical consistency. To address this challenge, we introduce XGeM, a 6.77-billion-parameter multimodal generative model designed to support flexible, any-to-any synthesis between medical data modalities. XGeM constructs a shared latent space via contrastive learning and introduces a novel Multi-Prompt Training strategy, enabling conditioning on arbitrary subsets of input modalities. This design allows the model to adapt to heterogeneous clinical inputs and generate multiple outputs jointly, preserving both semantic and structural coherence. We extensively validate XGeM: first we benchmark it against five competitors on the MIMIC-CXR dataset, a state-of-the-art dataset for multi-view Chest X-ray and radiological report generation. Secondly, we perform a Visual Turing Test with expert radiologists to assess the realism and clinical relevance of the generated data, ensuring alignment with real-world scenarios. Finally, we show how XGeM can support key medical data challenges such as anonymization, class imbalance, and data scarcity, underscoring its utility as a foundation model for medical data synthesis.

We propose FOCAL, a test-time, data-driven framework that achieves robust perception by leveraging internet-scale visual priors from foundation models. By generating and optimizing candidate transformations toward visually typical, "canonical" views, FOCAL enhances robustness without re-training or architectural changes. Our experiments demonstrate improved robustness of CLIP and SAM across challenging transformations, including 2D/3D rotations, illumination shifts (contrast and color), and day-night variations. We also highlight potential applications in active vision. Our approach challenges the assumption that transform-specific training is necessary, instead offering a scalable path to invariance.

| **[Mind the Gap: Aligning Vision Foundation Models to Image Feature Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10318v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging the vision foundation models has emerged as a mainstream paradigm that improves the performance of image feature matching. However, previous works have ignored the misalignment when introducing the foundation models into feature matching. The misalignment arises from the discrepancy between the foundation models focusing on single-image understanding and the cross-image understanding requirement of feature matching. Specifically, 1) the embeddings derived from commonly used foundation models exhibit discrepancies with the optimal embeddings required for feature matching; 2) lacking an effective mechanism to leverage the single-image understanding ability into cross-image understanding. A significant consequence of the misalignment is they struggle when addressing multi-instance feature matching problems. To address this, we introduce a simple but effective framework, called IMD (Image feature Matching with a pre-trained Diffusion model) with two parts: 1) Unlike the dominant solutions employing contrastive-learning based foundation models that emphasize global semantics, we integrate the generative-based diffusion models to effectively capture instance-level details. 2) We leverage the prompt mechanism in generative model as a natural tunnel, propose a novel cross-image interaction prompting module to facilitate bidirectional information interaction between image pairs. To more accurately measure the misalignment, we propose a new benchmark called IMIM, which focuses on multi-instance scenarios. Our proposed IMD establishes a new state-of-the-art in commonly evaluated benchmarks, and the superior improvement 12% in IMIM indicates our method efficiently mitigates the misalignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |

These models offer powerful capabilities in semantic understanding, high-level reasoning, and cross-modal generalization, enabling significant advances in perception, planning, control, and human-robot interaction. This critical review provides a structured synthesis of recent developments, categorizing applications across simulation-driven design, open-world execution, sim-to-real transfer, and adaptable robotics. Unlike existing surveys that emphasize isolated capabilities, this work highlights integrated, system-level strategies and evaluates their practical feasibility in real-world environments. Key enabling trends such as procedural scene generation, policy generalization, and multimodal reasoning are discussed alongside core bottlenecks, including limited embodiment, lack of multimodal data, safety risks, and computational constraints. Through this lens, this paper identifies both the architectural strengths and critical limitations of foundation model-based robotics, highlighting open challenges in real-time operation, grounding, resilience, and trust. The review concludes with a roadmap for future research aimed at bridging semantic reasoning and physical intelligence through more robust, interpretable, and embodied models.</p></details> |  |

While significant advances have been made in medical imaging, genetic biomarkers, and time series from electronic health records, the potential of foundation models for patient behavior monitoring through personal digital devices remains underexplored. The data generated by these devices are inherently heterogeneous, multisource, and often exhibit high rates of missing data, posing unique challenges. This paper introduces a novel foundation model based on a modified vector quantized variational autoencoder, specifically designed to process real-world data from smartphones and wearable devices. We leveraged the discrete latent representation of this model to effectively perform two downstream tasks, suicide risk assessment and emotional state prediction, on different held-out clinical cohorts without the need of fine-tuning. We also highlight the existence of a trade-off between discrete and continuous latent structures, suggesting that hybrid models may be optimal for balancing accuracy across various supervised and unsupervised tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages (32 with references and supplementary material).

| **[Reprogramming Vision Foundation Models for Spatio-Temporal Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11558v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have achieved remarkable success in natural language processing and computer vision, demonstrating strong capabilities in modeling complex patterns. While recent efforts have explored adapting large language models (LLMs) for time-series forecasting, LLMs primarily capture one-dimensional sequential dependencies and struggle to model the richer spatio-temporal (ST) correlations essential for accurate ST forecasting. In this paper, we present \textbf{ST-VFM}, a novel framework that systematically reprograms Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) for general-purpose spatio-temporal forecasting. While VFMs offer powerful spatial priors, two key challenges arise when applying them to ST tasks: (1) the lack of inherent temporal modeling capacity and (2) the modality gap between visual and ST data. To address these, ST-VFM adopts a \emph{dual-branch architecture} that integrates raw ST inputs with auxiliary ST flow inputs, where the flow encodes lightweight temporal difference signals interpretable as dynamic spatial cues. To effectively process these dual-branch inputs, ST-VFM introduces two dedicated reprogramming stages. The \emph{pre-VFM reprogramming} stage applies a Temporal-Aware Token Adapter to embed temporal context and align both branches into VFM-compatible feature spaces. The \emph{post-VFM reprogramming} stage introduces a Bilateral Cross-Prompt Coordination module, enabling dynamic interaction between branches through prompt-based conditioning, thus enriching joint representation learning without modifying the frozen VFM backbone. Extensive experiments on ten spatio-temporal datasets show that ST-VFM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating effectiveness and robustness across VFM backbones (e.g., DINO, CLIP, DEIT) and ablation studies, establishing it as a strong general framework for spatio-temporal forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Applying Large Language Models to Complement Single-Cell Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10039v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Single-cell foundation models such as scGPT represent a significant advancement in single-cell omics, with an ability to achieve state-of-the-art performance on various downstream biological tasks. However, these models are inherently limited in that a vast amount of information in biology exists as text, which they are unable to leverage. There have therefore been several recent works that propose the use of LLMs as an alternative to single-cell foundation models, achieving competitive results. However, there is little understanding of what factors drive this performance, along with a strong focus on using LLMs as an alternative, rather than complementary approach to single-cell foundation models. In this study, we therefore investigate what biological insights contribute toward the performance of LLMs when applied to single-cell data, and introduce scMPT; a model which leverages synergies between scGPT, and single-cell representations from LLMs that capture these insights. scMPT demonstrates stronger, more consistent performance than either of its component models, which frequently have large performance gaps between each other across datasets. We also experiment with alternate fusion methods, demonstrating the potential of combining specialized reasoning models with scGPT to improve performance. This study ultimately showcases the potential for LLMs to complement single-cell foundation models and drive improvements in single-cell analysis.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, we propose TolerantECG, a foundation model for ECG signals that is robust to noise and capable of functioning with arbitrary subsets of the standard 12-lead ECG. TolerantECG training combines contrastive and self-supervised learning frameworks to jointly learn ECG signal representations alongside their corresponding knowledge-retrieval-based text report descriptions and corrupted or lead-missing signals. Comprehensive benchmarking results demonstrate that TolerantECG consistently ranks as the best or second-best performer across various ECG signal conditions and class levels in the PTB-XL dataset, and achieves the highest performance on the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures.

However, the high noise level and limited task-specific data in non-invasive signals constrain decoding capabilities. Recently, the adoption of self-supervised pre-training is transforming the landscape of non-invasive BCI research, enabling the development of brain foundation models to capture generic neural representations from large-scale unlabeled electroencephalography (EEG) signals with substantial noises. However, despite these advances, the field currently lacks comprehensive, practical and extensible benchmarks to assess the utility of the public foundation models across diverse BCI tasks, hindering their widespread adoption. To address this challenge, we present AdaBrain-Bench, a large-scale standardized benchmark to systematically evaluate brain foundation models in widespread non-invasive BCI tasks. AdaBrain-Bench encompasses a diverse collection of representative BCI decoding datasets spanning 7 key applications. It introduces a streamlined task adaptation pipeline integrated with multi-dimensional evaluation metrics and a set of adaptation tools. The benchmark delivers an inclusive framework for assessing generalizability of brain foundation models across key transfer settings, including cross-subject, multi-subject, and few-shot scenarios. We leverage AdaBrain-Bench to evaluate a suite of publicly available brain foundation models and offer insights into practices for selecting appropriate models in various scenarios. We make our benchmark pipeline available to enable reproducible research and external use, offering a continuously evolving platform to foster progress toward robust and generalized neural decoding solutions.</p></details> |  |

Recent studies indicate that scaling-up and advanced design of the recommendation model can bring significant performance improvement. However, with a larger model scale, such prior studies have a significantly increasing gap from industry as they often neglect two fundamental challenges in industrial-scale applications. First, training and inference budgets are restricted for the model to be served, exceeding which may incur latency and impair user experience. Second, large-volume data arrive in a streaming mode with data distributions dynamically shifting, as new users/ads join and existing users/ads leave the system. We propose the External Large Foundation Model (ExFM) framework to address the overlooked challenges. Specifically, we develop external distillation and a data augmentation system (DAS) to control the computational cost of training/inference while maintaining high performance. We design the teacher in a way like a foundation model (FM) that can serve multiple students as vertical models (VMs) to amortize its building cost. We propose Auxiliary Head and Student Adapter to mitigate the data distribution gap between FM and VMs caused by the streaming data issue. Comprehensive experiments on internal industrial-scale applications and public datasets demonstrate significant performance gain by ExFM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the ACM Web Conference (WWW) 2025 Industrial Track as Oral Presentation</p></details> |

Traditional physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and finite-difference methods necessitate explicit mathematical formulation of governing equations, fundamentally limiting their generalizability and discovery potential. Our sketch-guided diffusion transformer approach reimagines computational physics by treating simulation as a conditional generation problem, where spatial boundary conditions guide the synthesis of physically accurate steady-state solutions. By leveraging enhanced diffusion transformer architectures with novel spatial relationship encoding, our model achieves direct boundary-to-equilibrium mapping and is generalizable to diverse physics domains. Unlike sequential time-stepping methods that accumulate errors over iterations, our approach bypasses temporal integration entirely, directly generating steady-state solutions with SSIM > 0.8 while maintaining sub-pixel boundary accuracy. Our data-informed approach enables physics discovery through learned representations analyzable via Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), revealing emergent physical relationships without predetermined mathematical constraints. This work represents a paradigm shift from AI-accelerated physics to AI-discovered physics, establishing the first truly universal physics simulation framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures.

While significant progress has been made in robotic manipulation, existing approaches often fall short in generalization to complex environmental variations and addressing memory-dependent tasks. To bridge this gap, we introduce SAM2Act, a multi-view robotic transformer-based policy that leverages multi-resolution upsampling with visual representations from large-scale foundation model. SAM2Act achieves a state-of-the-art average success rate of 86.8% across 18 tasks in the RLBench benchmark, and demonstrates robust generalization on The Colosseum benchmark, with only a 4.3% performance gap under diverse environmental perturbations. Building on this foundation, we propose SAM2Act+, a memory-based architecture inspired by SAM2, which incorporates a memory bank, an encoder, and an attention mechanism to enhance spatial memory. To address the need for evaluating memory-dependent tasks, we introduce MemoryBench, a novel benchmark designed to assess spatial memory and action recall in robotic manipulation. SAM2Act+ achieves an average success rate of 94.3% on memory-based tasks in MemoryBench, significantly outperforming existing approaches and pushing the boundaries of memory-based robotic systems.

| **[Oracular Programming: A Modular Foundation for Building LLM-Enabled Software](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05310v2)** | 2025-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models have proven surprisingly effective at solving a wide range of tasks from just a handful of examples. However, their lack of reliability and modularity limits their capacity to tackle large problems that require many steps of reasoning. In response, researchers have proposed advanced pipelines that leverage domain-specific knowledge to chain smaller prompts, provide intermediate feedback and improve performance through search. However, the current complexity of writing, tuning, maintaining and improving such pipelines has limited their sophistication. We propose oracular programming, a foundational paradigm for building LLM-enabled applications that lets domain experts express high-level problem-solving strategies as programs with unresolved choice points. These choice points are resolved at runtime by LLMs, which generalize from user-provided examples of correct and incorrect decisions. An oracular program is composed of three orthogonal components: a strategy that consists in a nondeterministic program with choice points that can be reified into a search tree, a policy that specifies how to navigate this tree with the help of LLM oracles, and a set of demonstrations that describe successful and unsuccessful search tree navigation scenarios across diverse problem instances. Each component is expressed in a dedicated programming language and can be independently improved or substituted. We address the key programming language design challenges of modularly composing oracular programs and enforcing consistency between their components as they evolve.</p></details> |  |
| **[Intelligent Orchestration of Distributed Large Foundation Model Inference at the Edge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03668v3)** | 2025-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Foundation Models (LFMs), including multi-modal and generative models, promise to unlock new capabilities for next-generation Edge AI applications. However, performing inference with LFMs in resource-constrained and heterogeneous edge environments, such as Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC), presents significant challenges for workload orchestration due to time-varying network, compute, and storage conditions. In particular, current split inference strategies, which partition LFM layers across nodes, are not designed to adapt to fluctuating workloads, dynamic bandwidth conditions, or evolving privacy constraints in high-utilization MEC environments. In this work, we propose a novel adaptive split inference orchestration framework that elevates both the placement and partitioning of LFM layers to runtime-tunable variables. Specifically, our framework enables real-time, quality-of-service (QoS)-aware management of inference workloads by extending conventional orchestrators with three key services: (1) Capacity-aware workload distribution, which continuously profiles node resources and selects an optimal subset of MEC nodes; (2) Dynamic partition migration, which transparently relocates pre-cut LFM segments in response to changes in utilization or network conditions; (3) Real-time reconfiguration, which dynamically re-splits LFM layers to balance latency, throughput, and privacy. We formalize the joint placement-partitioning problem, outline a reference architecture and algorithmic workflow, and discuss applicability in representative smart city, V2X, and industrial edge scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables, 52 references</p></details> |
| **[Pisces: An Auto-regressive Foundation Model for Image Understanding and Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10395v2)** | 2025-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled multimodal foundation models to tackle both image understanding and generation within a unified framework. Despite these gains, unified models often underperform compared to specialized models in either task. A key challenge in developing unified models lies in the inherent differences between the visual features needed for image understanding versus generation, as well as the distinct training processes required for each modality. In this work, we introduce Pisces, an auto-regressive multimodal foundation model that addresses this challenge through a novel decoupled visual encoding architecture and tailored training techniques optimized for multimodal generation. Combined with meticulous data curation, pretraining, and finetuning, Pisces achieves competitive performance in both image understanding and image generation. We evaluate Pisces on over 20 public benchmarks for image understanding, where it demonstrates strong performance across a wide range of tasks. Additionally, on GenEval, a widely adopted benchmark for image generation, Pisces exhibits robust generative capabilities. Our extensive analysis reveals the synergistic relationship between image understanding and generation, and the benefits of using separate visual encoders, advancing the field of unified multimodal models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Unifi...</summary><p>Unified image understanding and generation model</p></details> |
| **[TabDPT: Scaling Tabular Foundation Models on Real Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18164v2)** | 2025-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tabular data is one of the most ubiquitous sources of information worldwide, spanning a wide variety of domains. This inherent heterogeneity has slowed the development of Tabular Foundation Models (TFMs) capable of fast generalization to unseen datasets. In-Context Learning (ICL) has recently emerged as a promising solution for TFMs, enabling dynamic adaptation to new tasks without additional tuning. While many studies have attempted to re-purpose large language models for tabular ICL, they have had limited success, so recent works have focused on developing tabular-specific foundation models. In this work, we propose an approach to combine ICL-based retrieval with self supervised learning to train tabular foundation models. We also investigate the utility of real vs. synthetic data for model pre-training, and show that real data can contain useful signal not easily captured in synthetic training. Specifically, we show that incorporating real data during the pre-training phase can lead to significantly faster training and better downstream generalization to unseen data. Our resulting model, TabDPT, achieves top performance on both regression (CTR23) and classification (CC18) benchmarks. Importantly, we also demonstrate that with our pre-training procedure, scaling both model and data size leads to consistent performance improvements that follow power laws. This echoes scaling laws in LLMs and other foundation models, and suggests that Internet-scale TFMs can be achievable. We open-source our full pipeline: inference code including trained model weights can be found at github.com/layer6ai-labs/TabDPT-inference, and the training code to reproduce experiments can be found at github.com/layer6ai-labs/TabDPT-training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Infer...</summary><p>Inference repo: github.com/layer6ai-labs/TabDPT-inference; Training repo: github.com/layer6ai-labs/TabDPT-training</p></details> |
| **[Simplifying Traffic Anomaly Detection with Video Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09338v1)** | 2025-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent methods for ego-centric Traffic Anomaly Detection (TAD) often rely on complex multi-stage or multi-representation fusion architectures, yet it remains unclear whether such complexity is necessary. Recent findings in visual perception suggest that foundation models, enabled by advanced pre-training, allow simple yet flexible architectures to outperform specialized designs. Therefore, in this work, we investigate an architecturally simple encoder-only approach using plain Video Vision Transformers (Video ViTs) and study how pre-training enables strong TAD performance. We find that: (i) strong pre-training enables simple encoder-only models to match or even surpass the performance of specialized state-of-the-art TAD methods, while also being significantly more efficient; (ii) although weakly- and fully-supervised pre-training are advantageous on standard benchmarks, we find them less effective for TAD. Instead, self-supervised Masked Video Modeling (MVM) provides the strongest signal; and (iii) Domain-Adaptive Pre-Training (DAPT) on unlabeled driving videos further improves downstream performance, without requiring anomalous examples. Our findings highlight the importance of pre-training and show that effective, efficient, and scalable TAD models can be built with minimal architectural complexity. We release our code, domain-adapted encoders, and fine-tuned models to support future work: https://github.com/tue-mps/simple-tad.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCVW...</summary><p>ICCVW 2025 accepted.

| **[Online Long-term Point Tracking in the Foundation Model Era](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09217v1)** | 2025-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Point tracking aims to identify the same physical point across video frames and serves as a geometry-aware representation of motion. This representation supports a wide range of applications, from robotics to augmented reality, by enabling accurate modeling of dynamic environments. Most existing long-term tracking approaches operate in an offline setting, where future frames are available to refine predictions and recover from occlusions. However, real-world scenarios often demand online predictions: the model must operate causally, using only current and past frames. This constraint is critical in streaming video and embodied AI, where decisions must be made immediately based on past observations. Under such constraints, viewpoint invariance becomes essential. Visual foundation models, trained on diverse large-scale datasets, offer the potential for robust geometric representations. While they lack temporal reasoning on their own, they can be integrated into tracking pipelines to enrich spatial features. In this thesis, we address the problem of long-term point tracking in an online setting, where frames are processed sequentially without access to future information or sliding windows. We begin by evaluating the suitability of visual foundation models for this task and find that they can serve as useful initializations and be integrated into tracking pipelines. However, to enable long-term tracking in an online setting, a dedicated design is still required. In particular, maintaining coherence over time in this causal regime requires memory to propagate appearance and context across frames. To address this, we introduce Track-On, a transformer-based model that treats each tracked point as a query and processes video frames one at a time. Track-On sets a new state of the art across seven public benchmarks, demonstrating the feasibility of long-term tracking without future access.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2501.18487</p></details> |
