| **[Nonparametric inference for nonstationary spatial point processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17600v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Point pattern data often exhibit features such as abrupt changes, hotspots and spatially varying dependence in local intensity. Under a Poisson process framework, these correspond to discontinuities and nonstationarity in the underlying intensity function -- features that are difficult to capture with standard modeling approaches. This paper proposes a spatial Cox process model in which nonstationarity is induced through a random partition of the spatial domain, with conditionally independent Gaussian process priors specified across the resulting regions. This construction allows for heterogeneous spatial behavior, including sharp transitions in intensity. To ensure exact inference, a discretization-free MCMC algorithm is developed to target the infinite-dimensional posterior distribution without approximation. The random partition framework also reduces the computational burden typically associated with Gaussian process models. Spatial covariates can be incorporated to account for structured variation in intensity. The proposed methodology is evaluated through synthetic examples and real-world applications, demonstrating its ability to flexibly capture complex spatial structures. The paper concludes with a discussion of potential extensions and directions for future work.</p></details> |  |
| **[SToFM: a Multi-scale Foundation Model for Spatial Transcriptomics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11588v2)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) technologies provide biologists with rich insights into single-cell biology by preserving spatial context of cells. Building foundational models for ST can significantly enhance the analysis of vast and complex data sources, unlocking new perspectives on the intricacies of biological tissues. However, modeling ST data is inherently challenging due to the need to extract multi-scale information from tissue slices containing vast numbers of cells. This process requires integrating macro-scale tissue morphology, micro-scale cellular microenvironment, and gene-scale gene expression profile. To address this challenge, we propose SToFM, a multi-scale Spatial Transcriptomics Foundation Model. SToFM first performs multi-scale information extraction on each ST slice, to construct a set of ST sub-slices that aggregate macro-, micro- and gene-scale information. Then an SE(2) Transformer is used to obtain high-quality cell representations from the sub-slices. Additionally, we construct \textbf{SToCorpus-88M}, the largest high-resolution spatial transcriptomics corpus for pretraining. SToFM achieves outstanding performance on a variety of downstream tasks, such as tissue region semantic segmentation and cell type annotation, demonstrating its comprehensive understanding of ST data through capturing and integrating multi-scale information.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accpe...</summary><p>Accpeted by ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **[ISDrama: Immersive Spatial Drama Generation through Multimodal Prompting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20630v5)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal immersive spatial drama generation focuses on creating continuous multi-speaker binaural speech with dramatic prosody based on multimodal prompts, with potential applications in AR, VR, and others. This task requires simultaneous modeling of spatial information and dramatic prosody based on multimodal inputs, with high data collection costs. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first attempt to address these challenges. We construct MRSDrama, the first multimodal recorded spatial drama dataset, containing binaural drama audios, scripts, videos, geometric poses, and textual prompts. Then, we propose ISDrama, the first immersive spatial drama generation model through multimodal prompting. ISDrama comprises these primary components: 1) Multimodal Pose Encoder, based on contrastive learning, considering the Doppler effect caused by moving speakers to extract unified pose information from multimodal prompts. 2) Immersive Drama Transformer, a flow-based mamba-transformer model that generates high-quality drama, incorporating Drama-MOE to select proper experts for enhanced prosody and pose control. We also design a context-consistent classifier-free guidance strategy to coherently generate complete drama. Experimental results show that ISDrama outperforms baseline models on objective and subjective metrics. The demos are available at https://aaronz345.github.io/ISDramaDemo. We provide the dataset and the evaluation code at https://huggingface.co/datasets/AaronZ345/MRSDrama and https://github.com/AaronZ345/ISDrama.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM Multimedia 2025</p></details> |
| **[STQE: Spatial-Temporal Quality Enhancement for G-PCC Compressed Dynamic Point Clouds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17522v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Very few studies have addressed quality enhancement for compressed dynamic point clouds. In particular, the effective exploitation of spatial-temporal correlations between point cloud frames remains largely unexplored. Addressing this gap, we propose a spatial-temporal attribute quality enhancement (STQE) network that exploits both spatial and temporal correlations to improve the visual quality of G-PCC compressed dynamic point clouds. Our contributions include a recoloring-based motion compensation module that remaps reference attribute information to the current frame geometry to achieve precise inter-frame geometric alignment, a channel-aware temporal attention module that dynamically highlights relevant regions across bidirectional reference frames, a Gaussian-guided neighborhood feature aggregation module that efficiently captures spatial dependencies between geometry and color attributes, and a joint loss function based on the Pearson correlation coefficient, designed to alleviate over-smoothing effects typical of point-wise mean squared error optimization. When applied to the latest G-PCC test model, STQE achieved improvements of 0.855 dB, 0.682 dB, and 0.828 dB in delta PSNR, with Bj{\o}ntegaard Delta rate (BD-rate) reductions of -25.2%, -31.6%, and -32.5% for the Luma, Cb, and Cr components, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Spatial Diversity for Region-based Active Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17367v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-of-the-art methods for semantic segmentation are based on deep neural networks trained on large-scale labeled datasets. Acquiring such datasets would incur large annotation costs, especially for dense pixel-level prediction tasks like semantic segmentation. We consider region-based active learning as a strategy to reduce annotation costs while maintaining high performance. In this setting, batches of informative image regions instead of entire images are selected for labeling. Importantly, we propose that enforcing local spatial diversity is beneficial for active learning in this case, and to incorporate spatial diversity along with the traditional active selection criterion, e.g., data sample uncertainty, in a unified optimization framework for region-based active learning. We apply this framework to the Cityscapes and PASCAL VOC datasets and demonstrate that the inclusion of spatial diversity effectively improves the performance of uncertainty-based and feature diversity-based active learning methods. Our framework achieves $95\%$ performance of fully supervised methods with only $5-9\%$ of the labeled pixels, outperforming all state-of-the-art region-based active learning methods for semantic segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>publi...</summary><p>published in IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 2021</p></details> |
| **[SFNet: A Spatial-Frequency Domain Deep Learning Network for Efficient Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16267v2)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that predominantly affects the elderly population and currently has no cure. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), as a non-invasive imaging technique, is essential for the early diagnosis of AD. MRI inherently contains both spatial and frequency information, as raw signals are acquired in the frequency domain and reconstructed into spatial images via the Fourier transform. However, most existing AD diagnostic models extract features from a single domain, limiting their capacity to fully capture the complex neuroimaging characteristics of the disease. While some studies have combined spatial and frequency information, they are mostly confined to 2D MRI, leaving the potential of dual-domain analysis in 3D MRI unexplored. To overcome this limitation, we propose Spatio-Frequency Network (SFNet), the first end-to-end deep learning framework that simultaneously leverages spatial and frequency domain information to enhance 3D MRI-based AD diagnosis. SFNet integrates an enhanced dense convolutional network to extract local spatial features and a global frequency module to capture global frequency-domain representations. Additionally, a novel multi-scale attention module is proposed to further refine spatial feature extraction. Experiments on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset demonstrate that SFNet outperforms existing baselines and reduces computational overhead in classifying cognitively normal (CN) and AD, achieving an accuracy of 95.1%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial Frequency Modulation for Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11893v2)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High spatial frequency information, including fine details like textures, significantly contributes to the accuracy of semantic segmentation. However, according to the Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem, high-frequency components are vulnerable to aliasing or distortion when propagating through downsampling layers such as strided-convolution. Here, we propose a novel Spatial Frequency Modulation (SFM) that modulates high-frequency features to a lower frequency before downsampling and then demodulates them back during upsampling. Specifically, we implement modulation through adaptive resampling (ARS) and design a lightweight add-on that can densely sample the high-frequency areas to scale up the signal, thereby lowering its frequency in accordance with the Frequency Scaling Property. We also propose Multi-Scale Adaptive Upsampling (MSAU) to demodulate the modulated feature and recover high-frequency information through non-uniform upsampling This module further improves segmentation by explicitly exploiting information interaction between densely and sparsely resampled areas at multiple scales. Both modules can seamlessly integrate with various architectures, extending from convolutional neural networks to transformers. Feature visualization and analysis confirm that our method effectively alleviates aliasing while successfully retaining details after demodulation. Finally, we validate the broad applicability and effectiveness of SFM by extending it to image classification, adversarial robustness, instance segmentation, and panoptic segmentation tasks.

| **[Efficient Bayesian Inference for Spatial Point Patterns Using the Palm Likelihood](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17065v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bayesian inference for spatial point patterns is often hindered computationally by intractable likelihoods. In the frequentist literature, estimating equations utilizing pseudolikelihoods have long been used for simulation-free parameter estimation. One such pseudolikelihood based on the process of differences is known as the Palm likelihood. Utilizing notions of Bayesian composite likelihoods and generalized Bayesian inference, we develop a framework for the use of Palm likelihoods in a Bayesian context. Naive implementation of the Palm likelihood results in posterior undercoverage of model parameters. We propose two approaches to remedy this issue and calibrate the resulting posterior. Numerical simulations illustrate both the efficacy of the method in terms of statistical properties and the superiority in terms of computational efficiency when compared to classical Markov chain Monte Carlo. The method is then applied to the popular \textit{Beilschmiedia pendula Lauraceae} dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sparser2Sparse: Single-shot Sparser-to-Sparse Learning for Spatial Transcriptomics Imputation with Natural Image Co-learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16886v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial transcriptomics (ST) has revolutionized biomedical research by enabling high resolution gene expression profiling within tissues. However, the high cost and scarcity of high resolution ST data remain significant challenges. We present Single-shot Sparser-to-Sparse (S2S-ST), a novel framework for accurate ST imputation that requires only a single and low-cost sparsely sampled ST dataset alongside widely available natural images for co-training. Our approach integrates three key innovations: (1) a sparser-to-sparse self-supervised learning strategy that leverages intrinsic spatial patterns in ST data, (2) cross-domain co-learning with natural images to enhance feature representation, and (3) a Cascaded Data Consistent Imputation Network (CDCIN) that iteratively refines predictions while preserving sampled gene data fidelity. Extensive experiments on diverse tissue types, including breast cancer, liver, and lymphoid tissue, demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in imputation accuracy. By enabling robust ST reconstruction from sparse inputs, our framework significantly reduces reliance on costly high resolution data, facilitating potential broader adoption in biomedical research and clinical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 5 figure, under review</p></details> |
| **[A Partitioned Sparse Variational Gaussian Process for Fast, Distributed Spatial Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16771v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The next generation of Department of Energy supercomputers will be capable of exascale computation. For these machines, far more computation will be possible than that which can be saved to disk. As a result, users will be unable to rely on post-hoc access to data for uncertainty quantification and other statistical analyses and there will be an urgent need for sophisticated machine learning algorithms which can be trained in situ. Algorithms deployed in this setting must be highly scalable, memory efficient and capable of handling data which is distributed across nodes as spatially contiguous partitions. One suitable approach involves fitting a sparse variational Gaussian process (SVGP) model independently and in parallel to each spatial partition. The resulting model is scalable, efficient and generally accurate, but produces the undesirable effect of constructing discontinuous response surfaces due to the disagreement between neighboring models at their shared boundary. In this paper, we extend this idea by allowing for a small amount of communication between neighboring spatial partitions which encourages better alignment of the local models, leading to smoother spatial predictions and a better fit in general. Due to our decentralized communication scheme, the proposed extension remains highly scalable and adds very little overhead in terms of computation (and none, in terms of memory). We demonstrate this Partitioned SVGP (PSVGP) approach for the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) and compare the results to the independent SVGP case.</p></details> |  |
| **[SALM: Spatial Audio Language Model with Structured Embeddings for Understanding and Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16724v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial audio understanding is essential for accurately perceiving and interpreting acoustic environments. However, existing audio-language models struggle with processing spatial audio and perceiving spatial acoustic scenes. We introduce the Spatial Audio Language Model (SALM), a novel framework that bridges spatial audio and language via multi-modal contrastive learning. SALM consists of a text encoder and a dual-branch audio encoder, decomposing spatial sound into semantic and spatial components through structured audio embeddings. Key features of SALM include seamless alignment of spatial and text representations, separate and joint extraction of spatial and semantic information, zero-shot direction classification and robust support for spatial audio editing. Experimental results demonstrate that SALM effectively captures and aligns cross-modal representations. Furthermore, it supports advanced editing capabilities, such as altering directional audio using text-based embeddings.</p></details> | 5 pages, 1 figure |
| **[CTSL: Codebook-based Temporal-Spatial Learning for Accurate Non-Contrast Cardiac Risk Prediction Using Cine MRIs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16612v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and contrast-free Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE) prediction from Cine MRI sequences remains a critical challenge. Existing methods typically necessitate supervised learning based on human-refined masks in the ventricular myocardium, which become impractical without contrast agents. We introduce a self-supervised framework, namely Codebook-based Temporal-Spatial Learning (CTSL), that learns dynamic, spatiotemporal representations from raw Cine data without requiring segmentation masks. CTSL decouples temporal and spatial features through a multi-view distillation strategy, where the teacher model processes multiple Cine views, and the student model learns from reduced-dimensional Cine-SA sequences. By leveraging codebook-based feature representations and dynamic lesion self-detection through motion cues, CTSL captures intricate temporal dependencies and motion patterns. High-confidence MACE risk predictions are achieved through our model, providing a rapid, non-invasive solution for cardiac risk assessment that outperforms traditional contrast-dependent methods, thereby enabling timely and accessible heart disease diagnosis in clinical settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at MICCAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Spatial 3D-LLM: Exploring Spatial Awareness in 3D Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16524v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>New era has unlocked exciting possibilities for extending Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle 3D vision-language tasks. However, most existing 3D multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) rely on compressing holistic 3D scene information or segmenting independent objects to perform these tasks, which limits their spatial awareness due to insufficient representation of the richness inherent in 3D scenes. To overcome these limitations, we propose Spatial 3D-LLM, a 3D MLLM specifically designed to enhance spatial awareness for 3D vision-language tasks by enriching the spatial embeddings of 3D scenes. Spatial 3D-LLM integrates an LLM backbone with a progressive spatial awareness scheme that progressively captures spatial information as the perception field expands, generating location-enriched 3D scene embeddings to serve as visual prompts. Furthermore, we introduce two novel tasks: 3D object distance measurement and 3D layout editing, and construct a 3D instruction dataset, MODEL, to evaluate the model's spatial awareness capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that Spatial 3D-LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of 3D vision-language tasks, revealing the improvements stemmed from our progressive spatial awareness scheme of mining more profound spatial information. Our code is available at https://github.com/bjshuyuan/Spatial-3D-LLM.</p></details> | Accepted by ICME2025 |
| **[Multivariate spatial models for small area estimation of species-specific forest inventory parameters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07118v2)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>National Forest Inventories (NFIs) provide statistically reliable information on forest resources at national and other large spatial scales. As forest management and conservation needs become increasingly complex, NFIs are being called upon to provide forest parameter estimates at spatial scales smaller than current design-based estimation procedures can provide. This is particularly true when estimates are desired by species or species groups. Here we propose a multivariate spatial model for small area estimation of species-specific forest inventory parameters. The hierarchical Bayesian modeling framework accounts for key complexities in species-specific forest inventory data, such as zero-inflation, correlations among species, and residual spatial autocorrelation. Importantly, by fitting the model directly to the individual plot-level data, the framework enables estimates of species-level forest parameters, with associated uncertainty, across any user-defined small area of interest. A simulation study revealed minimal bias and higher accuracy of the proposed model-based approach compared to design-based estimator. We applied the model to estimate species-specific county-level aboveground biomass for the 20 most abundant tree species in the southern United States using Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data. Model-based biomass estimates had high correlations with design-based estimates, yet the model-based estimates tended to have a slight positive bias relative to design-based estimates. Importantly, the proposed model provided large gains in precision across all 20 species. On average across species, 91.5% of county-level biomass estimates had higher precision compared to the design-based estimates. The proposed framework improves the ability of NFI data users to generate species-level forest parameter estimates with reasonable precision at management-relevant spatial scales.</p></details> | 40 pages, 7 figures |
| **[A Bayesian Geoadditive Model for Spatial Disaggregation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16376v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel Bayesian spatial disaggregation model for count data, providing fast and flexible inference at high resolution. First, it incorporates non-linear covariate effects using penalized splines, a flexible approach that is not typically included in existing spatial disaggregation methods. Additionally, it employs a spline-based low-rank kriging approximation for modeling spatial dependencies. The use of Laplace approximation provides computational advantages over traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approaches, facilitating scalability to large datasets. We explore two estimation strategies: one using the exact likelihood and another leveraging a spatially discrete approximation for enhanced computational efficiency. Simulation studies demonstrate that both methods perform well, with the approximate method offering significant computational gains. We illustrate the applicability of our model by disaggregating disease rates in the United Kingdom and Belgium, showcasing its potential for generating high-resolution risk maps. By combining flexibility in covariate modeling, computational efficiency and ease of implementation, our approach offers a practical and effective framework for spatial disaggregation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Micromobility Flow Prediction: A Bike Sharing Station-level Study via Multi-level Spatial-Temporal Attention Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16020v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient use of urban micromobility resources such as bike sharing is challenging due to the unbalanced station-level demand and supply, which causes the maintenance of the bike sharing systems painstaking. Prior efforts have been made on accurate prediction of bike traffics, i.e., demand/pick-up and return/drop-off, to achieve system efficiency. However, bike station-level traffic prediction is difficult because of the spatial-temporal complexity of bike sharing systems. Moreover, such level of prediction over entire bike sharing systems is also challenging due to the large number of bike stations. To fill this gap, we propose BikeMAN, a multi-level spatio-temporal attention neural network to predict station-level bike traffic for entire bike sharing systems. The proposed network consists of an encoder and a decoder with an attention mechanism representing the spatial correlation between features of bike stations in the system and another attention mechanism describing the temporal characteristic of bike station traffic. Through experimental study on over 10 millions trips of bike sharing systems (> 700 stations) of New York City, our network showed high accuracy in predicting the bike station traffic of all stations in the city.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, UrbComp 2024</p></details> |
| **[A Practical Investigation of Spatially-Controlled Image Generation with Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15724v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enabling image generation models to be spatially controlled is an important area of research, empowering users to better generate images according to their own fine-grained specifications via e.g. edge maps, poses. Although this task has seen impressive improvements in recent times, a focus on rapidly producing stronger models has come at the cost of detailed and fair scientific comparison. Differing training data, model architectures and generation paradigms make it difficult to disentangle the factors contributing to performance. Meanwhile, the motivations and nuances of certain approaches become lost in the literature. In this work, we aim to provide clear takeaways across generation paradigms for practitioners wishing to develop transformer-based systems for spatially-controlled generation, clarifying the literature and addressing knowledge gaps. We perform controlled experiments on ImageNet across diffusion-based/flow-based and autoregressive (AR) models. First, we establish control token prefilling as a simple, general and performant baseline approach for transformers. We then investigate previously underexplored sampling time enhancements, showing that extending classifier-free guidance to control, as well as softmax truncation, have a strong impact on control-generation consistency. Finally, we re-clarify the motivation of adapter-based approaches, demonstrating that they mitigate "forgetting" and maintain generation quality when trained on limited downstream data, but underperform full training in terms of generation-control consistency. Code will be released upon publication.</p></details> | preprint |
| **[Continuous sPatial-Temporal Deformable Image Registration (CPT-DIR) for motion modelling in radiotherapy: beyond classic voxel-based methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00430v2)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deformable image registration (DIR) is a crucial tool in radiotherapy for analyzing anatomical changes and motion patterns. Current DIR implementations rely on discrete volumetric motion representation, which often leads to compromised accuracy and uncertainty when handling significant anatomical changes and sliding boundaries. This limitation affects the reliability of subsequent contour propagation and dose accumulation procedures, particularly in regions with complex anatomical interfaces such as the lung-chest wall boundary. Given that organ motion is inherently a continuous process in both space and time, we aimed to develop a model that preserves these fundamental properties. Drawing inspiration from fluid mechanics, we propose a novel approach using implicit neural representation (INR) for continuous modeling of patient anatomical motion. This approach ensures spatial and temporal continuity while effectively unifying Eulerian and Lagrangian specifications to enable natural continuous motion modeling and frame interpolation. The integration of these specifications provides a more comprehensive understanding of anatomical deformation patterns. By leveraging the continuous representations, the CPT-DIR method significantly enhances registration and interpolation accuracy, automation, and speed. The method demonstrates superior performance in landmark and contour precision, particularly in challenging anatomical regions, representing a substantial advancement over conventional approaches in deformable image registration. The improved efficiency and accuracy of CPT-DIR make it particularly suitable for real-time adaptive radiotherapy applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[SAIGFormer: A Spatially-Adaptive Illumination-Guided Network for Low-Light Image Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15520v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent Transformer-based low-light enhancement methods have made promising progress in recovering global illumination. However, they still struggle with non-uniform lighting scenarios, such as backlit and shadow, appearing as over-exposure or inadequate brightness restoration. To address this challenge, we present a Spatially-Adaptive Illumination-Guided Transformer (SAIGFormer) framework that enables accurate illumination restoration. Specifically, we propose a dynamic integral image representation to model the spatially-varying illumination, and further construct a novel Spatially-Adaptive Integral Illumination Estimator ($\text{SAI}^2\text{E}$). Moreover, we introduce an Illumination-Guided Multi-head Self-Attention (IG-MSA) mechanism, which leverages the illumination to calibrate the lightness-relevant features toward visual-pleased illumination enhancement. Extensive experiments on five standard low-light datasets and a cross-domain benchmark (LOL-Blur) demonstrate that our SAIGFormer significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative metrics. In particular, our method achieves superior performance in non-uniform illumination enhancement while exhibiting strong generalization capabilities across multiple datasets.

| **[Revisiting the Effect of Grid-Following Converter on Frequency Dynamics -- Part II: Spatial Variation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15362v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Besides the center of inertia (COI) frequency dynamics addressed in Part I, the spatial frequency variation in power systems with grid-following (GFL) converters is also crucial. Part II revisits the effect of GFLs on frequency spatial variation. Leveraging the interfacing state variables and equivalent frequency defined in Part I, an extended frequency divider (FD) formula is proposed. The linearized mapping relationship between network node frequency and synchronous generator (SG) rotor frequency, as well as GFL equivalent frequency, is modeled. The superposition contribution from GFLs is determined by the electrical distance between the generator and the frequency observation node, as well as the system power flow conditions. Additionally, the frequency mapping for branch currents, which is overlooked in previous research, is addressed. Simulation results validate the accuracy of the proposed extended FD formula. They quantitatively demonstrate that the superposition contribution of GFLs to node frequency is relatively weak and that the superposition coefficient is time-varying. The branch frequency superposition reveals a complex and distinctly different pattern.</p></details> |  |
| **[Few-Shot Object Detection via Spatial-Channel State Space Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15308v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the limited training samples in few-shot object detection (FSOD), we observe that current methods may struggle to accurately extract effective features from each channel. Specifically, this issue manifests in two aspects: i) channels with high weights may not necessarily be effective, and ii) channels with low weights may still hold significant value. To handle this problem, we consider utilizing the inter-channel correlation to facilitate the novel model's adaptation process to novel conditions, ensuring the model can correctly highlight effective channels and rectify those incorrect ones. Since the channel sequence is also 1-dimensional, its similarity with the temporal sequence inspires us to take Mamba for modeling the correlation in the channel sequence. Based on this concept, we propose a Spatial-Channel State Space Modeling (SCSM) module for spatial-channel state modeling, which highlights the effective patterns and rectifies those ineffective ones in feature channels. In SCSM, we design the Spatial Feature Modeling (SFM) module to balance the learning of spatial relationships and channel relationships, and then introduce the Channel State Modeling (CSM) module based on Mamba to learn correlation in channels. Extensive experiments on the VOC and COCO datasets show that the SCSM module enables the novel detector to improve the quality of focused feature representation in channels and achieve state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Spatial Context for Positive Pair Sampling in Histopathology Image Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05170v2)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has shown strong potential in cancer classification from whole-slide images (WSIs), but the need for extensive expert annotations often limits its success. Annotation-free approaches, such as multiple instance learning (MIL) and self-supervised learning (SSL), have emerged as promising alternatives to traditional annotation-based methods. However, conventional SSL methods typically rely on synthetic data augmentations, which may fail to capture the spatial structure critical to histopathology. In this work, we propose a spatial context-driven positive pair sampling strategy that enhances SSL by leveraging the morphological coherence of spatially adjacent patches within WSIs. Our method is modular and compatible with established joint embedding SSL frameworks, including Barlow Twins, BYOL, VICReg, and DINOv2. We evaluate its effectiveness on both slide-level classification using MIL and patch-level linear probing. Experiments across four datasets demonstrate consistent performance improvements, with accuracy gains of 5\% to 10\% compared to standard augmentation-based sampling. These findings highlight the value of spatial context in improving representation learning for computational pathology and provide a biologically meaningful enhancement for pretraining models in annotation-limited settings. The code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/contextual-pairs-E72F/.</p></details> |  |
| **[Event-based Graph Representation with Spatial and Motion Vectors for Asynchronous Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15150v1)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event-based sensors offer high temporal resolution and low latency by generating sparse, asynchronous data. However, converting this irregular data into dense tensors for use in standard neural networks diminishes these inherent advantages, motivating research into graph representations. While such methods preserve sparsity and support asynchronous inference, their performance on downstream tasks remains limited due to suboptimal modeling of spatiotemporal dynamics. In this work, we propose a novel spatiotemporal multigraph representation to better capture spatial structure and temporal changes. Our approach constructs two decoupled graphs: a spatial graph leveraging B-spline basis functions to model global structure, and a temporal graph utilizing motion vector-based attention for local dynamic changes. This design enables the use of efficient 2D kernels in place of computationally expensive 3D kernels. We evaluate our method on the Gen1 automotive and eTraM datasets for event-based object detection, achieving over a 6% improvement in detection accuracy compared to previous graph-based works, with a 5x speedup, reduced parameter count, and no increase in computational cost. These results highlight the effectiveness of structured graph modeling for asynchronous vision. Project page: eventbasedvision.github.io/eGSMV.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial Dependencies in Item Response Theory: Gaussian Process Priors for Geographic and Cognitive Measurement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09824v2)** | 2025-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Measurement validity in Item Response Theory depends on appropriately modeling dependencies between items when these reflect meaningful theoretical structures rather than random measurement error. In ecological assessment, citizen scientists identifying species across geographic regions exhibit systematic spatial patterns in task difficulty due to environmental factors. Similarly, in Author Recognition Tests, literary knowledge organizes by genre, where familiarity with science fiction authors systematically predicts recognition of other science fiction authors. Current spatial Item Response Theory methods, represented by the 1PLUS, 2PLUS, and 3PLUS model family, address these dependencies but remain limited by (1) binary response restrictions, and (2) conditional autoregressive priors that impose rigid local correlation assumptions, preventing effective modeling of complex spatial relationships. Our proposed method, Spatial Gaussian Process Item Response Theory (SGP-IRT), addresses these limitations by replacing conditional autoregressive priors with flexible Gaussian process priors that adapt to complex dependency structures while maintaining principled uncertainty quantification. SGP-IRT accommodates polytomous responses and models spatial dependencies in both geographic and abstract cognitive spaces, where items cluster by theoretical constructs rather than physical proximity. Simulation studies demonstrate improved parameter recovery, particularly for item difficulty estimation. Empirical applications show enhanced recovery of meaningful difficulty surfaces and improved measurement precision across psychological, educational, and ecological research applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 6 figures, 1 table.

| **[Spatial-Temporal Transformer with Curriculum Learning for EEG-Based Emotion Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14698v1)** | 2025-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>EEG-based emotion recognition plays an important role in developing adaptive brain-computer communication systems, yet faces two fundamental challenges in practical implementations: (1) effective integration of non-stationary spatial-temporal neural patterns, (2) robust adaptation to dynamic emotional intensity variations in real-world scenarios. This paper proposes SST-CL, a novel framework integrating spatial-temporal transformers with curriculum learning. Our method introduces two core components: a spatial encoder that models inter-channel relationships and a temporal encoder that captures multi-scale dependencies through windowed attention mechanisms, enabling simultaneous extraction of spatial correlations and temporal dynamics from EEG signals. Complementing this architecture, an intensity-aware curriculum learning strategy progressively guides training from high-intensity to low-intensity emotional states through dynamic sample scheduling based on a dual difficulty assessment. Comprehensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across various emotional intensity levels, with ablation studies confirming the necessity of both architectural components and the curriculum learning mechanism.</p></details> |  |

Transfer learning offers a promising solution by leveraging information from regions or domains with similar spatial spillover effects to improve the analysis of the target data. In this paper, we propose a parameter-transfer approach based on Mallows model averaging for spatial autoregressive models to improve the prediction accuracy. Our approach does not require sharing multi-source spatial data and can be combined with various parameter estimation methods, such as the maximum likelihood and the two-stage least squares. Theoretical analyses demonstrate that our method achieves asymptotic optimality and ensures weight convergence with an explicit convergence rate. Simulation studies and the application of infection count prediction in Africa further demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |

A Comparative Study of AR See-Through vs. 2D Minimap](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14316v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In high-stakes, time-critical scenarios-such as emergency evacuation, first responder prioritization, and crisis management -- decision-makers must rapidly choose among spatial targets, such as exits, individuals to assist, or areas to secure. Advances in indoor sensing and artificial intelligence (AI) can support these decisions by visualizing real-time situational data and AI suggestions on 2D maps. However, mentally mapping this information onto real-world spaces imposes significant cognitive load. This load can impair users' ability to appropriately judge AI suggestions, leading to inappropriate reliance (e.g., accepting wrong AI suggestions or rejecting correct ones). Embedded visualizations in Augmented Reality (AR), by directly overlaying information onto physical environments, may reduce this load and foster more deliberate, appropriate reliance on AI. But is this true? In this work, we conducted an empirical study (N = 32) comparing AR see-through (embedded visualization) and 2D Minimap in time-critical, AI-assisted spatial target selection tasks. Contrary to our expectations, users exhibited greater inappropriate reliance on AI in the AR condition. Our analysis further reveals that this is primarily due to over-reliance, with factors specific to embedded visualizations, such as perceptual challenges, visual proximity illusions, and highly realistic visual representations. Nonetheless, embedded visualizations demonstrated notable benefits in spatial reasoning, such as spatial mapping and egocentric spatial imagery. We conclude by discussing the empirical insights, deriving design implications, and outlining important directions for future research on human-AI decision collaboration in AR.</p></details> |  |

Additionally, we present, for the first time, a constructive algorithm based on the Moser-Tardos algorithm that ensures predictable performance. Furthermore, leveraging the properties of LLL-distribution and M-T-distribution, we establish the dependencies among the harmful structures during the construction process. We provide upper bounds on the probability change of remaining harmful structures after eliminating some of them. In particular, the elimination of 4-cycles increases the probability of 6-cycles becoming active by at most a factor of $e^{8/3}$.</p></details> | Accepted by ITW2025 |
| **[Learning Deformable Body Interactions With Adaptive Spatial Tokenization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13707v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulating interactions between deformable bodies is vital in fields like material science, mechanical design, and robotics. While learning-based methods with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are effective at solving complex physical systems, they encounter scalability issues when modeling deformable body interactions. To model interactions between objects, pairwise global edges have to be created dynamically, which is computationally intensive and impractical for large-scale meshes. To overcome these challenges, drawing on insights from geometric representations, we propose an Adaptive Spatial Tokenization (AST) method for efficient representation of physical states. By dividing the simulation space into a grid of cells and mapping unstructured meshes onto this structured grid, our approach naturally groups adjacent mesh nodes. We then apply a cross-attention module to map the sparse cells into a compact, fixed-length embedding, serving as tokens for the entire physical state. Self-attention modules are employed to predict the next state over these tokens in latent space. This framework leverages the efficiency of tokenization and the expressive power of attention mechanisms to achieve accurate and scalable simulation results. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in modeling deformable body interactions. Notably, it remains effective on large-scale simulations with meshes exceeding 100,000 nodes, where existing methods are hindered by computational limitations. Additionally, we contribute a novel large-scale dataset encompassing a wide range of deformable body interactions to support future research in this area.</p></details> | 21 pages, 15 figures |

TUI success will depend on how well they exploit spatiality, the intuitive spatial skills humans have with the objects they use. In this paper we carefully examine the relationship between humans and physical objects, and related previous research. From this examination we distill a set of observations, and turn these into heuristics for incorporation of spatiality into TUI application design, a cornerstone for their success. Following this line of thought, we identify spatial TUIs, the subset of TUIs that mediate interaction with shape, space and structure. We then examine several existing spatial TUIs using our heuristics.</p></details> |  |

While MLLMs have been extensively studied for visual semantic understanding tasks, their ability to perform precise and quantitative spatial-temporal understanding in real-world applications remains largely unexamined, leading to uncertain prospects. To evaluate models' Spatial-Temporal Intelligence, we introduce STI-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' spatial-temporal understanding through challenging tasks such as estimating and predicting the appearance, pose, displacement, and motion of objects. Our benchmark encompasses a wide range of robot and vehicle operations across desktop, indoor, and outdoor scenarios. The extensive experiments reveals that the state-of-the-art MLLMs still struggle in real-world spatial-temporal understanding, especially in tasks requiring precise distance estimation and motion analysis.</p></details> |  |

Despite this progress, the field lacks a comprehensive synthesis of current methodologies, dataset usage, evaluation metrics, and industrial applicability. This paper presents a systematic literature review of transformer-based spatial grounding approaches from 2018 to 2025. Our analysis identifies dominant model architectures, prevalent datasets, and widely adopted evaluation metrics, alongside highlighting key methodological trends and best practices. This study provides essential insights and structured guidance for researchers and practitioners, facilitating the development of robust, reliable, and industry-ready transformer-based spatial grounding models.</p></details> |  |
| **[STF: Spatial Temporal Fusion for Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18149v2)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is a challenging task that aims to predict the future trajectory of vehicles or pedestrians over a short time horizon based on their historical positions. The main reason is that the trajectory is a kind of complex data, including spatial and temporal information, which is crucial for accurate prediction. Intuitively, the more information the model can capture, the more precise the future trajectory can be predicted. However, previous works based on deep learning methods processed spatial and temporal information separately, leading to inadequate spatial information capture, which means they failed to capture the complete spatial information. Therefore, it is of significance to capture information more fully and effectively on vehicle interactions. In this study, we introduced an integrated 3D graph that incorporates both spatial and temporal edges. Based on this, we proposed the integrated 3D graph, which considers the cross-time interaction information. In specific, we design a Spatial-Temporal Fusion (STF) model including Multi-layer perceptions (MLP) and Graph Attention (GAT) to capture the spatial and temporal information historical trajectories simultaneously on the 3D graph. Our experiment on the ApolloScape Trajectory Datasets shows that the proposed STF outperforms several baseline methods, especially on the long-time-horizon trajectory prediction.</p></details> | 6 pages, 6 figures |

This paper presents FORTRESS (Function-composition Optimized Real-Time Resilient Structural Segmentation), a new architecture that balances accuracy and speed by using a special method that combines depthwise separable convolutions with adaptive Kolmogorov-Arnold Network integration. FORTRESS incorporates three key innovations: a systematic depthwise separable convolution framework achieving a 3.6x parameter reduction per layer, adaptive TiKAN integration that selectively applies function composition transformations only when computationally beneficial, and multi-scale attention fusion combining spatial, channel, and KAN-enhanced features across decoder levels. The architecture achieves remarkable efficiency gains with 91% parameter reduction (31M to 2.9M), 91% computational complexity reduction (13.7 to 1.17 GFLOPs), and 3x inference speed improvement while delivering superior segmentation performance. Evaluation on benchmark infrastructure datasets demonstrates state-of-the-art results with an F1- score of 0.771 and a mean IoU of 0.677, significantly outperforming existing methods including U-Net, SA-UNet, and U- KAN. The dual optimization strategy proves essential for optimal performance, establishing FORTRESS as a robust solution for practical structural defect segmentation in resource-constrained environments where both accuracy and computational efficiency are paramount.

| **[MindJourney: Test-Time Scaling with World Models for Spatial Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12508v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial reasoning in 3D space is central to human cognition and indispensable for embodied tasks such as navigation and manipulation. However, state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) struggle frequently with tasks as simple as anticipating how a scene will look after an egocentric motion: they perceive 2D images but lack an internal model of 3D dynamics. We therefore propose MindJourney, a test-time scaling framework that grants a VLM with this missing capability by coupling it to a controllable world model based on video diffusion. The VLM iteratively sketches a concise camera trajectory, while the world model synthesizes the corresponding view at each step. The VLM then reasons over this multi-view evidence gathered during the interactive exploration. Without any fine-tuning, our MindJourney achieves over an average 8% performance boost on the representative spatial reasoning benchmark SAT, showing that pairing VLMs with world models for test-time scaling offers a simple, plug-and-play route to robust 3D reasoning. Meanwhile, our method also improves upon the test-time inference VLMs trained through reinforcement learning, which demonstrates the potential of our method that utilizes world models for test-time scaling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://umass-embodied-agi.github.io/MindJourney</p></details> |
| **[Spontaneous Spatial Cognition Emerges during Egocentric Video Viewing through Non-invasive BCI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12417v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans possess a remarkable capacity for spatial cognition, allowing for self-localization even in novel or unfamiliar environments. While hippocampal neurons encoding position and orientation are well documented, the large-scale neural dynamics supporting spatial representation, particularly during naturalistic, passive experience, remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that non-invasive brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) based on electroencephalography (EEG) can decode spontaneous, fine-grained egocentric 6D pose, comprising three-dimensional position and orientation, during passive viewing of egocentric video. Despite EEG's limited spatial resolution and high signal noise, we find that spatially coherent visual input (i.e., continuous and structured motion) reliably evokes decodable spatial representations, aligning with participants' subjective sense of spatial engagement. Decoding performance further improves when visual input is presented at a frame rate of 100 ms per image, suggesting alignment with intrinsic neural temporal dynamics. Using gradient-based backpropagation through a neural decoding model, we identify distinct EEG channels contributing to position -- and orientation specific -- components, revealing a distributed yet complementary neural encoding scheme. These findings indicate that the brain's spatial systems operate spontaneously and continuously, even under passive conditions, challenging traditional distinctions between active and passive spatial cognition. Our results offer a non-invasive window into the automatic construction of egocentric spatial maps and advance our understanding of how the human mind transforms everyday sensory experience into structured internal representations.</p></details> |  |

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in general reasoning, their effectiveness in spatial strategic reasoning, which is critical for complex and fully observable board games, remains insufficiently explored. In this work, we adopt Chinese Chess (Xiangqi) as a challenging and rich testbed due to its intricate rules and spatial complexity. To advance LLMs' strategic competence in such environments, we propose a training framework tailored to Xiangqi, built upon a large-scale dataset of five million board-move pairs enhanced with expert annotations and engine evaluations. Building on this foundation, we introduce Xiangqi-R1, a 7B-parameter model trained in multi-stage manner: (1) fine-tuning for legal move prediction to capture basic spatial rules, (2) incorporating strategic annotations to improve decision-making, and (3) applying reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with multi-dimensional reward signals to enhance reasoning stability. Our Experimental results indicate that, despite their size and power, general-purpose LLMs struggle to achieve satisfactory performance in these tasks. Compared to general-purpose LLMs, Xiangqi-R1 greatly advances with an 18% rise in move legality and a 22% boost in analysis accuracy. Our results point to a promising path for creating general strategic intelligence in spatially complex areas.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |

Aiming to achieve minimal speech distortion, a hard constraint has been used in previous work in the optimization problem to compute the control filter. In this work, we propose a soft-constrained SSANC system that uses a frequency-independent parameter to trade off between speech distortion and noise reduction. We derive both time- and frequency-domain formulations, and show that conventional active noise control and hard-constrained SSANC represent two limiting cases of the proposed design. We evaluate the system through simulations using a pair of open-fitting hearables in an anechoic environment with one speech source and two noise sources. The simulation results validate the theoretical derivations and demonstrate that for a broad range of the trade-off parameter, the signal-to-noise ratio and the speech quality and intelligibility in terms of PESQ and ESTOI can be substantially improved compared to the hard-constrained design.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE Workshop on Applications of Signal Processing to Audio and Acoustics (WASPAA) 2025. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2505.10372</p></details> |

Existing methods mainly utilize spatial attention to highlight the region of interest. However, due to limitations of medical imaging devices, medical images exhibit significant heterogeneity, posing challenges for segmentation. Ultrasound images, for instance, often suffer from speckle noise, low resolution, and poor contrast between target tissues and background, which may lead to inaccurate boundary delineation. To address these challenges caused by heterogeneous image quality, we propose a hybrid CNN-Transformer model,called CFFormer, which leverages effective channel feature extraction to enhance the model' s ability to accurately identify tissue regions by capturing rich contextual information. The proposed architecture contains two key components: the Cross Feature Channel Attention (CFCA) module and the X-Spatial Feature Fusion (XFF) module. The model incorporates dual encoders, with the CNN encoder focusing on capturing local features and the Transformer encoder modeling global features. The CFCA module filters and facilitates interactions between the channel features from the two encoders, while the XFF module effectively reduces the significant semantic information differences in spatial features, enabling a smooth and cohesive spatial feature fusion. We evaluate our model across eight datasets covering five modalities to test its generalization capability. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms current state-of-the-art methods and maintains accurate tissue region segmentation across heterogeneous medical image datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/JiaxuanFelix/CFFormer.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods regard the RGB domain as a unified domain and neglect the multiple subdomains within it, such as daytime, nighttime, and foggy scenes. We argue that decoupling the domain-invariant (DI) and domain-specific (DS) features across these multiple subdomains is beneficial for RGB-IR domain adaptation. To this end, this paper proposes a new SS-DC framework based on a decoupling-coupling strategy. In terms of decoupling, we design a Spectral Adaptive Idempotent Decoupling (SAID) module in the aspect of spectral decomposition. Due to the style and content information being highly embedded in different frequency bands, this module can decouple DI and DS components more accurately and interpretably. A novel filter bank-based spectral processing paradigm and a self-distillation-driven decoupling loss are proposed to improve the spectral domain decoupling. In terms of coupling, a new spatial-spectral coupling method is proposed, which realizes joint coupling through spatial and spectral DI feature pyramids. Meanwhile, this paper introduces DS from decoupling to reduce the domain bias. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can significantly improve the baseline performance and outperform existing UDAOD methods on multiple RGB-IR datasets, including a new experimental protocol proposed in this paper based on the FLIR-ADAS dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 mai...</summary><p>8 main-pages, 3 reference-pages, 5 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

Unfortunately, existing methods fail to strike a satisfactory balance between performance and efficiency, either due to excessive overhead of tuning text prompts or unstable benefits from handcrafted, training-free visual feature enhancement. In this paper, we present Global-Spatial Bias Learner (GS-Bias), an efficient and effective TTA paradigm that incorporates two learnable biases during TTA, unfolded as the global bias and spatial bias. Particularly, the global bias captures the global semantic features of a test image by learning consistency across augmented views, while spatial bias learns the semantic coherence between regions in the image's spatial visual representation. It is worth highlighting that these two sets of biases are directly added to the logits outputed by the pretrained VLMs, which circumvent the full backpropagation through VLM that hinders the efficiency of existing TTA methods. This endows GS-Bias with extremely high efficiency while achieving state-of-the-art performance on 15 benchmark datasets. For example, it achieves a 2.23% improvement over TPT in cross-dataset generalization and a 2.72% improvement in domain generalization, while requiring only 6.5% of TPT's memory usage on ImageNet.</p></details> |  |

Despite its significance, this task remains largely unexplored. Most previous works have primarily focused on mapping modalities like speech, audio, and music to generate human motion. As of yet, these models typically overlook the impact of spatial features encoded in spatial audio signals on human motion. To bridge this gap and enable high-quality modeling of human movements in response to spatial audio, we introduce the first comprehensive Spatial Audio-Driven Human Motion (SAM) dataset, which contains diverse and high-quality spatial audio and motion data. For benchmarking, we develop a simple yet effective diffusion-based generative framework for human MOtion generation driven by SPatial Audio, termed MOSPA, which faithfully captures the relationship between body motion and spatial audio through an effective fusion mechanism. Once trained, MOSPA could generate diverse realistic human motions conditioned on varying spatial audio inputs. We perform a thorough investigation of the proposed dataset and conduct extensive experiments for benchmarking, where our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on this task. Our model and dataset will be open-sourced upon acceptance. Please refer to our supplementary video for more details.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Spatial-Physics Informed Model for 3D Spiral Sample Scanned by SQUID Microscopy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11853v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of advanced packaging is essential in the semiconductor manufacturing industry. However, non-destructive testing (NDT) of advanced packaging becomes increasingly challenging due to the depth and complexity of the layers involved. In such a scenario, Magnetic field imaging (MFI) enables the imaging of magnetic fields generated by currents. For MFI to be effective in NDT, the magnetic fields must be converted into current density. This conversion has typically relied solely on a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for magnetic field inversion; however, the existing approach does not consider eddy current effects or image misalignment in the test setup. In this paper, we present a spatial-physics informed model (SPIM) designed for a 3D spiral sample scanned using Superconducting QUantum Interference Device (SQUID) microscopy. The SPIM encompasses three key components: i) magnetic image enhancement by aligning all the "sharp" wire field signals to mitigate the eddy current effect using both in-phase (I-channel) and quadrature-phase (Q-channel) images; (ii) magnetic image alignment that addresses skew effects caused by any misalignment of the scanning SQUID microscope relative to the wire segments; and (iii) an inversion method for converting magnetic fields to magnetic currents by integrating the Biot-Savart Law with FFT. The results show that the SPIM improves I-channel sharpness by 0.3% and reduces Q-channel sharpness by 25%. Also, we were able to remove rotational and skew misalignments of 0.30 in a real image. Overall, SPIM highlights the potential of combining spatial analysis with physics-driven models in practical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>copyr...</summary><p>copyright 2025 IEEE.

It proposes a generative model that integrates effects of spatially-varying inputs and a network-valued input using deep neural networks to capture complex non-linear and spatial associations with the output. The method models spatial smoothness, accounts for subject heterogeneity and complex associations between network and spatial images at different scales, enables accurate inference of each images effect on the output image, and allows prediction with uncertainty quantification via Monte Carlo dropout, contributing to one of the first Explainable AI (XAI) frameworks for heterogeneous imaging data. The model is highly scalable to high-resolution data without the heavy pre-processing or summarization often required by Bayesian methods. Empirical results demonstrate its strong performance compared to existing statistical and deep learning methods. We applied the XAI model to the ABCD data which revealed associations between cortical features and ALFF throughout the entire brain. Our model performed comparably to existing methods in predictive accuracy but provided superior uncertainty quantification and faster computation, demonstrating its effectiveness for large-scale neuroimaging analysis. Open-source software in Python for XAI is available.</p></details> |  |

Apart from variation across different content types, e.g., game genres, we discovered time-variability within a clip from second to second, and explored the ramifications for traffic management. We introduced utility as an elegant way to manage resource sharing preferences. Our analysis of resource sharing methods shows that frequent QoE-aware reallocation has significant performance advantages compared to static rate allocation, even in case the latter is based on rich information about long-term average spatial complexity. We have also shown that utility-based resource allocation has clear advantages over methods targeting equal QoE allocation, it increases the average QoE, while it still controls the worst case QoE.</p></details> |  |

Today's spatial naming systems are digital maps such as Google and Apple maps. These maps and the location-based services provided on top of these maps are primarily controlled by a few large corporations and mostly cover outdoor public spaces. Emerging classes of applications, such as persistent world-scale augmented reality, require detailed maps of both outdoor and indoor spaces. Existing centralized mapping infrastructures are proving insufficient for such applications because of the scale of cartography efforts required and the privacy of indoor map data. In this paper, we present a case for a federated spatial naming system, or in other words, a federated mapping infrastructure. This enables disparate parties to manage and serve their own maps of physical regions and unlocks scalability of map management, isolation and privacy of maps. Map-related services such as address-to-location mapping, location-based search, and routing needs re-architecting to work on federated maps. We discuss some essential services and practicalities of enabling these services.</p></details> |  |

The approach is based on the notion of signature, which represents a function as an infinite series of its iterated integrals and presents the advantage of being applicable to a wide range of processes. We have provided theoretical guarantees for the choice of the signature truncation order, and we have shown in a simulation study and an application to pollution data that this approach outperforms existing approaches in the literature.</p></details> |  |
| **[SpaRTAN: Spatial Reinforcement Token-based Aggregation Network for Visual Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10999v1)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The resurgence of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in visual recognition tasks, exemplified by ConvNeXt, has demonstrated their capability to rival transformer-based architectures through advanced training methodologies and ViT-inspired design principles. However, both CNNs and transformers exhibit a simplicity bias, favoring straightforward features over complex structural representations. Furthermore, modern CNNs often integrate MLP-like blocks akin to those in transformers, but these blocks suffer from significant information redundancies, necessitating high expansion ratios to sustain competitive performance. To address these limitations, we propose SpaRTAN, a lightweight architectural design that enhances spatial and channel-wise information processing. SpaRTAN employs kernels with varying receptive fields, controlled by kernel size and dilation factor, to capture discriminative multi-order spatial features effectively. A wave-based channel aggregation module further modulates and reinforces pixel interactions, mitigating channel-wise redundancies. Combining the two modules, the proposed network can efficiently gather and dynamically contextualize discriminative features. Experimental results in ImageNet and COCO demonstrate that SpaRTAN achieves remarkable parameter efficiency while maintaining competitive performance. In particular, on the ImageNet-1k benchmark, SpaRTAN achieves 77. 7% accuracy with only 3.8M parameters and approximately 1.0 GFLOPs, demonstrating its ability to deliver strong performance through an efficient design. On the COCO benchmark, it achieves 50.0% AP, surpassing the previous benchmark by 1.2% with only 21.5M parameters. The code is publicly available at [https://github.com/henry-pay/SpaRTAN].</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN 2025)</p></details> |

We focus on achieving robust spatial generalization of the policy for the peg-in-hole (PiH) task trained from a small number of demonstrations. We propose EquiContact, a hierarchical policy composed of a high-level vision planner (Diffusion Equivariant Descriptor Field, Diff-EDF) and a novel low-level compliant visuomotor policy (Geometric Compliant ACT, G-CompACT). G-CompACT operates using only localized observations (geometrically consistent error vectors (GCEV), force-torque readings, and wrist-mounted RGB images) and produces actions defined in the end-effector frame. Through these design choices, we show that the entire EquiContact pipeline is SE(3)-equivariant, from perception to force control. We also outline three key components for spatially generalizable contact-rich policies: compliance, localized policies, and induced equivariance. Real-world experiments on PiH tasks demonstrate a near-perfect success rate and robust generalization to unseen spatial configurations, validating the proposed framework and principles.

To accurately characterize "data-level dependence'' in analysis of extreme events, we propose a mixture model that achieves flexible dependence properties and allows high-dimensional inference for extremes of spatial processes. We modify the popular random scale construction that multiplies a Gaussian random field by a single radial variable; we allow the radial variable to vary smoothly across space and add non-stationarity to the Gaussian process. As the level of extremeness increases, this single model exhibits both asymptotic independence at long ranges and either asymptotic dependence or independence at short ranges. We make joint inference on the dependence model and a marginal model using a copula approach within a Bayesian hierarchical model. Three different simulation scenarios show close to nominal frequentist coverage rates. Lastly, we apply the model to a dataset of extreme summertime precipitation over the central United States. We find that the joint tail of precipitation exhibits non-stationary dependence structure that cannot be captured by limiting extreme value models or current state-of-the-art sub-asymptotic models.</p></details> |  |

Denoising generative models have become the de-facto standard for image generation, due to their effectiveness in sampling from complex, high-dimensional distributions. Recently, they have started being explored in the context of reasoning over multiple continuous variables. Providing infrastructure for generative reasoning with such models requires a high effort, due to a wide range of different denoising formulations, samplers, and inference strategies.

| **[3S-Attack: Spatial, Spectral and Semantic Invisible Backdoor Attack Against DNN Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10733v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Backdoor attacks involve either poisoning the training data or directly modifying the model in order to implant a hidden behavior, that causes the model to misclassify inputs when a specific trigger is present. During inference, the model maintains high accuracy on benign samples but misclassifies poisoned samples into an attacker-specified target class. Existing research on backdoor attacks has explored developing triggers in the spatial, spectral (frequency), and semantic (feature) domains, aiming to make them stealthy. While some approaches have considered designing triggers that are imperceptible in both spatial and spectral domains, few have incorporated the semantic domain. In this paper, we propose a novel backdoor attack, termed 3S-attack, which is stealthy across the spatial, spectral, and semantic domains. The key idea is to exploit the semantic features of benign samples as triggers, using Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) and a preliminary model for extraction. The trigger is then embedded in the spectral domain, followed by pixel-level restrictions after converting the samples back to the spatial domain. This process minimizes the distance between poisoned and benign samples, making the attack harder to detect by existing defenses and human inspection. Extensive experiments on various datasets, along with theoretical analysis, demonstrate the stealthiness of 3S-attack and highlight the need for stronger defenses to ensure AI security.

Traditional deep reinforcement learning methods face computational complexity bottlenecks, particularly with standard attention mechanisms, when handling large-scale urban-level location problems. This paper proposes GeoHopNet, a Hopfield-augmented sparse spatial attention network specifically designed for dynamic UAV site location problems. Our approach introduces four core innovations: (1) distance-biased multi-head attention mechanism that explicitly encodes spatial geometric information; (2) K-nearest neighbor sparse attention that reduces computational complexity from $O(N^2)$ to $O(NK)$; (3) a modern Hopfield external memory module; and (4) a memory regularization strategy. Experimental results demonstrate that GeoHopNet extends the boundary of solvable problem sizes. For large-scale instances with 1,000 nodes, where standard attention models become prohibitively slow (over 3 seconds per instance) and traditional solvers fail, GeoHopNet finds high-quality solutions (0.22\% optimality gap) in under 0.1 seconds. Compared to the state-of-the-art ADNet baseline on 100-node instances, our method improves solution quality by 22.2\% and is 1.8$\times$ faster.</p></details> | 12 Pages, 5 Figures |
| **[Spatial Lifting for Dense Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10222v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Spatial Lifting (SL), a novel methodology for dense prediction tasks. SL operates by lifting standard inputs, such as 2D images, into a higher-dimensional space and subsequently processing them using networks designed for that higher dimension, such as a 3D U-Net. Counterintuitively, this dimensionality lifting allows us to achieve good performance on benchmark tasks compared to conventional approaches, while reducing inference costs and significantly lowering the number of model parameters. The SL framework produces intrinsically structured outputs along the lifted dimension. This emergent structure facilitates dense supervision during training and enables robust, near-zero-additional-cost prediction quality assessment at test time. We validate our approach across 19 benchmark datasets (13 for semantic segmentation and 6 for depth estimation), demonstrating competitive dense prediction performance while reducing the model parameter count by over 98% (in the U-Net case) and lowering inference costs. Spatial Lifting introduces a new vision modeling paradigm that offers a promising path toward more efficient, accurate, and reliable deep networks for dense prediction tasks in vision.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

In this paper, we introduce an algorithm that constructs QC spatially-coupled (SC) LDPC codes with large girth while keeping the constraint length small. The algorithm offers a "protograph to basegraph" construction, focusing on finding small lifting sizes of QC codes while avoiding short cycles. This work extends the hierarchical quasi-cyclic (HQC) construction for block LDPC codes proposed by Wang et al. to the spatially coupled case. The construction is based on the cycle relevant matrix (CRM) derived from the periodic structure of time-invariant SC-LDPC codes. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm effectively achieves the target girth with a small lifting factor, enabling low-complexity SC code construction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ISTC 2025</p></details> |
| **[Demystifying Spatial Confounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16861v3)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial confounding is a fundamental issue in spatial regression models which arises because spatial random effects, included to approximate unmeasured spatial variation, are typically not independent of covariates in the model. This can lead to significant bias in covariate effect estimates. The problem is complex and has been the topic of extensive research with sometimes puzzling and seemingly contradictory results. Here, we develop a broad theoretical framework that brings mathematical clarity to the mechanisms of spatial confounding, providing explicit analytical expressions for the resulting bias. We see that the problem is directly linked to spatial smoothing and identify exactly how the size and occurrence of bias relate to the features of the spatial model as well as the underlying confounding scenario. Using our results, we can explain subtle and counter-intuitive behaviours. Finally, we propose a general approach for dealing with spatial confounding bias in practice, applicable for any spatial model specification. When a covariate has non-spatial information, we show that a general form of the so-called spatial+ method can be used to eliminate bias. When no such information is present, the situation is more challenging but, under the assumption of unconfounded high frequencies, we develop a procedure in which multiple capped versions of spatial+ are applied to assess the bias in this case. We illustrate our approach with an application to air temperature in Germany.</p></details> |  |

While existing methods primarily focus on modeling observed motion patterns and interactions with other vehicles, they often neglect the potential risks posed by the uncertain or aggressive behaviors of surrounding vehicles. In this paper, we propose a novel spatial-temporal risk-attentive trajectory prediction framework that incorporates a risk potential field to assess perceived risks arising from behaviors of nearby vehicles. The framework leverages a spatial-temporal encoder and a risk-attentive feature fusion decoder to embed the risk potential field into the extracted spatial-temporal feature representations for trajectory prediction. A risk-scaled loss function is further designed to improve the prediction accuracy of high-risk scenarios, such as short relative spacing. Experiments on the widely used NGSIM and HighD datasets demonstrate that our method reduces average prediction errors by 4.8% and 31.2% respectively compared to state-of-the-art approaches, especially in high-risk scenarios. The proposed framework provides interpretable, risk-aware predictions, contributing to more robust decision-making for autonomous driving systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, accepted at ITSC 2025</p></details> |

While multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) support imagination-based reasoning, spatial visualization remains insufficiently evaluated, typically embedded within broader mathematical and logical assessments. Existing evaluations often rely on IQ tests or math competitions that may overlap with training data, compromising assessment reliability. To this end, we introduce SpatialViz-Bench, a comprehensive multi-modal benchmark for spatial visualization with 12 tasks across 4 sub-abilities, comprising 1,180 automatically generated problems. Our evaluation of 33 state-of-the-art MLLMs not only reveals wide performance variations and demonstrates the benchmark's strong discriminative power, but also uncovers counter-intuitive findings: models exhibit unexpected behaviors by showing difficulty perception that misaligns with human intuition, displaying dramatic 2D-to-3D performance cliffs, and defaulting to formula derivation despite spatial tasks requiring visualization alone. SpatialVizBench empirically demonstrates that state-of-the-art MLLMs continue to exhibit deficiencies in spatial visualization tasks, thereby addressing a significant lacuna in the field. The benchmark is publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Volume-Based Space-Time Cube for Large-Scale Continuous Spatial Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09917v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial time series visualization offers scientific research pathways and analytical decision-making tools across various spatiotemporal domains. Despite many advanced methodologies, the seamless integration of temporal and spatial information remains a challenge. The space-time cube (STC) stands out as a promising approach for the synergistic presentation of spatial and temporal information, with successful applications across various spatiotemporal datasets. However, the STC is plagued by well-known issues such as visual occlusion and depth ambiguity, which are further exacerbated when dealing with large-scale spatial time series data. In this study, we introduce a novel technical framework termed VolumeSTCube, designed for continuous spatiotemporal phenomena. It first leverages the concept of the STC to transform discretely distributed spatial time series data into continuously volumetric data. Subsequently, volume rendering and surface rendering techniques are employed to visualize the transformed volumetric data. Volume rendering is utilized to mitigate visual occlusion, while surface rendering provides pattern details by enhanced lighting information. Lastly, we design interactions to facilitate the exploration and analysis from temporal, spatial, and spatiotemporal perspectives. VolumeSTCube is evaluated through a computational experiment, a real-world case study with one expert, and a controlled user study with twelve non-experts, compared against a baseline from prior work, showing its superiority and effectiveness in largescale spatial time series analysis.</p></details> |  |

For such spatial lifetime data, statistical models usually account for the spatial dependence through spatial random effects, such as the cumulative exposure model and the proportional hazards model. For these models, the Bayesian estimation is commonly used for model inference, but often encounters computational challenges when the number of spatial locations is large. The conventional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for sampling the posterior can be time-consuming. In this case-study paper, we investigate the capability of variational inference (VI) for the model inference on spatial lifetime data, aiming for a good balance between the estimation accuracy and computational efficiency. Specifically, the VI methods with different divergence metrics are investigated for the spatial lifetime models. In the case study, the Titan GPU lifetime data and the pine tree lifetime data are used to examine the VI methods in terms of their computational advantage and estimation accuracy.</p></details> | 30 pages, 9 figures |

To pursue higher intelligence in space, MLLMs require integrating multiple atomic spatial capabilities to handle complex and dynamic tasks. However, existing benchmarks struggle to comprehensively evaluate the spatial intelligence of common MLLMs from the atomic level to the compositional level. To fill this gap, we present SpaCE-10, a comprehensive benchmark for compositional spatial evaluations. In SpaCE-10, we define 10 atomic spatial capabilities, which are combined to form 8 compositional capabilities. Based on these definitions, we propose a novel hierarchical annotation pipeline to generate high-quality and diverse question-answer (QA) pairs. With over 150+ hours of human expert effort, we obtain over 5k QA pairs for 811 real indoor scenes in SpaCE-10, which covers various evaluation settings like point cloud input and multi-choice QA. We conduct an extensive evaluation of common MLLMs on SpaCE-10 and find that even the most advanced MLLM still lags behind humans by large margins. Through our careful study, we also draw several significant findings that benefit the MLLM community. For example, we reveal that the shortcoming of counting capability greatly limits the compositional spatial capabilities of existing MLLMs. The evaluation code and benchmark datasets are available at https://github.com/Cuzyoung/SpaCE-10.</p></details> |  |

The Micro-gesture Online Recognition task is a highly challenging problem that aims to locate the temporal positions and recognize the categories of multiple micro-gesture instances in untrimmed videos. Compared to traditional temporal action detection, this task places greater emphasis on distinguishing between micro-gesture categories and precisely identifying the start and end times of each instance. Moreover, micro-gestures are typically spontaneous human actions, with greater differences than those found in other human actions. To address these challenges, we propose hand-crafted data augmentation and spatial-temporal attention to enhance the model's ability to classify and localize micro-gestures more accurately. Our solution achieved an F1 score of 38.03, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art by 37.9%. As a result, our method ranked first in the Micro-gesture Online Recognition track.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |

However, many existing methods rely on behavior cloning with supervised historical trajectories, limiting their 3D spatial and 4D spatiotemporal awareness. Consequently, these methods struggle to capture the 3D structures and 4D spatiotemporal relationships necessary for real-world deployment. In this work, we propose 4D Diffusion Policy (DP4), a novel visual imitation learning method that incorporates spatiotemporal awareness into diffusion-based policies. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on trajectory cloning, DP4 leverages a dynamic Gaussian world model to guide the learning of 3D spatial and 4D spatiotemporal perceptions from interactive environments. Our method constructs the current 3D scene from a single-view RGB-D observation and predicts the future 3D scene, optimizing trajectory generation by explicitly modeling both spatial and temporal dependencies. Extensive experiments across 17 simulation tasks with 173 variants and 3 real-world robotic tasks demonstrate that the 4D Diffusion Policy (DP4) outperforms baseline methods, improving the average simulation task success rate by 16.4% (Adroit), 14% (DexArt), and 6.45% (RLBench), and the average real-world robotic task success rate by 8.6%.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional methods struggle with high-dimensional data, spectral-spatial redundancy, and the scarcity of labeled samples, often leading to suboptimal performance. To address these challenges, we propose the Self-Adaptive Tensor- Regularized Network (SDTN), which combines tensor decomposition with regularization mechanisms to dynamically adjust tensor ranks, ensuring optimal feature representation tailored to the complexity of the data. Building upon SDTN, we propose the Tensor-Regularized Network (TRN), which integrates the features extracted by SDTN into a lightweight network capable of capturing spectral-spatial features at multiple scales. This approach not only maintains high classification accuracy but also significantly reduces computational complexity, making the framework highly suitable for real-time deployment in resource-constrained environments. Experiments on PaviaU datasets demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy and reduced model parameters compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 4 pages, 2 figures |

Moreover, effectively modeling these interactions often incurs substantial computational costs. In this work, we propose a computationally efficient model for multi-person motion prediction by simplifying spatial and temporal interactions. Our approach begins with the design of lightweight dual branches that learn local and global representations for individual and multiple persons separately. Additionally, we introduce a novel cross-level interaction block to integrate the spatial and temporal representations from both branches. To further enhance interaction modeling, we explicitly incorporate the spatial inter-person distance embedding. With above efficient temporal and spatial design, we achieve state-of-the-art performance for multiple metrics on standard datasets of CMU-Mocap, MuPoTS-3D, and 3DPW, while significantly reducing the computational cost.

| **[3D Bivariate Spatial Modelling of Argo Ocean Temperature and Salinity Profiles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11611v2)** | 2025-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Variables contained within the global oceans can detect and reveal the effects of the warming climate, as the oceans absorb huge amounts of solar energy. Hence, information regarding the joint spatial distribution of ocean variables is critical for understanding the climate. In this paper, we investigate the spatial dependence structure between ocean temperature and salinity using data harvested from the Argo program and construct a bivariate spatial model for the data that cover the surface to the ocean's interior. We develop a flexible class of multivariate nonstationary covariance models defined in 3-dimensional (3D) space (longitude $\times$ latitude $\times$ depth) that allow the variances and correlation to vary with ocean depth. These models describe the joint spatial distribution of the two variables while incorporating the underlying vertical structure of the ocean. We apply this framework to temperature and salinity data from Argo floats. To manage the computational challenges posed by the large volume of the Argo data, we apply the Vecchia approximation to the likelihood functions. We demonstrate that the proposed bivariate covariance is able to describe the complex vertical cross-covariance structure between the original processes as well as their first and second-order differenciations, while existing bivariate models, including bivariate Mat\'{e}rn, poorly fit the empirical cross-covariance structure.</p></details> |  |

Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) has become a standard imaging modality for retinal disease diagnosis, but OCT images often suffer from issues such as speckle noise, complex lesion shapes, and varying lesion sizes, making interpretation challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, WaveNet-SF, to enhance retinal disease detection by integrating the spatial-domain and frequency-domain learning. The framework utilizes wavelet transforms to decompose OCT images into low- and high-frequency components, enabling the model to extract both global structural features and fine-grained details. To improve lesion detection, we introduce a Multi-Scale Wavelet Spatial Attention (MSW-SA) module, which enhances the model's focus on regions of interest at multiple scales. Additionally, a High-Frequency Feature Compensation (HFFC) block is incorporated to recover edge information lost during wavelet decomposition, suppress noise, and preserve fine details crucial for lesion detection. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) classification accuracies of 97.82% and 99.58% on the OCT-C8 and OCT2017 datasets, respectively, surpassing existing methods. These results demonstrate the efficacy of WaveNet-SF in addressing the challenges of OCT image analysis and its potential as a powerful tool for retinal disease diagnosis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Capturing Unseen Spatial Extremes Through Knowledge-Informed Generative Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09211v1)** | 2025-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Observed records of climate extremes provide an incomplete picture of risk, missing "unseen" extremes that exceed historical bounds. In parallel, neglecting spatial dependence undervalues the risk of synchronized hazards that amplify impacts. To address these challenges, we develop DeepX-GAN (Dependence-Enhanced Embedding for Physical eXtremes - Generative Adversarial Network), a knowledge-informed deep generative model designed to better capture the spatial structure of rare extremes. The zero-shot generalizability of DeepX-GAN enables simulation of unseen extremes that fall outside historical experience yet remain statistically plausible. We define two types of unseen extremes: "checkmate" extremes that directly hit targets, and "stalemate" extremes that narrowly miss. These unrealized scenarios expose latent risks in fragile systems and may reinforce a false sense of resilience if overlooked. Near misses, in particular, can prompt either proactive adaptation or dangerous complacency, depending on how they are interpreted. Applying DeepX-GAN to the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), we find that these unseen extremes disproportionately affect regions with high vulnerability and low socioeconomic readiness, but differ in urgency and interpretation. Future warming could expand and redistribute these unseen extremes, with emerging exposure hotspots in Indo-Pakistan and Central Africa. This distributional shift highlights critical blind spots in conventional hazard planning and underscores the need to develop spatially adaptive policies that anticipate emergent risk hotspots rather than simply extrapolating from historical patterns.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Spatial Audio Understanding via Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09195v1)** | 2025-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for spatial audio understanding of first-order ambisonic (FOA) signals through a question answering (QA) paradigm, aiming to extend the scope of sound event localization and detection (SELD) towards spatial scene understanding and reasoning. First, we curate and release fine-grained spatio-temporal textual descriptions for the STARSS23 dataset using a rule-based approach, and further enhance linguistic diversity using large language model (LLM)-based rephrasing. We also introduce a QA dataset aligned with the STARSS23 scenes, covering various aspects such as event presence, localization, spatial, and temporal relationships. To increase language variety, we again leverage LLMs to generate multiple rephrasings per question. Finally, we develop a baseline spatial audio QA model that takes FOA signals and natural language questions as input and provides answers regarding various occurrences, temporal, and spatial relationships of sound events in the scene formulated as a classification task. Despite being trained solely with scene-level question answering supervision, our model achieves performance that is comparable to a fully supervised sound event localization and detection model trained with frame-level spatiotemporal annotations. The results highlight the potential of language-guided approaches for spatial audio understanding and open new directions for integrating linguistic supervision into spatial scene analysis.</p></details> |  |

However, the presence of multistate current status endpoints, where only a single snapshot of each subject's progression through disease states is available at a random inspection time after a known starting state, complicates the inferential framework. In addition, these endpoints can be clustered, and spatially associated, where a group of proximally located teeth (within subjects) may experience similar PD status, compared to those distally located. Motivated by a clinical study recording PD progression, we propose a Bayesian semiparametric accelerated failure time model with an inverse-Wishart proposal for accommodating (spatial) random effects, and flexible errors that follow a Dirichlet process mixture of Gaussians. For clinical interpretability, the systematic component of the event times is modeled using a monotone single index model, with the (unknown) link function estimated via a novel integrated basis expansion and basis coefficients endowed with constrained Gaussian process priors. In addition to establishing parameter identifiability, we present scalable computing via a combination of elliptical slice sampling, fast circulant embedding techniques, and smoothing of hard constraints, leading to straightforward estimation of parameters, and state occupation and transition probabilities. Using synthetic data, we study the finite sample properties of our Bayesian estimates, and their performance under model misspecification. We also illustrate our method via application to the real clinical PD dataset.</p></details> |  |

This allows for modeling non-linearities and interactions among predictor variables in a flexible data-driven manner and for accounting for spatio-temporal variation that is not explained by observable predictor variables. We also show how estimation and prediction can be done in a computationally efficient manner. In an application to a large U.S. mortgage credit risk data set, we find that both predictive default probabilities for individual loans and predictive loan portfolio loss distributions obtained with our novel approach are more accurate compared to conventional independent linear hazard models and also linear spatio-temporal models. Using interpretability tools for machine learning models, we find that the likely reasons for this outperformance are strong interaction and non-linear effects in the predictor variables and the presence of spatio-temporal frailty effects.</p></details> |  |

We propose COMPASS, a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework that enables decentralized agents to persistently monitor multiple moving targets efficiently. We model the environment as a graph, where nodes represent spatial locations and edges capture topological proximity, allowing agents to reason over structured layouts and revisit informative regions as needed. Each agent independently selects actions based on a shared spatio-temporal attention network that we design to integrate historical observations and spatial context. We model target dynamics using Gaussian Processes (GPs), which support principled belief updates and enable uncertainty-aware planning. We train COMPASS using centralized value estimation and decentralized policy execution under an adaptive reward setting. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that COMPASS consistently outperforms strong baselines in uncertainty reduction, target coverage, and coordination efficiency across dynamic multi-target scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reducing GPU Memory Fragmentation via Spatio-Temporal Planning for Efficient Large-Scale Model Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16274v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid scaling of large language models (LLMs) has significantly increased GPU memory pressure, which is further aggravated by training optimization techniques such as virtual pipeline and recomputation that disrupt tensor lifespans and introduce considerable memory fragmentation. Default GPU memory allocators of popular deep learning frameworks like PyTorch use online strategies without knowledge of tensor lifespans, which can waste up to 43\% of memory and cause out-of-memory errors, rendering optimization techniques ineffective or even unusable. To address this, we introduce STWeaver, a GPU memory allocator for deep learning frameworks that reduces fragmentation by exploiting the spatial and temporal regularity in memory allocation behaviors of training workloads. STWeaver introduces a novel paradigm that combines offline planning with online allocation. The offline planning leverages spatio-temporal regularities to generate a near-optimal allocation plan, while the online allocation handles complex and dynamic models such as Mixture-of-Experts (MoE). Built as a pluggable PyTorch allocator, STWeaver reduces fragmentation ratio on average by 79.2\% (up to 100\%) across both dense and sparse models, with negligible overhead. This enables more efficient, high-throughput training configurations and improves performance by up to 32.5\%.</p></details> |  |
| **[STL-GO: Spatio-Temporal Logic with Graph Operators for Distributed Systems with Multiple Network Topologies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15147v1)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent systems (MASs) consisting of a number of autonomous agents that communicate, coordinate, and jointly sense the environment to achieve complex missions can be found in a variety of applications such as robotics, smart cities, and internet-of-things applications. Modeling and monitoring MAS requirements to guarantee overall mission objectives, safety, and reliability is an important problem. Such requirements implicitly require reasoning about diverse sensing and communication modalities between agents, analysis of the dependencies between agent tasks, and the spatial or virtual distance between agents. To capture such rich MAS requirements, we model agent interactions via multiple directed graphs, and introduce a new logic -- Spatio-Temporal Logic with Graph Operators (STL-GO). The key innovation in STL-GO are graph operators that enable us to reason about the number of agents along either the incoming or outgoing edges of the underlying interaction graph that satisfy a given property of interest; for example, the requirement that an agent should sense at least two neighboring agents whose task graphs indicate the ability to collaborate. We then propose novel distributed monitoring conditions for individual agents that use only local information to determine whether or not an STL-GO specification is satisfied. We compare the expressivity of STL-GO against existing spatio-temporal logic formalisms, and demonstrate the utility of STL-GO and our distributed monitors in a bike-sharing and a multi-drone case study.</p></details> |  |

Most existing methods rely on binary classifiers trained using real and fake image sequences, therefore hindering their generalization capabilities to unseen generation methods. Moreover, with the constant progress in generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), deepfake artifacts are becoming imperceptible at both the spatial and the temporal levels, making them extremely difficult to capture. To address these issues, we propose a fine-grained deepfake video detection approach called FakeSTormer that enforces the modeling of subtle spatio-temporal inconsistencies while avoiding overfitting. Specifically, we introduce a multi-task learning framework that incorporates two auxiliary branches for explicitly attending artifact-prone spatial and temporal regions. Additionally, we propose a video-level data synthesis strategy that generates pseudo-fake videos with subtle spatio-temporal artifacts, providing high-quality samples and hand-free annotations for our additional branches. Extensive experiments on several challenging benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared to recent state-of-the-art methods.

In this paper, we demonstrate that effective information compression may occur over time or space during sequences of node communications in distributed algorithms, leading to the concept of spatio-temporal compressors. This abstraction classifies existing compressors and inspires new compressors as spatio-temporal compressors, with their effectiveness described by constructive stability criteria from nonlinear system theory. Subsequently, we incorporate these spatio-temporal compressors directly into standard continuous-time consensus flows and distributed primal-dual flows, establishing conditions ensuring exponential convergence. Additionally, we introduce a novel observer-based distributed primal-dual continuous flow integrated with spatio-temporal compressors, which provides broader convergence conditions. These continuous flows achieve exponential convergence to the global optimum when the objective function is strongly convex and can be discretized using Euler approximations.

| **[DVFL-Net: A Lightweight Distilled Video Focal Modulation Network for Spatio-Temporal Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12426v2)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The landscape of video recognition has evolved significantly, shifting from traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to Transformer-based architectures for improved accuracy. While 3D CNNs have been effective at capturing spatiotemporal dynamics, recent Transformer models leverage self-attention to model long-range spatial and temporal dependencies. Despite achieving state-of-the-art performance on major benchmarks, Transformers remain computationally expensive, particularly with dense video data. To address this, we propose a lightweight Video Focal Modulation Network, DVFL-Net, which distills spatiotemporal knowledge from a large pre-trained teacher into a compact nano student model, enabling efficient on-device deployment. DVFL-Net utilizes knowledge distillation and spatial-temporal feature modulation to significantly reduce computation while preserving high recognition performance. We employ forward Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence alongside spatio-temporal focal modulation to effectively transfer both local and global context from the Video-FocalNet Base (teacher) to the proposed VFL-Net (student). We evaluate DVFL-Net on UCF50, UCF101, HMDB51, SSV2, and Kinetics-400, benchmarking it against recent state-of-the-art methods in Human Action Recognition (HAR). Additionally, we conduct a detailed ablation study analyzing the impact of forward KL divergence. The results confirm the superiority of DVFL-Net in achieving an optimal balance between performance and efficiency, demonstrating lower memory usage, reduced GFLOPs, and strong accuracy, making it a practical solution for real-time HAR applications.</p></details> | 17 pages |

Previous methods solve the issue of insufficient observation by leveraging 4D diffusion models to generate videos at novel viewpoints. However, the generated videos from these models often lack spatio-temporal consistency, thus degrading view synthesis quality. In this paper, we propose a novel sliding iterative denoising process to enhance the spatio-temporal consistency of the 4D diffusion model. Specifically, we define a latent grid in which each latent encodes the image, camera pose, and human pose for a certain viewpoint and timestamp, then alternately denoising the latent grid along spatial and temporal dimensions with a sliding window, and finally decode the videos at target viewpoints from the corresponding denoised latents. Through the iterative sliding, information flows sufficiently across the latent grid, allowing the diffusion model to obtain a large receptive field and thus enhance the 4D consistency of the output, while making the GPU memory consumption affordable. The experiments on the DNA-Rendering and ActorsHQ datasets demonstrate that our method is able to synthesize high-quality and consistent novel-view videos and significantly outperforms the existing approaches.

It serves as a cornerstone for achieving high-level autonomous driving. However, current approaches remain inadequate for accurately modeling the complex spatio-temporal interdependencies and the unpredictable variability of human driving behavior. To address these challenges, we propose CaSTFormer, a Causal Spatio-Temporal Transformer to explicitly model causal interactions between driver behavior and environmental context for robust intention prediction. Specifically, CaSTFormer introduces a novel Reciprocal Shift Fusion (RSF) mechanism for precise temporal alignment of internal and external feature streams, a Causal Pattern Extraction (CPE) module that systematically eliminates spurious correlations to reveal authentic causal dependencies, and an innovative Feature Synthesis Network (FSN) that adaptively synthesizes these purified representations into coherent spatio-temporal inferences. We evaluate the proposed CaSTFormer on the public Brain4Cars dataset, and it achieves state-of-the-art performance. It effectively captures complex causal spatio-temporal dependencies and enhances both the accuracy and transparency of driving intention prediction.</p></details> |  |

Leveraging fine-scale weekly mortality and high-resolution climate data from Austria (2002 to 2019), we assess how interactions between temperature, humidity, age, and gender influence mortality patterns. Our approach goes beyond conventional modelling by capturing complex dependencies through structured interactions across space-time, space-age, and age-time dimensions, allowing us to capture complex demographic and environmental dependencies. The analysis identifies district-level mortality patterns and quantifies climate-related risks on a weekly basis, offering new insights for public health surveillance.</p></details> |  |

Real-world measurements of such processes are often collected at irregularly distributed points in space, which can be effectively represented as graphs; however, there are currently only a few existing datasets. Our work aims to make advancements in the field of PDE-modeling accessible to the temporal graph machine learning community, while addressing the data scarcity problem, by creating and utilizing datasets based on PDEs. In this work, we create and use synthetic datasets based on PDEs to support spatio-temporal graph modeling in machine learning for different applications. More precisely, we showcase three equations to model different types of disasters and hazards in the fields of epidemiology, atmospheric particles, and tsunami waves. Further, we show how such created datasets can be used by benchmarking several machine learning models on the epidemiological dataset. Additionally, we show how pre-training on this dataset can improve model performance on real-world epidemiological data. The presented methods enable others to create datasets and benchmarks customized to individual requirements. The source code for our methodology and the three created datasets can be found on https://github.com/github-usr-ano/Temporal_Graph_Data_PDEs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Camer...</summary><p>Camera-ready version of the paper, which is now accepted at DMLR, see https://openreview.net/forum?id=EguDBMechn . 17 pages, 5 Figures</p></details> |
| **[Reprogramming Vision Foundation Models for Spatio-Temporal Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11558v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have achieved remarkable success in natural language processing and computer vision, demonstrating strong capabilities in modeling complex patterns. While recent efforts have explored adapting large language models (LLMs) for time-series forecasting, LLMs primarily capture one-dimensional sequential dependencies and struggle to model the richer spatio-temporal (ST) correlations essential for accurate ST forecasting. In this paper, we present \textbf{ST-VFM}, a novel framework that systematically reprograms Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) for general-purpose spatio-temporal forecasting. While VFMs offer powerful spatial priors, two key challenges arise when applying them to ST tasks: (1) the lack of inherent temporal modeling capacity and (2) the modality gap between visual and ST data. To address these, ST-VFM adopts a \emph{dual-branch architecture} that integrates raw ST inputs with auxiliary ST flow inputs, where the flow encodes lightweight temporal difference signals interpretable as dynamic spatial cues. To effectively process these dual-branch inputs, ST-VFM introduces two dedicated reprogramming stages. The \emph{pre-VFM reprogramming} stage applies a Temporal-Aware Token Adapter to embed temporal context and align both branches into VFM-compatible feature spaces. The \emph{post-VFM reprogramming} stage introduces a Bilateral Cross-Prompt Coordination module, enabling dynamic interaction between branches through prompt-based conditioning, thus enriching joint representation learning without modifying the frozen VFM backbone. Extensive experiments on ten spatio-temporal datasets show that ST-VFM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating effectiveness and robustness across VFM backbones (e.g., DINO, CLIP, DEIT) and ablation studies, establishing it as a strong general framework for spatio-temporal forecasting.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches in this field usually struggle to capture the complex spatio-temporal dependencies in EV charging behaviors, and their limited model parameters hinder their ability to learn complex data distribution representations from large datasets. To this end, we propose a novel EV spatio-temporal large language model (EV-STLLM) for accurate prediction. Our proposed framework is divided into two modules. In the data processing module, we utilize variational mode decomposition (VMD) for data denoising, and improved complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (ICEEMDAN) for data multi-frequency decomposition. Fuzzy information granulation (FIG) for extracting multi-scale information. Additionally, ReliefF is used for feature selection to mitigate redundancy. In the forecasting module, the EV-STLLM is used to directly achieve EV charging and occupancy forecasting. Firstly, we fully capture the intrinsic spatio-temporal characteristics of the data by integrating adjacency matrices derived from the regional stations network and spatio-temporal-frequency embedding information. Then, the partially frozen graph attention (PFGA) module is utilized to maintain the sequential feature modeling capabilities of the pre-trained large model while incorporating EV domain knowledge. Extensive experiments using real-world data from Shenzhen, China, demonstrate that our proposed framework can achieve superior accuracy and robustness compared to the state-of-the-art benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deformable Dynamic Convolution for Accurate yet Efficient Spatio-Temporal Traffic Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11550v1)** | 2025-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal traffic prediction plays a key role in intelligent transportation systems by enabling accurate prediction in complex urban areas. Although not only accuracy but also efficiency for scalability is important, some previous methods struggle to capture heterogeneity such as varying traffic patterns across regions and time periods. Moreover, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which are the mainstream of traffic prediction, not only require predefined adjacency matrix, but also limit scalability to large-scale data containing many nodes due to their inherent complexity. To overcome these limitations, we propose Deformable Dynamic Convolution Network (DDCN) for accurate yet efficient traffic prediction. Traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are limited in modeling non-Euclidean spatial structures and spatio-temporal heterogeneity, DDCN overcomes these challenges by dynamically applying deformable filters based on offset. Specifically, DDCN decomposes transformer-style CNN to encoder-decoder structure, and applies proposed approaches to the spatial and spatio-temporal attention blocks of the encoder to emphasize important features. The decoder, composed of feed-forward module, complements the output of the encoder. This novel structure make DDCN can perform accurate yet efficient traffic prediction. In comprehensive experiments on four real-world datasets, DDCN achieves competitive performance, emphasizing the potential and effectiveness of CNN-based approaches for spatio-temporal traffic prediction.</p></details> | 7 pages |

However, the inherent time variance of many spatio-temporal systems poses challenges to achieving accurate predictions whenever stationarity is not granted. In order to address non-stationarity, we propose a Distribution and Relation Adaptive Network (DRAN) capable of dynamically adapting to relation and distribution changes over time. While temporal normalization and de-normalization are frequently used techniques to adapt to distribution shifts, this operation is not suitable for the spatio-temporal context as temporal normalization scales the time series of nodes and possibly disrupts the spatial relations among nodes. In order to address this problem, a Spatial Factor Learner (SFL) module is developed that enables the normalization and de-normalization process. To adapt to dynamic changes in spatial relationships among sensors, we propose a Dynamic-Static Fusion Learner (DSFL) module that effectively integrates features learned from both dynamic and static relations through an adaptive fusion ratio mechanism. Furthermore, we introduce a Stochastic Learner to capture the noisy components of spatio-temporal representations. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on weather prediction and traffic flow forecasting tasks.Experimental results show that our SFL efficiently preserves spatial relationships across various temporal normalization operations. Visualizations of the learned dynamic and static relations demonstrate that DSFL can capture both local and distant relationships between nodes.</p></details> | 15 pages, 10 figures |

Spatio-Temporal Anomaly detection plays an important role in ensuring system security and operational integrity. However, current data-driven approaches, largely driven by black-box deep learning, face challenges in interpretability, adaptability to distribution shifts, and robustness under evolving system dynamics. In this paper, we advocate for a causal learning perspective to advance anomaly detection in spatially distributed infrastructures that grounds detection in structural cause-effect relationships. We identify and formalize three key directions: causal graph profiling, multi-view fusion, and continual causal graph learning, each offering distinct advantages in uncovering dynamic cause-effect structures across time and space. Drawing on real-world insights from systems such as water treatment infrastructures, we illustrate how causal models provide early warning signals and root cause attribution, addressing the limitations of black-box detectors. Looking ahead, we outline the future research agenda centered on multi-modality, generative AI-driven, and scalable adaptive causal frameworks. Our objective is to lay a new research trajectory toward scalable, adaptive, explainable, and spatially grounded anomaly detection systems. We hope to inspire a paradigm shift in cybersecurity research, promoting causality-driven approaches to address evolving threats in interconnected infrastructures.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 1 figure, Under Review in Vision Paper Track-ACM SIGSPATIAL 2025</p></details> |

To address this, we propose a training-free spatio-temporal token merging method, named STTM. Our key insight is to exploit local spatial and temporal redundancy in video data which has been overlooked in prior work. STTM first transforms each frame into multi-granular spatial tokens using a coarse-to-fine search over a quadtree structure, then performs directed pairwise merging across the temporal dimension. This decomposed merging approach outperforms existing token reduction methods across six video QA benchmarks. Notably, STTM achieves a 2$\times$ speed-up with only a 0.5% accuracy drop under a 50% token budget, and a 3$\times$ speed-up with just a 2% drop under a 30% budget. Moreover, STTM is query-agnostic, allowing KV cache reuse across different questions for the same video.

While most existing benchmarks evaluate models under offline settings with a fixed set of pre-recorded inputs, we introduce OST-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate Online Spatio-Temporal understanding from the perspective of an agent actively exploring a scene. The Online aspect emphasizes the need to process and reason over incrementally acquired observations, while the Spatio-Temporal component requires integrating current visual inputs with historical memory to support dynamic spatial reasoning. OST-Bench better reflects the challenges of real-world embodied perception. Built on an efficient data collection pipeline, OST-Bench consists of 1.4k scenes and 10k question-answer pairs collected from ScanNet, Matterport3D, and ARKitScenes. We evaluate several leading MLLMs on OST-Bench and observe that they fall short on tasks requiring complex spatio-temporal reasoning. Under the online setting, their accuracy declines as the exploration horizon extends and the memory grows. Through further experimental analysis, we identify common error patterns across models and find that both complex clue-based spatial reasoning demands and long-term memory retrieval requirements significantly drop model performance along two separate axes, highlighting the core challenges that must be addressed to improve online embodied reasoning.

Although various domain adaptation and generalization methods were proposed to promote the adaptability of deep-based rPPG models in unseen deployment environments, considerations in aspects like privacy concerns and real-time adaptation restrict their application in real-world deployment. Thus, we aim to propose a novel fully Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) strategy tailored for rPPG tasks in this work. Specifically, based on prior knowledge in physiology and our observations, we noticed not only there is spatio-temporal consistency in the frequency domain of rPPG signals, but also that inconsistency in the time domain was significant. Given this, by leveraging both consistency and inconsistency priors, we introduce an innovative expert knowledge-based self-supervised \textbf{C}onsistency-\textbf{i}n\textbf{C}onsistency-\textbf{i}ntegration (\textbf{CiCi}) framework to enhances model adaptation during inference. Besides, our approach further incorporates a gradient dynamic control mechanism to mitigate potential conflicts between priors, ensuring stable adaptation across instances. Through extensive experiments on five diverse datasets under the TTA protocol, our method consistently outperforms existing techniques, presenting state-of-the-art performance in real-time self-supervised adaptation without accessing source data. The code will be released later.</p></details> |  |

The standard neuron model for spike-based computation on such systems has long been the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron. A computationally light augmentation of the LIF neuron model with an adaptation mechanism has recently been shown to exhibit superior performance on spatio-temporal processing tasks. The root of the superiority of these so-called adaptive LIF neurons however is not well understood. In this article, we thoroughly analyze the dynamical, computational, and learning properties of adaptive LIF neurons and networks thereof. Our investigation reveals significant challenges related to stability and parameterization when employing the conventional Euler-Forward discretization for this class of models. We report a rigorous theoretical and empirical demonstration that these challenges can be effectively addressed by adopting an alternative discretization approach - the Symplectic Euler method, allowing to improve over state-of-the-art performances on common event-based benchmark datasets. Our further analysis of the computational properties of networks of adaptive LIF neurons shows that they are particularly well suited to exploit the spatio-temporal structure of input sequences without any normalization techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Nature Communications, July 2025</p></details> |

Recent studies have typically focused on fusing cross-domain spatio-temporal data to train unified Transformer-based models. However, these models suffer from quadratic computational complexity and high memory overhead, limiting their scalability and practical deployment. Inspired by the efficiency of Mamba, a state space model with linear time complexity, we explore its potential for efficient urban spatio-temporal prediction. However, directly applying Mamba as a spatio-temporal backbone leads to negative transfer and severe performance degradation. This is primarily due to spatio-temporal heterogeneity and the recursive mechanism of Mamba's hidden state updates, which limit cross-domain generalization. To overcome these challenges, we propose Damba-ST, a novel domain-adaptive Mamba-based model for efficient urban spatio-temporal prediction. Damba-ST retains Mamba's linear complexity advantage while significantly enhancing its adaptability to heterogeneous domains. Specifically, we introduce two core innovations: (1) a domain-adaptive state space model that partitions the latent representation space into a shared subspace for learning cross-domain commonalities and independent, domain-specific subspaces for capturing intra-domain discriminative features; (2) three distinct Domain Adapters, which serve as domain-aware proxies to bridge disparate domain distributions and facilitate the alignment of cross-domain commonalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate the generalization and efficiency of Damba-ST. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on prediction tasks and demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization, enabling seamless deployment in new urban environments without extensive retraining or fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present ST-GRIT, a spatio-temporal graph transformer for ice layer thickness, designed to process these radargrams and capture the spatiotemporal relationships between shallow and deep ice layers. ST-GRIT leverages an inductive geometric graph learning framework to extract local spatial features as feature embeddings and employs a series of temporal and spatial attention blocks separately to model long-range dependencies effectively in both dimensions. Experimental evaluation on radargram data from the Greenland ice sheet demonstrates that ST-GRIT consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art methods and other baseline graph neural networks by achieving lower root mean-squared error. These results highlight the advantages of self-attention mechanisms on graphs over pure graph neural networks, including the ability to handle noise, avoid oversmoothing, and capture long-range dependencies. Moreover, the use of separate spatial and temporal attention blocks allows for distinct and robust learning of spatial relationships and temporal patterns, providing a more comprehensive and effective approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for 2025 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)</p></details> |
| **[Accelerated Spatio-Temporal Bayesian Modeling for Multivariate Gaussian Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06938v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate Gaussian processes (GPs) offer a powerful probabilistic framework to represent complex interdependent phenomena. They pose, however, significant computational challenges in high-dimensional settings, which frequently arise in spatial-temporal applications. We present DALIA, a highly scalable framework for performing Bayesian inference tasks on spatio-temporal multivariate GPs, based on the methodology of integrated nested Laplace approximations. Our approach relies on a sparse inverse covariance matrix formulation of the GP, puts forward a GPU-accelerated block-dense approach, and introduces a hierarchical, triple-layer, distributed memory parallel scheme. We showcase weak scaling performance surpassing the state-of-the-art by two orders of magnitude on a model whose parameter space is 8$\times$ larger and measure strong scaling speedups of three orders of magnitude when running on 496 GH200 superchips on the Alps supercomputer. Applying DALIA to air pollution data from northern Italy over 48 days, we showcase refined spatial resolutions over the aggregated pollutant measurements.</p></details> |  |
| **[DIFFUMA: High-Fidelity Spatio-Temporal Video Prediction via Dual-Path Mamba and Diffusion Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06738v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal video prediction plays a pivotal role in critical domains, ranging from weather forecasting to industrial automation. However, in high-precision industrial scenarios such as semiconductor manufacturing, the absence of specialized benchmark datasets severely hampers research on modeling and predicting complex processes. To address this challenge, we make a twofold contribution.First, we construct and release the Chip Dicing Lane Dataset (CHDL), the first public temporal image dataset dedicated to the semiconductor wafer dicing process. Captured via an industrial-grade vision system, CHDL provides a much-needed and challenging benchmark for high-fidelity process modeling, defect detection, and digital twin development.Second, we propose DIFFUMA, an innovative dual-path prediction architecture specifically designed for such fine-grained dynamics. The model captures global long-range temporal context through a parallel Mamba module, while simultaneously leveraging a diffusion module, guided by temporal features, to restore and enhance fine-grained spatial details, effectively combating feature degradation. Experiments demonstrate that on our CHDL benchmark, DIFFUMA significantly outperforms existing methods, reducing the Mean Squared Error (MSE) by 39% and improving the Structural Similarity (SSIM) from 0.926 to a near-perfect 0.988. This superior performance also generalizes to natural phenomena datasets. Our work not only delivers a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) model but, more importantly, provides the community with an invaluable data resource to drive future research in industrial AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging Sequential Deep Operator Network and Video Diffusion: Residual Refinement of Spatio-Temporal PDE Solutions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06133v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video-diffusion models have recently set the standard in video generation, inpainting, and domain translation thanks to their training stability and high perceptual fidelity. Building on these strengths, we repurpose conditional video diffusion as a physics surrogate for spatio-temporal fields governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). Our two-stage surrogate first applies a Sequential Deep Operator Network (S-DeepONet) to produce a coarse, physics-consistent prior from the prescribed boundary or loading conditions. The prior is then passed to a conditional video diffusion model that learns only the residual: the point-wise difference between the ground truth and the S-DeepONet prediction. By shifting the learning burden from the full solution to its much smaller residual space, diffusion can focus on sharpening high-frequency structures without sacrificing global coherence. The framework is assessed on two disparate benchmarks: (i) vortex-dominated lid-driven cavity flow and (ii) tensile plastic deformation of dogbone specimens. Across these data sets the hybrid surrogate consistently outperforms its single-stage counterpart, cutting the mean relative L2 error from 4.57% to 0.83% for the flow problem and from 4.42% to 2.94% for plasticity, a relative improvements of 81.8% and 33.5% respectively. The hybrid approach not only lowers quantitative errors but also improves visual quality, visibly recovering fine spatial details. These results show that (i) conditioning diffusion on a physics-aware prior enables faithful reconstruction of localized features, (ii) residual learning reduces the problem, accelerating convergence and enhancing accuracy, and (iii) the same architecture transfers seamlessly from incompressible flow to nonlinear elasto-plasticity without problem-specific architectural modifications, highlighting its broad applicability to nonlinear, time-dependent continua.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distributionally Robust Predictive Runtime Verification under Spatio-Temporal Logic Specifications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02964v2)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cyber-physical systems (CPS) designed in simulators, often consisting of multiple interacting agents (e.g. in multi-agent formations), behave differently in the real-world. We want to verify these systems during runtime when they are deployed. We thus propose robust predictive runtime verification (RPRV) algorithms for: (1) general stochastic CPS under signal temporal logic (STL) tasks, and (2) stochastic multi-agent systems (MAS) under spatio-temporal logic tasks. The RPRV problem presents the following challenges: (1) there may not be sufficient data on the behavior of the deployed CPS, (2) predictive models based on design phase system trajectories may encounter distribution shift during real-world deployment, and (3) the algorithms need to scale to the complexity of MAS and be applicable to spatio-temporal logic tasks. To address the challenges, we assume knowledge of an upper bound on the statistical distance between the trajectory distributions of the system at deployment and design time. We are motivated by our prior work [1, 2] where we proposed an accurate and an interpretable RPRV algorithm for general CPS, which we here extend to the MAS setting and spatio-temporal logic tasks. Specifically, we use a learned predictive model to estimate the system behavior at runtime and robust conformal prediction to obtain probabilistic guarantees by accounting for distribution shifts. Building on [1], we perform robust conformal prediction over the robust semantics of spatio-temporal reach and escape logic (STREL) to obtain centralized RPRV algorithms for MAS. We empirically validate our results in a drone swarm simulator, where we show the scalability of our RPRV algorithms to MAS and analyze the impact of different trajectory predictors on the verification result. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first statistically valid algorithms for MAS under distribution shift.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2311.09482</p></details> |

Specifically, it is challenging to address prompts that refer to 1) the entirety of an environment that an agent equipped with an MLLM can operate in; and simultaneously also refer to 2) recent actions that just happened and are encoded in a video clip. However, such a holistic spatio-temporal understanding is important for agents operating in the real world. To address this issue, we first develop a framework to collect a large-scale dataset. Using the collected "Reasoning about Environments and Actions" (REA) dataset, we show that recent methods indeed struggle to correctly answer the prompts. To improve, we develop a "spatio-temporal LLM" (ST-LLM), a model equipped with projectors to improve both spatial understanding of an environment and temporal understanding of recent observations. On the collected REA data, we show that the proposed method significantly improves results compared to prior work.

Existing methods often prioritize the development of intricate neural networks to capture the complex dependencies of the data. These methods neglect node-level heterogeneity and face over-parameterization when attempting to model node-specific characteristics. In this paper, we present a novel low-rank adaptation framework for existing spatio-temporal prediction models, termed \model, which alleviates the aforementioned problems through node-level adjustments. Specifically, we introduce the node-adaptive low-rank layer and node-specific predictor, capturing the complex functional characteristics of nodes while maintaining computational efficiency. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that our method consistently achieves superior performance across various forecasting models with minimal computational overhead, improving performance by 7% with only 1% additional parameter cost.

Current video-based approaches, while proficient in tracking, lack the sophisticated reasoning capabilities of large language models, limiting their contextual understanding and generalization. We introduce VideoMolmo, a large multimodal model tailored for fine-grained spatio-temporal pointing conditioned on textual descriptions. Building upon the Molmo architecture, VideoMolmo incorporates a temporal module utilizing an attention mechanism to condition each frame on preceding frames, ensuring temporal consistency. Additionally, our novel temporal mask fusion pipeline employs SAM2 for bidirectional point propagation, significantly enhancing coherence across video sequences. This two-step decomposition, i.e., first using the LLM to generate precise pointing coordinates, then relying on a sequential mask-fusion module to produce coherent segmentation, not only simplifies the task for the language model but also enhances interpretability. Due to the lack of suitable datasets, we curate a comprehensive dataset comprising 72k video-caption pairs annotated with 100k object points. To evaluate the generalization of VideoMolmo, we introduce VPoS-Bench, a challenging out-of-distribution benchmark spanning five real-world scenarios: Cell Tracking, Egocentric Vision, Autonomous Driving, Video-GUI Interaction, and Robotics. We also evaluate our model on Referring Video Object Segmentation (Refer-VOS) and Reasoning VOS tasks. In comparison to existing models, VideoMolmo substantially improves spatio-temporal pointing accuracy and reasoning capability.

| **[Spatio-temporal smoothing, interpolation and prediction of income distributions based on grouped data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08384v3)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Housing and Land Survey (HLS) of Japan provides municipality-level grouped data on household incomes. Although these data can be used for effective local policymaking, their analyses are hindered by several challenges, such as limited information attributed to grouping, the presence of non-sampled areas, and the very low frequency of implementing surveys. To address these challenges, we propose a novel grouped-data-based spatio-temporal finite mixture model for estimating the income distributions of multiple spatial units at multiple time points. A unique feature of the proposed method is that all the areas share common latent distributions and that the mixing proportions, including spatial and temporal effects, capture the potential area-wise heterogeneity. Thus, incorporating these effects can smooth out the quantities of interest over time and space, impute missing values, and predict future values. By treating the HLS data with the proposed method, we obtain complete maps of the income and inequality measures at an arbitrary time, which can facilitate rapid and efficient policymaking with fine granularity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Representation Decoupling and Enhancement for Federated Instrument Segmentation in Surgical Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23759v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Surgical instrument segmentation under Federated Learning (FL) is a promising direction, which enables multiple surgical sites to collaboratively train the model without centralizing datasets. However, there exist very limited FL works in surgical data science, and FL methods for other modalities do not consider inherent characteristics in surgical domain: i) different scenarios show diverse anatomical backgrounds while highly similar instrument representation; ii) there exist surgical simulators which promote large-scale synthetic data generation with minimal efforts. In this paper, we propose a novel Personalized FL scheme, Spatio-Temporal Representation Decoupling and Enhancement (FedST), which wisely leverages surgical domain knowledge during both local-site and global-server training to boost segmentation. Concretely, our model embraces a Representation Separation and Cooperation (RSC) mechanism in local-site training, which decouples the query embedding layer to be trained privately, to encode respective backgrounds. Meanwhile, other parameters are optimized globally to capture the consistent representations of instruments, including the temporal layer to capture similar motion patterns. A textual-guided channel selection is further designed to highlight site-specific features, facilitating model adapta tion to each site. Moreover, in global-server training, we propose Synthesis-based Explicit Representation Quantification (SERQ), which defines an explicit representation target based on synthetic data to synchronize the model convergence during fusion for improving model generalization.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we explore the potential of adapter tuning in image-to-video model adaptation and propose a novel video adapter tuning framework, called Disentangled-and-Deformable Spatio-Temporal Adapter (D$^2$ST-Adapter). It features a lightweight design, low adaptation overhead and powerful spatio-temporal feature adaptation capabilities. D$^2$ST-Adapter is structured with an internal dual-pathway architecture that enables built-in disentangled encoding of spatial and temporal features within the adapter, seamlessly integrating into the single-stream feature learning framework of pre-trained image models. In particular, we develop an efficient yet effective implementation of the D$^2$ST-Adapter, incorporating the specially devised anisotropic Deformable Spatio-Temporal Attention as its pivotal operation. This mechanism can be individually tailored for two pathways with anisotropic sampling densities along the spatial and temporal domains in 3D spatio-temporal space, enabling disentangled encoding of spatial and temporal features while maintaining a lightweight design. Extensive experiments by instantiating our method on both pre-trained ResNet and ViT demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art methods. Our method is particularly well-suited to challenging scenarios where temporal dynamics are critical for action recognition.

We propose the Intervention-Aware Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network (IA-STGNN), a novel framework that closes the causal loop from tactical input to strategic delay output. The model integrates graph attention mechanisms, counterfactual simulation units, and spatial intervention node reconstruction to enable dynamic simulations of strike configurations and synchronization strategies. Training data are generated from a multi-physics simulation platform (GEANT4 + COMSOL) under NIST SP 800-160 standards, ensuring structural traceability and policy-level validation. Experimental results demonstrate that IA-STGNN significantly outperforms baseline models (ST-GNN, GCN-LSTM, XGBoost), achieving a 12.8 percent reduction in MAE and 18.4 percent increase in Top-5 percent accuracy, while improving causal path consistency and intervention stability. IA-STGNN enables interpretable prediction of strategic delay and supports applications such as nuclear deterrence simulation, diplomatic window assessment, and multi-strategy optimization, providing a structured and transparent AI decision-support mechanism for high-level policy modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper proposes the first closed-loop causal modeling framework (IA-STGNN) that links tactical strike variables to strategic delay outcomes via graph neural networks with counterfactual reasoning</p></details> |

This work aims to provide additional insight into the association between dengue and climate in the Philippines. We employ a two-stage modelling framework: the first stage fits climate models, while the second stage fits a health model that uses the climate predictions from the first stage as inputs. We postulate a Bayesian spatio-temporal model and use the integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) approach for inference. To account for the uncertainty in the climate models, we perform posterior sampling and then perform Bayesian model averaging to compute the final posterior estimates of second-stage model parameters. The results indicate that temperature is positively associated with dengue, although extremely hot conditions tend to have a negative effect. Moreover, the relationship between rainfall and dengue varies in space. In areas with uniform amounts of rainfall all year round, rainfall is negatively associated with dengue. In contrast, in regions with pronounced dry and wet season, rainfall shows a positive association with dengue. Finally, there remains unexplained structured variation in space and time after accounting for the impact of climate variables and other covariates.</p></details> |  |
| **[VideoFusion: A Spatio-Temporal Collaborative Network for Multi-modal Video Fusion and Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23359v2)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Compared to images, videos better align with real-world acquisition scenarios and possess valuable temporal cues. However, existing multi-sensor fusion research predominantly integrates complementary context from multiple images rather than videos. This primarily stems from two factors: 1) the scarcity of large-scale multi-sensor video datasets, limiting research in video fusion, and 2) the inherent difficulty of jointly modeling spatial and temporal dependencies in a unified framework. This paper proactively compensates for the dilemmas. First, we construct M3SVD, a benchmark dataset with $220$ temporally synchronized and spatially registered infrared-visible video pairs comprising 153,797 frames, filling the data gap for the video fusion community. Secondly, we propose VideoFusion, a multi-modal video fusion model that fully exploits cross-modal complementarity and temporal dynamics to generate spatio-temporally coherent videos from (potentially degraded) multi-modal inputs. Specifically, 1) a differential reinforcement module is developed for cross-modal information interaction and enhancement, 2) a complete modality-guided fusion strategy is employed to adaptively integrate multi-modal features, and 3) a bi-temporal co-attention mechanism is devised to dynamically aggregate forward-backward temporal contexts to reinforce cross-frame feature representations. Extensive experiments reveal that VideoFusion outperforms existing image-oriented fusion paradigms in sequential scenarios, effectively mitigating temporal inconsistency and interference.</p></details> |  |
| **[CAST: Cross-Attentive Spatio-Temporal feature fusion for Deepfake detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21711v1)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deepfakes have emerged as a significant threat to digital media authenticity, increasing the need for advanced detection techniques that can identify subtle and time-dependent manipulations. CNNs are effective at capturing spatial artifacts, and Transformers excel at modeling temporal inconsistencies. However, many existing CNN-Transformer models process spatial and temporal features independently. In particular, attention-based methods often use separate attention mechanisms for spatial and temporal features and combine them using naive approaches like averaging, addition, or concatenation, which limits the depth of spatio-temporal interaction. To address this challenge, we propose a unified CAST model that leverages cross-attention to effectively fuse spatial and temporal features in a more integrated manner. Our approach allows temporal features to dynamically attend to relevant spatial regions, enhancing the model's ability to detect fine-grained, time-evolving artifacts such as flickering eyes or warped lips. This design enables more precise localization and deeper contextual understanding, leading to improved performance across diverse and challenging scenarios. We evaluate the performance of our model using the FaceForensics++, Celeb-DF, and DeepfakeDetection datasets in both intra- and cross-dataset settings to affirm the superiority of our approach. Our model achieves strong performance with an AUC of 99.49 percent and an accuracy of 97.57 percent in intra-dataset evaluations. In cross-dataset testing, it demonstrates impressive generalization by achieving a 93.31 percent AUC on the unseen DeepfakeDetection dataset. These results highlight the effectiveness of cross-attention-based feature fusion in enhancing the robustness of deepfake video detection.</p></details> | 50 pages, 6 figures |
| **[A Modular Multitask Reasoning Framework Integrating Spatio-temporal Models and LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20073v1)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal data mining plays a pivotal role in informed decision making across diverse domains. However, existing models are often restricted to narrow tasks, lacking the capacity for multi-task inference and complex long-form reasoning that require generation of in-depth, explanatory outputs. These limitations restrict their applicability to real-world, multi-faceted decision scenarios. In this work, we introduce STReason, a novel framework that integrates the reasoning strengths of large language models (LLMs) with the analytical capabilities of spatio-temporal models for multi-task inference and execution. Without requiring task-specific finetuning, STReason leverages in-context learning to decompose complex natural language queries into modular, interpretable programs, which are then systematically executed to generate both solutions and detailed rationales. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we construct a new benchmark dataset and propose a unified evaluation framework with metrics specifically designed for long-form spatio-temporal reasoning. Experimental results show that STReason significantly outperforms advanced LLM baselines across all metrics, particularly excelling in complex, reasoning-intensive spatio-temporal scenarios. Human evaluations further validate STReason's credibility and practical utility, demonstrating its potential to reduce expert workload and broaden the applicability to real-world spatio-temporal tasks. We believe STReason provides a promising direction for developing more capable and generalizable spatio-temporal reasoning systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Spatio-Temporal Point Process for Fine-Grained Modeling of Reading Behavior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19999v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reading is a process that unfolds across space and time, alternating between fixations where a reader focuses on a specific point in space, and saccades where a reader rapidly shifts their focus to a new point. An ansatz of psycholinguistics is that modeling a reader's fixations and saccades yields insight into their online sentence processing. However, standard approaches to such modeling rely on aggregated eye-tracking measurements and models that impose strong assumptions, ignoring much of the spatio-temporal dynamics that occur during reading. In this paper, we propose a more general probabilistic model of reading behavior, based on a marked spatio-temporal point process, that captures not only how long fixations last, but also where they land in space and when they take place in time. The saccades are modeled using a Hawkes process, which captures how each fixation excites the probability of a new fixation occurring near it in time and space. The duration time of fixation events is modeled as a function of fixation-specific predictors convolved across time, thus capturing spillover effects. Empirically, our Hawkes process model exhibits a better fit to human saccades than baselines. With respect to fixation durations, we observe that incorporating contextual surprisal as a predictor results in only a marginal improvement in the model's predictive accuracy. This finding suggests that surprisal theory struggles to explain fine-grained eye movements.</p></details> | ACL 2025 |
| **[RePST: Language Model Empowered Spatio-Temporal Forecasting via Semantic-Oriented Reprogramming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14505v3)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal forecasting is pivotal in numerous real-world applications, including transportation planning, energy management, and climate monitoring. In this work, we aim to harness the reasoning and generalization abilities of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) for more effective spatio-temporal forecasting, particularly in data-scarce scenarios. However, recent studies uncover that PLMs, which are primarily trained on textual data, often falter when tasked with modeling the intricate correlations in numerical time series, thereby limiting their effectiveness in comprehending spatio-temporal data. To bridge the gap, we propose RePST, a semantic-oriented PLM reprogramming framework tailored for spatio-temporal forecasting. Specifically, we first propose a semantic-oriented decomposer that adaptively disentangles spatially correlated time series into interpretable sub-components, which facilitates PLM to understand sophisticated spatio-temporal dynamics via a divide-and-conquer strategy. Moreover, we propose a selective discrete reprogramming scheme, which introduces an expanded spatio-temporal vocabulary space to project spatio-temporal series into discrete representations. This scheme minimizes the information loss during reprogramming and enriches the representations derived by PLMs. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that the proposed RePST outperforms twelve state-of-the-art baseline methods, particularly in data-scarce scenarios, highlighting the effectiveness and superior generalization capabilities of PLMs for spatio-temporal forecasting.

Thyroid nodules are frequently detected through ultrasound (US) imaging, and some require further evaluation via fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy. Despite its effectiveness, FNA often leads to unnecessary biopsies of benign nodules, causing patient discomfort and anxiety. To address this, the American College of Radiology Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TI-RADS) has been developed to reduce benign biopsies. However, such systems are limited by interobserver variability. Recent deep learning approaches have sought to improve risk stratification, but they often fail to utilize the rich temporal and spatial context provided by US cine clips, which contain dynamic global information and surrounding structural changes across various views. In this work, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Cross Attention for Cine Thyroid Ultrasound Time Series Classification (STACT-Time) model, a novel representation learning framework that integrates imaging features from US cine clips with features from segmentation masks automatically generated by a pretrained model. By leveraging self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms, our model captures the rich temporal and spatial context of US cine clips while enhancing feature representation through segmentation-guided learning. Our model improves malignancy prediction compared to state-of-the-art models, achieving a cross-validation precision of 0.91 (plus or minus 0.02) and an F1 score of 0.89 (plus or minus 0.02). By reducing unnecessary biopsies of benign nodules while maintaining high sensitivity for malignancy detection, our model has the potential to enhance clinical decision-making and improve patient outcomes.</p></details> |  |

However, existing Geographic Information Systems (GIS)-based systems struggle to integrate and manage of such large-scale and diverse data sources. To address these challenges, this paper proposes G-SEED (GeoSOT-based Scalable Encoding and Extraction for Forest and Grassland Spatio-temporal Data), a unified encoding and management framework based on the hierarchical GeoSOT (Geographical coordinate global Subdivision grid with One dimension integer on 2n tree) grid system. G-SEED integrates spatial, temporal, and type information into a composite code, enabling consistent encoding of both structured and unstructured data, including remote sensing imagery, vector maps, sensor records, documents, and multimedia content. The framework incorporates adaptive grid-level selection, center-cell-based indexing, and full-coverage grid arrays to optimize spatial querying and compression. Through extensive experiments on a real-world dataset from Shennongjia National Park (China), G-SEED demonstrates superior performance in spatial precision control, cross-source consistency, query efficiency, and compression compared to mainstream methods such as Geohash and H3. This study provides a scalable and reusable paradigm for the unified organization of forest and grassland big data, supporting dynamic monitoring and intelligent decision-making in these domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 2 figures.

While prior work has improved the timeliness and accuracy of spatio-temporal forecasting, converting these forecasts into actionable strategies remains a key challenge. A main limitation is the decoupling of the prediction and the downstream decision phases, which can significantly degrade the downstream efficiency. For example, in emergency response, the priority is successful resource allocation and intervention, not just incident prediction. To this end, it is essential to propose an Adaptive Spatio-Temporal Early Decision model (ASTER) that reforms the forecasting paradigm from event anticipation to actionable decision support. This framework ensures that information is directly used for decision-making, thereby maximizing overall effectiveness. Specifically, ASTER introduces a new Resource-aware Spatio-Temporal interaction module (RaST) that adaptively captures long- and short-term dependencies under dynamic resource conditions, producing context-aware spatiotemporal representations. To directly generate actionable decisions, we further design a Preference-oriented decision agent (Poda) based on multi-objective reinforcement learning, which transforms predictive signals into resource-efficient intervention strategies by deriving optimal actions under specific preferences and dynamic constraints. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of ASTER in improving both early prediction accuracy and resource allocation outcomes across six downstream metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>ASTER...</summary><p>ASTER: Adaptive Spatio-Temporal Early Decision Model for Dynamic Resource Allocation</p></details> |

This issue is particularly challenging in spatio-temporal analyses, where it has been less explored so far. To study the effects of air pollution on mortality in Italy, we argue that a model that simultaneously accounts for spatio-temporal confounding and for the non-linear form of the effect of interest is needed. To this end, we propose a Bayesian spatial dynamic generalized linear model, which allows for a non-linear association and for a decomposition of the exposure effect into two components. This decomposition accommodates associations with the outcome at fine and coarse temporal and spatial scales of variation. These features, when combined, allow reducing the spatio-temporal confounding bias and recovering the true shape of the association, as demonstrated through simulation studies. The results from the real-data application indicate that the exposure effect seems to have different magnitudes in different seasons, with peaks in the summer. We hypothesize that this could be due to possible interactions between the exposure variable with air temperature and unmeasured confounders.</p></details> | 46 pages, 11 figures |

Genesis employs a two-stage architecture that integrates a DiT-based video diffusion model with 3D-VAE encoding, and a BEV-aware LiDAR generator with NeRF-based rendering and adaptive sampling. Both modalities are directly coupled through a shared latent space, enabling coherent evolution across visual and geometric domains. To guide the generation with structured semantics, we introduce DataCrafter, a captioning module built on vision-language models that provides scene-level and instance-level supervision. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that Genesis achieves state-of-the-art performance across video and LiDAR metrics (FVD 16.95, FID 4.24, Chamfer 0.611), and benefits downstream tasks including segmentation and 3D detection, validating the semantic fidelity and practical utility of the generated data.</p></details> |  |

However, modeling real-world environments presents unique challenges as they dynamically change across both space and, crucially, time. To capture these composed dynamics, we introduce a Spatio-Temporal Road Image Dataset for Exploration (STRIDE) permuting 360-degree panoramic imagery into rich interconnected observation, state and action nodes. Leveraging this structure, we can simultaneously model the relationship between egocentric views, positional coordinates, and movement commands across both space and time. We benchmark this dataset via TARDIS, a transformer-based generative world model that integrates spatial and temporal dynamics through a unified autoregressive framework trained on STRIDE. We demonstrate robust performance across a range of agentic tasks such as controllable photorealistic image synthesis, instruction following, autonomous self-control, and state-of-the-art georeferencing. These results suggest a promising direction towards sophisticated generalist agents--capable of understanding and manipulating the spatial and temporal aspects of their material environments--with enhanced embodied reasoning capabilities. Training code, datasets, and model checkpoints are made available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Tera-AI/STRIDE.</p></details> | <details><summary>Compu...</summary><p>Computer Vision, Pattern Recognition, Early-Fusion, Dataset, Data Augmentation</p></details> |

The proposed system requires neither access to multi-channel training data nor prior knowledge about the number or placement of microphones. It works for both a compact microphone array and distributed microphones, with minor adjustments. Due to its superior handling of overlapping speech during segmentation, the proposed pipeline significantly outperforms the single-channel pyannote approach, both in a scenario with a compact microphone array and in a setup with distributed microphones. Additionally, we show that, unlike fully spatial diarization pipelines, the proposed system can correctly track speakers when they change positions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Interspeech 2025</p></details> |

In order to summarise information encompassed in such data, we combine two well known statistical modelling methods. To account for the spatial dimension, we use the intrinsic modification of the conditional autoregression, and incorporate it with the hidden Markov model, allowing the spatial patterns to vary over time. We apply our method into parish register data considering deaths caused by measles in Finland in 1750-1850, and gain novel insight of previously undiscovered infection dynamics. Five distinctive, reoccurring states describing spatially and temporally differing infection burden and potential routes of spread are identified. We also find that there is a change in the occurrences of the most typical spatial patterns circa 1812, possibly due to changes in communication routes after major administrative transformations in Finland.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we leverage a large-scale spatio-temporal dataset collected from Peru's national Digital Contact Tracing (DCT) application during the COVID-19 pandemic to forecast mobility flows across urban regions. A key challenge lies in the spatial sparsity of hourly mobility counts across hexagonal grid cells, which limits the predictive power of conventional time series models. To address this, we propose a lightweight and model-agnostic Spatial Neighbourhood Fusion (SPN) technique that augments each cell's features with aggregated signals from its immediate H3 neighbors. We evaluate this strategy on three forecasting backbones: NLinear, PatchTST, and K-U-Net, under various historical input lengths. Experimental results show that SPN consistently improves forecasting performance, achieving up to 9.85 percent reduction in test MSE. Our findings demonstrate that spatial smoothing of sparse mobility signals provides a simple yet effective path toward robust spatio-temporal forecasting during public health crises.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we utilise statistical spatio-temporal methods to combine data from various sources and resolutions, aiming to model krill abundance. Our focus lies in fitting the model to a dataset comprising acoustic measurements of krill biomass. To achieve this, we integrate climate covariates obtained from satellite imagery and from drifting surface buoys (also known as drifters). Additionally, we use sparsely collected krill biomass data obtained from net fishing efforts (KRILLBASE) for validation. However, integrating these multiple heterogeneous data sources presents significant modelling challenges, including spatio-temporal misalignment and inflated zeros in the observed data. To address these challenges, we fit a Hurdle-Gamma model to jointly describe the occurrence of zeros and the krill biomass for the non-zero observations, while also accounting for misaligned and heterogeneous data sources, including drifters. Therefore, our work presents a comprehensive framework for analysing and predicting krill abundance in the Southern Ocean, leveraging information from various sources and formats. This is crucial due to the impact of krill fishing, as understanding their distribution is essential for informed management decisions and fishing regulations aimed at protecting the species.</p></details> |  |

While recent data-driven methods like deep reinforcement learning improve microscopic realism, they often overlook critical macroscopic features such as crowd density and flow, which are governed by spatio-temporal spawn dynamics, namely, when and where agents enter a scene. Traditional methods, like random spawn rates, stochastic processes, or fixed schedules, are not guaranteed to capture the underlying complexity or lack diversity and realism. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach called nTPP-GMM that models spatio-temporal spawn dynamics using Neural Temporal Point Processes (nTPPs) that are coupled with a spawn-conditional Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for agent spawn and goal positions. We evaluate our approach by orchestrating crowd simulations of three diverse real-world datasets with nTPP-GMM. Our experiments demonstrate the orchestration with nTPP-GMM leads to realistic simulations that reflect real-world crowd scenarios and allow crowd analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Using Deep Operators to Create Spatio-temporal Surrogates for Dynamical Systems under Uncertainty](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11761v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal data, which consists of responses or measurements gathered at different times and positions, is ubiquitous across diverse applications of civil infrastructure. While SciML methods have made significant progress in tackling the issue of response prediction for individual time histories, creating a full spatial-temporal surrogate remains a challenge. This study proposes a novel variant of deep operator networks (DeepONets), namely the full-field Extended DeepONet (FExD), to serve as a spatial-temporal surrogate that provides multi-output response predictions for dynamical systems. The proposed FExD surrogate model effectively learns the full solution operator across multiple degrees of freedom by enhancing the expressiveness of the branch network and expanding the predictive capabilities of the trunk network. The proposed FExD surrogate is deployed to simultaneously capture the dynamics at several sensing locations along a testbed model of a cable-stayed bridge subjected to stochastic ground motions. The ensuing response predictions from the FExD are comprehensively compared against both a vanilla DeepONet and a modified spatio-temporal Extended DeepONet. The results demonstrate the proposed FExD can achieve both superior accuracy and computational efficiency, representing a significant advancement in operator learning for structural dynamics applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[FAME: A Lightweight Spatio-Temporal Network for Model Attribution of Face-Swap Deepfakes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11477v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread emergence of face-swap Deepfake videos poses growing risks to digital security, privacy, and media integrity, necessitating effective forensic tools for identifying the source of such manipulations. Although most prior research has focused primarily on binary Deepfake detection, the task of model attribution -- determining which generative model produced a given Deepfake -- remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce FAME (Fake Attribution via Multilevel Embeddings), a lightweight and efficient spatio-temporal framework designed to capture subtle generative artifacts specific to different face-swap models. FAME integrates spatial and temporal attention mechanisms to improve attribution accuracy while remaining computationally efficient. We evaluate our model on three challenging and diverse datasets: Deepfake Detection and Manipulation (DFDM), FaceForensics++, and FakeAVCeleb. Results show that FAME consistently outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and runtime, highlighting its potential for deployment in real-world forensic and information security applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Attention-based Spatio-Temporal Neural Operator for Evolving Physics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11328v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In scientific machine learning (SciML), a key challenge is learning unknown, evolving physical processes and making predictions across spatio-temporal scales. For example, in real-world manufacturing problems like additive manufacturing, users adjust known machine settings while unknown environmental parameters simultaneously fluctuate. To make reliable predictions, it is desired for a model to not only capture long-range spatio-temporal interactions from data but also adapt to new and unknown environments; traditional machine learning models excel at the first task but often lack physical interpretability and struggle to generalize under varying environmental conditions. To tackle these challenges, we propose the Attention-based Spatio-Temporal Neural Operator (ASNO), a novel architecture that combines separable attention mechanisms for spatial and temporal interactions and adapts to unseen physical parameters. Inspired by the backward differentiation formula (BDF), ASNO learns a transformer for temporal prediction and extrapolation and an attention-based neural operator for handling varying external loads, enhancing interpretability by isolating historical state contributions and external forces, enabling the discovery of underlying physical laws and generalizability to unseen physical environments. Empirical results on SciML benchmarks demonstrate that ASNO outperforms over existing models, establishing its potential for engineering applications, physics discovery, and interpretable machine learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[CINeMA: Conditional Implicit Neural Multi-Modal Atlas for a Spatio-Temporal Representation of the Perinatal Brain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09668v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Magnetic resonance imaging of fetal and neonatal brains reveals rapid neurodevelopment marked by substantial anatomical changes unfolding within days. Studying this critical stage of the developing human brain, therefore, requires accurate brain models-referred to as atlases-of high spatial and temporal resolution. To meet these demands, established traditional atlases and recently proposed deep learning-based methods rely on large and comprehensive datasets. This poses a major challenge for studying brains in the presence of pathologies for which data remains scarce. We address this limitation with CINeMA (Conditional Implicit Neural Multi-Modal Atlas), a novel framework for creating high-resolution, spatio-temporal, multimodal brain atlases, suitable for low-data settings. Unlike established methods, CINeMA operates in latent space, avoiding compute-intensive image registration and reducing atlas construction times from days to minutes. Furthermore, it enables flexible conditioning on anatomical features including GA, birth age, and pathologies like ventriculomegaly (VM) and agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC). CINeMA supports downstream tasks such as tissue segmentation and age prediction whereas its generative properties enable synthetic data creation and anatomically informed data augmentation. Surpassing state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, efficiency, and versatility, CINeMA represents a powerful tool for advancing brain research. We release the code and atlases at https://github.com/m-dannecker/CINeMA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work currently under revision for IEEE TMI</p></details> |

However, existing time-to-space sequential methods often fail to effectively extract features in block-wise missing data scenarios. Meanwhile, the static graph structure for spatial feature propagation significantly constrains the models flexibility in handling the distribution shift issue for the nonstationary traffic data. To address these issues, this paper proposes a SpatioTemporal Attention Mixture of experts network named STAMImputer for traffic data imputation. Specifically, we introduce a Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework to capture latent spatio-temporal features and their influence weights, effectively imputing block missing. A novel Low-rank guided Sampling Graph ATtention (LrSGAT) mechanism is designed to dynamically balance the local and global correlations across road networks. The sampled attention vectors are utilized to generate dynamic graphs that capture real-time spatial correlations. Extensive experiments are conducted on four traffic datasets for evaluation. The result shows STAMImputer achieves significantly performance improvement compared with existing SOTA approaches.

Current memory systems often grapple with fundamental limitations in structural flexibility, temporal awareness, and the ability to synthesize higher-level insights from raw interaction data. This paper introduces Cognitive Weave, a novel memory framework centered around a multi-layered spatio-temporal resonance graph (STRG). This graph manages information as semantically rich insight particles (IPs), which are dynamically enriched with resonance keys, signifiers, and situational imprints via a dedicated semantic oracle interface (SOI). These IPs are interconnected through typed relational strands, forming an evolving knowledge tapestry. A key component of Cognitive Weave is the cognitive refinement process, an autonomous mechanism that includes the synthesis of insight aggregates (IAs) condensed, higher-level knowledge structures derived from identified clusters of related IPs. We present comprehensive experimental results demonstrating Cognitive Weave's marked enhancement over existing approaches in long-horizon planning tasks, evolving question-answering scenarios, and multi-session dialogue coherence. The system achieves a notable 34% average improvement in task completion rates and a 42% reduction in mean query latency when compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, this paper explores the ethical considerations inherent in such advanced memory systems, discusses the implications for long-term memory in LLMs, and outlines promising future research trajectories.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal State Space Model For Efficient Event-Based Optical Flow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07878v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event cameras unlock new frontiers that were previously unthinkable with standard frame-based cameras. One notable example is low-latency motion estimation (optical flow), which is critical for many real-time applications. In such applications, the computational efficiency of algorithms is paramount. Although recent deep learning paradigms such as CNN, RNN, or ViT have shown remarkable performance, they often lack the desired computational efficiency. Conversely, asynchronous event-based methods including SNNs and GNNs are computationally efficient; however, these approaches fail to capture sufficient spatio-temporal information, a powerful feature required to achieve better performance for optical flow estimation. In this work, we introduce Spatio-Temporal State Space Model (STSSM) module along with a novel network architecture to develop an extremely efficient solution with competitive performance. Our STSSM module leverages state-space models to effectively capture spatio-temporal correlations in event data, offering higher performance with lower complexity compared to ViT, CNN-based architectures in similar settings. Our model achieves 4.5x faster inference and 8x lower computations compared to TMA and 2x lower computations compared to EV-FlowNet with competitive performance on the DSEC benchmark.

In this work, we introduce ST-GraphNet, a spatio-temporal graph neural network framework designed to model and predict AV crash severity by using both fine-grained and region-aggregated spatial graphs. Using a balanced dataset of 2,352 real-world AV-related crash reports from Texas (2024), including geospatial coordinates, crash timestamps, SAE automation levels, and narrative descriptions, we construct two complementary graph representations: (1) a fine-grained graph with individual crash events as nodes, where edges are defined via spatio-temporal proximity; and (2) a coarse-grained graph where crashes are aggregated into Hexagonal Hierarchical Spatial Indexing (H3)-based spatial cells, connected through hexagonal adjacency. Each node in the graph is enriched with multimodal data, including semantic, spatial, and temporal attributes, including textual embeddings from crash narratives using a pretrained Sentence-BERT model. We evaluate various graph neural network (GNN) architectures, such as Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), Graph Attention Networks (GAT), and Dynamic Spatio-Temporal GCN (DSTGCN), to classify crash severity and predict high-risk regions. Our proposed ST-GraphNet, which utilizes a DSTGCN backbone on the coarse-grained H3 graph, achieves a test accuracy of 97.74\%, substantially outperforming the best fine-grained model (64.7\% test accuracy). These findings highlight the effectiveness of spatial aggregation, dynamic message passing, and multi-modal feature integration in capturing the complex spatio-temporal patterns underlying AV crash severity.</p></details> |  |

The framework automatically mines pre-defined traffic scenarios from any dataset using ground-truth annotations, provides an intuitive user interface for efficient human verification, and generates multiple-choice questions for model evaluation. Applied to the NuScenes dataset, we present STSnu, the first benchmark that evaluates the spatio-temporal reasoning capabilities of VLMs based on comprehensive 3D perception. Existing benchmarks typically target off-the-shelf or fine-tuned VLMs for images or videos from a single viewpoint and focus on semantic tasks such as object recognition, dense captioning, risk assessment, or scene understanding. In contrast, STSnu evaluates driving expert VLMs for end-to-end driving, operating on videos from multi-view cameras or LiDAR. It specifically assesses their ability to reason about both ego-vehicle actions and complex interactions among traffic participants, a crucial capability for autonomous vehicles. The benchmark features 43 diverse scenarios spanning multiple views and frames, resulting in 971 human-verified multiple-choice questions. A thorough evaluation uncovers critical shortcomings in existing models' ability to reason about fundamental traffic dynamics in complex environments. These findings highlight the urgent need for architectural advances that explicitly model spatio-temporal reasoning. By addressing a core gap in spatio-temporal evaluation, STSBench enables the development of more robust and explainable VLMs for autonomous driving.</p></details> | <details><summary>Datas...</summary><p>Dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/ivc-lrp/STSBench, Code: https://github.com/LRP-IVC/STSBench</p></details> |

However, the spatial correlation inherent to environmental monitoring has been mostly neglected in the recent literature, due to the significant modeling complexity it introduces. In this work, we address this gap by presenting a model of spatio-temporal information freshness, considering the conditional entropy of the system state in a remote monitoring scenario, such as a low-orbit satellite collecting information from a wide geographical area. Our analytical results show that purely age-oriented schemes tend to select an overly broad communication range, leading to inaccurate estimates and energy inefficiency, both of which can be mitigated by adopting a spatio-temporal approach.</p></details> |  |

Although spatio-temporal graph neural networks have achieved success in modeling various static spatio-temporal forecasting scenarios, real-world spatio-temporal data are typically received in a streaming manner, and the network continuously expands with the installation of new sensors. Thus, spatio-temporal forecasting in streaming scenarios faces dual challenges: the inefficiency of retraining models over newly arrived data and the detrimental effects of catastrophic forgetting over long-term history. To address these challenges, we propose a novel prompt tuning-based continuous forecasting method, following two fundamental tuning principles guided by empirical and theoretical analysis: expand and compress, which effectively resolve the aforementioned problems with lightweight tuning parameters. Specifically, we integrate the base spatio-temporal graph neural network with a continuous prompt pool, utilizing stored prompts (i.e., few learnable parameters) in memory, and jointly optimize them with the base spatio-temporal graph neural network. This method ensures that the model sequentially learns from the spatio-temporal data stream to accomplish tasks for corresponding periods. Extensive experimental results on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the multi-faceted superiority of our method over the state-of-the-art baselines, including effectiveness, efficiency, universality, etc.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> |

However, existing methods typically rely on transformer-based architectures, which often face challenges related to scalability and efficiency. To address these issues, we propose a novel, efficient human-human interaction generation method based on the Mamba framework, designed to meet the demands of effectively capturing long-sequence dependencies while providing real-time feedback. Specifically, we introduce an adaptive spatio-temporal Mamba framework that utilizes two parallel SSM branches with an adaptive mechanism to integrate the spatial and temporal features of motion sequences. To further enhance the model's ability to capture dependencies within individual motion sequences and the interactions between different individual sequences, we develop two key modules: the self-adaptive spatio-temporal Mamba module and the cross-adaptive spatio-temporal Mamba module, enabling efficient feature learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results on two interaction datasets with remarkable quality and efficiency. Compared to the baseline method InterGen, our approach not only improves accuracy but also requires a minimal parameter size of just 66M ,only 36% of InterGen's, while achieving an average inference speed of 0.57 seconds, which is 46% of InterGen's execution time.</p></details> |  |

Many end-to-end approaches rely on human annotations to learn intermediate perception and prediction tasks, while purely self-supervised approaches--which directly learn from sensor inputs to generate planning trajectories without human annotations often underperform the state of the art. We observe a key gap in the input representation space: end-to-end approaches built on MLLMs are often pretrained with reasoning tasks in 2D image space rather than the native 3D space in which autonomous vehicles plan. To this end, we propose S4-Driver, a scalable self-supervised motion planning algorithm with spatio-temporal visual representation, based on the popular PaLI multimodal large language model. S4-Driver uses a novel sparse volume strategy to seamlessly transform the strong visual representation of MLLMs from perspective view to 3D space without the need to finetune the vision encoder. This representation aggregates multi-view and multi-frame visual inputs and enables better prediction of planning trajectories in 3D space. To validate our method, we run experiments on both nuScenes and Waymo Open Motion Dataset (with in-house camera data). Results show that S4-Driver performs favorably against existing supervised multi-task approaches while requiring no human annotations. It also demonstrates great scalability when pretrained on large volumes of unannotated driving logs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR2025; Project website: s4-driver.github.io</p></details> |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Fuzzy-oriented Multi-Modal Meta-Learning for Fine-grained Emotion Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13541v4)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-grained emotion recognition (FER) plays a vital role in various fields, such as disease diagnosis, personalized recommendations, and multimedia mining. However, existing FER methods face three key challenges in real-world applications: (i) they rely on large amounts of continuously annotated data to ensure accuracy since emotions are complex and ambiguous in reality, which is costly and time-consuming; (ii) they cannot capture the temporal heterogeneity caused by changing emotion patterns, because they usually assume that the temporal correlation within sampling periods is the same; (iii) they do not consider the spatial heterogeneity of different FER scenarios, that is, the distribution of emotion information in different data may have bias or interference. To address these challenges, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Fuzzy-oriented Multi-modal Meta-learning framework (ST-F2M). Specifically, ST-F2M first divides the multi-modal videos into multiple views, and each view corresponds to one modality of one emotion. Multiple randomly selected views for the same emotion form a meta-training task. Next, ST-F2M uses an integrated module with spatial and temporal convolutions to encode the data of each task, reflecting the spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Then it adds fuzzy semantic information to each task based on generalized fuzzy rules, which helps handle the complexity and ambiguity of emotions. Finally, ST-F2M learns emotion-related general meta-knowledge through meta-recurrent neural networks to achieve fast and robust fine-grained emotion recognition. Extensive experiments show that ST-F2M outperforms various state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and model efficiency. In addition, we construct ablation studies and further analysis to explore why ST-F2M performs well.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

They provide policymakers with the granular information needed to identify, target, and implement effective interventions and allocate resources appropriately. Traditional disease mapping methods typically rely on Poisson regression, modeling observed counts while adjusting for local covariates that are treated as fixed and known. However, these methods may fail to capture the complexities and uncertainties in areas with sparse or absent data. To address this challenge, we developed a Bayesian hierarchical spatio-temporal top-down approach designed to estimate county-level OUD rates when direct small-area (county) data is unavailable. This method allows us to infer small-area OUD rates and quantify associated uncertainties, even in data-sparse environments using observed state-level OUD rates and a combination of state and county level informative covariates. We applied our approach to estimate OUD rates for 3,143 counties in the United States between 2010 and 2025. Model performance was assessed through simulation studies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unraveling Spatio-Temporal Foundation Models via the Pipeline Lens: A Comprehensive Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01364v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal deep learning models aims to utilize useful patterns in such data to support tasks like prediction. However, previous deep learning models designed for specific tasks typically require separate training for each use case, leading to increased computational and storage costs. To address this issue, spatio-temporal foundation models have emerged, offering a unified framework capable of solving multiple spatio-temporal tasks. These foundation models achieve remarkable success by learning general knowledge with spatio-temporal data or transferring the general capabilities of pre-trained language models. While previous surveys have explored spatio-temporal data and methodologies separately, they have ignored a comprehensive examination of how foundation models are designed, selected, pre-trained, and adapted. As a result, the overall pipeline for spatio-temporal foundation models remains unclear. To bridge this gap, we innovatively provide an up-to-date review of previous spatio-temporal foundation models from the pipeline perspective. The pipeline begins with an introduction to different types of spatio-temporal data, followed by details of data preprocessing and embedding techniques. The pipeline then presents a novel data property taxonomy to divide existing methods according to data sources and dependencies, providing efficient and effective model design and selection for researchers. On this basis, we further illustrate the training objectives of primitive models, as well as the adaptation techniques of transferred models. Overall, our survey provides a clear and structured pipeline to understand the connection between core elements of spatio-temporal foundation models while guiding researchers to get started quickly.

| **[Spatio-Temporal Decoupled Learning for Spiking Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01117v1)** | 2025-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have gained significant attention for their potential to enable energy-efficient artificial intelligence. However, effective and efficient training of SNNs remains an unresolved challenge. While backpropagation through time (BPTT) achieves high accuracy, it incurs substantial memory overhead. In contrast, biologically plausible local learning methods are more memory-efficient but struggle to match the accuracy of BPTT. To bridge this gap, we propose spatio-temporal decouple learning (STDL), a novel training framework that decouples the spatial and temporal dependencies to achieve both high accuracy and training efficiency for SNNs. Specifically, to achieve spatial decoupling, STDL partitions the network into smaller subnetworks, each of which is trained independently using an auxiliary network. To address the decreased synergy among subnetworks resulting from spatial decoupling, STDL constructs each subnetwork's auxiliary network by selecting the largest subset of layers from its subsequent network layers under a memory constraint. Furthermore, STDL decouples dependencies across time steps to enable efficient online learning. Extensive evaluations on seven static and event-based vision datasets demonstrate that STDL consistently outperforms local learning methods and achieves comparable accuracy to the BPTT method with considerably reduced GPU memory cost. Notably, STDL achieves 4x reduced GPU memory than BPTT on the ImageNet dataset. Therefore, this work opens up a promising avenue for memory-efficient SNN training.

In this paper, we propose a noise-robust real-world VSR framework by incorporating self-supervised learning and Mamba into pre-trained latent diffusion models. To ensure content consistency across adjacent frames, we enhance the diffusion model with a global spatio-temporal attention mechanism using the Video State-Space block with a 3D Selective Scan module, which reinforces coherence at an affordable computational cost. To further reduce artifacts in generated details, we introduce a self-supervised ControlNet that leverages HR features as guidance and employs contrastive learning to extract degradation-insensitive features from LR videos. Finally, a three-stage training strategy based on a mixture of HR-LR videos is proposed to stabilize VSR training. The proposed Self-supervised ControlNet with Spatio-Temporal Continuous Mamba based VSR algorithm achieves superior perceptual quality than state-of-the-arts on real-world VSR benchmark datasets, validating the effectiveness of the proposed model design and training strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 10 figures, accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Fixed Variables: Expanding-variate Time Series Forecasting via Flat Scheme and Spatio-temporal Focal Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15296v2)** | 2025-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate Time Series Forecasting (MTSF) has long been a key research focus. Traditionally, these studies assume a fixed number of variables, but in real-world applications, Cyber-Physical Systems often expand as new sensors are deployed, increasing variables in MTSF. In light of this, we introduce a novel task, Expanding-variate Time Series Forecasting (EVTSF). This task presents unique challenges, specifically (1) handling inconsistent data shapes caused by adding new variables, and (2) addressing imbalanced spatio-temporal learning, where expanding variables have limited observed data due to the necessity for timely operation. To address these challenges, we propose STEV, a flexible spatio-temporal forecasting framework. STEV includes a new Flat Scheme to tackle the inconsistent data shape issue, which extends the graph-based spatio-temporal modeling architecture into 1D space by flattening the 2D samples along the variable dimension, making the model variable-scale-agnostic while still preserving dynamic spatial correlations through a holistic graph. We introduce a novel Spatio-temporal Focal Learning strategy that incorporates a negative filter to resolve potential conflicts between contrastive learning and graph representation, and a focal contrastive loss as its core to guide the framework to focus on optimizing the expanding variables. We benchmark EVTSF performance using three real-world datasets and compare it against three potential solutions employing SOTA MTSF models tailored for EVSTF. Experimental results show that STEV significantly outperforms its competitors, particularly on expanding variables. Notably, STEV, with only 5% of observations from the expanding period, is on par with SOTA MTSF models trained with complete observations. Further exploration of various expanding strategies underscores the generalizability of STEV in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

However, the interpretable spatio-temporal features extraction by soft sensors remains a challenge. In this light, this work introduces a novel method termed spatio-temporal consistent and interpretable model (STCIM). First, temporal and spatial features are captured and aligned by a far topological spatio-temporal consistency extraction block. Then, the features are mapped into an interpretable latent space for further prediction by explicitly giving physical meanings to latent variables. The efficacy of the proposed STCIM is demonstrated through the modeling of two generated datasets and a real-life dataset of coal-fired power plants. The corresponding experiments show: 1) The generalization of STCIM outperforms other methods, especially in different operation situations. 2) The far topological spatio-temporal consistency is vital for feature alignment. 3) The hyper-parameters of physics-informed interpretable latent space loss decide the performance of STCIM.</p></details> |  |

However, accurately forecasting STTS is challenging due to complex dynamic correlations in both time and space dimensions. Existing graph neural networks struggle to balance effectiveness and efficiency in modeling dynamic spatio-temporal relations. To address this problem, we propose the Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Stiefel Graph Neural Network (DST-SGNN) to efficiently process STTS. For DST-SGNN, we first introduce the novel Stiefel Graph Spectral Convolution (SGSC) and Stiefel Graph Fourier Transform (SGFT). The SGFT matrix in SGSC is constrained to lie on the Stiefel manifold, and SGSC can be regarded as a filtered graph spectral convolution. We also propose the Linear Dynamic Graph Optimization on Stiefel Manifold (LDGOSM), which can efficiently learn the SGFT matrix from the dynamic graph and significantly reduce the computational complexity. Finally, we propose a multi-layer SGSC (MSGSC) that efficiently captures complex spatio-temporal correlations. Extensive experiments on seven spatio-temporal datasets show that DST-SGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods while maintaining relatively low computational costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IJCAI 2025</p></details> |

While Graph Attention Networks (GATs) are popular for modeling spatial dependencies, they rely on predefined adjacency structures and dynamic attention scores, introducing inductive biases and computational overhead that can obscure interpretability. We propose InterGAT, a simplified alternative to GAT that replaces masked attention with a fully learnable, symmetric node interaction matrix, capturing latent spatial relationships without relying on fixed graph topologies. Our framework, InterGAT-GRU, which incorporates a GRU-based temporal decoder, outperforms the baseline GAT-GRU in forecasting accuracy, achieving at least a 21% improvement on the SZ-Taxi dataset and a 6% improvement on the Los-Loop dataset across all forecasting horizons (15 to 60 minutes). Additionally, we observed reduction in training time by 60-70% compared to GAT-GRU baseline. Crucially, the learned interaction matrix reveals interpretable structure: it recovers sparse, topology-aware attention patterns that align with community structure. Spectral and clustering analyses show that the model captures both localized and global dynamics, offering insights into the functional topology driving predictions. This highlights how structure learning can simultaneously support prediction, computational efficiency, and topological interpretabil-ity in dynamic graph-based domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 10 figures, workshop</p></details> |

However, real-world scenarios frequently present challenges such as signal anomalies, noise, and distributional shifts. Existing solutions primarily enhance robustness by modifying network architectures or training procedures. Nevertheless, these approaches are computationally intensive and resource-demanding, especially for large-scale applications. In this paper, we explore a novel test-time computing paradigm, namely learning with calibration, ST-TTC, for spatio-temporal forecasting. Through learning with calibration, we aim to capture periodic structural biases arising from non-stationarity during the testing phase and perform real-time bias correction on predictions to improve accuracy. Specifically, we first introduce a spectral-domain calibrator with phase-amplitude modulation to mitigate periodic shift and then propose a flash updating mechanism with a streaming memory queue for efficient test-time computation. ST-TTC effectively bypasses complex training-stage techniques, offering an efficient and generalizable paradigm. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness, universality, flexibility and efficiency of our proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 9 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

It provides a systematic approach to quantifying resource consumption, emissions, and waste, enabling industries, researchers, and policymakers to identify hotspots for sustainability improvements. By providing a comprehensive assessment of systems, from raw material extraction to end-of-life disposal, LCA facilitates the development of environmentally sound strategies, thereby contributing significantly to sustainable engineering and informed decision-making. Despite its strengths and ubiquitous use, life cycle analysis has not been reconciled with the broader literature in model-based systems engineering and analysis, thus hindering its integration into the design of complex systems more generally. This lack of reconciliation poses a significant problem, as it hinders the seamless integration of environmental sustainability into the design and optimization of complex systems. Without alignment between life cycle analysis (LCA) and model-based systems engineering (MBSE), sustainability remains an isolated consideration rather than an inherent part of the system's architecture and design. The original contribution of this paper is twofold. First, the paper reconciles process-based life cycle analysis with the broader literature and vocabulary of model-based systems engineering and hetero-functional graph theory. It ultimately proves that model-based systems engineering and hetero-functional graph theory are a formal generalization of process-based life cycle analysis. Secondly, the paper demonstrates how model-based systems engineering and hetero-functional graph theory may be used to enhance the spatio-temporal resolution of process-based life cycle analysis in a manner that aligns with system design objectives.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |

Hence, analyzing and clustering spatio-temporal air quality data is crucial for understanding pollution dynamics and guiding policy interventions. This work provides a review of Bayesian nonparametric clustering methods, with a particular focus on their application to spatio-temporal data, which are ubiquitous in environmental sciences. We first introduce key modeling approaches for point-referenced spatio-temporal data, highlighting their flexibility in capturing complex spatial and temporal dependencies. We then review recent advancements in Bayesian clustering, focusing on spatial product partition models, which incorporate spatial structure into the clustering process. We illustrate the proposed methods on PM10 monitoring data from Northern Italy, demonstrating their ability to identify meaningful pollution patterns. This review highlights the potential of Bayesian nonparametric methods for environmental risk assessment and offers insights into future research directions in spatio-temporal clustering for public health and environmental science.</p></details> |  |
| **[Model-Guided Network with Cluster-Based Operators for Spatio-Spectral Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24605v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the problem of reconstructing a high-resolution hyperspectral image from a low-resolution multispectral observation. While spatial super-resolution and spectral super-resolution have been extensively studied, joint spatio-spectral super-resolution remains relatively explored. We propose an end-to-end model-driven framework that explicitly decomposes the joint spatio-spectral super-resolution problem into spatial super-resolution, spectral super-resolution and fusion tasks. Each sub-task is addressed by unfolding a variational-based approach, where the operators involved in the proximal gradient iterative scheme are replaced with tailored learnable modules. In particular, we design an upsampling operator for spatial super-resolution based on classical back-projection algorithms, adapted to handle arbitrary scaling factors. Spectral reconstruction is performed using learnable cluster-based upsampling and downsampling operators. For image fusion, we integrate low-frequency estimation and high-frequency injection modules to combine the spatial and spectral information from spatial super-resolution and spectral super-resolution outputs. Additionally, we introduce an efficient nonlocal post-processing step that leverages image self-similarity by combining a multi-head attention mechanism with residual connections. Extensive evaluations on several datasets and sampling factors demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Such data show dependence across several dimensions of space as well as in time, and can easily involve hundreds of thousands of observations. Many spatio-temporal models result in a dependence structure across all observations and can be fit only at a substantial computational cost, arising from dense matrix inversion, high dimensional parameter spaces, poor mixing in Markov Chain Monte Carlo, or the impossibility of utilizing parallel computing due to a lack of independence anywhere in the model fitting process. These computational challenges are exacerbated when the response variable is ordinal, and especially as the number of ordered categories grows. Some spatio-temporal models achieve computational feasibility for large datasets but only through overly restrictive model simplifications, which we seek to avoid here. In this paper we demonstrate a two-stage algorithm to fit a Bayesian spatio-temporal model to large datasets when the response variable is ordinal. The first stage models locations independently in space, capturing temporal dependence, and can be run in parallel. The second stage resamples from the first stage posterior distributions with an acceptance probability computed to impose spatial dependence from the full spatio-temporal model. The result is fast Bayesian inference which samples from the full spatio-temporal posterior and is computationally feasible even for large datasets. We quantify the substantial computational gains our approach achieves, and demonstrate the preservation of the posterior distribution as compared to the more costly single-stage model fit. We apply our approach to a large spatio-temporal drought dataset in the United States, a dataset too large for many existing spatio-temporal methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing the Accuracy of Spatio-Temporal Models for Wind Speed Prediction by Incorporating Bias-Corrected Crowdsourced Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24506v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate high-resolution spatial and temporal wind speed data is critical for estimating the wind energy potential of a location. For real-time wind speed prediction, statistical models typically depend on high-quality (near) real-time data from official meteorological stations to improve forecasting accuracy. Personal weather stations (PWS) offer an additional source of real-time data and broader spatial coverage than offical stations. However, they are not subject to rigorous quality control and may exhibit bias or measurement errors. This paper presents a framework for incorporating PWS data into statistical models for validated official meteorological station data via a two-stage approach. First, bias correction is performed on PWS wind speed data using reanalysis data. Second, we implement a Bayesian hierarchical spatio-temporal model that accounts for varying measurement error in the PWS data. This enables wind speed prediction across a target area, and is particularly beneficial for improving predictions in regions sparse in official monitoring stations. Our results show that including bias-corrected PWS data improves prediction accuracy compared to using meteorological station data alone, with a 7% reduction in prediction error on average across all sites. The results are comparable with popular reanalysis products, but unlike these numerical weather models our approach is available in real-time and offers improved uncertainty quantification.</p></details> |  |

However, most current systems assume a static environment, which limits the system's applicability in real-world scenarios where environments frequently change due to human intervention or the robot's own actions. In this work, we present DynaMem, a new approach to open-world mobile manipulation that uses a dynamic spatio-semantic memory to represent a robot's environment. DynaMem constructs a 3D data structure to maintain a dynamic memory of point clouds, and answers open-vocabulary object localization queries using multimodal LLMs or open-vocabulary features generated by state-of-the-art vision-language models. Powered by DynaMem, our robots can explore novel environments, search for objects not found in memory, and continuously update the memory as objects move, appear, or disappear in the scene. We run extensive experiments on the Stretch SE3 robots in three real and nine offline scenes, and achieve an average pick-and-drop success rate of 70% on non-stationary objects, which is more than a 2x improvement over state-of-the-art static systems.

However, existing 3DGS-based methods for dynamic reconstruction often suffer from \textit{spatio-temporal incoherence} during initialization, where canonical Gaussians are constructed by aggregating observations from multiple frames without temporal distinction. This results in spatio-temporally entangled representations, making it difficult to model dynamic motion accurately. To overcome this limitation, we propose \textbf{STDR} (Spatio-Temporal Decoupling for Real-time rendering), a plug-and-play module that learns spatio-temporal probability distributions for each Gaussian. STDR introduces a spatio-temporal mask, a separated deformation field, and a consistency regularization to jointly disentangle spatial and temporal patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that incorporating our module into existing 3DGS-based dynamic scene reconstruction frameworks leads to notable improvements in both reconstruction quality and spatio-temporal consistency across synthetic and real-world benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we adapt and specialise the robust and conjugate GP (RCGP) framework of Altamirano et al. (2024) to the spatio-temporal setting. In doing so, we obtain an outlier-robust spatio-temporal GP with a computational cost comparable to classical spatio-temporal GPs. We also overcome the three main drawbacks of RCGPs: their unreliable performance when the prior mean is chosen poorly, their lack of reliable uncertainty quantification, and the need to carefully select a hyperparameter by hand. We study our method extensively in finance and weather forecasting applications, demonstrating that it provides a reliable approach to spatio-temporal modelling in the presence of outliers.</p></details> |  |

Recently, advancements in monitoring technology have facilitated the effective recording of nuclear radiation levels and related factors, such as weather conditions. The abundance of monitoring data enables the development of accurate and reliable nuclear radiation forecasting models, which play a crucial role in informing decision-making for individuals and governments. However, this task is challenging due to the imbalanced distribution of monitoring stations over a wide spatial range and the non-stationary radiation variation patterns. In this study, we introduce NRFormer, a novel framework tailored for the nationwide prediction of nuclear radiation variations. By integrating a non-stationary temporal attention module, an imbalance-aware spatial attention module, and a radiation propagation prompting module, NRFormer collectively captures complex spatio-temporal dynamics of nuclear radiation. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework against 11 baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by KDD 2025 ADS Track</p></details> |

To make profits, prosumers equipped with photovoltaic (PV) panels and even the energy storage system (ESS) can actively participate in the real-time P2P energy market and trade energy. However, in real situations, system states such as energy demands and renewable energy power generation are highly uncertain, making it difficult for prosumers to make optimal real-time decisions. Moreover, severe problems with the physical network can arise from the real-time P2P energy trading, such as bus voltage violations and line overload. To handle these problems, this work first formulates the real-time P2P energy trading problem as a spatio-temporally constrained stochastic optimization problem by considering ESS and the spatial physical network constraints. To deal with the uncertainties online, a modified Lyapunov optimization method is innovatively proposed to approximately reformulate the stochastic optimization problem into an online one by relaxing the time-coupling constraints. Compared with the state-of-the-art online methods, the proposed one renders more flexibility and better performance for the real-time P2P energy market operation. Additionally, to protect the prosumers' privacy, an online distributed algorithm based on the consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is developed to solve the reformulated online problem by decoupling the spatial constraints. The theoretical near-optimal performance guarantee of the proposed online distributed algorithm is derived, and its performance can be further improved by minimizing the performance gap. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed online distributed algorithm can guarantee the fast, stable, and safe long-term operation of the real-time P2P energy market.</p></details> |  |

Spatio-temporal deep learning models, while scalable, typically assume a simplistic independent covariance matrix for the response, failing to capture the underlying correlation structure. However, spatio-temporal GPs suffer from issues of scalability and various forms of approximation bias resulting from restrictive assumptions of the covariance kernel function. We propose STACI, a novel framework consisting of a variational Bayesian neural network approximation of non-stationary spatio-temporal GP along with a novel spatio-temporal conformal inference algorithm. STACI is highly scalable, taking advantage of GPU training capabilities for neural network models, and provides statistically valid prediction intervals for uncertainty quantification. STACI outperforms competing GPs and deep methods in accurately approximating spatio-temporal processes and we show it easily scales to datasets with millions of observations.</p></details> |  |

However, they often fail to generalize in Spatio-Temporal Out-of-Distribution (STOOD) scenarios, where both temporal dynamics and spatial structures evolve beyond the training distribution. To address this problem, we propose an innovative Spatio-Temporal Retrieval-Augmented Pattern Learning framework,STRAP, which enhances model generalization by integrating retrieval-augmented learning into the STGNN continue learning pipeline. The core of STRAP is a compact and expressive pattern library that stores representative spatio-temporal patterns enriched with historical, structural, and semantic information, which is obtained and optimized during the training phase. During inference, STRAP retrieves relevant patterns from this library based on similarity to the current input and injects them into the model via a plug-and-play prompting mechanism. This not only strengthens spatio-temporal representations but also mitigates catastrophic forgetting. Moreover, STRAP introduces a knowledge-balancing objective to harmonize new information with retrieved knowledge. Extensive experiments across multiple real-world streaming graph datasets show that STRAP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art STGNN baselines on STOOD tasks, demonstrating its robustness, adaptability, and strong generalization capability without task-specific fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |

To tackle these challenges, we propose STH-SepNet (Spatio-Temporal Hypergraph Separation Networks), a novel framework that decouples temporal and spatial modeling to enhance both efficiency and precision. Therein, the temporal dimension is modeled using lightweight large language models, which effectively capture low-rank temporal dynamics. Concurrently, the spatial dimension is addressed through an adaptive hypergraph neural network, which dynamically constructs hyperedges to model intricate, higher-order interactions. A carefully designed gating mechanism is integrated to seamlessly fuse temporal and spatial representations. By leveraging the fundamental principles of low-rank temporal dynamics and spatial interactions, STH-SepNet offers a pragmatic and scalable solution for spatio-temporal prediction in real-world applications. Extensive experiments on large-scale real-world datasets across multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of STH-SepNet in boosting predictive performance while maintaining computational efficiency. This work may provide a promising lightweight framework for spatio-temporal prediction, aiming to reduce computational demands and while enhancing predictive performance.

However, existing VLMs typically utilize discrete text Chain-of-Thought (CoT) tailored to the current scenario, which essentially represents highly abstract and symbolic compression of visual information, potentially leading to spatio-temporal relationship ambiguity and fine-grained information loss. Is autonomous driving better modeled on real-world simulation and imagination than on pure symbolic logic? In this paper, we propose a spatio-temporal CoT reasoning method that enables models to think visually. First, VLM serves as a world model to generate unified image frame for predicting future world states: where perception results (e.g., lane divider and 3D detection) represent the future spatial relationships, and ordinary future frame represent the temporal evolution relationships. This spatio-temporal CoT then serves as intermediate reasoning steps, enabling the VLM to function as an inverse dynamics model for trajectory planning based on current observations and future predictions. To implement visual generation in VLMs, we propose a unified pretraining paradigm integrating visual generation and understanding, along with a progressive visual CoT enhancing autoregressive image generation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, advancing autonomous driving towards visual reasoning.</p></details> |  |

While integrating multi-modal data has shown potential for enhancing prediction accuracy, key challenges persist: (i) inadequate fusion of multi-modal information, (ii) confounding factors that obscure causal relations, and (iii) high computational complexity of prediction models. To address these challenges, we propose E^2-CSTP, an Effective and Efficient Causal multi-modal Spatio-Temporal Prediction framework. E^2-CSTP leverages cross-modal attention and gating mechanisms to effectively integrate multi-modal data. Building on this, we design a dual-branch causal inference approach: the primary branch focuses on spatio-temporal prediction, while the auxiliary branch mitigates bias by modeling additional modalities and applying causal interventions to uncover true causal dependencies. To improve model efficiency, we integrate GCN with the Mamba architecture for accelerated spatio-temporal encoding. Extensive experiments on 4 real-world datasets show that E^2-CSTP significantly outperforms 9 state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 9.66% improvements in accuracy as well as 17.37%-56.11% reductions in computational overhead.</p></details> |  |
| **[FLEX: A Backbone for Diffusion-Based Modeling of Spatio-temporal Physical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17351v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce FLEX (FLow EXpert), a backbone architecture for generative modeling of spatio-temporal physical systems using diffusion models. FLEX operates in the residual space rather than on raw data, a modeling choice that we motivate theoretically, showing that it reduces the variance of the velocity field in the diffusion model, which helps stabilize training. FLEX integrates a latent Transformer into a U-Net with standard convolutional ResNet layers and incorporates a redesigned skip connection scheme. This hybrid design enables the model to capture both local spatial detail and long-range dependencies in latent space. To improve spatio-temporal conditioning, FLEX uses a task-specific encoder that processes auxiliary inputs such as coarse or past snapshots. Weak conditioning is applied to the shared encoder via skip connections to promote generalization, while strong conditioning is applied to the decoder through both skip and bottleneck features to ensure reconstruction fidelity. FLEX achieves accurate predictions for super-resolution and forecasting tasks using as few as two reverse diffusion steps. It also produces calibrated uncertainty estimates through sampling. Evaluations on high-resolution 2D turbulence data show that FLEX outperforms strong baselines and generalizes to out-of-distribution settings, including unseen Reynolds numbers, physical observables (e.g., fluid flow velocity fields), and boundary conditions.</p></details> |  |

| **[Attention (as Discrete-Time Markov) Chains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17657v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a new interpretation of the attention matrix as a discrete-time Markov chain. Our interpretation sheds light on common operations involving attention scores such as selection, summation, and averaging in a unified framework. It further extends them by considering indirect attention, propagated through the Markov chain, as opposed to previous studies that only model immediate effects. Our main observation is that tokens corresponding to semantically similar regions form a set of metastable states, where the attention clusters, while noisy attention scores tend to disperse. Metastable states and their prevalence can be easily computed through simple matrix multiplication and eigenanalysis, respectively. Using these lightweight tools, we demonstrate state-of-the-art zero-shot segmentation. Lastly, we define TokenRank -- the steady state vector of the Markov chain, which measures global token importance. We demonstrate that using it brings improvements in unconditional image generation. We believe our framework offers a fresh view of how tokens are being attended in modern visual transformers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://yoterel.github.io/attention_chains/</p></details> |

We focus on two approaches: the Time Deep Gradient Flow (TDGF) method and the Deep Galerkin Method (DGM). We extend the TDGF method to handle the free-boundary partial differential equation inherent in American options. We carefully design the sampling strategy during training to enhance performance. Both TDGF and DGM achieve high accuracy while outperforming conventional Monte Carlo methods in terms of computational speed. In particular, TDGF tends to be faster during training than DGM.</p></details> | 13 pages, 6 figures |

Existing detection methods, whether offline or online, typically rely on dense point cloud reconstruction, which imposes substantial computational overhead and memory constraints, hindering real-time deployment in downstream tasks. To address this, we propose a novel reconstruction-free online framework tailored for memory-efficient and real-time 3D detection. Specifically, given streaming posed RGB-D video input, we leverage Cubify Anything as a pre-trained visual foundation model (VFM) for single-view 3D object detection by bounding boxes, coupled with CLIP to capture open-vocabulary semantics of detected objects. To fuse all detected bounding boxes across different views into a unified one, we employ an association module for correspondences of multi-views and an optimization module to fuse the 3D bounding boxes of the same instance predicted in multi-views. The association module utilizes 3D Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) and a box correspondence matching module, while the optimization module uses an IoU-guided efficient random optimization technique based on particle filtering to enforce multi-view consistency of the 3D bounding boxes while minimizing computational complexity. Extensive experiments on ScanNetV2 and CA-1M datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance among online methods. Benefiting from this novel reconstruction-free paradigm for 3D object detection, our method exhibits great generalization abilities in various scenarios, enabling real-time perception even in environments exceeding 1000 square meters.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://lanlan96.github.io/BoxFusion/</p></details> |

However, the computational cost to execute ray tracing (RT) is proportional to factors such as the level of detail used in the adopted 3D scenario. This work proposes RT pre-processing algorithms that aim at simplifying the 3D scene without distorting the channel, by reducing the scenario area and/or simplifying object shapes in the scenario. It also proposes a post-processing method that augments a set of RT results to achieve an improved time resolution. These methods enable using RT in applications that use a detailed and photorealistic 3D scenario while generating consistent wireless channels over time. Our simulation results with different urban scenarios scales, in terms of area and object details, demonstrate that it is possible to reduce the simulation time by more than 50% without compromising the accuracy of the multipath RT parameters, such as angles of arrival and departure, delay, phase, and path gain.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been published at IEEE Open Journal of the Communications Society (DOI: https://doi.org/10.1109/OJCOMS.2025.3583202)</p></details> |
| **[Data-Driven Exploration for a Class of Continuous-Time Indefinite Linear--Quadratic Reinforcement Learning Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00358v2)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study reinforcement learning (RL) for the same class of continuous-time stochastic linear--quadratic (LQ) control problems as in \cite{huang2024sublinear}, where volatilities depend on both states and controls while states are scalar-valued and running control rewards are absent. We propose a model-free, data-driven exploration mechanism that adaptively adjusts entropy regularization by the critic and policy variance by the actor. Unlike the constant or deterministic exploration schedules employed in \cite{huang2024sublinear}, which require extensive tuning for implementations and ignore learning progresses during iterations, our adaptive exploratory approach boosts learning efficiency with minimal tuning. Despite its flexibility, our method achieves a sublinear regret bound that matches the best-known model-free results for this class of LQ problems, which were previously derived only with fixed exploration schedules. Numerical experiments demonstrate that adaptive explorations accelerate convergence and improve regret performance compared to the non-adaptive model-free and model-based counterparts.</p></details> | 37 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Exact Model Reduction for Continuous-Time Open Quantum Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05102v3)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider finite-dimensional many-body quantum systems described by time-independent Hamiltonians and Markovian master equations, and present a systematic method for constructing smaller-dimensional, reduced models that exactly reproduce the time evolution of a set of initial conditions or observables of interest. Our approach exploits Krylov operator spaces and their extension to operator algebras, and may be used to obtain reduced linear models of minimal dimension, well-suited for simulation on classical computers, or reduced quantum models that preserve the structural constraints of physically admissible quantum dynamics, as required for simulation on quantum computers. Notably, we prove that the reduced quantum-dynamical generator is still in Lindblad form. By introducing a new type of observable-dependent symmetries, we show that our method provides a non-trivial generalization of techniques that leverage symmetries, unlocking new reduction opportunities. We quantitatively benchmark our method on paradigmatic open many-body systems of relevance to condensed-matter and quantum-information physics. In particular, we demonstrate how our reduced models can quantitatively describe decoherence dynamics in central-spin systems coupled to structured environments, magnetization transport in boundary-driven dissipative spin chains, and unwanted error dynamics on information encoded in a noiseless quantum code.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Bright Side of Timed Opacity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12240v4)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Timed automata (TAs) are an extension of finite automata that can measure and react to the passage of time, providing the ability to handle real-time constraints using clocks. In 2009, Franck Cassez showed that the timed opacity problem, where an attacker can observe some actions with their timestamps and attempts to deduce information, is undecidable for TAs. Moreover, he showed that the undecidability holds even for subclasses such as event-recording automata. In this article, we consider the same definition of opacity, by restricting either the system or the attacker. Our first contribution is to prove the inter-reducibility of two variants of opacity: full opacity (for which the observations should be the same regardless of the visit of a private location) and weak opacity (for which it suffices that the attacker cannot deduce whether the private location was visited, but for which it is harmless to deduce that it was not visited); we also prove further results including a connection with timed language inclusion. Our second contribution is to study opacity for several subclasses of TAs: with restrictions on the number of clocks, the number of actions, the nature of time, or a new subclass called observable event-recording automata. We show that opacity is mostly decidable in these cases, except for one-action TAs and for one-clock TAs with $\epsilon$-transitions, for which undecidability remains. Our third (and arguably main) contribution is to propose a new definition of opacity in which the number of observations made by the attacker is limited to the first $N$ observations, or to a set of $N$ timestamps after which the attacker observes the first action that follows immediately. This set can be defined either a priori or at runtime; all three versions yield decidability for the whole TA class.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the author (and extended) version of the manuscript of the same name published in the proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Formal Engineering Methods (ICFEM 2024)</p></details> |
| **[MIRA: Medical Time Series Foundation Model for Real-World Health Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07584v3)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A unified foundation model for medical time series -- pretrained on open access and ethics board-approved medical corpora -- offers the potential to reduce annotation burdens, minimize model customization, and enable robust transfer across clinical institutions, modalities, and tasks, particularly in data-scarce or privacy-constrained environments. However, existing generalist time series foundation models struggle to handle medical time series data due to their inherent challenges, including irregular intervals, heterogeneous sampling rates, and frequent missing values. To address these challenges, we introduce MIRA, a unified foundation model specifically designed for medical time series forecasting. MIRA incorporates a Continuous-Time Rotary Positional Encoding that enables fine-grained modeling of variable time intervals, a frequency-specific mixture-of-experts layer that routes computation across latent frequency regimes to further promote temporal specialization, and a Continuous Dynamics Extrapolation Block based on Neural ODE that models the continuous trajectory of latent states, enabling accurate forecasting at arbitrary target timestamps. Pretrained on a large-scale and diverse medical corpus comprising over 454 billion time points collect from publicly available datasets, MIRA achieves reductions in forecasting errors by an average of 10% and 7% in out-of-distribution and in-distribution scenarios, respectively, when compared to other zero-shot and fine-tuned baselines. We also introduce a comprehensive benchmark spanning multiple downstream clinical tasks, establishing a foundation for future research in medical time series modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic-DINO: Fine-Grained Mixture of Experts Tuning for Real-time Open-Vocabulary Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17436v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture has excelled in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), yet its potential in real-time open-vocabulary object detectors, which also leverage large-scale vision-language datasets but smaller models, remains unexplored. This work investigates this domain, revealing intriguing insights. In the shallow layers, experts tend to cooperate with diverse peers to expand the search space. While in the deeper layers, fixed collaborative structures emerge, where each expert maintains 2-3 fixed partners and distinct expert combinations are specialized in processing specific patterns. Concretely, we propose Dynamic-DINO, which extends Grounding DINO 1.5 Edge from a dense model to a dynamic inference framework via an efficient MoE-Tuning strategy. Additionally, we design a granularity decomposition mechanism to decompose the Feed-Forward Network (FFN) of base model into multiple smaller expert networks, expanding the subnet search space. To prevent performance degradation at the start of fine-tuning, we further propose a pre-trained weight allocation strategy for the experts, coupled with a specific router initialization. During inference, only the input-relevant experts are activated to form a compact subnet. Experiments show that, pretrained with merely 1.56M open-source data, Dynamic-DINO outperforms Grounding DINO 1.5 Edge, pretrained on the private Grounding20M dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |

Despite advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for lifelike avatar creation, existing methods struggle with fine-grained control of facial expressions and body movements in full-body talking tasks. Additionally, they often lack sufficient details and cannot run in real-time on mobile devices. We present TaoAvatar, a high-fidelity, lightweight, 3DGS-based full-body talking avatar driven by various signals. Our approach starts by creating a personalized clothed human parametric template that binds Gaussians to represent appearances. We then pre-train a StyleUnet-based network to handle complex pose-dependent non-rigid deformation, which can capture high-frequency appearance details but is too resource-intensive for mobile devices. To overcome this, we "bake" the non-rigid deformations into a lightweight MLP-based network using a distillation technique and develop blend shapes to compensate for details. Extensive experiments show that TaoAvatar achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality while running in real-time across various devices, maintaining 90 FPS on high-definition stereo devices such as the Apple Vision Pro.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025 (Highlight), project page: https://PixelAI-Team.github.io/TaoAvatar</p></details> |

We propose a coupled scheme that combines finite difference methods in time with surface finite element methods in space. By establishing a new summation by parts formula and proving the supercloseness of the semi-discrete solution, we derive superconvergence results for the recovered gradient via post-processing techniques. In addition, our geometric error analysis is implemented within a novel framework based on the approximation of the Riemannian metric. Several numerical examples are provided to validate and illustrate the theoretical results.</p></details> |  |
| **[EventLines: Time Compression for Discrete Event Timelines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17320v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discrete event sequences serve as models for numerous real-world datasets, including publications over time, project milestones, and medication dosing during patient treatments. These event sequences typically exhibit bursty behavior, where events cluster together in rapid succession, interspersed with periods of inactivity. Standard timeline charts with linear time axes fail to adequately represent such data, resulting in cluttered regions during event bursts while leaving other areas unutilized. We introduce EventLines, a novel technique that dynamically adjusts the time scale to match the underlying event distribution, enabling more efficient use of screen space. To address the challenges of non-linear time scaling, EventLines employs the time axis's visual representation itself to communicate the varying scale. We present findings from a crowdsourced graphical perception study that examines how different time scale representations influence temporal perception.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Constrained Control Allocation With Continuous-Time Rate Constraints: Three-Dimensional Case](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15489v2)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel quadratic programming (QP) approach for constrained control allocation that directly incorporates continuous-time actuator rate constraints without requiring slack variables. Over-actuated aircraft configurations, particularly prevalent in eVTOL and military applications, require control allocation algorithms to distribute commanded control moments among available actuators while respecting position and rate constraints. Existing methods such as direct allocation, pseudo-inverse, cascaded generalized inverse, and exact redistributed pseudo-inverse either cannot handle rate constraints in continuous time or require discretization approaches that compromise performance. Current QP methods that incorporate rate constraints rely on slack variables to ensure feasibility, which prevents full utilization of the attainable moment set and degrades allocation performance. The proposed methodology addresses this limitation by calculating the attainable moment set from both position and rate constraints through convex hull operations, then ensuring feasibility by scaling unattainable commanded moments to the boundary of the attainable moment set while preserving their direction. This approach guarantees the feasibility of the optimization problem without slack variables. The method is validated through simulation on an F-18 fighter aircraft control allocation problem, demonstrating equivalent performance to the established exact redistributed pseudo-inverse method while providing smoother actuator behavior and enhanced constraint satisfaction. Results show that incorporating continuous-time rate constraints leads to improved actuator tracking, reduced overshoot, and more precise adherence to position limits, which is essential for aircraft safety, ride comfort, and actuator longevity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Will ...</summary><p>Will be submitted as Engineering Note to Journal of Guidance, Control, and Dynamics</p></details> |
| **[Dispatch-Aware Deep Neural Network for Optimal Transmission Switching: Toward Real-Time and Feasibility Guaranteed Operation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17194v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimal transmission switching (OTS) improves optimal power flow (OPF) by selectively opening transmission lines, but its mixed-integer formulation increases computational complexity, especially on large grids. To deal with this, we propose a dispatch-aware deep neural network (DA-DNN) that accelerates DC-OTS without relying on pre-solved labels. DA-DNN predicts line states and passes them through a differentiable DC-OPF layer, using the resulting generation cost as the loss function so that all physical network constraints are enforced throughout training and inference. In addition, we adopt a customized weight-bias initialization that keeps every forward pass feasible from the first iteration, which allows stable learning on large grids. Once trained, the proposed DA-DNN produces a provably feasible topology and dispatch pair in the same time as solving the DCOPF, whereas conventional mixed-integer solvers become intractable. As a result, the proposed method successfully captures the economic advantages of OTS while maintaining scalability.</p></details> | 5 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Evaluation of the effects of frame time variation on VR task performance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17139v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a first study of the effects of frame time variations, in both deviation around mean frame times and period of fluctuation, on task performance in a virtual environment (VE). Chosen are open and closed loop tasks that are typical for current applications or likely to be prominent in future ones. The results show that at frame times in the range deemed acceptable for many applications, fairly large deviations in amplitude over a fairly wide range of periods do not significantly affect task performance. However, at a frame time often considered a minimum for immersive VR, frame time variations do produce significant effects on closed loop task performance. The results will be of use to designers of VEs and immersive applications, who often must control frame time variations due to large fluctuations of complexity (graphical and otherwise) in the VE.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enabling Self-Improving Agents to Learn at Test Time With Human-In-The-Loop Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17131v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) agents often struggle in environments where rules and required domain knowledge frequently change, such as regulatory compliance and user risk screening. Current approaches, like offline fine-tuning and standard prompting, are insufficient because they cannot effectively adapt to new knowledge during actual operation. To address this limitation, we propose the Adaptive Reflective Interactive Agent (ARIA), an LLM agent framework designed specifically to continuously learn updated domain knowledge at test time. ARIA assesses its own uncertainty through structured self-dialogue, proactively identifying knowledge gaps and requesting targeted explanations or corrections from human experts. It then systematically updates an internal, timestamped knowledge repository with provided human guidance, detecting and resolving conflicting or outdated knowledge through comparisons and clarification queries. We evaluate ARIA on the realistic customer due diligence name screening task on TikTok Pay, alongside publicly available dynamic knowledge tasks. Results demonstrate significant improvements in adaptability and accuracy compared to baselines using standard offline fine-tuning and existing self-improving agents. ARIA is deployed within TikTok Pay serving over 150 million monthly active users, confirming its practicality and effectiveness for operational use in rapidly evolving environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Explicit Monotone Stable Super-Time-Stepping Methods for Finite Time Singularities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17062v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We explore a novel way to numerically resolve the scaling behavior of finite-time singularities in solutions of nonlinear parabolic PDEs. The Runge--Kutta--Legendre (RKL) and Runge--Kutta--Gegenbauer (RKG) super-time-stepping methods were originally developed for nonlinear complex physics problems with diffusion. These are multi-stage single step second-order, forward-in-time methods with no implicit solves. The advantage is that the timestep size for stability scales with stage number $s$ as $\mathcal{O}(s^2)$. Many interesting nonlinear PDEs have finite-time singularities, and the presence of diffusion often limits one to using implicit or semi-implicit timestep methods for stability constraints. Finite-time singularities are particularly challenging due to the large range of scales that one desires to resolve, often with adaptive spatial grids and adaptive timesteps. Here we show two examples of nonlinear PDEs for which the self-similar singularity structure has time and space scales that are resolvable using the RKL and RKG methods, without forcing even smaller timesteps. Compared to commonly-used implicit numerical methods, we achieve significantly smaller run time while maintaining comparable accuracy. We also prove numerical monotonicity for both the RKL and RKG methods under their linear stability conditions for the constant coefficient heat equation, in the case of infinite domain and periodic boundary condition, leading to a theoretical guarantee of the superiority of the RKL and RKG methods over traditional super-time-stepping methods, such as the Runge-Kutta-Chebyshev (RKC) and the orthogonal Runge-Kutta-Chebyshev (ROCK) methods.</p></details> |  |

Our method attains the optimal $\ell_\infty$-estimation error and runs in strictly $O(n \ln \ln d)$ time in the word-RAM model, thereby improving upon the previous best known deterministic-time bound of $\tilde{O}(n^2)$ and resolving the open problem of breaking this quadratic barrier (Balcer and Vadhan, 2019). Central to our algorithm is a novel private item blanket technique with target-length padding, which transforms the approximate differentially private stability-based histogram algorithm into a pure differentially private one.</p></details> |  |

This problem arises in applications where direct measurements of internal fluid states are unavailable. We introduce a novel computational framework based on Legendre time reduction, which projects the velocity field onto an exponentially weighted Legendre basis in time. This transformation reduces the original time-dependent inverse problem to a coupled, time-independent elliptic system. The resulting reduced model is solved iteratively using a Picard iteration and a stabilized least-squares formulation under noisy boundary data. Numerical experiments in two dimensions confirm that the method accurately and robustly reconstructs initial velocity fields, even in the presence of significant measurement noise and complex anisotropic structures. This approach offers a flexible and computationally tractable alternative for inverse modeling in fluid dynamics with anisotropic media.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional optimization methods often rely on manual tuning and heuristics, which can be time-consuming and error-prone. Recent studies proposed to leverage Large Language Models(LLMs) to assist in RTL code optimization. LLMs can generate optimized code snippets based on natural language descriptions, potentially speeding up the optimization process. However, existing approaches have not thoroughly evaluated the effectiveness of LLM-Based code optimization methods for RTL code with complex timing logic. To address this gap, we conducted a comprehensive empirical investigation to assess the capability of LLM-Based RTL code optimization methods in handling RTL code with complex timing logic. In this study, we first propose a new benchmark for RTL optimization evaluation. It comprises four subsets, each corresponding to a specific area of RTL code optimization. Then we introduce a method based on metamorphosis to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of LLM-Based RTL code optimization methods.Our key insight is that the optimization effectiveness should remain consistent for semantically equivalent but more complex code. After intensive experiments, we revealed several key findings. (1) LLM-Based RTL optimization methods can effectively optimize logic operations and outperform existing compiler-based methods. (2) LLM-Based RTL optimization methods do not perform better than existing compiler-based methods on RTL code with complex timing logic, particularly in timing control flow optimization and clock domain optimization. This is primarily attributed to the challenges LLMs face in understanding timing logic in RTL code. Based on these findings, we provide insights for further research in leveraging LLMs for RTL code optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>13pag...</summary><p>13pages with 9 pictures and 2 tables</p></details> |

Exploring Correlations between Desire for Robotic Automation, Invested Time and Well-Being](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06348v3)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the motivations underlying the human inclination to automate tasks is vital to developing truly helpful robots integrated into daily life. Accordingly, we ask: are individuals more inclined to automate chores based on the time they consume or the feelings experienced while performing them? This study explores these preferences and whether they vary across different social groups (i.e., gender category and income level). Leveraging data from the BEHAVIOR-1K dataset, the American Time-Use Survey, and the American Time-Use Survey Well-Being Module, we investigate the relationship between the desire for automation, time spent on daily activities, and their associated feelings - Happiness, Meaningfulness, Sadness, Painfulness, Stressfulness, or Tiredness. Our key findings show that, despite common assumptions, time spent does not strongly relate to the desire for automation for the general population. For the feelings analyzed, only happiness and pain are key indicators. Significant differences by gender and economic level also emerged: Women prefer to automate stressful activities, whereas men prefer to automate those that make them unhappy; mid-income individuals prioritize automating less enjoyable and meaningful activities, while low and high-income show no significant correlations. We hope our research helps motivate technologies to develop robots that match the priorities of potential users, moving domestic robotics toward more socially relevant solutions. We open-source all the data, including an online tool that enables the community to replicate our analysis and explore additional trends at https://robin-lab.cs.utexas.edu/why-automate-this/.</p></details> | 20 pages, 14 figures |

We propose a scalable Bayesian framework for CTMC inference based on a pseudo-likelihood that bypasses the need for the full intractable likelihood. Our approach jointly estimates the probability transition matrix and a biorthogonal spectral decomposition of the generator, enabling an efficient Gibbs sampling procedure that obeys embeddability. Existing methods typically integrate out the unobserved transitions, which becomes computationally burdensome as the number of data or dimensions increase. The computational cost of our method is near-invariant in the number of data and scales well to medium-high dimensions. We justify our pseudo-likelihood approach by establishing theoretical guarantees, including a Bernstein-von Mises theorem for the probability transition matrix and posterior consistency for the spectral parameters of the generator. Through simulation and applications, we showcase the flexibility and robustness of our approach, offering a tractable and scalable approach to Bayesian inference for CTMCs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward Realistic Evaluations of Just-In-Time Vulnerability Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10729v2)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern software systems are increasingly complex, presenting significant challenges in quality assurance. Just-in-time vulnerability prediction (JIT-VP) is a proactive approach to identifying vulnerable commits and providing early warnings about potential security risks. However, we observe that current JIT-VP evaluations rely on an idealized setting, where the evaluation datasets are artificially balanced, consisting exclusively of vulnerability-introducing and vulnerability-fixing commits. To address this limitation, this study assesses the effectiveness of JIT-VP techniques under a more realistic setting that includes both vulnerability-related and vulnerability-neutral commits. To enable a reliable evaluation, we introduce a large-scale public dataset comprising over one million commits from FFmpeg and the Linux kernel. Our empirical analysis of eight state-of-the-art JIT-VP techniques reveals a significant decline in predictive performance when applied to real-world conditions; for example, the average PR-AUC on Linux drops 98% from 0.805 to 0.016. This discrepancy is mainly attributed to the severe class imbalance in real-world datasets, where vulnerability-introducing commits constitute only a small fraction of all commits. To mitigate this issue, we explore the effectiveness of widely adopted techniques for handling dataset imbalance, including customized loss functions, oversampling, and undersampling. Surprisingly, our experimental results indicate that these techniques are ineffective in addressing the imbalance problem in JIT-VP. These findings underscore the importance of realistic evaluations of JIT-VP and the need for domain-specific techniques to address data imbalance in such scenarios.</p></details> |  |

VulGuard automatically mines commit histories, extracts fine-grained code changes, commit messages, and software engineering metrics, and formats them for downstream analysis. In addition, it integrates several state-of-the-art vulnerability prediction models, allowing researchers to train, evaluate, and compare models with minimal setup. By supporting both repository-scale mining and model-level experimentation within a unified framework, VulGuard addresses key challenges in reproducibility and scalability in software security research. VulGuard can also be easily integrated into the CI/CD pipeline. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the tool in two influential open-source projects, FFmpeg and the Linux kernel, highlighting its potential to accelerate real-world JIT-VP research and promote standardized benchmarking.

| **[Estimating Transition Rates in Two-State Non-Homogeneous Markov Jump Processes with Intermittent Observations: A Pseudo-Marginal McMC Approach via Honest Times](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16603v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A possibly time-dependent transition intensity matrix or generator $(Q(t))$ characterizes the law of a Markov jump process (MP). For a time homogeneous MP, the transition probability matrix (TPM) can be expressed as a matrix exponential of $Q$. However, when dealing with a time non-homogeneous MP, there is often no simple analytical form of the TPM in terms of $Q(t)$, unless they all commute. This poses a challenge because when a continuous MP is observed intermittently, a TPM is required to build a likelihood. In this paper, we show that the estimation of the transition intensities of a two-state nonhomogeneous Markov model can be carried out by augmenting the intermittent observations with honest random times associated with two independent driving Poisson point processes, and that sampling the full path is not required. We propose a pseudo-marginal McMC algorithm to estimate the transition rates using the augmented data. Finally, we illustrate our approach by simulating a continuous MP and by using observed (intermittent) time grids extracted from real clinical visits data.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Distributed Actor-Critic Algorithm for Fixed-Time Consensus in Nonlinear Multi-Agent Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16520v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a reinforcement learning (RL)-based backstepping control strategy to achieve fixed time consensus in nonlinear multi-agent systems with strict feedback dynamics. Agents exchange only output information with their neighbors over a directed communication graph, without requiring full state measurements or symmetric communication. Achieving fixed time consensus, where convergence occurs within a pre-specified time bound that is independent of initial conditions is faced with significant challenges due to the presence of unknown nonlinearities, inter-agent couplings, and external disturbances. This work addresses these challenges by integrating actor critic reinforcement learning with a novel fixed time adaptation mechanism. Each agent employs an actor critic architecture supported by two estimator networks designed to handle system uncertainties and unknown perturbations. The adaptation laws are developed to ensure that all agents track the leader within a fixed time regardless of their initial conditions. The consensus and tracking errors are guaranteed to converge to a small neighborhood of the origin, with the convergence radius adjustable through control parameters. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and highlight its advantages over state-of-the-art methods in terms of convergence speed and robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Canonical Correlation Patterns for Validating Clustering of Multivariate Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16497v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clustering of multivariate time series using correlation-based methods reveals regime changes in relationships between variables across health, finance, and industrial applications. However, validating whether discovered clusters represent distinct relationships rather than arbitrary groupings remains a fundamental challenge. Existing clustering validity indices were developed for Euclidean data, and their effectiveness for correlation patterns has not been systematically evaluated. Unlike Euclidean clustering, where geometric shapes provide discrete reference targets, correlations exist in continuous space without equivalent reference patterns. We address this validation gap by introducing canonical correlation patterns as mathematically defined validation targets that discretise the infinite correlation space into finite, interpretable reference patterns. Using synthetic datasets with perfect ground truth across controlled conditions, we demonstrate that canonical patterns provide reliable validation targets, with L1 norm for mapping and L5 norm for silhouette width criterion and Davies-Bouldin index showing superior performance. These methods are robust to distribution shifts and appropriately detect correlation structure degradation, enabling practical implementation guidelines. This work establishes a methodological foundation for rigorous correlation-based clustering validation in high-stakes domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>45 pa...</summary><p>45 pages, 8 figures.

| **[The Church Synthesis Problem over Continuous Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04782v4)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Church Problem asks for the construction of a procedure which, given a logical specification A(I,O) between input omega-strings I and output omega-strings O, determines whether there exists an operator F that implements the specification in the sense that A(I, F(I)) holds for all inputs I. Buchi and Landweber provided a procedure to solve the Church problem for MSO specifications and operators computable by finite-state automata. We investigate a generalization of the Church synthesis problem to the continuous time domain of the non-negative reals. We show that in the continuous time domain there are phenomena which are very different from the canonical discrete time domain of the natural numbers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Continuous Test-time Domain Adaptation for Efficient Fault Detection under Evolving Operating Conditions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16354v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fault detection is essential in complex industrial systems to prevent failures and optimize performance by distinguishing abnormal from normal operating conditions. With the growing availability of condition monitoring data, data-driven approaches have seen increased adoption in detecting system faults. However, these methods typically require large, diverse, and representative training datasets that capture the full range of operating scenarios, an assumption rarely met in practice, particularly in the early stages of deployment. Industrial systems often operate under highly variable and evolving conditions, making it difficult to collect comprehensive training data. This variability results in a distribution shift between training and testing data, as future operating conditions may diverge from previously observed ones. Such domain shifts hinder the generalization of traditional models, limiting their ability to transfer knowledge across time and system instances, ultimately leading to performance degradation in practical deployments. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method for continuous test-time domain adaptation, designed to support robust early-stage fault detection in the presence of domain shifts and limited representativeness of training data. Our proposed framework --Test-time domain Adaptation for Robust fault Detection (TARD) -- explicitly separates input features into system parameters and sensor measurements. It employs a dedicated domain adaptation module to adapt to each input type using different strategies, enabling more targeted and effective adaptation to evolving operating conditions. We validate our approach on two real-world case studies from multi-phase flow facilities, delivering substantial improvements over existing domain adaptation methods in both fault detection accuracy and model robustness under real-world variability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Budget Allocation Policies for Real-Time Multi-Agent Path Finding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16874v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-Agent Pathfinding (MAPF) is the problem of finding paths for a set of agents such that each agent reaches its desired destination while avoiding collisions with the other agents. Many MAPF solvers are designed to run offline, that is, first generate paths for all agents and then execute them. Real-Time MAPF (RT-MAPF) embodies a realistic MAPF setup in which one cannot wait until a complete path for each agent has been found before they start to move. Instead, planning and execution are interleaved, where the agents must commit to a fixed number of steps in a constant amount of computation time, referred to as the planning budget. Existing solutions to RT-MAPF iteratively call windowed versions of MAPF algorithms in every planning period, without explicitly considering the size of the planning budget. We address this gap and explore different policies for allocating the planning budget in windowed versions of standard MAPF algorithms, namely Prioritized Planning (PrP) and MAPF-LNS2. Our exploration shows that the baseline approach in which all agents draw from a shared planning budget pool is ineffective in over-constrained situations. Instead, policies that distribute the planning budget over the agents are able to solve more problems with a smaller makespan.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

This paper presents a framework for achieving autonomous excavation using reinforcement learning (RL) through a rock excavation simulator. In the simulation, resolution can be defined by the particle size/number in the whole soil space. Fine-resolution simulations closely mimic real-world behavior but demand significant calculation time and challenging sample collection, while coarse-resolution simulations enable faster sample collection but deviate from real-world behavior. To combine the advantages of both resolutions, we explore using policies developed in coarse-resolution simulations for pre-training in fine-resolution simulations. To this end, we propose a novel policy learning framework called Progressive-Resolution Policy Distillation (PRPD), which progressively transfers policies through some middle-resolution simulations with conservative policy transfer to avoid domain gaps that could lead to policy transfer failure. Validation in a rock excavation simulator and nine real-world rock environments demonstrated that PRPD reduced sampling time to less than 1/7 while maintaining task success rates comparable to those achieved through policy learning in a fine-resolution simulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted for IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering (T-ASE)</p></details> |

However, practical deployment is hindered by (i) modality fragility - poor lighting and occlusions degrade vision-based methods; (ii) physiological variability - heart-rate and skin-conductance patterns differ across individuals; and (iii) privacy risk - centralized training requires transmission of sensitive data. To address these challenges, we present FedMultiEmo, a privacy-preserving framework that fuses two complementary modalities at the decision level: visual features extracted by a Convolutional Neural Network from facial images, and physiological cues (heart rate, electrodermal activity, and skin temperature) classified by a Random Forest. FedMultiEmo builds on three key elements: (1) a multimodal federated learning pipeline with majority-vote fusion, (2) an end-to-end edge-to-cloud prototype on Raspberry Pi clients and a Flower server, and (3) a personalized Federated Averaging scheme that weights client updates by local data volume. Evaluated on FER2013 and a custom physiological dataset, the federated Convolutional Neural Network attains 77% accuracy, the Random Forest 74%, and their fusion 87%, matching a centralized baseline while keeping all raw data local. The developed system converges in 18 rounds, with an average round time of 120 seconds and a per-client memory footprint below 200 MB. These results indicate that FedMultiEmo offers a practical approach to real-time, privacy-aware emotion recognition in automotive settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint version.

| **[eKalibr-Stereo: Continuous-Time Spatiotemporal Calibration for Event-Based Stereo Visual Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04451v2)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The bioinspired event camera, distinguished by its exceptional temporal resolution, high dynamic range, and low power consumption, has been extensively studied in recent years for motion estimation, robotic perception, and object detection. In ego-motion estimation, the stereo event camera setup is commonly adopted due to its direct scale perception and depth recovery. For optimal stereo visual fusion, accurate spatiotemporal (extrinsic and temporal) calibration is required. Considering that few stereo visual calibrators orienting to event cameras exist, based on our previous work eKalibr (an event camera intrinsic calibrator), we propose eKalibr-Stereo for accurate spatiotemporal calibration of event-based stereo visual systems. To improve the continuity of grid pattern tracking, building upon the grid pattern recognition method in eKalibr, an additional motion prior-based tracking module is designed in eKalibr-Stereo to track incomplete grid patterns. Based on tracked grid patterns, a two-step initialization procedure is performed to recover initial guesses of piece-wise B-splines and spatiotemporal parameters, followed by a continuous-time batch bundle adjustment to refine the initialized states to optimal ones. The results of extensive real-world experiments show that eKalibr-Stereo can achieve accurate event-based stereo spatiotemporal calibration. The implementation of eKalibr-Stereo is open-sourced at (https://github.com/Unsigned-Long/eKalibr) to benefit the research community.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improved Wake-Up Time For Euclidean Freeze-Tag Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16269v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Freeze-Tag Problem (FTP) involves activating a set of initially asleep robots as quickly as possible, starting from a single awake robot. Once activated, a robot can assist in waking up other robots. Each active robot moves at unit speed. The objective is to minimize the makespan, i.e., the time required to activate the last robot. A key performance measure is the wake-up ratio, defined as the maximum time needed to activate any number of robots in any primary positions. This work focuses on the geometric (Euclidean) version of FTP in $\mathbb{R}^d$ under the $\ell_p$ norm, where the initial distance between each asleep robot and the single active robot is at most 1. For $(\mathbb{R}^2, \ell_2)$, we improve the previous upper bound of 4.62 ([7], CCCG 2024) to 4.31. Note that it is known that 3.82 is a lower bound for the wake-up ratio. In $\mathbb{R}^3$, we propose a new strategy that achieves a wake-up ratio of 12 for $(\mathbb{R}^3, \ell_1)$ and 12.76 for $(\mathbb{R}^3, \ell_2)$, improving upon the previous bounds of 13 and $13\sqrt{3}$, respectively, reported in [2].</p></details> |  |

We formally define the notions of homing sequences (HSs) and synchronizing sequences (SSs) for these TFSMs and demonstrate that several properties that hold for untimed machines do not necessarily apply to timed ones. Furthermore, we explore the applicability of various approaches for deriving SSs and HSs for Timed FSMs with output delays, such as truncated successor tree-based and FSM abstraction-based methods. Correspondingly, we identify the subclasses of TFSMs for which these approaches can be directly applied and those for which other methods are required. Additionally, we evaluate the complexity of existence check and derivation of (shortest) HSs / SSs for TFSMs with output delays.</p></details> |  |

However, they have been found extremely computationally expensive. One of the reasons is the small time step requirement to resolve the complex microstructure evolution during the rapid solidification process. This paper investigates the possibility of using a class of stabilized time integration algorithms to accelerate such phase field simulations by increasing the time steps. The specific time integration formulation and theoretical analysis on energy stability were developed, based on a phase field model dedicated to simulating rapid solidification in additive manufacturing. The numerical results confirmed that the proposed method can ensure the numerical stability and a decreasing energy requirement for the phase field simulations with at least two orders-of-magnitude larger time steps over conventional explicit methods. 2D and 3D phase field simulations have been conducted with relevant physical and kinetic parameters for 316L stainless steels. This work provides a numerical framework for efficient phase field simulations and open numerous opportunities for large scale phase field modeling.</p></details> |  |

In ad-hoc array conditions, microphone invariance (MI) requires systems to handle different microphone numbers and array geometries. From a practical perspective, multichannel recordings inevitably increase the computational burden for edge-device applications, highlighting the necessity of lightweight and efficient deployments. In this work, we propose a lightweight attentive beamforming network (LABNet) to integrate MI in a low-complexity real-time SE system. We design a three-stage framework for efficient intra-channel modeling and inter-channel interaction. A cross-channel attention module is developed to aggregate features from each channel selectively. Experimental results demonstrate our LABNet achieves impressive performance with ultra-light resource overhead while maintaining the MI, indicating great potential for ad-hoc array processing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Energy-Efficient and Real-Time Sensing for Federated Continual Learning via Sample-Driven Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07497v2)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An intelligent Real-Time Sensing (RTS) system must continuously acquire, update, integrate, and apply knowledge to adapt to real-world dynamics. Managing distributed intelligence in this context requires Federated Continual Learning (FCL). However, effectively capturing the diverse characteristics of RTS data in FCL systems poses significant challenges, including severely impacting computational and communication resources, escalating energy costs, and ultimately degrading overall system performance. To overcome these challenges, we investigate how the data distribution shift from ideal to practical RTS scenarios affects Artificial Intelligence (AI) model performance by leveraging the \textit{generalization gap} concept. In this way, we can analyze how sampling time in RTS correlates with the decline in AI performance, computation cost, and communication efficiency. Based on this observation, we develop a novel Sample-driven Control for Federated Continual Learning (SCFL) technique, specifically designed for mobile edge networks with RTS capabilities. In particular, SCFL is an optimization problem that harnesses the sampling process to concurrently minimize the generalization gap and improve overall accuracy while upholding the energy efficiency of the FCL framework. To solve the highly complex and time-varying optimization problem, we introduce a new soft actor-critic algorithm with explicit and implicit constraints (A2C-EI). Our empirical experiments reveal that we can achieve higher efficiency compared to other DRL baselines. Notably, SCFL can significantly reduce energy consumption up to $85\%$ while maintaining FL convergence and timely data transmission.</p></details> | 20 pages, 7 figures |

Respiratory spirogram time series, routinely collected during pulmonary function tests (PFTs), play a critical role in the early detection of repsiratory diseases and in monitoring lung function over time. However, most current AI models for COPD diagnosis are limited to outputting classification results without providing a rationale for their diagnostic process, while current Large Language Models (LLMs) cannot understand spirograms yet, which severely limits their clinical trust and adoption. To tackle this challenge, we leverage a cohort of 234,028 individuals from the UK Biobank (UKB) to propose SpiroLLM, the first multimodal large language model that can understand spirogram. The model extracts morphological features from respiratory curves via a SpiroEncoder and aligns them with PFT numerical values in a unified latent space using a SpiroProjector, ultimately empowering a large language model to generate a comprehensive diagnostic report. Experimental results confirm that SpiroLLM achieved a diagnostic AUROC of 0.8980 (95% CI: 0.8820-0.9132). In a robustness test with missing core data, it maintained a 100% valid response rate, far surpassing the 13.4% of a text-only model and showcasing the superiority of its multimodal design. This work demonstrates the substantial potential of deeply fusing physiological signals with large language models, establishing a new paradigm for the next generation of interpretable and reliable clinical decision support tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[FTIN: Frequency-Time Integration Network for Inertial Odometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16120v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, machine learning has achieved significant advancements in inertial odometry. However, most existing inertial odometry methods primarily rely on CNNs in the time domain. These methods often struggle to capture long-term dependency in inertial measurement unit data, thereby constraining the potential for further improvements in localization accuracy. To address these issues, we propose a novel network architecture that integrates both frequency-domain and time-domain information. Specifically, we leverage the global view and energy compaction properties of frequency-domain learning to effectively model long-term dependency and reduce redundancy in IMU data. Additionally, we introduce a Scalar LSTM to capture sequential dependencies in the time domain, enabling cross-domain information fusion and providing a stable and reliable reference for localization. Experimental evaluations on multiple public datasets (e.g., RIDI, RoNIN, OxIOD, RNIN, TLIO, and IMUNet) demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed frequency-time domain fusion strategy. Notably, on the RoNIN dataset, our method achieves a 43.0% reduction in absolute trajectory error and a 13.1% reduction in relative trajectory error compared to RoNIN ResNet.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Researcher with Test-Time Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16075v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep research agents, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), are rapidly advancing; yet, their performance often plateaus when generating complex, long-form research reports using generic test-time scaling algorithms. Drawing inspiration from the iterative nature of human research, which involves cycles of searching, reasoning, and revision, we propose the Test-Time Diffusion Deep Researcher (TTD-DR). This novel framework conceptualizes research report generation as a diffusion process. TTD-DR initiates this process with a preliminary draft, an updatable skeleton that serves as an evolving foundation to guide the research direction. The draft is then iteratively refined through a "denoising" process, which is dynamically informed by a retrieval mechanism that incorporates external information at each step. The core process is further enhanced by a self-evolutionary algorithm applied to each component of the agentic workflow, ensuring the generation of high-quality context for the diffusion process. This draft-centric design makes the report writing process more timely and coherent while reducing information loss during the iterative search process. We demonstrate that our TTD-DR achieves state-of-the-art results on a wide array of benchmarks that require intensive search and multi-hop reasoning, significantly outperforming existing deep research agents.</p></details> |  |

We first design synthetic tasks isolating intra-neuron inter-spike intervals and cross-neuron synchrony under matched spike counts. On more complex spike-based speech recognition datasets (Spiking Heidelberg Digits (SHD) and Spiking Speech Commands (SSC), we construct variants where spike count information is eliminated and only timing information remains, and show that Surrogate GD-trained SNNs are able to perform significantly above chance whereas purely rate-based models perform at chance level. We further evaluate robustness under biologically inspired perturbations -- including Gaussian jitter per spike or per-neuron, and spike deletion -- revealing consistent but perturbation-specific degradation. Networks show a sharp performance drop when spike sequences are reversed in time, with a larger drop in performance from SNNs trained with delays, indicating that these networks are more human-like in terms of behaviour. To facilitate further studies of temporal coding, we have released our modified SHD and SSC datasets.</p></details> |  |

To address this problem, we propose to reverse the construction principle by considering preselected sets of interest and estimating the probability that a future observation of the process falls into these sets. The accuracy of the prediction is then evaluated by quantifying the uncertainty associated with estimation of these predictive probabilities. We consider parametric and non-parametric approaches and derive asymptotic theory for the estimators involved. Suitable bootstrap approaches to evaluate the distribution of the estimators considered also are introduced. They have the advantage to imitate the distributions of interest under different possible settings, including the practical important case where uncertainty holds true about the correctness of a parametric model used for prediction. Theoretical justification of the bootstrap is given, which also requires investigation of asymptotic properties of parameter estimators under model misspecification. We elaborate on bootstrap implementations under different scenarios and focus on parametric prediction using INAR and INARCH models and (conditional) maximum likelihood estimators. Simulations investigate the finite sample performance of the predictive method developed and applications to real life data sets are presented.</p></details> | <details><summary>44 pa...</summary><p>44 pages, 2 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |

However, in many applications -- particularly in healthcare -- this static summary fails to capture the nuanced dynamics of treatment effects that vary with both dose and time. We propose a framework for modelling treatment effect trajectories as smooth surfaces over dose and time, enabling the extraction of clinically actionable insights such as onset time, peak effect, and duration of benefit. To ensure interpretability, robustness, and verifiability -- key requirements in high-stakes domains -- we adapt SemanticODE, a recent framework for interpretable trajectory modelling, to the causal setting where treatment effects are never directly observed. Our approach decouples the estimation of trajectory shape from the specification of clinically relevant properties (e.g., maxima, inflection points), supporting domain-informed priors, post-hoc editing, and transparent analysis. We show that our method yields accurate, interpretable, and editable models of treatment dynamics, facilitating both rigorous causal analysis and practical decision-making.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the Actionable Interpretability Workshop at ICML 2025</p></details> |

Session types inherit this restriction, which precludes them from fully modelling timeouts -- a core property of web and cloud services. To address this deficiency, we present (binary) Timeout Asynchronous Session Types (TOAST) as an extension to (binary) asynchronous timed session types, that permits mixed-choice. TOAST deploys timing constraints to regulate the use of mixed-choice so as to preserve communication safety. We provide a new behavioural semantics for TOAST which guarantees progress in the presence of mixed-choice. Building upon TOAST, we provide a calculus featuring process timers which is capable of modelling timeouts using a receive-after pattern, much like Erlang, and capture the correspondence with TOAST specifications via a type system for which we prove subject reduction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Per-Bank Bandwidth Regulation of Shared Last-Level Cache for Real-Time Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14003v2)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) multicore processors have advanced memory hierarchies that enhance memory-level parallelism (MLP), which is crucial for high performance. To support high MLP, shared last-level caches (LLCs) are divided into multiple banks, allowing parallel access. However, uneven distribution of cache requests from the cores, especially when requests from multiple cores are concentrated on a single bank, can result in significant contention affecting all cores that access the cache. Such cache bank contention can even be maliciously induced -- known as cache bank-aware denial-of-service (DoS) attacks -- in order to jeopardize the system's timing predictability. In this paper, we propose a per-bank bandwidth regulation approach for multi-banked shared LLC based multicore real-time systems. By regulating bandwidth on a per-bank basis, the approach aims to prevent unnecessary throttling of cache accesses to non-contended banks, thus improving overall performance (throughput) without compromising isolation benefits of throttling. We implement our approach on a RISC-V system-on-chip (SoC) platform using FireSim and evaluate extensively using both synthetic and real-world workloads. Our evaluation results show that the proposed per-bank regulation approach effectively protects real-time tasks from co-running cache bank-aware DoS attacks, and offers up to a 3.66$\times$ performance improvement for the throttled benign best-effort tasks compared to prior bank-oblivious bandwidth throttling approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Update to Fig. 11: The previous version used mismatched cache capacities between the 2-bank and 4-bank configurations in the simulation setup. This has been corrected to ensure both configurations have equal total cache capacity. As a result, the specific numerical results in Fig. 11 have changed. However, the overall trend shown in Fig. 11 and key findings of the paper remain consistent</p></details> |

The approach extends previous port-Hamiltonian characterizations to include the general non-minimal case and the case where the feedthrough term fails to have an invertible symmetric part. The resulting construction is able to identify infeasibility when the system fails to be port-Hamiltonian, and allows for the incorporation of perturbations in order to arrive at a nearby port-Hamiltonian system. Results are illustrated via numerical examples.</p></details> |  |
| **[Does More Inference-Time Compute Really Help Robustness?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15974v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Zaremba et al. demonstrated that increasing inference-time computation improves robustness in large proprietary reasoning LLMs. In this paper, we first show that smaller-scale, open-source models (e.g., DeepSeek R1, Qwen3, Phi-reasoning) can also benefit from inference-time scaling using a simple budget forcing strategy. More importantly, we reveal and critically examine an implicit assumption in prior work: intermediate reasoning steps are hidden from adversaries. By relaxing this assumption, we identify an important security risk, intuitively motivated and empirically verified as an inverse scaling law: if intermediate reasoning steps become explicitly accessible, increased inference-time computation consistently reduces model robustness. Finally, we discuss practical scenarios where models with hidden reasoning chains are still vulnerable to attacks, such as models with tool-integrated reasoning and advanced reasoning extraction attacks. Our findings collectively demonstrate that the robustness benefits of inference-time scaling depend heavily on the adversarial setting and deployment context. We urge practitioners to carefully weigh these subtle trade-offs before applying inference-time scaling in security-sensitive, real-world applications.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[A Lightweight Face Quality Assessment Framework to Improve Face Verification Performance in Real-Time Screening Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15961v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Face image quality plays a critical role in determining the accuracy and reliability of face verification systems, particularly in real-time screening applications such as surveillance, identity verification, and access control. Low-quality face images, often caused by factors such as motion blur, poor lighting conditions, occlusions, and extreme pose variations, significantly degrade the performance of face recognition models, leading to higher false rejection and false acceptance rates. In this work, we propose a lightweight yet effective framework for automatic face quality assessment, which aims to pre-filter low-quality face images before they are passed to the verification pipeline. Our approach utilises normalised facial landmarks in conjunction with a Random Forest Regression classifier to assess image quality, achieving an accuracy of 96.67\%. By integrating this quality assessment module into the face verification process, we observe a substantial improvement in performance, including a comfortable 99.7\% reduction in the false rejection rate and enhanced cosine similarity scores when paired with the ArcFace face verification model. To validate our approach, we have conducted experiments on a real-world dataset collected comprising over 600 subjects captured from CCTV footage in unconstrained environments within Dubai Police. Our results demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively mitigates the impact of poor-quality face images, outperforming existing face quality assessment techniques while maintaining computational efficiency. Moreover, the framework specifically addresses two critical challenges in real-time screening: variations in face resolution and pose deviations, both of which are prevalent in practical surveillance scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Our approach relies on an iterative scheme combined with soft thresholding of the iterates. A model case of a time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation with low-rank matrix approximation is analyzed in detail, and the required modifications for second-order parabolic problems are described. Numerical tests illustrate the results for both cases.</p></details> | 35 pages |

However, no similar studies have been conducted for computational notebooks in the context of data science. To help bridge this research gap, we make three scientific contributions: we (1) introduce a toolset for collecting code changes in Jupyter notebooks during development time; (2) use it to collect more than 100 hours of work related to a data analysis task and a machine learning task (carried out by 20 developers with different levels of expertise), resulting in a dataset containing 2,655 cells and 9,207 cell executions; and (3) use this dataset to investigate the dynamic nature of the notebook development process and the changes that take place in the notebooks. In our analysis of the collected data, we classified the changes made to the cells between executions and found that a significant number of these changes were relatively small fixes and code iteration modifications. This suggests that notebooks are used not only as a development and exploration tool but also as a debugging tool. We report a number of other insights and propose potential future research directions on the novel data.</p></details> | 32 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Spectral Differential Network Analysis for High-Dimensional Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07905v2)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spectral networks derived from multivariate time series data arise in many domains, from brain science to Earth science. Often, it is of interest to study how these networks change under different conditions. For instance, to better understand epilepsy, it would be interesting to capture the changes in the brain connectivity network as a patient experiences a seizure, using electroencephalography data. A common approach relies on estimating the networks in each condition and calculating their difference. Such estimates may behave poorly in high dimensions as the networks themselves may not be sparse in structure while their difference may be. We build upon this observation to develop an estimator of the difference in inverse spectral densities across two conditions. Using an L1 penalty on the difference, consistency is established by only requiring the difference to be sparse. We illustrate the method on synthetic data experiments and on experiments with electroencephalography data.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 13 figures, AISTATS 2025</p></details> |

Various methods have been developed to construct hypergraphs -- referred to as simplicial complexes in the TDA framework -- over datasets, enabling the formation of edges between more than two vertices. This paper addresses the challenge of constructing hypergraphs from collections of multivariate time series. While prior work has focused on the case of a single multivariate time series, we extend this framework to handle collections of such time series. Our approach generalizes the method proposed in Chretien and al. by leveraging the properties of signature transforms to introduce controlled randomness, thereby enhancing the robustness of the construction process. We validate our method on synthetic datasets and present promising results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at GSI25 conference.

Our hypothesis is that this task needs models that are able to learn the data underlying dynamics. We propose to validate it through both systemic and empirical studies. We develop an original $\texttt{PRO-DYN}$ nomenclature to analyze existing models through the lens of dynamics. Two observations thus emerged: $\textbf{1}$. under-performing architectures learn dynamics at most partially, $\textbf{2}$. the location of the dynamics block at the model end is of prime importance. We conduct extensive experiments to confirm our observations on a set of performance-varying models with diverse backbones. Results support the need to incorporate a learnable dynamics block and its use as the final predictor.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 6 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

This is true not only for model-based controllers, but also for model-free, real-time control methods such as extremum seeking control (ESC). In this paper, we propose a unicycle-based ESC design applicable to differential wheeled robots that: (1) is very simple design, based on one simple control-affine law, and without state integrators; (2) attenuates oscillations known to persist in ESC designs (i.e., fully stop at the source); and (3) operates in a model-free, real-time setting, tolerating environmental/sensor noise. We provide simulation and real-world robotic experimental results for fixed and moving light source seeking by a differential wheeled robot using our proposed design. Results indicate clear advantages of our proposed design when compared to the literature, including attenuation of undesired oscillations, improved convergence speed, and better handling of noise.</p></details> |  |
| **[Floquet$-$Bloch analysis of wave propagation with time-periodic coefficients](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10297v2)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a numerical investigation of acoustic wave propagation in an obstacle with periodically time-modulated material parameters. We focus on the numerical construction of Floquet$-$Bloch solutions, which are quasi-periodic kernel elements of the hyperbolic operator appearing on the left-hand side of the acoustic wave equation. Using the temporal Fourier expansion yields a system of coupled harmonics, which can be truncated. Rewriting this system then provides different (generally nonlinear) eigenvalue formulations for discretized Floquet$-$Bloch solutions. Deriving energy estimates and the necessary conditions for Riesz$-$Schauder theory show basic properties of the occurring Floquet exponents. To derive fully discrete schemes, we employ a general Galerkin space discretization. Under assumptions on the relation of the temporal Fourier truncation and the Galerkin space discretization, we prove that the approximated Floquet exponents exhibit the same limitations as their continuous counterparts. Moreover, the approximated modes are shown to satisfy the defining properties of Floquet$-$Bloch solutions, with a defect that tends to zero as the number of harmonics approaches infinity. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and illustrate the theoretical findings.</p></details> | 29 pages, 6 figures |

| **[Approximating temporal modularity on graphs of small underlying treewidth](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17541v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modularity is a very widely used measure of the level of clustering or community structure in networks. Here we consider a recent generalisation of the definition of modularity to temporal graphs, whose edge-sets change over discrete timesteps; such graphs offer a more realistic model of many real-world networks in which connections between entities (for example, between individuals in a social network) evolve over time. Computing modularity is notoriously difficult: it is NP-hard even to approximate in general, and only admits efficient exact algorithms in very restricted special cases. Our main result is that a multiplicative approximation to temporal modularity can be computed efficiently when the underlying graph has small treewidth. This generalises a similar approximation algorithm for the static case, but requires some substantially new ideas to overcome technical challenges associated with the temporal nature of the problem.</p></details> |  |
| **[STQE: Spatial-Temporal Quality Enhancement for G-PCC Compressed Dynamic Point Clouds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17522v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Very few studies have addressed quality enhancement for compressed dynamic point clouds. In particular, the effective exploitation of spatial-temporal correlations between point cloud frames remains largely unexplored. Addressing this gap, we propose a spatial-temporal attribute quality enhancement (STQE) network that exploits both spatial and temporal correlations to improve the visual quality of G-PCC compressed dynamic point clouds. Our contributions include a recoloring-based motion compensation module that remaps reference attribute information to the current frame geometry to achieve precise inter-frame geometric alignment, a channel-aware temporal attention module that dynamically highlights relevant regions across bidirectional reference frames, a Gaussian-guided neighborhood feature aggregation module that efficiently captures spatial dependencies between geometry and color attributes, and a joint loss function based on the Pearson correlation coefficient, designed to alleviate over-smoothing effects typical of point-wise mean squared error optimization. When applied to the latest G-PCC test model, STQE achieved improvements of 0.855 dB, 0.682 dB, and 0.828 dB in delta PSNR, with Bj{\o}ntegaard Delta rate (BD-rate) reductions of -25.2%, -31.6%, and -32.5% for the Luma, Cb, and Cr components, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[LTLZinc: a Benchmarking Framework for Continual Learning and Neuro-Symbolic Temporal Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17482v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence aims to combine neural architectures with symbolic approaches that can represent knowledge in a human-interpretable formalism. Continual learning concerns with agents that expand their knowledge over time, improving their skills while avoiding to forget previously learned concepts. Most of the existing approaches for neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence are applied to static scenarios only, and the challenging setting where reasoning along the temporal dimension is necessary has been seldom explored. In this work we introduce LTLZinc, a benchmarking framework that can be used to generate datasets covering a variety of different problems, against which neuro-symbolic and continual learning methods can be evaluated along the temporal and constraint-driven dimensions. Our framework generates expressive temporal reasoning and continual learning tasks from a linear temporal logic specification over MiniZinc constraints, and arbitrary image classification datasets. Fine-grained annotations allow multiple neural and neuro-symbolic training settings on the same generated datasets. Experiments on six neuro-symbolic sequence classification and four class-continual learning tasks generated by LTLZinc, demonstrate the challenging nature of temporal learning and reasoning, and highlight limitations of current state-of-the-art methods. We release the LTLZinc generator and ten ready-to-use tasks to the neuro-symbolic and continual learning communities, in the hope of fostering research towards unified temporal learning and reasoning frameworks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Smoothness-Aware Rate-Distortion Optimized 4D Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17336v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) effectively extends the high-speed rendering capabilities of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to represent volumetric videos. However, the large number of Gaussians, substantial temporal redundancies, and especially the absence of an entropy-aware compression framework result in large storage requirements. Consequently, this poses significant challenges for practical deployment, efficient edge-device processing, and data transmission. In this paper, we introduce a novel end-to-end RD-optimized compression framework tailored for 4DGS, aiming to enable flexible, high-fidelity rendering across varied computational platforms. Leveraging Fully Explicit Dynamic Gaussian Splatting (Ex4DGS), one of the state-of-the-art 4DGS methods, as our baseline, we start from the existing 3DGS compression methods for compatibility while effectively addressing additional challenges introduced by the temporal axis. In particular, instead of storing motion trajectories independently per point, we employ a wavelet transform to reflect the real-world smoothness prior, significantly enhancing storage efficiency. This approach yields significantly improved compression ratios and provides a user-controlled balance between compression efficiency and rendering quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving up to 91x compression compared to the original Ex4DGS model while maintaining high visual fidelity. These results highlight the applicability of our framework for real-time dynamic scene rendering in diverse scenarios, from resource-constrained edge devices to high-performance environments.</p></details> | 21 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Temporal Point-Supervised Signal Reconstruction: A Human-Annotation-Free Framework for Weak Moving Target Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17334v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In low-altitude surveillance and early warning systems, detecting weak moving targets remains a significant challenge due to low signal energy, small spatial extent, and complex background clutter. Existing methods struggle with extracting robust features and suffer from the lack of reliable annotations. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Temporal Point-Supervised (TPS) framework that enables high-performance detection of weak targets without any manual annotations.Instead of conventional frame-based detection, our framework reformulates the task as a pixel-wise temporal signal modeling problem, where weak targets manifest as short-duration pulse-like responses. A Temporal Signal Reconstruction Network (TSRNet) is developed under the TPS paradigm to reconstruct these transient signals.TSRNet adopts an encoder-decoder architecture and integrates a Dynamic Multi-Scale Attention (DMSAttention) module to enhance its sensitivity to diverse temporal patterns. Additionally, a graph-based trajectory mining strategy is employed to suppress false alarms and ensure temporal consistency.Extensive experiments on a purpose-built low-SNR dataset demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods while requiring no human annotations. It achieves strong detection performance and operates at over 1000 FPS, underscoring its potential for real-time deployment in practical scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Conflict Detection for Temporal Knowledge Graphs:A Fast Constraint Mining Algorithm and New Benchmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11053v2)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal facts, which are used to describe events that occur during specific time periods, have become a topic of increased interest in the field of knowledge graph (KG) research. In terms of quality management, the introduction of time restrictions brings new challenges to maintaining the temporal consistency of KGs. Previous studies rely on manually enumerated temporal constraints to detect conflicts, which are labor-intensive and may have granularity issues. To address this problem, we start from the common pattern of temporal facts and propose a pattern-based temporal constraint mining method, PaTeCon. Unlike previous studies, PaTeCon uses graph patterns and statistical information relevant to the given KG to automatically generate temporal constraints, without the need for human experts. In this paper, we illustrate how this method can be optimized to achieve significant speed improvement. We also annotate Wikidata and Freebase to build two new benchmarks for conflict detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our pattern-based automatic constraint mining approach is highly effective in generating valuable temporal constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Spatio-Temporal Machine Learning Model for Mortgage Credit Risk: Default Probabilities and Loan Portfolios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02846v2)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel machine learning model for credit risk by combining tree-boosting with a latent spatio-temporal Gaussian process model accounting for frailty correlation. This allows for modeling non-linearities and interactions among predictor variables in a flexible data-driven manner and for accounting for spatio-temporal variation that is not explained by observable predictor variables. We also show how estimation and prediction can be done in a computationally efficient manner. In an application to a large U.S. mortgage credit risk data set, we find that both predictive default probabilities for individual loans and predictive loan portfolio loss distributions obtained with our novel approach are more accurate compared to conventional independent linear hazard models and also linear spatio-temporal models. Using interpretability tools for machine learning models, we find that the likely reasons for this outperformance are strong interaction and non-linear effects in the predictor variables and the presence of spatio-temporal frailty effects.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Temporal Guidance and Iterative Refinement in Audio Source Separation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17297v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial semantic segmentation of sound scenes (S5) involves the accurate identification of active sound classes and the precise separation of their sources from complex acoustic mixtures. Conventional systems rely on a two-stage pipeline - audio tagging followed by label-conditioned source separation - but are often constrained by the absence of fine-grained temporal information critical for effective separation. In this work, we address this limitation by introducing a novel approach for S5 that enhances the synergy between the event detection and source separation stages. Our key contributions are threefold. First, we fine-tune a pre-trained Transformer to detect active sound classes. Second, we utilize a separate instance of this fine-tuned Transformer to perform sound event detection (SED), providing the separation module with detailed, time-varying guidance. Third, we implement an iterative refinement mechanism that progressively enhances separation quality by recursively reusing the separator's output from previous iterations. These advancements lead to significant improvements in both audio tagging and source separation performance, as demonstrated by our system's second-place finish in Task 4 of the DCASE Challenge 2025. Our implementation and model checkpoints are available in our GitHub repository: https://github.com/theMoro/dcase25task4 .</p></details> |  |
| **[Triadic First-Order Logic Queries in Temporal Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17215v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motif counting is a fundamental problem in network analysis, and there is a rich literature of theoretical and applied algorithms for this problem. Given a large input network $G$, a motif $H$ is a small "pattern" graph indicative of special local structure. Motif/pattern mining involves finding all matches of this pattern in the input $G$. The simplest, yet challenging, case of motif counting is when $H$ has three vertices, often called a "triadic" query. Recent work has focused on "temporal graph mining", where the network $G$ has edges with timestamps (and directions) and $H$ has time constraints. Inspired by concepts in logic and database theory, we introduce the study of "thresholded First Order Logic (FOL) Motif Analysis" for massive temporal networks. A typical triadic motif query asks for the existence of three vertices that form a desired temporal pattern. An "FOL" motif query is obtained by having both existential and thresholded universal quantifiers. This allows for query semantics that can mine richer information from networks. A typical triadic query would be "find all triples of vertices $u,v,w$ such that they form a triangle within one hour". A thresholded FOL query can express "find all pairs $u,v$ such that for half of $w$ where $(u,w)$ formed an edge, $(v,w)$ also formed an edge within an hour". We design the first algorithm, FOLTY, for mining thresholded FOL triadic queries. The theoretical running time of FOLTY matches the best known running time for temporal triangle counting in sparse graphs. We give an efficient implementation of FOLTY using specialized temporal data structures. FOLTY has excellent empirical behavior, and can answer triadic FOL queries on graphs with nearly 70M edges is less than hour on commodity hardware. Our work has the potential to start a new research direction in the classic well-studied problem of motif analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamics of temporal influence in polarised networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17177v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In social networks, it is often of interest to identify the most influential users who can successfully spread information to others. This is particularly important for marketing (e.g., targeting influencers for a marketing campaign) and to understand the dynamics of information diffusion (e.g., who is the most central user in the spreading of a certain type of information). However, different opinions often split the audience and make the network polarised. In polarised networks, information becomes soiled within communities in the network, and the most influential user within a network might not be the most influential across all communities. Additionally, influential users and their influence may change over time as users may change their opinion or choose to decrease or halt their engagement on the subject. In this work, we aim to study the temporal dynamics of users' influence in a polarised social network. We compare the stability of influence ranking using temporal centrality measures, while extending them to account for community structure across a number of network evolution behaviours. We show that we can successfully aggregate nodes into influence bands, and how to aggregate centrality scores to analyse the influence of communities over time. A modified version of the temporal independent cascade model and the temporal degree centrality perform the best in this setting, as they are able to reliably isolate nodes into their bands.</p></details> | 35 pages, 16 figures |
| **[Attention-Based Multiscale Temporal Fusion Network for Uncertain-Mode Fault Diagnosis in Multimode Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05172v3)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fault diagnosis in multimode processes plays a critical role in ensuring the safe operation of industrial systems across multiple modes. It faces a great challenge yet to be addressed - that is, the significant distributional differences among monitoring data from multiple modes make it difficult for the models to extract shared feature representations related to system health conditions. In response to this problem, this paper introduces a novel method called attention-based multiscale temporal fusion network. The multiscale depthwise convolution and gated recurrent unit are employed to extract multiscale contextual local features and long-short-term features. Instance normalization is applied to suppress mode-specific information. Furthermore, a temporal attention mechanism is designed to focus on critical time points with higher cross-mode shared information, thereby enhancing the accuracy of fault diagnosis. The proposed model is applied to Tennessee Eastman process dataset and three-phase flow facility dataset. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior diagnostic performance and maintains a small model size. The source code will be available on GitHub at https://github.com/GuangqiangLi/AMTFNet.</p></details> | 32 pages,11 figures |
| **[Temporally Consistent Dynamic Scene Graphs: An End-to-End Approach for Action Tracklet Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02808v2)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding video content is pivotal for advancing real-world applications like activity recognition, autonomous systems, and human-computer interaction. While scene graphs are adept at capturing spatial relationships between objects in individual frames, extending these representations to capture dynamic interactions across video sequences remains a significant challenge. To address this, we present TCDSG, Temporally Consistent Dynamic Scene Graphs, an innovative end-to-end framework that detects, tracks, and links subject-object relationships across time, generating action tracklets, temporally consistent sequences of entities and their interactions. Our approach leverages a novel bipartite matching mechanism, enhanced by adaptive decoder queries and feedback loops, ensuring temporal coherence and robust tracking over extended sequences. This method not only establishes a new benchmark by achieving over 60% improvement in temporal recall@k on the Action Genome, OpenPVSG, and MEVA datasets but also pioneers the augmentation of MEVA with persistent object ID annotations for comprehensive tracklet generation. By seamlessly integrating spatial and temporal dynamics, our work sets a new standard in multi-frame video analysis, opening new avenues for high-impact applications in surveillance, autonomous navigation, and beyond.</p></details> |  |
| **[Influence Maximization in Temporal Networks with Persistent and Reactive Behaviors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20936v2)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Influence maximization in temporal social networks presents unique challenges due to the dynamic interactions that evolve over time. Traditional diffusion models often fall short in capturing the real-world complexities of active-inactive transitions among nodes, obscuring the true behavior of influence spread. In dynamic networks, nodes do not simply transition to an active state once; rather, they can oscillate between active and inactive states, with the potential for reactivation and reinforcement over time. This reactivation allows previously influenced nodes to regain influence potency, enhancing their ability to spread influence to others and amplifying the overall diffusion process. Ignoring these transitions can thus conceal the cumulative impact of influence, making it essential to account for them in any effective diffusion model. To address these challenges, we introduce the Continuous Persistent Susceptible-Infected Model with Reinforcement and Re-activation (cpSI-R), which explicitly incorporates active-inactive transitions, capturing the progressive reinforcement that makes nodes more potent spreaders upon reactivation. This model naturally leads to a submodular and monotone objective function, which supports efficient optimization for seed selection in influence maximization tasks. Alongside cpSI-R, we propose an efficient temporal snapshot sampling method, simplifying the analysis of evolving networks. We then adapt the prior algorithms of seed selection to our model and sampling strategy, resulting in reduced computational costs and enhanced seed selection efficiency. Experimental evaluations on diverse datasets demonstrate substantial improvements in performance over baseline methods, underscoring the effectiveness of cpSI-R for real-world temporal networks</p></details> |  |

However, despite extensive benchmarking efforts, it remains unclear whether current Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) effectively capture core temporal patterns such as periodicity, cause-and-effect, and long-range dependencies. In this work, we introduce the Temporal Graph Reasoning Benchmark (T-GRAB), a comprehensive set of synthetic tasks designed to systematically probe the capabilities of TGNNs to reason across time. T-GRAB provides controlled, interpretable tasks that isolate key temporal skills: counting/memorizing periodic repetitions, inferring delayed causal effects, and capturing long-range dependencies over both spatial and temporal dimensions. We evaluate 11 temporal graph learning methods on these tasks, revealing fundamental shortcomings in their ability to generalize temporal patterns.

| **[Temporally-Constrained Video Reasoning Segmentation and Automated Benchmark Construction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16718v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional approaches to video segmentation are confined to predefined object categories and cannot identify out-of-vocabulary objects, let alone objects that are not identified explicitly but only referred to implicitly in complex text queries. This shortcoming limits the utility for video segmentation in complex and variable scenarios, where a closed set of object categories is difficult to define and where users may not know the exact object category that will appear in the video. Such scenarios can arise in operating room video analysis, where different health systems may use different workflows and instrumentation, requiring flexible solutions for video analysis. Reasoning segmentation (RS) now offers promise towards such a solution, enabling natural language text queries as interaction for identifying object to segment. However, existing video RS formulation assume that target objects remain contextually relevant throughout entire video sequences. This assumption is inadequate for real-world scenarios in which objects of interest appear, disappear or change relevance dynamically based on temporal context, such as surgical instruments that become relevant only during specific procedural phases or anatomical structures that gain importance at particular moments during surgery. Our first contribution is the introduction of temporally-constrained video reasoning segmentation, a novel task formulation that requires models to implicitly infer when target objects become contextually relevant based on text queries that incorporate temporal reasoning. Since manual annotation of temporally-constrained video RS datasets would be expensive and limit scalability, our second contribution is an innovative automated benchmark construction method. Finally, we present TCVideoRSBenchmark, a temporally-constrained video RS dataset containing 52 samples using the videos from the MVOR dataset.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods typically necessitate supervised learning based on human-refined masks in the ventricular myocardium, which become impractical without contrast agents. We introduce a self-supervised framework, namely Codebook-based Temporal-Spatial Learning (CTSL), that learns dynamic, spatiotemporal representations from raw Cine data without requiring segmentation masks. CTSL decouples temporal and spatial features through a multi-view distillation strategy, where the teacher model processes multiple Cine views, and the student model learns from reduced-dimensional Cine-SA sequences. By leveraging codebook-based feature representations and dynamic lesion self-detection through motion cues, CTSL captures intricate temporal dependencies and motion patterns. High-confidence MACE risk predictions are achieved through our model, providing a rapid, non-invasive solution for cardiac risk assessment that outperforms traditional contrast-dependent methods, thereby enabling timely and accessible heart disease diagnosis in clinical settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at MICCAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Multimodal Deviation Perceiving Framework for Weakly-Supervised Temporal Forgery Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16596v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current researches on Deepfake forensics often treat detection as a classification task or temporal forgery localization problem, which are usually restrictive, time-consuming, and challenging to scale for large datasets. To resolve these issues, we present a multimodal deviation perceiving framework for weakly-supervised temporal forgery localization (MDP), which aims to identify temporal partial forged segments using only video-level annotations. The MDP proposes a novel multimodal interaction mechanism (MI) and an extensible deviation perceiving loss to perceive multimodal deviation, which achieves the refined start and end timestamps localization of forged segments. Specifically, MI introduces a temporal property preserving cross-modal attention to measure the relevance between the visual and audio modalities in the probabilistic embedding space. It could identify the inter-modality deviation and construct comprehensive video features for temporal forgery localization. To explore further temporal deviation for weakly-supervised learning, an extensible deviation perceiving loss has been proposed, aiming at enlarging the deviation of adjacent segments of the forged samples and reducing that of genuine samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and achieve comparable results to fully-supervised approaches in several evaluation metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 3 figures,conference</p></details> |
| **[Learning Temporal Abstractions via Variational Homomorphisms in Option-Induced Abstract MDPs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16473v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable reasoning ability through explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, but generating these step-by-step textual explanations is computationally expensive and slow. To overcome this, we aim to develop a framework for efficient, implicit reasoning, where the model "thinks" in a latent space without generating explicit text for every step. We propose that these latent thoughts can be modeled as temporally-extended abstract actions, or options, within a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework. To effectively learn a diverse library of options as latent embeddings, we first introduce the Variational Markovian Option Critic (VMOC), an off-policy algorithm that uses variational inference within the HiT-MDP framework. To provide a rigorous foundation for using these options as an abstract reasoning space, we extend the theory of continuous MDP homomorphisms. This proves that learning a policy in the simplified, abstract latent space, for which VMOC is suited, preserves the optimality of the solution to the original, complex problem. Finally, we propose a cold-start procedure that leverages supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data to distill human reasoning demonstrations into this latent option space, providing a rich initialization for the model's reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves strong performance on complex logical reasoning benchmarks and challenging locomotion tasks, validating our framework as a principled method for learning abstract skills for both language and control.</p></details> |  |
| **[COMPASS: Cooperative Multi-Agent Persistent Monitoring using Spatio-Temporal Attention Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16306v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Persistent monitoring of dynamic targets is essential in real-world applications such as disaster response, environmental sensing, and wildlife conservation, where mobile agents must continuously gather information under uncertainty. We propose COMPASS, a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework that enables decentralized agents to persistently monitor multiple moving targets efficiently. We model the environment as a graph, where nodes represent spatial locations and edges capture topological proximity, allowing agents to reason over structured layouts and revisit informative regions as needed. Each agent independently selects actions based on a shared spatio-temporal attention network that we design to integrate historical observations and spatial context. We model target dynamics using Gaussian Processes (GPs), which support principled belief updates and enable uncertainty-aware planning. We train COMPASS using centralized value estimation and decentralized policy execution under an adaptive reward setting. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that COMPASS consistently outperforms strong baselines in uncertainty reduction, target coverage, and coordination efficiency across dynamic multi-target scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[GroundFlow: A Plug-in Module for Temporal Reasoning on 3D Point Cloud Sequential Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21188v2)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential grounding in 3D point clouds (SG3D) refers to locating sequences of objects by following text instructions for a daily activity with detailed steps. Current 3D visual grounding (3DVG) methods treat text instructions with multiple steps as a whole, without extracting useful temporal information from each step. However, the instructions in SG3D often contain pronouns such as "it", "here" and "the same" to make language expressions concise. This requires grounding methods to understand the context and retrieve relevant information from previous steps to correctly locate object sequences. Due to the lack of an effective module for collecting related historical information, state-of-the-art 3DVG methods face significant challenges in adapting to the SG3D task. To fill this gap, we propose GroundFlow -- a plug-in module for temporal reasoning on 3D point cloud sequential grounding. Firstly, we demonstrate that integrating GroundFlow improves the task accuracy of 3DVG baseline methods by a large margin (+7.5\% and +10.2\%) in the SG3D benchmark, even outperforming a 3D large language model pre-trained on various datasets. Furthermore, we selectively extract both short-term and long-term step information based on its relevance to the current instruction, enabling GroundFlow to take a comprehensive view of historical information and maintain its temporal understanding advantage as step counts increase. Overall, our work introduces temporal reasoning capabilities to existing 3DVG models and achieves state-of-the-art performance in the SG3D benchmark across five datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reducing GPU Memory Fragmentation via Spatio-Temporal Planning for Efficient Large-Scale Model Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16274v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid scaling of large language models (LLMs) has significantly increased GPU memory pressure, which is further aggravated by training optimization techniques such as virtual pipeline and recomputation that disrupt tensor lifespans and introduce considerable memory fragmentation. Default GPU memory allocators of popular deep learning frameworks like PyTorch use online strategies without knowledge of tensor lifespans, which can waste up to 43\% of memory and cause out-of-memory errors, rendering optimization techniques ineffective or even unusable. To address this, we introduce STWeaver, a GPU memory allocator for deep learning frameworks that reduces fragmentation by exploiting the spatial and temporal regularity in memory allocation behaviors of training workloads. STWeaver introduces a novel paradigm that combines offline planning with online allocation. The offline planning leverages spatio-temporal regularities to generate a near-optimal allocation plan, while the online allocation handles complex and dynamic models such as Mixture-of-Experts (MoE). Built as a pluggable PyTorch allocator, STWeaver reduces fragmentation ratio on average by 79.2\% (up to 100\%) across both dense and sparse models, with negligible overhead. This enables more efficient, high-throughput training configurations and improves performance by up to 32.5\%.</p></details> |  |

The generation part of the recipe outputs audios from the input dataset with several critical characteristics, such as longer duration, noisy conditions, and containing multiple speakers, in a controllable fashion. The corresponding detection and localization protocol uses models. We conduct experiments based on self-supervised learning front-end and simple back-end. The results indicate that models trained using data generated with LENS-DF consistently outperform those trained via conventional recipes, demonstrating the effectiveness and usefulness of LENS-DF for robust audio deepfake detection and localization. We also conduct ablation studies on the variations introduced, investigating their impact on and relevance to realistic challenges in the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE International Joint Conference on Biometrics (IJCB) 2025, Osaka, Japan</p></details> |

Prior efforts have been made on accurate prediction of bike traffics, i.e., demand/pick-up and return/drop-off, to achieve system efficiency. However, bike station-level traffic prediction is difficult because of the spatial-temporal complexity of bike sharing systems. Moreover, such level of prediction over entire bike sharing systems is also challenging due to the large number of bike stations. To fill this gap, we propose BikeMAN, a multi-level spatio-temporal attention neural network to predict station-level bike traffic for entire bike sharing systems. The proposed network consists of an encoder and a decoder with an attention mechanism representing the spatial correlation between features of bike stations in the system and another attention mechanism describing the temporal characteristic of bike station traffic. Through experimental study on over 10 millions trips of bike sharing systems (> 700 stations) of New York City, our network showed high accuracy in predicting the bike station traffic of all stations in the city.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, UrbComp 2024</p></details> |
| **[The Other Mind: How Language Models Exhibit Human Temporal Cognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15851v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to advance, they exhibit certain cognitive patterns similar to those of humans that are not directly specified in training data. This study investigates this phenomenon by focusing on temporal cognition in LLMs. Leveraging the similarity judgment task, we find that larger models spontaneously establish a subjective temporal reference point and adhere to the Weber-Fechner law, whereby the perceived distance logarithmically compresses as years recede from this reference point. To uncover the mechanisms behind this behavior, we conducted multiple analyses across neuronal, representational, and informational levels. We first identify a set of temporal-preferential neurons and find that this group exhibits minimal activation at the subjective reference point and implements a logarithmic coding scheme convergently found in biological systems. Probing representations of years reveals a hierarchical construction process, where years evolve from basic numerical values in shallow layers to abstract temporal orientation in deep layers. Finally, using pre-trained embedding models, we found that the training corpus itself possesses an inherent, non-linear temporal structure, which provides the raw material for the model's internal construction. In discussion, we propose an experientialist perspective for understanding these findings, where the LLMs' cognition is viewed as a subjective construction of the external world by its internal representational system. This nuanced perspective implies the potential emergence of alien cognitive frameworks that humans cannot intuitively predict, pointing toward a direction for AI alignment that focuses on guiding internal constructions.

| **[TSkips: Efficiency Through Explicit Temporal Delay Connections in Spiking Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16711v2)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) with their bio-inspired Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons inherently capture temporal information. This makes them well-suited for sequential tasks like processing event-based data from Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS) and event-based speech tasks. Harnessing the temporal capabilities of SNNs requires mitigating vanishing spikes during training, capturing spatio-temporal patterns and enhancing precise spike timing. To address these challenges, we propose TSkips, augmenting SNN architectures with forward and backward skip connections that incorporate explicit temporal delays. These connections capture long-term spatio-temporal dependencies and facilitate better spike flow over long sequences. The introduction of TSkips creates a vast search space of possible configurations, encompassing skip positions and time delay values. To efficiently navigate this search space, this work leverages training-free Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to identify optimal network structures and corresponding delays. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on four event-based datasets: DSEC-flow for optical flow estimation, DVS128 Gesture for hand gesture recognition and Spiking Heidelberg Digits (SHD) and Spiking Speech Commands (SSC) for speech recognition. Our method achieves significant improvements across these datasets: up to 18% reduction in Average Endpoint Error (AEE) on DSEC-flow, 8% increase in classification accuracy on DVS128 Gesture, and up to 8% and 16% higher classification accuracy on SHD and SSC, respectively.</p></details> |  |

However, existing Video LLMs often exhibit limitations in fine-grained temporal reasoning, restricting their ability to precisely attribute responses to specific video moments, especially under constrained supervision. We introduce DaMO, a data-efficient Video LLM explicitly designed for accurate temporal reasoning and multimodal understanding. At its core, the proposed Temporal-aware Fuseformer employs a hierarchical dual-stream architecture that progressively captures temporal dynamics within each modality and effectively fuses complementary visual and audio information. To further enhance computational efficiency, DaMO integrates a global residual that reduces spatial redundancy while preserving essential semantic details. We train DaMO via a structured four-stage progressive training paradigm, incrementally equipping the model with multimodal alignment, semantic grounding, and temporal reasoning capabilities. This work also contributes multiple datasets augmented from existing ones with LLM-generated temporally grounded QA pairs for tasks requiring temporal supervision. Comprehensive experiments on temporal grounding and video QA benchmarks demonstrate that DaMO consistently surpasses prior methods, particularly in tasks demanding precise temporal alignment and reasoning. Our work establishes a promising direction for data-efficient video-language modeling.</p></details> |  |

Current DIR implementations rely on discrete volumetric motion representation, which often leads to compromised accuracy and uncertainty when handling significant anatomical changes and sliding boundaries. This limitation affects the reliability of subsequent contour propagation and dose accumulation procedures, particularly in regions with complex anatomical interfaces such as the lung-chest wall boundary. Given that organ motion is inherently a continuous process in both space and time, we aimed to develop a model that preserves these fundamental properties. Drawing inspiration from fluid mechanics, we propose a novel approach using implicit neural representation (INR) for continuous modeling of patient anatomical motion. This approach ensures spatial and temporal continuity while effectively unifying Eulerian and Lagrangian specifications to enable natural continuous motion modeling and frame interpolation. The integration of these specifications provides a more comprehensive understanding of anatomical deformation patterns. By leveraging the continuous representations, the CPT-DIR method significantly enhances registration and interpolation accuracy, automation, and speed. The method demonstrates superior performance in landmark and contour precision, particularly in challenging anatomical regions, representing a substantial advancement over conventional approaches in deformable image registration. The improved efficiency and accuracy of CPT-DIR make it particularly suitable for real-time adaptive radiotherapy applications.</p></details> |  |

It can estimate spatially accurate and temporally consistent disparities without relying on auxiliary information such as camera poses or optical flow. The strong capability is driven by rich priors from monocular video depth models, which are integrated with convolutional features to produce stable representations. To further enhance performance, key architectural innovations are introduced: all-to-all-pairs correlation, which constructs smooth and robust matching cost volumes, and temporal convex upsampling, which improves temporal coherence. These components collectively ensure robustness, accuracy, and temporal consistency, setting a new standard in video stereo matching. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets both qualitatively and quantitatively in zero-shot settings, as well as strong generalization to real-world indoor and outdoor scenarios.</p></details> | ICCV2025 |

Temporal reasoning, a critical component of natural language understanding, has raised increasing research attention. However, comprehensive testing of Allen's interval relations (e.g., before, after, during) -- a fundamental framework for temporal relationships -- remains underexplored. To fill this gap, we present ChronoSense, a new benchmark for evaluating LLMs' temporal understanding. It includes 16 tasks, focusing on identifying the Allen relation between two temporal events and temporal arithmetic, using both abstract events and real-world data from Wikidata. We assess the performance of seven recent LLMs using this benchmark and the results indicate that models handle Allen relations, even symmetrical ones, quite differently. Moreover, the findings suggest that the models may rely on memorization to answer time-related questions. Overall, the models' low performance highlights the need for improved temporal understanding in LLMs and ChronoSense offers a robust framework for future research in this area.

| **[Temporal Basis Function Models for Closed-Loop Neural Stimulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15274v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Closed-loop neural stimulation provides novel therapies for neurological diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD), but it is not yet clear whether artificial intelligence (AI) techniques can tailor closed-loop stimulation to individual patients or identify new therapies. Progress requires us to address a number of translational issues, including sample efficiency, training time, and minimizing loop latency such that stimulation may be shaped in response to changing brain activity. We propose temporal basis function models (TBFMs) to address these difficulties, and explore this approach in the context of excitatory optogenetic stimulation. We demonstrate the ability of TBF models to provide a single-trial, spatiotemporal forward prediction of the effect of optogenetic stimulation on local field potentials (LFPs) measured in two non-human primates. We further use simulations to demonstrate the use of TBF models for closed-loop stimulation, driving neural activity towards target patterns. The simplicity of TBF models allow them to be sample efficient, rapid to train (2-4min), and low latency (0.2ms) on desktop CPUs. We demonstrate the model on 40 sessions of previously published excitatory optogenetic stimulation data. For each session, the model required 15-20min of data collection to successfully model the remainder of the session. It achieved a prediction accuracy comparable to a baseline nonlinear dynamical systems model that requires hours to train, and superior accuracy to a linear state-space model. In our simulations, it also successfully allowed a closed-loop stimulator to control a neural circuit. Our approach begins to bridge the translational gap between complex AI-based approaches to modeling dynamical systems and the vision of using such forward prediction models to develop novel, clinically useful closed-loop stimulation protocols.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes an attention-based Graph Neural Network framework that captures spatial-temporal dependencies by modeling the food delivery environment as a graph. In this graph, nodes represent urban delivery zones, while edges reflect spatial proximity and inter-regional order flow patterns derived from historical data. The attention mechanism dynamically weighs the influence of neighboring zones, enabling the model to focus on the most contextually relevant areas during prediction. Temporal trends are jointly learned alongside spatial interactions, allowing the model to adapt to evolving demand patterns. Extensive experiments on real-world food delivery datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model in forecasting future order volumes with high accuracy. The framework offers a scalable and adaptive solution to support proactive fleet positioning, resource allocation, and dispatch optimization in urban food delivery operations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Video LLMs for Temporal Reasoning in Long Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02930v4)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces TemporalVLM, a video large language model (video LLM) capable of effective temporal reasoning and fine-grained understanding in long videos. At the core, our approach includes a visual encoder for mapping a long-term input video into features which are time-aware and contain both local and global cues. In particular, it first divides the input video into short-term clips, which are jointly encoded with their timestamps and fused across overlapping temporal windows into time-sensitive local features. Next, the local features are passed through a bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) module for global feature aggregation. The extracted time-aware and multi-level features are important for accurate temporal reasoning and fine-grained understanding in long videos. Moreover, to facilitate the evaluation of TemporalVLM, we present a large-scale long video dataset of industry assembly processes, namely IndustryASM, which consists of videos recorded on factory floors with actions and timestamps annotated by industrial engineers for time and motion studies and temporal action segmentation evaluation. Finally, extensive experiments on datasets of long videos, including TimeIT and IndustryASM, show that TemporalVLM achieves superior performance than previous methods across temporal reasoning and fine-grained understanding tasks, namely dense video captioning, temporal video grounding, video highlight detection, and temporal action segmentation. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to incorporate LSTMs into video LLMs.</p></details> |  |

TCP integrates a machine learning-based quantile forecaster with an online conformal calibration layer. This layer's thresholds are updated via a modified Robbins-Monro scheme, allowing the model to dynamically adapt to volatility clustering and regime shifts without rigid parametric assumptions. We benchmark TCP against GARCH, Historical Simulation, and static Quantile Regression across diverse financial assets. Our empirical results reveal a critical flaw in static methods: while sharp, Quantile Regression is poorly calibrated, systematically over-covering the nominal 95% target. In contrast, TCP's adaptive mechanism actively works to achieve the correct coverage level, successfully navigating the coverage-sharpness tradeoff. Visualizations during the 2020 market crash confirm TCP's superior adaptive response, and a comprehensive sensitivity analysis demonstrates the framework's robustness to hyperparameter choices. Overall, TCP offers a practical and theoretically-grounded solution to the central challenge of calibrated uncertainty quantification for time series under distribution shift, advancing the interface between statistical inference and machine learning.</p></details> |  |

The sample population branching factor-the expected number of new onsets triggered by a given event-is a key summary of self-excitation in behavior dynamics. Prior pooled models overestimate this quantity by ignoring patient-specific variability. We addressed this using a hierarchical Hawkes process with an exponential kernel and edge-effect correction allowing partial pooling across patients. This approach reduces bias from high-frequency individuals and stabilizes estimates for those with sparse data. Bayesian inference was performed using the No U-Turn Sampler with model evaluation via convergence diagnostics, power-scaling sensitivity analysis, and multiple Goodness-of-Fit (GOF) metrics: PSIS-LOO the Lewis test with Durbin's modification and residual analysis based on the Random Time Change Theorem (RTCT). The hierarchical model yielded a significantly lower and more precise branching factor estimate mean (0.742 +- 0.026) than the pooled model (0.899 +- 0.015) and narrower intervals than the unpooled model (0.717 +- 0.139). This led to a threefold smaller cascade of events per onset under the hierarchical model. Sensitivity analyses confirmed robustness to prior and likelihood perturbations while the unpooled model showed instability for sparse individuals. GOF measures consistently favored or on par to the hierarchical model. Hierarchical Hawkes modeling with edge-effect correction provides robust estimation of branching dynamics by capturing both within- and between-patient variability. This enables clearer separation of endogenous from exogenous events supports linkage to physiological signals and enhances early warning systems individualized treatment and resource allocation in inpatient care.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to BMC Bioinformatics</p></details> |
| **[STL-GO: Spatio-Temporal Logic with Graph Operators for Distributed Systems with Multiple Network Topologies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15147v1)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent systems (MASs) consisting of a number of autonomous agents that communicate, coordinate, and jointly sense the environment to achieve complex missions can be found in a variety of applications such as robotics, smart cities, and internet-of-things applications. Modeling and monitoring MAS requirements to guarantee overall mission objectives, safety, and reliability is an important problem. Such requirements implicitly require reasoning about diverse sensing and communication modalities between agents, analysis of the dependencies between agent tasks, and the spatial or virtual distance between agents. To capture such rich MAS requirements, we model agent interactions via multiple directed graphs, and introduce a new logic -- Spatio-Temporal Logic with Graph Operators (STL-GO). The key innovation in STL-GO are graph operators that enable us to reason about the number of agents along either the incoming or outgoing edges of the underlying interaction graph that satisfy a given property of interest; for example, the requirement that an agent should sense at least two neighboring agents whose task graphs indicate the ability to collaborate. We then propose novel distributed monitoring conditions for individual agents that use only local information to determine whether or not an STL-GO specification is satisfied. We compare the expressivity of STL-GO against existing spatio-temporal logic formalisms, and demonstrate the utility of STL-GO and our distributed monitors in a bike-sharing and a multi-drone case study.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods depend on costly frame-level annotations during training, limiting real-world scalability. Also, they focus on detecting transition artifacts between bonafide and deepfake segments. As deepfake generation techniques increasingly smooth these transitions, detection has become more challenging. To address this, our work introduces a new perspective by analyzing frame-level temporal differences and reveals that deepfake speech exhibits erratic directional changes and unnatural local transitions compared to bonafide speech. Based on this finding, we propose a Temporal Difference Attention Module (TDAM) that redefines partial deepfake detection as identifying unnatural temporal variations, without relying on explicit boundary annotations. A dual-level hierarchical difference representation captures temporal irregularities at both fine and coarse scales, while adaptive average pooling preserves essential patterns across variable-length inputs to minimize information loss. Our TDAM-AvgPool model achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an EER of 0.59% on the PartialSpoof dataset and 0.03% on the HAD dataset, which significantly outperforms the existing methods without requiring frame-level supervision.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 4 figures, 4 tables.

While large language models (LLMs) achieve unification through task-agnostic data and generation, existing visual generation models fail to meet these principles. Current approaches either rely on per-task datasets and large-scale training or adapt pre-trained image models with task-specific modifications, limiting their generalizability. In this work, we explore video models as a foundation for unified image generation, leveraging their inherent ability to model temporal correlations. We introduce RealGeneral, a novel framework that reformulates image generation as a conditional frame prediction task, analogous to in-context learning in LLMs. To bridge the gap between video models and condition-image pairs, we propose (1) a Unified Conditional Embedding module for multi-modal alignment and (2) a Unified Stream DiT Block with decoupled adaptive LayerNorm and attention mask to mitigate cross-modal interference. RealGeneral demonstrates effectiveness in multiple important visual generation tasks, e.g., it achieves a 14.5% improvement in subject similarity for customized generation and a 10% enhancement in image quality for canny-to-image task.

| **[TopoStreamer: Temporal Lane Segment Topology Reasoning in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00709v2)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lane segment topology reasoning constructs a comprehensive road network by capturing the topological relationships between lane segments and their semantic types. This enables end-to-end autonomous driving systems to perform road-dependent maneuvers such as turning and lane changing. However, the limitations in consistent positional embedding and temporal multiple attribute learning in existing methods hinder accurate roadnet reconstruction. To address these issues, we propose TopoStreamer, an end-to-end temporal perception model for lane segment topology reasoning. Specifically, TopoStreamer introduces three key improvements: streaming attribute constraints, dynamic lane boundary positional encoding, and lane segment denoising. The streaming attribute constraints enforce temporal consistency in both centerline and boundary coordinates, along with their classifications. Meanwhile, dynamic lane boundary positional encoding enhances the learning of up-to-date positional information within queries, while lane segment denoising helps capture diverse lane segment patterns, ultimately improving model performance. Additionally, we assess the accuracy of existing models using a lane boundary classification metric, which serves as a crucial measure for lane-changing scenarios in autonomous driving. On the OpenLane-V2 dataset, TopoStreamer demonstrates significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, achieving substantial performance gains of +3.0% mAP in lane segment perception and +1.7% OLS in centerline perception tasks.</p></details> |  |

Mining temporal motifs is essential for applications such as fraud detection, cybersecurity, and dynamic network analysis. However, conventional motif mining approaches treat each query independently, incurring significant redundant computations when similar substructures exist across multiple motifs. In this paper, we propose Mayura, a novel framework that unifies the mining of multiple temporal motifs by exploiting their inherent structural and temporal commonalities. Central to our approach is the Motif-Group Tree (MG-Tree), a hierarchical data structure that organizes related motifs and enables the reuse of common search paths, thereby reducing redundant computation. We propose a co-mining algorithm that leverages the MG-Tree and develop a flexible runtime capable of exploiting both CPU and GPU architectures for scalable performance. Empirical evaluations on diverse real-world datasets demonstrate that Mayura achieves substantial improvements over the state-of-the-art techniques that mine each motif individually, with an average speed-up of 2.4x on the CPU and 1.7x on the GPU, while maintaining the exactness required for high-stakes applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[LeAdQA: LLM-Driven Context-Aware Temporal Grounding for Video Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14784v1)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Question Answering (VideoQA) requires identifying sparse critical moments in long videos and reasoning about their causal relationships to answer semantically complex questions. While recent advances in multimodal learning have improved alignment and fusion, current approaches remain limited by two prevalent but fundamentally flawed strategies: (1) task-agnostic sampling indiscriminately processes all frames, overwhelming key events with irrelevant content; and (2) heuristic retrieval captures superficial patterns but misses causal-temporal structures needed for complex reasoning. To address these challenges, we introduce LeAdQA, an innovative approach that bridges these gaps through synergizing causal-aware query refinement with fine-grained visual grounding. Our method first leverages LLMs to reformulate question-option pairs, resolving causal ambiguities and sharpening temporal focus. These refined queries subsequently direct a temporal grounding model to precisely retrieve the most salient segments, complemented by an adaptive fusion mechanism dynamically integrating the evidence to maximize relevance. The integrated visual-textual cues are then processed by an MLLM to generate accurate, contextually-grounded answers. Experiments on NExT-QA, IntentQA, and NExT-GQA demonstrate that our method's precise visual grounding substantially enhances the understanding of video-question relationships, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on complex reasoning tasks while maintaining computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |

Chest X-rays (CXRs) are a vital diagnostic tool, providing insights into clinical trajectories, but their irregular acquisition limits their utility. Existing tools for CXR interpretation are constrained by cross-sectional analysis, failing to capture temporal dynamics. To address this, we introduce CXR-TFT, a novel multi-modal framework that integrates temporally sparse CXR imaging and radiology reports with high-frequency clinical data, such as vital signs, laboratory values, and respiratory flow sheets, to predict the trajectory of CXR findings in critically ill patients. CXR-TFT leverages latent embeddings from a vision encoder that are temporally aligned with hourly clinical data through interpolation. A transformer model is then trained to predict CXR embeddings at each hour, conditioned on previous embeddings and clinical measurements. In a retrospective study of 20,000 ICU patients, CXR-TFT demonstrated high accuracy in forecasting abnormal CXR findings up to 12 hours before they became radiographically evident. This predictive capability in clinical data holds significant potential for enhancing the management of time-sensitive conditions like acute respiratory distress syndrome, where early intervention is crucial and diagnoses are often delayed. By providing distinctive temporal resolution in prognostic CXR analysis, CXR-TFT offers actionable 'whole patient' insights that can directly improve clinical outcomes.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Re...</summary><p>In Review for MICCAI 2025</p></details> |

This paper proposes SST-CL, a novel framework integrating spatial-temporal transformers with curriculum learning. Our method introduces two core components: a spatial encoder that models inter-channel relationships and a temporal encoder that captures multi-scale dependencies through windowed attention mechanisms, enabling simultaneous extraction of spatial correlations and temporal dynamics from EEG signals. Complementing this architecture, an intensity-aware curriculum learning strategy progressively guides training from high-intensity to low-intensity emotional states through dynamic sample scheduling based on a dual difficulty assessment. Comprehensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across various emotional intensity levels, with ablation studies confirming the necessity of both architectural components and the curriculum learning mechanism.</p></details> |  |

Visual analytics combines computational techniques with interactive visualizations, enabling the identification of patterns, anomalies, and attribute interactions. However, existing approaches frequently overlook the interplay between temporal and multivariate attributes. We introduce EventBox, a novel data representation and visual encoding approach for analyzing groups of events and their multivariate attributes. We have integrated EventBox into Sequen-C, a visual analytics system for the analysis of event sequences. To enable the agile creation of EventBoxes in Sequen-C, we have added user-driven transformations, including alignment, sorting, substitution and aggregation. To enhance analytical depth, we incorporate automatically generated statistical analyses, providing additional insight into the significance of attribute interactions. We evaluated our approach involving 21 participants (3 domain experts, 18 novice data analysts). We used the ICE-T framework to assess visualization value, user performance metrics completing a series of tasks, and interactive sessions with domain experts. We also present three case studies with real-world healthcare data demonstrating how EventBox and its integration into Sequen-C reveal meaningful patterns, anomalies, and insights. These results demonstrate that our work advances visual analytics by providing a flexible solution for exploring temporal and multivariate attributes in event sequences.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the author's version of the article to be published in IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics, and presented at IEEE VIS 2025. 11 pages, 7 figures</p></details> |

Reinforcement learning can be applied on recommendation to study such a problem but is also subject to large search space, sparse user feedback and long interactive latency. Motivated by recent progress in hierarchical reinforcement learning, we propose a novel framework called mccHRL to provide different levels of temporal abstraction on listwise recommendation. Within the hierarchical framework, the high-level agent studies the evolution of user perception, while the low-level agent produces the item selection policy by modeling the process as a sequential decision-making problem. We argue that such framework has a well-defined decomposition of the outra-session context and the intra-session context, which are encoded by the high-level and low-level agents, respectively. To verify this argument, we implement both a simulator-based environment and an industrial dataset-based experiment. Results observe significant performance improvement by our method, compared with several well-known baselines. Data and codes have been made public.</p></details> | 18 pages, 4 figures |

Specifically, it is still difficult for robots to adapt the learned skills to new environments with different task and motion requirements, especially in long-horizon, multi-stage scenarios with intricate constraints. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical framework, called BT-TL-DMPs, that integrates Behavior Tree (BT), Temporal Logic (TL), and Dynamical Movement Primitives (DMPs) to address this problem. Within this framework, Signal Temporal Logic (STL) is employed to formally specify complex, long-horizon task requirements and constraints. These STL specifications are systematically transformed to generate reactive and modular BTs for high-level decision-making task structure. An STL-constrained DMP optimization method is proposed to optimize the DMP forcing term, allowing the learned motion primitives to adapt flexibly while satisfying intricate spatiotemporal requirements and, crucially, preserving the essential dynamics learned from demonstrations. The framework is validated through simulations demonstrating generalization capabilities under various STL constraints and real-world experiments on several long-horizon robotic manipulation tasks. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively bridges the symbolic-motion gap, enabling more reliable and generalizable autonomous manipulation for complex robotic tasks.</p></details> | 11 pages, 8 figures |

Most existing methods rely on binary classifiers trained using real and fake image sequences, therefore hindering their generalization capabilities to unseen generation methods. Moreover, with the constant progress in generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), deepfake artifacts are becoming imperceptible at both the spatial and the temporal levels, making them extremely difficult to capture. To address these issues, we propose a fine-grained deepfake video detection approach called FakeSTormer that enforces the modeling of subtle spatio-temporal inconsistencies while avoiding overfitting. Specifically, we introduce a multi-task learning framework that incorporates two auxiliary branches for explicitly attending artifact-prone spatial and temporal regions. Additionally, we propose a video-level data synthesis strategy that generates pseudo-fake videos with subtle spatio-temporal artifacts, providing high-quality samples and hand-free annotations for our additional branches. Extensive experiments on several challenging benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared to recent state-of-the-art methods.

With advancements in artificial intelligence, sophisticated visual decoding architectures have achieved remarkable success in fMRI research, enabling more precise and fine-grained spatial concept localization. This has provided new tools for exploring the spatial representation of concepts in the brain. However, despite the millisecond-scale temporal resolution of EEG, which offers unparalleled advantages in tracking the dynamic evolution of cognitive processes, the temporal dynamics of neural representations based on EEG remain underexplored. This is primarily due to EEG's inherently low signal-to-noise ratio and its complex spatiotemporal coupling characteristics. To bridge this research gap, we propose a novel approach that integrates advanced neural decoding algorithms to systematically investigate how low-dimensional object properties are temporally encoded in EEG signals. We are the first to attempt to identify the specificity and prototypical temporal characteristics of concepts within temporal distributions. Our framework not only enhances the interpretability of neural representations but also provides new insights into visual decoding in brain-computer interfaces (BCI).</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we demonstrate that effective information compression may occur over time or space during sequences of node communications in distributed algorithms, leading to the concept of spatio-temporal compressors. This abstraction classifies existing compressors and inspires new compressors as spatio-temporal compressors, with their effectiveness described by constructive stability criteria from nonlinear system theory. Subsequently, we incorporate these spatio-temporal compressors directly into standard continuous-time consensus flows and distributed primal-dual flows, establishing conditions ensuring exponential convergence. Additionally, we introduce a novel observer-based distributed primal-dual continuous flow integrated with spatio-temporal compressors, which provides broader convergence conditions. These continuous flows achieve exponential convergence to the global optimum when the objective function is strongly convex and can be discretized using Euler approximations.

However, existing works neglect the real-world challenges for temporal reasoning: (1) intensive temporal information, (2) fast-changing event dynamics, and (3) complex temporal dependencies in social interactions. To bridge this gap, we propose a multi-level benchmark TIME, designed for temporal reasoning in real-world scenarios. TIME consists of 38,522 QA pairs, covering 3 levels with 11 fine-grained sub-tasks. This benchmark encompasses 3 sub-datasets reflecting different real-world challenges: TIME-Wiki, TIME-News, and TIME-Dial. We conduct extensive experiments on reasoning models and non-reasoning models. And we conducted an in-depth analysis of temporal reasoning performance across diverse real-world scenarios and tasks, and summarized the impact of test-time scaling on temporal reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we release TIME-Lite, a human-annotated subset to foster future research and standardized evaluation in temporal reasoning.

| **[Towards Temporal Knowledge Graph Alignment in the Wild](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14475v1)** | 2025-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal Knowledge Graph Alignment (TKGA) seeks to identify equivalent entities across heterogeneous temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) for fusion to improve their completeness. Although some approaches have been proposed to tackle this task, most assume unified temporal element standards and simplified temporal structures across different TKGs. They cannot deal with TKGA in the wild (TKGA-Wild), where multi-scale temporal element entanglement and cross-source temporal structural imbalances are common. To bridge this gap, we study the task of TKGA-Wild and propose HyDRA, a new and effective solution. HyDRA is the first to reformulate the task via multi-scale hypergraph retrieval-augmented generation to address the challenges of TKGA-Wild.In addition, we design a new scale-weave synergy mechanism for HyDRA, which incorporates intra-scale interactions and cross-scale conflict detection. This mechanism is designed to alleviate the fragmentation caused by multi-source temporal incompleteness and resolves inconsistencies arising from complex and uneven temporal event density distributions, thereby enhancing the model capacity to handle the intricacies of real-world temporal alignment. Finally, there is no standard benchmark that captures these challenges of TKGA-Wild and effectively evaluates existing methods. To this end, we formally propose to benchmark challenges for TKGA-Wild and validate the effectiveness of the method by establishing two new datasets(BETA and WildBETA). Extensive experiments on the new datasets and six representative benchmarks show that BETA and WildBETA better reflect real-world challenges. Meanwhile, HyDRA proposes a new paradigm for TKGA-Wild, consistently outperforming 24 competitive baselines, while maintaining strong efficiency and scalability.</p></details> | 18 pages, 6 figures |

In this study, we investigate how LLMs process the temporal meaning of linguistic aspect in narratives that were previously used in human studies. Using an Expert-in-the-Loop probing pipeline, we conduct a series of targeted experiments to assess whether LLMs construct semantic representations and pragmatic inferences in a human-like manner. Our findings show that LLMs over-rely on prototypicality, produce inconsistent aspectual judgments, and struggle with causal reasoning derived from aspect, raising concerns about their ability to fully comprehend narratives. These results suggest that LLMs process aspect fundamentally differently from humans and lack robust narrative understanding. Beyond these empirical findings, we develop a standardized experimental framework for the reliable assessment of LLMs' cognitive and linguistic capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward Temporal Causal Representation Learning with Tensor Decomposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14126v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal causal representation learning is a powerful tool for uncovering complex patterns in observational studies, which are often represented as low-dimensional time series. However, in many real-world applications, data are high-dimensional with varying input lengths and naturally take the form of irregular tensors. To analyze such data, irregular tensor decomposition is critical for extracting meaningful clusters that capture essential information. In this paper, we focus on modeling causal representation learning based on the transformed information. First, we present a novel causal formulation for a set of latent clusters. We then propose CaRTeD, a joint learning framework that integrates temporal causal representation learning with irregular tensor decomposition. Notably, our framework provides a blueprint for downstream tasks using the learned tensor factors, such as modeling latent structures and extracting causal information, and offers a more flexible regularization design to enhance tensor decomposition. Theoretically, we show that our algorithm converges to a stationary point. More importantly, our results fill the gap in theoretical guarantees for the convergence of state-of-the-art irregular tensor decomposition. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world electronic health record (EHR) datasets (MIMIC-III), with extensive benchmarks from both phenotyping and network recovery perspectives, demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques and enhances the explainability of causal representations.</p></details> |  |

Despite their importance, they are severely underrepresented in large-scale EHR datasets. For instance, in the widely used Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) dataset, only about $8.56\%$ of hospital visits include progress notes, leaving gaps in longitudinal patient narratives. In contrast, the dataset contains a diverse array of other note types, each capturing different aspects of care. We present DENSE (Documenting Evolving Progress Notes from Scattered Evidence), a system designed to align with clinical documentation workflows by simulating how physicians reference past encounters while drafting progress notes. The system introduces a fine-grained note categorization and a temporal alignment mechanism that organizes heterogeneous notes across visits into structured, chronological inputs. At its core, DENSE leverages a clinically informed retrieval strategy to identify temporally and semantically relevant content from both current and prior visits. This retrieved evidence is used to prompt a large language model (LLM) to generate clinically coherent and temporally aware progress notes. We evaluate DENSE on a curated cohort of patients with multiple visits and complete progress note documentation. The generated notes demonstrate strong longitudinal fidelity, achieving a temporal alignment ratio of $1.089$, surpassing the continuity observed in original notes. By restoring narrative coherence across fragmented documentation, our system supports improved downstream tasks such as summarization, predictive modeling, and clinical decision support, offering a scalable solution for LLM-driven note synthesis in real-world healthcare settings.</p></details> |  |

We thoroughly explore the rich spatio-temporal properties of transformers within a multi-stage architecture paradigm for the temporal action localization (TAL) task. This exploration led to the development of a hierarchical multi-stage transformer architecture called PCL-Former, where each subtask is handled by a dedicated transformer module with a specialized loss function. Specifically, the Proposal-Former identifies candidate segments in an untrimmed video that may contain actions, the Classification-Former classifies the action categories within those segments, and the Localization-Former precisely predicts the temporal boundaries (i.e., start and end) of the action instances. To evaluate the performance of our method, we have conducted extensive experiments on three challenging benchmark datasets: THUMOS-14, ActivityNet-1.3, and HACS Segments. We also conducted detailed ablation experiments to assess the impact of each individual module of our PCL-Former.

This expressive system is achieved by a synergistic combination of two foundational ASP extensions: the linear-time logic of Here-and-There, providing robust nonmonotonic temporal reasoning capabilities, and the logic of Here-and-There with constraints, enabling the direct integration and manipulation of numeric constraints, among others. This work establishes the foundational logical framework for tackling complex dynamic systems with high resolution within the ASP paradigm.</p></details> |  |

While 3D CNNs have been effective at capturing spatiotemporal dynamics, recent Transformer models leverage self-attention to model long-range spatial and temporal dependencies. Despite achieving state-of-the-art performance on major benchmarks, Transformers remain computationally expensive, particularly with dense video data. To address this, we propose a lightweight Video Focal Modulation Network, DVFL-Net, which distills spatiotemporal knowledge from a large pre-trained teacher into a compact nano student model, enabling efficient on-device deployment. DVFL-Net utilizes knowledge distillation and spatial-temporal feature modulation to significantly reduce computation while preserving high recognition performance. We employ forward Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence alongside spatio-temporal focal modulation to effectively transfer both local and global context from the Video-FocalNet Base (teacher) to the proposed VFL-Net (student). We evaluate DVFL-Net on UCF50, UCF101, HMDB51, SSV2, and Kinetics-400, benchmarking it against recent state-of-the-art methods in Human Action Recognition (HAR). Additionally, we conduct a detailed ablation study analyzing the impact of forward KL divergence. The results confirm the superiority of DVFL-Net in achieving an optimal balance between performance and efficiency, demonstrating lower memory usage, reduced GFLOPs, and strong accuracy, making it a practical solution for real-time HAR applications.</p></details> | 17 pages |

However, this task is inherently difficult due to variations in fruit size, shape, occlusion, orientation, and the dynamic nature of orchards where fruits may appear or disappear between observations. In this article, we propose a novel method for fruit instance segmentation and re-identification on 3D terrestrial point clouds collected over time. Our approach directly operates on dense colored point clouds, capturing fine-grained 3D spatial detail. We segment individual fruits using a learning-based instance segmentation method applied directly to the point cloud. For each segmented fruit, we extract a compact and discriminative descriptor using a 3D sparse convolutional neural network. To track fruits across different times, we introduce an attention-based matching network that associates fruits with their counterparts from previous sessions. Matching is performed using a probabilistic assignment scheme, selecting the most likely associations across time. We evaluate our approach on real-world datasets of strawberries and apples, demonstrating that it outperforms existing methods in both instance segmentation and temporal re-identification, enabling robust and precise fruit monitoring across complex and dynamic orchard environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Computers and Electronics in Agriculture</p></details> |

While existing Temporal Graph Neural Networks (T-GNNs) have achieved notable success by leveraging complex architectures to model temporal and structural dependencies, they often suffer from scalability and efficiency challenges due to high computational overhead. In this paper, we propose EAGLE, a lightweight framework that integrates short-term temporal recency and long-term global structural patterns. EAGLE consists of a time-aware module that aggregates information from a node's most recent neighbors to reflect its immediate preferences, and a structure-aware module that leverages temporal personalized PageRank to capture the influence of globally important nodes. To balance these attributes, EAGLE employs an adaptive weighting mechanism to dynamically adjust their contributions based on data characteristics. Also, EAGLE eliminates the need for complex multi-hop message passing or memory-intensive mechanisms, enabling significant improvements in efficiency. Extensive experiments on seven real-world temporal graphs demonstrate that EAGLE consistently achieves superior performance against state-of-the-art T-GNNs in both effectiveness and efficiency, delivering more than a 50x speedup over effective transformer-based T-GNNs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted in 2024.

Existing approaches, depending on the domain they operate, suffer from several issues (e.g. geometric distortions, excessive cropping, poor generalization) that degrade the user experience. To address these issues, we introduce \textbf{GaVS}, a novel 3D-grounded approach that reformulates video stabilization as a temporally-consistent `local reconstruction and rendering' paradigm. Given 3D camera poses, we augment a reconstruction model to predict Gaussian Splatting primitives, and finetune it at test-time, with multi-view dynamics-aware photometric supervision and cross-frame regularization, to produce temporally-consistent local reconstructions. The model are then used to render each stabilized frame. We utilize a scene extrapolation module to avoid frame cropping. Our method is evaluated on a repurposed dataset, instilled with 3D-grounded information, covering samples with diverse camera motions and scene dynamics. Quantitatively, our method is competitive with or superior to state-of-the-art 2D and 2.5D approaches in terms of conventional task metrics and new geometry consistency.

We first introduce NarrativeReason, a novel dataset focused on temporal relationships among sequential events within narratives, distinguishing it from existing temporal reasoning datasets that primarily address pair-wise event relationships. Our approach then combines temporal reasoning with timeline summarisation through a knowledge distillation framework, where we first fine-tune a teacher model on temporal reasoning tasks and then distill this knowledge into a student model while simultaneously training it for the task of timeline summarisation. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves superior performance on out-of-domain mental health-related timeline summarisation tasks, which involve long social media threads with repetitions of events and a mix of emotions, highlighting the importance and generalisability of leveraging temporal reasoning to improve timeline summarisation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Signal Temporal Logic Control Synthesis among Uncontrollable Dynamic Agents with Conformal Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04242v4)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The control of dynamical systems under temporal logic specifications among uncontrollable dynamic agents is challenging due to the agents' a-priori unknown behavior. Existing works have considered the problem where either all agents are controllable, the agent models are deterministic and known, or no safety guarantees are provided. We propose a predictive control synthesis framework that guarantees, with high probability, the satisfaction of signal temporal logic (STL) tasks that are defined over a controllable system in the presence of uncontrollable stochastic agents. We use trajectory predictors and conformal prediction to construct probabilistic prediction regions for each uncontrollable agent that are valid over multiple future time steps. Specifically, we construct a normalized prediction region over all agents and time steps to reduce conservatism and increase data efficiency. We then formulate a worst-case bilevel mixed integer program (MIP) that accounts for all agent realizations within the prediction region to obtain an open-loop controller that provably guarantee task satisfaction with high probability. To efficiently solve this bilevel MIP, we propose an equivalent MIP program based on KKT conditions of the original bilevel formulation. Building upon this, we design a closed-loop controller, where both recursive feasibility and task satisfaction can be guaranteed with high probability. We illustrate our control synthesis framework on two case studies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Adaptation of Pre-trained Foundation Models for Music Structure Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13572v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Audio-based music structure analysis (MSA) is an essential task in Music Information Retrieval that remains challenging due to the complexity and variability of musical form. Recent advances highlight the potential of fine-tuning pre-trained music foundation models for MSA tasks. However, these models are typically trained with high temporal feature resolution and short audio windows, which limits their efficiency and introduces bias when applied to long-form audio. This paper presents a temporal adaptation approach for fine-tuning music foundation models tailored to MSA. Our method enables efficient analysis of full-length songs in a single forward pass by incorporating two key strategies: (1) audio window extension and (2) low-resolution adaptation. Experiments on the Harmonix Set and RWC-Pop datasets show that our method significantly improves both boundary detection and structural function prediction, while maintaining comparable memory usage and inference speed.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WASPAA 2025.

Current methods, such as reducing inter-frame redundancy, employing separate models for image-text relevance assessment, or utilizing temporal video grounding for event localization, substantially adopt unsupervised learning paradigms, whereas they struggle to address the complex scenarios in long video understanding. We propose Instructed Temporal Grounding for Videos (VideoITG), featuring customized frame sampling aligned with user instructions. The core of VideoITG is the VidThinker pipeline, an automated annotation framework that explicitly mimics the human annotation process. First, it generates detailed clip-level captions conditioned on the instruction; then, it retrieves relevant video segments through instruction-guided reasoning; finally, it performs fine-grained frame selection to pinpoint the most informative visual evidence. Leveraging VidThinker, we construct the VideoITG-40K dataset, containing 40K videos and 500K instructed temporal grounding annotations. We then design a plug-and-play VideoITG model, which takes advantage of visual language alignment and reasoning capabilities of Video-LLMs, for effective frame selection in a discriminative manner. Coupled with Video-LLMs, VideoITG achieves consistent performance improvements across multiple multimodal video understanding benchmarks, showing its superiority and great potentials for video understanding.</p></details> | Technical Report |

Previous methods solve the issue of insufficient observation by leveraging 4D diffusion models to generate videos at novel viewpoints. However, the generated videos from these models often lack spatio-temporal consistency, thus degrading view synthesis quality. In this paper, we propose a novel sliding iterative denoising process to enhance the spatio-temporal consistency of the 4D diffusion model. Specifically, we define a latent grid in which each latent encodes the image, camera pose, and human pose for a certain viewpoint and timestamp, then alternately denoising the latent grid along spatial and temporal dimensions with a sliding window, and finally decode the videos at target viewpoints from the corresponding denoised latents. Through the iterative sliding, information flows sufficiently across the latent grid, allowing the diffusion model to obtain a large receptive field and thus enhance the 4D consistency of the output, while making the GPU memory consumption affordable. The experiments on the DNA-Rendering and ActorsHQ datasets demonstrate that our method is able to synthesize high-quality and consistent novel-view videos and significantly outperforms the existing approaches.

It serves as a cornerstone for achieving high-level autonomous driving. However, current approaches remain inadequate for accurately modeling the complex spatio-temporal interdependencies and the unpredictable variability of human driving behavior. To address these challenges, we propose CaSTFormer, a Causal Spatio-Temporal Transformer to explicitly model causal interactions between driver behavior and environmental context for robust intention prediction. Specifically, CaSTFormer introduces a novel Reciprocal Shift Fusion (RSF) mechanism for precise temporal alignment of internal and external feature streams, a Causal Pattern Extraction (CPE) module that systematically eliminates spurious correlations to reveal authentic causal dependencies, and an innovative Feature Synthesis Network (FSN) that adaptively synthesizes these purified representations into coherent spatio-temporal inferences. We evaluate the proposed CaSTFormer on the public Brain4Cars dataset, and it achieves state-of-the-art performance. It effectively captures complex causal spatio-temporal dependencies and enhances both the accuracy and transparency of driving intention prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimal Empirical Risk Minimization under Temporal Distribution Shifts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13287v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal distribution shifts pose a key challenge for machine learning models trained and deployed in dynamically evolving environments. This paper introduces RIDER (RIsk minimization under Dynamically Evolving Regimes) which derives optimally-weighted empirical risk minimization procedures under temporal distribution shifts. Our approach is theoretically grounded in the random distribution shift model, where random shifts arise as a superposition of numerous unpredictable changes in the data-generating process. We show that common weighting schemes, such as pooling all data, exponentially weighting data, and using only the most recent data, emerge naturally as special cases in our framework. We demonstrate that RIDER consistently improves out-of-sample predictive performance when applied as a fine-tuning step on the Yearbook dataset, across a range of benchmark methods in Wild-Time. Moreover, we show that RIDER outperforms standard weighting strategies in two other real-world tasks: predicting stock market volatility and forecasting ride durations in NYC taxi data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Signal Temporal Logic Compliant Co-design of Planning and Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13225v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work presents a novel co-design strategy that integrates trajectory planning and control to handle STL-based tasks in autonomous robots. The method consists of two phases: $(i)$ learning spatio-temporal motion primitives to encapsulate the inherent robot-specific constraints and $(ii)$ constructing an STL-compliant motion plan from these primitives. Initially, we employ reinforcement learning to construct a library of control policies that perform trajectories described by the motion primitives. Then, we map motion primitives to spatio-temporal characteristics. Subsequently, we present a sampling-based STL-compliant motion planning strategy tailored to meet the STL specification. The proposed model-free approach, which generates feasible STL-compliant motion plans across various environments, is validated on differential-drive and quadruped robots across various STL specifications.

Unlike existing approaches in the literature, our solution is designed to meet a broader range of key requirements. This includes estimating confidence levels for predictions, detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) cases, and controlling false alarms. The proposed solution is based on a temporal convolutional autoencoder to automatically extract low-dimensional features from raw sensor data. Fault detection and diagnosis are respectively carried out using a binary and a multiclass classifier trained on the autoencoder latent and residual spaces. The classifiers are histogram-based gradient boosting models calibrated to output probabilities that can be interpreted as confidence levels. A relatively simple technique, based on inductive conformal anomaly detection, is used to identify OOD data. We leverage other simple yet effective techniques, such as cumulative sum control chart (CUSUM) to limit the false alarms, and threshold moving to address class imbalance in fault detection. The proposed framework is highly configurable and has been evaluated on simulated data, covering both nominal and anomalous operational scenarios. The results indicate that our solution is a promising first step, though testing with real data will be necessary to ensure that it achieves the required maturity level for operational use.</p></details> | 53 pages, 16 figures |

While MLLMs have been extensively studied for visual semantic understanding tasks, their ability to perform precise and quantitative spatial-temporal understanding in real-world applications remains largely unexamined, leading to uncertain prospects. To evaluate models' Spatial-Temporal Intelligence, we introduce STI-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' spatial-temporal understanding through challenging tasks such as estimating and predicting the appearance, pose, displacement, and motion of objects. Our benchmark encompasses a wide range of robot and vehicle operations across desktop, indoor, and outdoor scenarios. The extensive experiments reveals that the state-of-the-art MLLMs still struggle in real-world spatial-temporal understanding, especially in tasks requiring precise distance estimation and motion analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[STF: Spatial Temporal Fusion for Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18149v2)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is a challenging task that aims to predict the future trajectory of vehicles or pedestrians over a short time horizon based on their historical positions. The main reason is that the trajectory is a kind of complex data, including spatial and temporal information, which is crucial for accurate prediction. Intuitively, the more information the model can capture, the more precise the future trajectory can be predicted. However, previous works based on deep learning methods processed spatial and temporal information separately, leading to inadequate spatial information capture, which means they failed to capture the complete spatial information. Therefore, it is of significance to capture information more fully and effectively on vehicle interactions. In this study, we introduced an integrated 3D graph that incorporates both spatial and temporal edges. Based on this, we proposed the integrated 3D graph, which considers the cross-time interaction information. In specific, we design a Spatial-Temporal Fusion (STF) model including Multi-layer perceptions (MLP) and Graph Attention (GAT) to capture the spatial and temporal information historical trajectories simultaneously on the 3D graph. Our experiment on the ApolloScape Trajectory Datasets shows that the proposed STF outperforms several baseline methods, especially on the long-time-horizon trajectory prediction.</p></details> | 6 pages, 6 figures |

Leveraging fine-scale weekly mortality and high-resolution climate data from Austria (2002 to 2019), we assess how interactions between temperature, humidity, age, and gender influence mortality patterns. Our approach goes beyond conventional modelling by capturing complex dependencies through structured interactions across space-time, space-age, and age-time dimensions, allowing us to capture complex demographic and environmental dependencies. The analysis identifies district-level mortality patterns and quantifies climate-related risks on a weekly basis, offering new insights for public health surveillance.</p></details> |  |

Skills in calisthenics encompass both static and dynamic elements performed by athletes. The evaluation of static skills is based on their difficulty level and the duration of the hold. Automated tools able to recognize isometric skills from a video by segmenting them to estimate their duration would be desirable to assist athletes in their training and judges during competitions. Although the video understanding literature on action recognition through body pose analysis is rich, no previous work has specifically addressed the problem of calisthenics skill temporal video segmentation. This study aims to provide an initial step towards the implementation of automated tools within the field of Calisthenics. To advance knowledge in this context, we propose a dataset of video footage of static calisthenics skills performed by athletes. Each video is annotated with a temporal segmentation which determines the extent of each skill. We hence report the results of a baseline approach to address the problem of skill temporal segmentation on the proposed dataset. The results highlight the feasibility of the proposed problem, while there is still room for improvement.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 6 figures, In Proceedings of the 19th International Joint Conference on Computer Vision, Imaging and Computer Graphics Theory and Applications - Volume 2</p></details> |

The suggested BTSS is organized as a hierarchical structure that entails various embedded processing layers. We posit that observable translation behaviour - i.e., eye and finger movements - is fundamental when executing the physical act of translation but it is caused and shaped by higher-order cognitive processes and affective translation states. We analyse records of keystrokes and gaze data as indicators of the hidden mental processing structure and organize the behavioural patterns as a multi-layered embedded BTSS. The BTSS serves as the basis for a computational translation agent to simulate the temporal dynamics of affect, automatized behaviour and cognition during human translation production.</p></details> |  |

| **[Learning Perceptually Relevant Temporal Envelope Morphing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01588v2)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal envelope morphing, the process of interpolating between the amplitude dynamics of two audio signals, is an emerging problem in generative audio systems that lacks sufficient perceptual grounding. Morphing of temporal envelopes in a perceptually intuitive manner should enable new methods for sound blending in creative media and for probing perceptual organization in psychoacoustics. However, existing audio morphing techniques often fail to produce intermediate temporal envelopes when input sounds have distinct temporal structures; many morphers effectively overlay both temporal structures, leading to perceptually unnatural results. In this paper, we introduce a novel workflow for learning envelope morphing with perceptual guidance: we first derive perceptually grounded morphing principles through human listening studies, then synthesize large-scale datasets encoding these principles, and finally train machine learning models to create perceptually intermediate morphs. Specifically, we present: (1) perceptual principles that guide envelope morphing, derived from our listening studies, (2) a supervised framework to learn these principles, (3) an autoencoder that learns to compress temporal envelope structures into latent representations, and (4) benchmarks for evaluating audio envelope morphs, using both synthetic and naturalistic data, and show that our approach outperforms existing methods in producing temporally intermediate morphs.

Real-world measurements of such processes are often collected at irregularly distributed points in space, which can be effectively represented as graphs; however, there are currently only a few existing datasets.

In this work, we create and use synthetic datasets based on PDEs to support spatio-temporal graph modeling in machine learning for different applications. More precisely, we showcase three equations to model different types of disasters and hazards in the fields of epidemiology, atmospheric particles, and tsunami waves. Further, we show how such created datasets can be used by benchmarking several machine learning models on the epidemiological dataset.

These tags are generated during an offline sleep phase and serve as compact references to past experience, allowing the learner to incorporate information beyond its immediate input range. We evaluate this idea in a controlled synthetic environment designed to reveal the limitations of traditional neural network based sequence learners, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), when facing temporal patterns on multiple timescales. We evaluate this idea in a controlled synthetic environment designed to reveal the limitations of traditional neural network based sequence learners, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), when facing temporal patterns on multiple timescales. Our results, while preliminary, suggest that temporal chunking can significantly enhance learning efficiency under resource constrained settings. A small-scale human pilot study using a Serial Reaction Time Task further motivates the idea of structural abstraction. Although limited to synthetic tasks, this work serves as an early proof-of-concept, with initial evidence that learned context tags can transfer across related task, offering potential for future applications in transfer learning.</p></details> |  |

To address these issues, we introduce Hyperbolic-convolutions Adaptive-temporal-attention with Neural-representation and Synaptic-plasticity Network (HANS-Net), a novel segmentation framework that synergistically combines hyperbolic convolutions for hierarchical geometric representation, a wavelet-inspired decomposition module for multi-scale texture learning, a biologically motivated synaptic plasticity mechanism for adaptive feature enhancement, and an implicit neural representation branch to model fine-grained and continuous anatomical boundaries. Additionally, we incorporate uncertainty-aware Monte Carlo dropout to quantify prediction confidence and lightweight temporal attention to improve inter-slice consistency without sacrificing efficiency. Extensive evaluations of the LiTS dataset demonstrate that HANS-Net achieves a mean Dice score of 93.26%, an IoU of 88.09%, an average symmetric surface distance (ASSD) of 0.72 mm, and a volume overlap error (VOE) of 11.91%. Furthermore, cross-dataset validation on the 3D-IRCADb-01 dataset obtains an average Dice of 87.45%, IoU of 80.30%, ASSD of 1.525 mm, and VOE of 19.71%, indicating strong generalization across different datasets.

To advance this effective approach, we introduce CaTT (\textit{Contrast All The Time}), a new approach to unsupervised contrastive learning for time series, which takes advantage of dynamics between temporally similar moments more efficiently and effectively than existing methods. CaTT departs from conventional time-series contrastive approaches that rely on data augmentations or selected views. Instead, it uses the full temporal dimension by contrasting all time steps in parallel. This is made possible by a scalable NT-pair formulation, which extends the classic N-pair loss across both batch and temporal dimensions, making the learning process end-to-end and more efficient. CaTT learns directly from the natural structure of temporal data, using repeated or adjacent time steps as implicit supervision, without the need for pair selection heuristics. We demonstrate that this approach produces superior embeddings which allow better performance in downstream tasks. Additionally, training is faster than other contrastive learning approaches, making it suitable for large-scale and real-world time series applications.

Learning logic constraints is challenging due to the combinatorially large space of possible specifications and the ill-posed nature of non-Markovian constraints. To figure it out, we introduce a novel temporal-constraint learning method, which we call inverse logic-constraint learning (ILCL). Our method frames ICL as a two-player zero-sum game between 1) a genetic algorithm-based temporal-logic mining (GA-TL-Mining) and 2) logic-constrained reinforcement learning (Logic-CRL). GA-TL-Mining efficiently constructs syntax trees for parameterized truncated linear temporal logic (TLTL) without predefined templates. Subsequently, Logic-CRL finds a policy that maximizes task rewards under the constructed TLTL constraints via a novel constraint redistribution scheme. Our evaluations show ILCL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in learning and transferring TL constraints on four temporally constrained tasks. We also demonstrate successful transfer to real-world peg-in-shallow-hole tasks.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Imitation Learning from a Single Temporally Misaligned Video](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05397v2)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We examine the problem of learning sequential tasks from a single visual demonstration. A key challenge arises when demonstrations are temporally misaligned due to variations in timing, differences in embodiment, or inconsistencies in execution. Existing approaches treat imitation as a distribution-matching problem, aligning individual frames between the agent and the demonstration. However, we show that such frame-level matching fails to enforce temporal ordering or ensure consistent progress. Our key insight is that matching should instead be defined at the level of sequences. We propose that perfect matching occurs when one sequence successfully covers all the subgoals in the same order as the other sequence. We present ORCA (ORdered Coverage Alignment), a dense per-timestep reward function that measures the probability of the agent covering demonstration frames in the correct order. On temporally misaligned demonstrations, we show that agents trained with the ORCA reward achieve $4.5$x improvement ($0.11 \rightarrow 0.50$ average normalized returns) for Meta-world tasks and $6.6$x improvement ($6.55 \rightarrow 43.3$ average returns) for Humanoid-v4 tasks compared to the best frame-level matching algorithms. We also provide empirical analysis showing that ORCA is robust to varying levels of temporal misalignment. Our code is available at https://github.com/portal-cornell/orca/</p></details> | ICML 2025 |

Accurate demand prediction is critical to help make buying and inventory decisions for supply chain management of e-commerce and physical retailers, and such predictions are typically required for future horizons extending tens of weeks. This is especially challenging during high-stake sales events when demand peaks are particularly difficult to predict accurately. However, these events are important not only for managing supply chain operations but also for ensuring a seamless shopping experience for customers. To address this challenge, we propose Temporal-Aligned Transformer (TAT), a multi-horizon forecaster leveraging apriori-known context variables such as holiday and promotion events information for improving predictive performance. Our model consists of an encoder and decoder, both embedded with a novel Temporal Alignment Attention (TAA), designed to learn context-dependent alignment for peak demand forecasting. We conduct extensive empirical analysis on two large-scale proprietary datasets from a large e-commerce retailer. We demonstrate that TAT brings up to 30% accuracy improvement on peak demand forecasting while maintaining competitive overall performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, 7 tables, published at KDD 2025 workshop on AI for Supply Chain: Today and Future</p></details> |

| **[ToMacVF : Temporal Macro-action Value Factorization for Asynchronous Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10251v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing asynchronous MARL methods based on MacDec-POMDP typically construct training trajectory buffers by simply sampling limited and biased data at the endpoints of macro-actions, and directly apply conventional MARL methods on the buffers. As a result, these methods lead to an incomplete and inaccurate representation of the macro-action execution process, along with unsuitable credit assignments. To solve these problems, the Temporal Macro-action Value Factorization (ToMacVF) is proposed to achieve fine-grained temporal credit assignment for macro-action contributions. A centralized training buffer, called Macro-action Segmented Joint Experience Replay Trajectory (Mac-SJERT), is designed to incorporate with ToMacVF to collect accurate and complete macro-action execution information, supporting a more comprehensive and precise representation of the macro-action process. To ensure principled and fine-grained asynchronous value factorization, the consistency requirement between joint and individual macro-action selection called Temporal Macro-action based IGM (To-Mac-IGM) is formalized, proving that it generalizes the synchronous cases. Based on To-Mac-IGM, a modularized ToMacVF architecture, which satisfies CTDE principle, is designed to conveniently integrate previous value factorization methods. Next, the ToMacVF algorithm is devised as an implementation of the ToMacVF architecture. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to asynchronous baselines, our ToMacVF algorithm not only achieves optimal performance but also exhibits strong adaptability and robustness across various asynchronous multi-agent experimental scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fusing Large Language Models with Temporal Transformers for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10098v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful capabilities in performing various tasks and thus are applied by recent studies to time series forecasting (TSF) tasks, which predict future values with the given historical time series. Existing LLM-based approaches transfer knowledge learned from text data to time series prediction using prompting or fine-tuning strategies. However, LLMs are proficient at reasoning over discrete tokens and semantic patterns but are not initially designed to model continuous numerical time series data. The gaps between text and time series data lead LLMs to achieve inferior performance to a vanilla Transformer model that is directly trained on TSF data. However, the vanilla Transformers often struggle to learn high-level semantic patterns. In this paper, we design a novel Transformer-based architecture that complementarily leverages LLMs and vanilla Transformers, so as to integrate the high-level semantic representations learned by LLMs into the temporal information encoded by time series Transformers, where a hybrid representation is obtained by fusing the representations from the LLM and the Transformer. The resulting fused representation contains both historical temporal dynamics and semantic variation patterns, allowing our model to predict more accurate future values. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reprogramming Vision Foundation Models for Spatio-Temporal Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11558v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have achieved remarkable success in natural language processing and computer vision, demonstrating strong capabilities in modeling complex patterns. While recent efforts have explored adapting large language models (LLMs) for time-series forecasting, LLMs primarily capture one-dimensional sequential dependencies and struggle to model the richer spatio-temporal (ST) correlations essential for accurate ST forecasting. In this paper, we present \textbf{ST-VFM}, a novel framework that systematically reprograms Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) for general-purpose spatio-temporal forecasting. While VFMs offer powerful spatial priors, two key challenges arise when applying them to ST tasks: (1) the lack of inherent temporal modeling capacity and (2) the modality gap between visual and ST data. To address these, ST-VFM adopts a \emph{dual-branch architecture} that integrates raw ST inputs with auxiliary ST flow inputs, where the flow encodes lightweight temporal difference signals interpretable as dynamic spatial cues. To effectively process these dual-branch inputs, ST-VFM introduces two dedicated reprogramming stages. The \emph{pre-VFM reprogramming} stage applies a Temporal-Aware Token Adapter to embed temporal context and align both branches into VFM-compatible feature spaces. The \emph{post-VFM reprogramming} stage introduces a Bilateral Cross-Prompt Coordination module, enabling dynamic interaction between branches through prompt-based conditioning, thus enriching joint representation learning without modifying the frozen VFM backbone. Extensive experiments on ten spatio-temporal datasets show that ST-VFM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating effectiveness and robustness across VFM backbones (e.g., DINO, CLIP, DEIT) and ablation studies, establishing it as a strong general framework for spatio-temporal forecasting.</p></details> |  |

While existing methods primarily focus on modeling observed motion patterns and interactions with other vehicles, they often neglect the potential risks posed by the uncertain or aggressive behaviors of surrounding vehicles. In this paper, we propose a novel spatial-temporal risk-attentive trajectory prediction framework that incorporates a risk potential field to assess perceived risks arising from behaviors of nearby vehicles. The framework leverages a spatial-temporal encoder and a risk-attentive feature fusion decoder to embed the risk potential field into the extracted spatial-temporal feature representations for trajectory prediction. A risk-scaled loss function is further designed to improve the prediction accuracy of high-risk scenarios, such as short relative spacing. Experiments on the widely used NGSIM and HighD datasets demonstrate that our method reduces average prediction errors by 4.8% and 31.2% respectively compared to state-of-the-art approaches, especially in high-risk scenarios. The proposed framework provides interpretable, risk-aware predictions, contributing to more robust decision-making for autonomous driving systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, accepted at ITSC 2025</p></details> |

Exploring the relationships between vertices based on temporal paths is one of the fundamental tasks. In this paper, we conduct the first research to propose and investigate the problem of generating the temporal simple path graph (tspG), which is the subgraph consisting of all temporal simple paths from the source vertex to the target vertex within the given time interval. Directly enumerating all temporal simple paths and constructing the tspG is computationally expensive. To accelerate the processing, we propose an efficient method named Verification in Upper-bound Graph. It first incorporates the temporal path constraint and simple path constraint to exclude unpromising edges from the original graph, which obtains a tight upper-bound graph as a high-quality approximation of the tspG in polynomial time. Then, an Escape Edges Verification algorithm is further applied in the upper-bound graph to construct the exact tspG without exhaustively enumerating all temporal simple paths between given vertices. Finally, comprehensive experiments on 10 real-world graphs are conducted to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed techniques.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods often suffer from temporal inconsistencies, manifesting as flickering effects that compromise visual experience and adversely affect decision-making. While recent approaches have incorporated historical data to mitigate the issue, they often incur high computational costs and may introduce noisy information that interferes with object detection. We propose OccLinker, a novel plugin framework designed to seamlessly integrate with existing VONs for boosting performance. Our method efficiently consolidates historical static and motion cues, learns sparse latent correlations with current features through a dual cross-attention mechanism, and produces correction occupancy components to refine the base network's predictions. We propose a new temporal consistency metric to quantitatively identify flickering effects. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method delivers superior performance with negligible computational overhead, while effectively eliminating flickering artifacts.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods often falter in these areas. This paper proposes the BiDepth Multimodal Neural Network (BDMNN), which integrates two key innovations: 1) a bidirectional depth modulation mechanism that dynamically adjusts network depth to comprehensively capture both long-term seasonality and immediate short-term events; and 2) a novel convolutional self-attention cell (CSAC). Critically, unlike many attention mechanisms that can lose spatial acuity, our CSAC is specifically designed to preserve crucial spatial relationships throughout the network, akin to standard convolutional layers, while simultaneously capturing temporal dependencies. Evaluated on real-world urban traffic and precipitation datasets, BDMNN demonstrates significant accuracy improvements, achieving a 12% Mean Squared Error (MSE) reduction in urban traffic prediction and a 15% improvement in precipitation forecasting over leading deep learning benchmarks like ConvLSTM, using comparable computational resources. These advancements offer robust ST forecasting for smart city management, disaster prevention, and resource optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 6 figures.

Existing approaches in this field usually struggle to capture the complex spatio-temporal dependencies in EV charging behaviors, and their limited model parameters hinder their ability to learn complex data distribution representations from large datasets. To this end, we propose a novel EV spatio-temporal large language model (EV-STLLM) for accurate prediction. Our proposed framework is divided into two modules. In the data processing module, we utilize variational mode decomposition (VMD) for data denoising, and improved complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (ICEEMDAN) for data multi-frequency decomposition. Fuzzy information granulation (FIG) for extracting multi-scale information. Additionally, ReliefF is used for feature selection to mitigate redundancy. In the forecasting module, the EV-STLLM is used to directly achieve EV charging and occupancy forecasting. Firstly, we fully capture the intrinsic spatio-temporal characteristics of the data by integrating adjacency matrices derived from the regional stations network and spatio-temporal-frequency embedding information. Then, the partially frozen graph attention (PFGA) module is utilized to maintain the sequential feature modeling capabilities of the pre-trained large model while incorporating EV domain knowledge. Extensive experiments using real-world data from Shenzhen, China, demonstrate that our proposed framework can achieve superior accuracy and robustness compared to the state-of-the-art benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

| **[In-Trajectory Inverse Reinforcement Learning: Learn Incrementally Before An Ongoing Trajectory Terminates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15612v7)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) aims to learn a reward function and a corresponding policy that best fit the demonstrated trajectories of an expert. However, current IRL works cannot learn incrementally from an ongoing trajectory because they have to wait to collect at least one complete trajectory to learn. To bridge the gap, this paper considers the problem of learning a reward function and a corresponding policy while observing the initial state-action pair of an ongoing trajectory and keeping updating the learned reward and policy when new state-action pairs of the ongoing trajectory are observed. We formulate this problem as an online bi-level optimization problem where the upper level dynamically adjusts the learned reward according to the newly observed state-action pairs with the help of a meta-regularization term, and the lower level learns the corresponding policy. We propose a novel algorithm to solve this problem and guarantee that the algorithm achieves sub-linear local regret $O(\sqrt{T}+\log T+\sqrt{T}\log T)$. If the reward function is linear, we prove that the proposed algorithm achieves sub-linear regret $O(\log T)$. Experiments are used to validate the proposed algorithm.</p></details> |  |

We propose Ctx2TrajGen, a context-aware trajectory generation framework that synthesizes realistic urban driving behaviors using GAIL. Leveraging PPO and WGAN-GP, our model addresses nonlinear interdependencies and training instability inherent in microscopic settings. By explicitly conditioning on surrounding vehicles and road geometry, Ctx2TrajGen generates interaction-aware trajectories aligned with real-world context. Experiments on the drone-captured DRIFT dataset demonstrate superior performance over existing methods in terms of realism, behavioral diversity, and contextual fidelity, offering a robust solution to data scarcity and domain shift without simulation.</p></details> |  |

We use the feasible operating region of a controlled system as bounds for safe system states and evaluate the trajectories of the controller based on the projection of the full system state onto the two-dimensional PQ-plane. We demonstrate the defined conditions for an exemplary sub-transmission system. We show that the proposed method is suitable to evaluate controller performance and robustness for systems subject to disturbances.</p></details> |  |
| **[R-Stitch: Dynamic Trajectory Stitching for Efficient Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17307v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning enhances the problem-solving capabilities of large language models by encouraging step-by-step intermediate reasoning during inference. While effective, CoT introduces substantial computational overhead due to its reliance on autoregressive decoding over long token sequences. Existing acceleration strategies either reduce sequence length through early stopping or compressive reward designs, or improve decoding speed via speculative decoding with smaller models. However, speculative decoding suffers from limited speedup when the agreement between small and large models is low, and fails to exploit the potential advantages of small models in producing concise intermediate reasoning. In this paper, we present R-Stitch, a token-level, confidence-based hybrid decoding framework that accelerates CoT inference by switching between a small language model (SLM) and a large language model (LLM) along the reasoning trajectory. R-Stitch uses the SLM to generate tokens by default and delegates to the LLM only when the SLM's confidence falls below a threshold. This design avoids full-sequence rollback and selectively invokes the LLM on uncertain steps, preserving both efficiency and answer quality. R-Stitch is model-agnostic, training-free, and compatible with standard decoding pipelines. Experiments on math reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that R-Stitch achieves up to 85\% reduction in inference latency with negligible accuracy drop, highlighting its practical effectiveness in accelerating CoT reasoning.</p></details> |  |

In order to ensure that construction robots can perform tasks efficiently and accurately in complex construction environments, traditional single-objective trajectory optimization methods are difficult to meet the complex requirements of the changing construction environment. Therefore, we propose a multi-objective trajectory optimization for the robotic arm used in the curtain wall installation. First, we design a robotic arm for curtain wall installation, integrating serial, parallel, and folding arm elements, while considering its physical properties and motion characteristics. In addition, this paper proposes an NSGA-III-FO algorithm (NSGA-III with Focused Operator, NSGA-III-FO) that incorporates a focus operator screening mechanism to accelerate the convergence of the algorithm towards the Pareto front, thereby effectively balancing the multi-objective constraints of construction robots. The proposed algorithm is tested against NSGA-III, MOEA/D, and MSOPS-II in ten consecutive trials on the DTLZ3 and WFG3 test functions, showing significantly better convergence efficiency than the other algorithms. Finally, we conduct two sets of experiments on the designed robotic arm platform, which confirm the efficiency and practicality of the NSGA-III-FO algorithm in solving multi-objective trajectory planning problems for curtain wall installation tasks.</p></details> |  |

To tackle this challenge, our study innovatively draws inspiration from the mechanics of human upper limb movements during weight lifting, proposing a bio-inspired trajectory planning framework that incorporates human energy conversion principles. By collecting motion trajectories and electromyography (EMG) signals during dumbbell curls, we construct an anthropomorphic trajectory planning that integrates human force exertion patterns and energy consumption patterns. Utilizing the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm, we achieve dynamic load distribution for robotic arm trajectory planning based on human-like movement features. In practical application, these bio-inspired movement characteristics are applied to curtain wall installation tasks, validating the correctness and superiority of our trajectory planning method. Simulation results demonstrate a 48.4% reduction in energy consumption through intelligent conversion between kinetic and potential energy. This approach provides new insights and theoretical support for optimizing energy use in curtain wall installation robots during actual handling tasks.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose the GFM-Planner, a perception-aware trajectory planning framework based on the geometric feature metric, which enhances LiDAR localization accuracy by guiding the robot to avoid degraded areas. First, we derive the Geometric Feature Metric (GFM) from the fundamental LiDAR localization problem. Next, we design a 2D grid-based Metric Encoding Map (MEM) to efficiently store GFM values across the environment. A constant-time decoding algorithm is further proposed to retrieve GFM values for arbitrary poses from the MEM. Finally, we develop a perception-aware trajectory planning algorithm that improves LiDAR localization capabilities by guiding the robot in selecting trajectories through feature-rich areas. Both simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that our approach enables the robot to actively select trajectories that significantly enhance LiDAR localization accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IROS 2025</p></details> |

The model applies the Adaboost algorithm to divide multiple weak learners, and each submodel utilizes CNN to extract spatial features, LSTM to capture temporal features, and attention mechanism to capture global features comprehensively. The strong learner model, combined with multiple sub-models, then optimizes the hyperparameters of the prediction model through the natural selection behavior pattern simulated by SO. In this study, based on the real ADS-B data from Xi'an to Tianjin, the comparison experiments and ablation studies of multiple optimizers are carried out, and a comprehensive test and evaluation analysis is carried out. The results show that SO-CLA-adaboost outperforms traditional optimizers such as particle swarm, whale, and gray wolf in handling large-scale high-dimensional trajectory data. In addition, introducing the full-strategy collaborative improvement SO algorithm improves the model's prediction accuracy by 39.89%.</p></details> | in Chinese language |

However, current automated methods are limited to establishing cell developmental trajectories within individual samples, necessitating biologists to manually link cells across samples to construct complete cross-sample evolutionary trajectories that consider cellular spatial dynamics. This process demands substantial human effort due to the complex spatial correspondence between each pair of samples. To address this challenge, we first proposed a GNN-based model to predict cross-sample cell developmental trajectories. We then developed TrajLens, a visual analytics system that supports biologists in exploring and refining the cell developmental trajectories based on predicted links. Specifically, we designed the visualization that integrates features on cell distribution and developmental direction across multiple samples, providing an overview of the spatial evolutionary patterns of cell populations along trajectories. Additionally, we included contour maps superimposed on the original cell distribution data, enabling biologists to explore them intuitively. To demonstrate our system's performance, we conducted quantitative evaluations of our model with two case studies and expert interviews to validate its usefulness and effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalized Consistency Trajectory Models for Image Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12510v4)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models (DMs) excel in unconditional generation, as well as on applications such as image editing and restoration. The success of DMs lies in the iterative nature of diffusion: diffusion breaks down the complex process of mapping noise to data into a sequence of simple denoising tasks. Moreover, we are able to exert fine-grained control over the generation process by injecting guidance terms into each denoising step. However, the iterative process is also computationally intensive, often taking from tens up to thousands of function evaluations. Although consistency trajectory models (CTMs) enable traversal between any time points along the probability flow ODE (PFODE) and score inference with a single function evaluation, CTMs only allow translation from Gaussian noise to data. This work aims to unlock the full potential of CTMs by proposing generalized CTMs (GCTMs), which translate between arbitrary distributions via ODEs. We discuss the design space of GCTMs and demonstrate their efficacy in various image manipulation tasks such as image-to-image translation, restoration, and editing.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 (poster) |

Here, we propose a researcher population pyramids framework for tracking global demographic and gender trajectories using publication data. This framework provides a timely snapshot of historical and present demographics and gender balance, revealing three contrasting research systems: Emerging systems (e.g., Arab countries) exhibit high researcher inflows with widening gender gaps in cumulative productivity; Mature systems (e.g., the United States) show modest inflows with narrowing gender gaps; and Rigid systems (e.g., Japan) lag in both. Furthermore, by simulating future scenarios, the framework makes potential trajectories visible. If 2023 demographic patterns persist, Arab countries' systems could resemble mature or even rigid ones by 2050. Our framework provides a robust diagnostic tool for policymakers worldwide to foster sustainable talent pipelines and gender equality in academia.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 5 figures, 1 table, and SI</p></details> |

Functional connectivity can be represented by correlation matrices computed over time, where each matrix captures the Pearson correlation between the mean fMRI signals of different regions within a sliding window. We introduce several Log-Euclidean Riemannian framework for constructing smooth approximations of functional brain connectivity trajectories. Representing dynamic functional connectivity as time series of full-rank correlation matrices, we leverage recent theoretical Log-Euclidean diffeomorphisms to map these trajectories in practice into Euclidean spaces where polynomial regression becomes feasible. Pulling back the regressed curve ensures that each estimated point remains a valid correlation matrix, enabling a smooth, interpretable, and geometrically consistent approximation of the original brain connectivity dynamics. Experiments on fMRI-derived connectivity trajectories demonstrate the geometric consistency and computational efficiency of our approach.</p></details> |  |

Due to the restrictions on sensing capabilities in the underwater scenario, the AUV is limited to collecting only bearing measurements to the target. A framework called GBT is proposed with integration of online learning and planning. First, a Gaussian process learning method is proposed for the AUV to handle unknown target motion, wherein pseudo linear transformation of bearing measurements is introduced to address nonlinearity of bearings. A probabilistic bearing-data-dependent bound on tracking error is then rigorously established. Based on it, optimal desired bearings that can reduce tracking uncertainty are obtained analytically. Finally, the trajectory optimization problem is formulated and transformed into an easily solved one with parametric transformation. Numerical examples and comparison with existing methods verify the feasibility and superior performance of our proposed framework.</p></details> |  |

Chest X-rays (CXRs) are a vital diagnostic tool, providing insights into clinical trajectories, but their irregular acquisition limits their utility. Existing tools for CXR interpretation are constrained by cross-sectional analysis, failing to capture temporal dynamics. To address this, we introduce CXR-TFT, a novel multi-modal framework that integrates temporally sparse CXR imaging and radiology reports with high-frequency clinical data, such as vital signs, laboratory values, and respiratory flow sheets, to predict the trajectory of CXR findings in critically ill patients. CXR-TFT leverages latent embeddings from a vision encoder that are temporally aligned with hourly clinical data through interpolation. A transformer model is then trained to predict CXR embeddings at each hour, conditioned on previous embeddings and clinical measurements. In a retrospective study of 20,000 ICU patients, CXR-TFT demonstrated high accuracy in forecasting abnormal CXR findings up to 12 hours before they became radiographically evident. This predictive capability in clinical data holds significant potential for enhancing the management of time-sensitive conditions like acute respiratory distress syndrome, where early intervention is crucial and diagnoses are often delayed. By providing distinctive temporal resolution in prognostic CXR analysis, CXR-TFT offers actionable 'whole patient' insights that can directly improve clinical outcomes.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Re...</summary><p>In Review for MICCAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Consistency Trajectory Matching for One-Step Generative Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20349v4)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current diffusion-based super-resolution (SR) approaches achieve commendable performance at the cost of high inference overhead. Therefore, distillation techniques are utilized to accelerate the multi-step teacher model into one-step student model. Nevertheless, these methods significantly raise training costs and constrain the performance of the student model by the teacher model. To overcome these tough challenges, we propose Consistency Trajectory Matching for Super-Resolution (CTMSR), a distillation-free strategy that is able to generate photo-realistic SR results in one step. Concretely, we first formulate a Probability Flow Ordinary Differential Equation (PF-ODE) trajectory to establish a deterministic mapping from low-resolution (LR) images with noise to high-resolution (HR) images. Then we apply the Consistency Training (CT) strategy to directly learn the mapping in one step, eliminating the necessity of pre-trained diffusion model. To further enhance the performance and better leverage the ground-truth during the training process, we aim to align the distribution of SR results more closely with that of the natural images. To this end, we propose to minimize the discrepancy between their respective PF-ODE trajectories from the LR image distribution by our meticulously designed Distribution Trajectory Matching (DTM) loss, resulting in improved realism of our recovered HR images. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods can attain comparable or even superior capabilities on both synthetic and real datasets while maintaining minimal inference latency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |

Traditional Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) methods, while effective for offline planning, often struggle with premature convergence and latency in real-time scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose PE-PSO, an enhanced PSO-based online trajectory planner. The method introduces a persistent exploration mechanism to preserve swarm diversity and an entropy-based parameter adjustment strategy to dynamically adapt optimization behavior. UAV trajectories are modeled using B-spline curves, which ensure path smoothness while reducing optimization complexity. To extend this capability to UAV swarms, we develop a multi-agent framework that combines genetic algorithm (GA)-based task allocation with distributed PE-PSO, supporting scalable and coordinated trajectory generation. The distributed architecture allows for parallel computation and decentralized control, enabling effective cooperation among agents while maintaining real-time performance. Comprehensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms conventional PSO and other swarm-based planners across several metrics, including trajectory quality, energy efficiency, obstacle avoidance, and computation time. These results confirm the effectiveness and applicability of PE-PSO in real-time multi-UAV operations under complex environmental conditions.</p></details> | 8 papers,7 figures |

Real-world scenarios frequently present challenges such as occlusions and incomplete scene observations, which can compromise predictive accuracy. Thus, traditional video-based methods often struggle due to limited temporal and spatial perspectives. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative. Having been trained on a large text corpus describing human behaviors, LLMs likely encode plausible sequences of human actions in a home environment. However, LLMs, trained primarily on text data, lack inherent spatial awareness and real-time environmental perception. They struggle with understanding physical constraints and spatial geometry. Therefore, to be effective in a real-world spatial scenario, we propose a multimodal prediction framework that enhances LLM-based action prediction by integrating physical constraints derived from human trajectories. Our experiments demonstrate that combining LLM predictions with trajectory data significantly improves overall prediction performance. This enhancement is particularly notable in situations where the LLM receives limited scene information, highlighting the complementary nature of linguistic knowledge and physical constraints in understanding and anticipating human behavior.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IROS 2025</p></details> |

| **[STF: Spatial Temporal Fusion for Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18149v2)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is a challenging task that aims to predict the future trajectory of vehicles or pedestrians over a short time horizon based on their historical positions. The main reason is that the trajectory is a kind of complex data, including spatial and temporal information, which is crucial for accurate prediction. Intuitively, the more information the model can capture, the more precise the future trajectory can be predicted. However, previous works based on deep learning methods processed spatial and temporal information separately, leading to inadequate spatial information capture, which means they failed to capture the complete spatial information. Therefore, it is of significance to capture information more fully and effectively on vehicle interactions. In this study, we introduced an integrated 3D graph that incorporates both spatial and temporal edges. Based on this, we proposed the integrated 3D graph, which considers the cross-time interaction information. In specific, we design a Spatial-Temporal Fusion (STF) model including Multi-layer perceptions (MLP) and Graph Attention (GAT) to capture the spatial and temporal information historical trajectories simultaneously on the 3D graph. Our experiment on the ApolloScape Trajectory Datasets shows that the proposed STF outperforms several baseline methods, especially on the long-time-horizon trajectory prediction.</p></details> | 6 pages, 6 figures |

However, existing trajectory optimization methods show weakness when dealing with large-scale long trajectories. Recent advances in parallel computing have accelerated optimization in some fields, but how to efficiently solve trajectory optimization via parallelism remains an open question. In this paper, we propose a novel trajectory optimization framework based on the Consensus Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (CADMM) algorithm, which decomposes the trajectory into multiple segments and solves the subproblems in parallel. The proposed framework reduces the time complexity to O(1) per iteration to the number of segments, compared to O(N) of the state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches. Furthermore, we introduce a closed-form solution that integrates convex linear and quadratic constraints to speed up the optimization, and we also present numerical solutions for general inequality constraints. A series of simulations and experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms the SOTA approach in terms of efficiency and smoothness. Especially for a large-scale trajectory, with one hundred segments, achieving over a tenfold speedup. To fully explore the potential of our algorithm on modern parallel computing architectures, we deploy our framework on a GPU and show high performance with thousands of segments.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, submitted to RA-L</p></details> |
| **[Reinforced Imitative Trajectory Planning for Urban Automated Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15607v2)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) faces challenges in trajectory planning for urban automated driving due to the poor convergence of RL and the difficulty in designing reward functions. Consequently, few RL-based trajectory planning methods can achieve performance comparable to that of imitation learning-based methods. The convergence problem is alleviated by combining RL with supervised learning. However, most existing approaches only reason one step ahead and lack the capability to plan for multiple future steps. Besides, although inverse reinforcement learning holds promise for solving the reward function design issue, existing methods for automated driving impose a linear structure assumption on reward functions, making them difficult to apply to urban automated driving. In light of these challenges, this paper proposes a novel RL-based trajectory planning method that integrates RL with imitation learning to enable multi-step planning. Furthermore, a transformer-based Bayesian reward function is developed, providing effective reward signals for RL in urban scenarios. Moreover, a hybrid-driven trajectory planning framework is proposed to enhance safety and interpretability. The proposed methods were validated on the large-scale real-world urban automated driving nuPlan dataset. Evaluated using closed-loop metrics, the results demonstrated that the proposed method significantly outperformed the baseline employing the identical policy model structure and achieved competitive performance compared to the state-of-the-art method.

| **[InSyn: Modeling Complex Interactions for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13397v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate pedestrian trajectory prediction is crucial for intelligent applications, yet it remains highly challenging due to the complexity of interactions among pedestrians. Previous methods have primarily relied on relative positions to model pedestrian interactions; however, they tend to overlook specific interaction patterns such as paired walking or conflicting behaviors, limiting the prediction accuracy in crowded scenarios. To address this issue, we propose InSyn (Interaction-Synchronization Network), a novel Transformer-based model that explicitly captures diverse interaction patterns (e.g., walking in sync or conflicting) while effectively modeling direction-sensitive social behaviors. Additionally, we introduce a training strategy termed Seq-Start of Seq (SSOS), designed to alleviate the common issue of initial-step divergence in numerical time-series prediction. Experiments on the ETH and UCY datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms recent baselines significantly, especially in high-density scenarios. Furthermore, the SSOS strategy proves effective in improving sequential prediction performance, reducing the initial-step prediction error by approximately 6.58%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fast and Scalable Game-Theoretic Trajectory Planning with Intentional Uncertainties](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12174v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory planning involving multi-agent interactions has been a long-standing challenge in the field of robotics, primarily burdened by the inherent yet intricate interactions among agents. While game-theoretic methods are widely acknowledged for their effectiveness in managing multi-agent interactions, significant impediments persist when it comes to accommodating the intentional uncertainties of agents. In the context of intentional uncertainties, the heavy computational burdens associated with existing game-theoretic methods are induced, leading to inefficiencies and poor scalability. In this paper, we propose a novel game-theoretic interactive trajectory planning method to effectively address the intentional uncertainties of agents, and it demonstrates both high efficiency and enhanced scalability. As the underpinning basis, we model the interactions between agents under intentional uncertainties as a general Bayesian game, and we show that its agent-form equivalence can be represented as a potential game under certain minor assumptions. The existence and attainability of the optimal interactive trajectories are illustrated, as the corresponding Bayesian Nash equilibrium can be attained by optimizing a unified optimization problem. Additionally, we present a distributed algorithm based on the dual consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) tailored to the parallel solving of the problem, thereby significantly improving the scalability. The attendant outcomes from simulations and experiments demonstrate that the proposed method is effective across a range of scenarios characterized by general forms of intentional uncertainties. Its scalability surpasses that of existing centralized and decentralized baselines, allowing for real-time interactive trajectory planning in uncertain game settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Foresight in Motion: Reinforcing Trajectory Prediction with Reward Heuristics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12083v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motion forecasting for on-road traffic agents presents both a significant challenge and a critical necessity for ensuring safety in autonomous driving systems. In contrast to most existing data-driven approaches that directly predict future trajectories, we rethink this task from a planning perspective, advocating a "First Reasoning, Then Forecasting" strategy that explicitly incorporates behavior intentions as spatial guidance for trajectory prediction. To achieve this, we introduce an interpretable, reward-driven intention reasoner grounded in a novel query-centric Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) scheme. Our method first encodes traffic agents and scene elements into a unified vectorized representation, then aggregates contextual features through a query-centric paradigm. This enables the derivation of a reward distribution, a compact yet informative representation of the target agent's behavior within the given scene context via IRL. Guided by this reward heuristic, we perform policy rollouts to reason about multiple plausible intentions, providing valuable priors for subsequent trajectory generation. Finally, we develop a hierarchical DETR-like decoder integrated with bidirectional selective state space models to produce accurate future trajectories along with their associated probabilities. Extensive experiments on the large-scale Argoverse and nuScenes motion forecasting datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances trajectory prediction confidence, achieving highly competitive performance relative to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[Schrödinger Bridge Consistency Trajectory Models for Speech Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11925v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speech enhancement (SE) utilizing diffusion models is a promising technology that improves speech quality in noisy speech data. Furthermore, the Schr\"odinger bridge (SB) has recently been used in diffusion-based SE to improve speech quality by resolving a mismatch between the endpoint of the forward process and the starting point of the reverse process. However, the SB still exhibits slow inference owing to the necessity of a large number of function evaluations (NFE) for inference to obtain high-quality results. While Consistency Models (CMs) address this issue by employing consistency training that uses distillation from pretrained models in the field of image generation, it does not improve generation quality when the number of steps increases. As a solution to this problem, Consistency Trajectory Models (CTMs) not only accelerate inference speed but also maintain a favorable trade-off between quality and speed. Furthermore, SoundCTM demonstrates the applicability of CTM techniques to the field of sound generation. In this paper, we present Schr\"odinger bridge Consistency Trajectory Models (SBCTM) by applying the CTM's technique to the Schr\"odinger bridge for SE. Additionally, we introduce a novel auxiliary loss, including a perceptual loss, into the original CTM's training framework. As a result, SBCTM achieves an approximately 16x improvement in the real-time factor (RTF) compared to the conventional Schr\"odinger bridge for SE. Furthermore, the favorable trade-off between quality and speed in SBCTM allows for time-efficient inference by limiting multi-step refinement to cases where 1-step inference is insufficient. Our code, pretrained models, and audio samples are available at https://github.com/sony/sbctm/.</p></details> |  |

This research addresses a gap in delay prediction studies within the Dutch railway network by employing an XGBoost Classifier with a focus on topological features. Current research predominantly emphasizes short-term predictions and neglects the broader network-wide patterns essential for mitigating ripple effects. This research implements and improves an existing methodology, originally designed to forecast the evolution of the fast-changing US air network, to predict delays in the Dutch Railways. By integrating Node Centrality Measures and comparing multiple classifiers like RandomForest, DecisionTree, GradientBoosting, AdaBoost, and LogisticRegression, the goal is to predict delayed trajectories. However, the results reveal limited performance, especially in non-simultaneous testing scenarios, suggesting the necessity for more context-specific adaptations. Regardless, this research contributes to the understanding of transportation network evaluation and proposes future directions for developing more robust predictive models for delays.</p></details> |  |
| **[LF: Online Multi-Robot Path Planning Meets Optimal Trajectory Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11464v1)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a multi-robot control paradigm to solve point-to-point navigation tasks for a team of holonomic robots with access to the full environment information. The framework invokes two processes asynchronously at high frequency: (i) a centralized, discrete, and full-horizon planner for computing collision- and deadlock-free paths rapidly, leveraging recent advances in multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF), and (ii) dynamics-aware, robot-wise optimal trajectory controllers that ensure all robots independently follow their assigned paths reliably. This hierarchical shift in planning representation from (i) discrete and coupled to (ii) continuous and decoupled domains enables the framework to maintain long-term scalable motion synthesis. As an instantiation of this idea, we present LF, which combines a fast state-of-the-art MAPF solver (LaCAM), and a robust feedback control stack (Freyja) for executing agile robot maneuvers. LF provides a robust and versatile mechanism for lifelong multi-robot navigation even under asynchronous and partial goal updates, and adapts to dynamic workspaces simply by quick replanning. We present various multirotor and ground robot demonstrations, including the deployment of 15 real multirotors with random, consecutive target updates while a person walks through the operational workspace.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages; under review for IEEE Robotics & Automation - Letters (RA-L)</p></details> |

While many imputation methods have been proposed for spatiotemporal data, they are not well-suited for multi-agent sports scenarios where player movements are highly dynamic and inter-agent interactions continuously evolve. To address these challenges, we propose MIDAS (Multi-agent Imputer with Derivative-Accumulating Self-ensemble), a framework that imputes multi-agent trajectories with high accuracy and physical plausibility. It jointly predicts positions, velocities, and accelerations through a Set Transformer-based neural network and generates alternative estimates by recursively accumulating predicted velocity and acceleration values. These predictions are then combined using a learnable weighted ensemble to produce final imputed trajectories. Experiments on three sports datasets demonstrate that MIDAS significantly outperforms existing baselines in both positional accuracy and physical plausibility. Lastly, we showcase use cases of MIDAS, such as approximating total distance and pass success probability, to highlight its applicability to practical downstream tasks that require complete tracking data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ECML/PKDD 2025</p></details> |
| **[NavComposer: Composing Language Instructions for Navigation Trajectories through Action-Scene-Object Modularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10894v1)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language-guided navigation is a cornerstone of embodied AI, enabling agents to interpret language instructions and navigate complex environments. However, expert-provided instructions are limited in quantity, while synthesized annotations often lack quality, making them insufficient for large-scale research. To address this, we propose NavComposer, a novel framework for automatically generating high-quality navigation instructions. NavComposer explicitly decomposes semantic entities such as actions, scenes, and objects, and recomposes them into natural language instructions. Its modular architecture allows flexible integration of state-of-the-art techniques, while the explicit use of semantic entities enhances both the richness and accuracy of instructions. Moreover, it operates in a data-agnostic manner, supporting adaptation to diverse navigation trajectories without domain-specific training. Complementing NavComposer, we introduce NavInstrCritic, a comprehensive annotation-free evaluation system that assesses navigation instructions on three dimensions: contrastive matching, semantic consistency, and linguistic diversity. NavInstrCritic provides a holistic evaluation of instruction quality, addressing limitations of traditional metrics that rely heavily on expert annotations. By decoupling instruction generation and evaluation from specific navigation agents, our method enables more scalable and generalizable research. Extensive experiments provide direct and practical evidence for the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> |  |

While the lack of exact latent inversion is a core advantage of these methods, it often results in unstable editing trajectories and poor source consistency. To address this limitation, we propose {\em FlowAlign}, a novel inversion-free flow-based framework for consistent image editing with optimal control-based trajectory control. Specifically, FlowAlign introduces source similarity at the terminal point as a regularization term to promote smoother and more consistent trajectories during the editing process. Notably, our terminal point regularization is shown to explicitly balance semantic alignment with the edit prompt and structural consistency with the source image along the trajectory. Furthermore, FlowAlign naturally supports reverse editing by simply reversing the ODE trajectory, highliting the reversible and consistent nature of the transformation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlowAlign outperforms existing methods in both source preservation and editing controllability.</p></details> |  |

While existing methods primarily focus on modeling observed motion patterns and interactions with other vehicles, they often neglect the potential risks posed by the uncertain or aggressive behaviors of surrounding vehicles. In this paper, we propose a novel spatial-temporal risk-attentive trajectory prediction framework that incorporates a risk potential field to assess perceived risks arising from behaviors of nearby vehicles. The framework leverages a spatial-temporal encoder and a risk-attentive feature fusion decoder to embed the risk potential field into the extracted spatial-temporal feature representations for trajectory prediction. A risk-scaled loss function is further designed to improve the prediction accuracy of high-risk scenarios, such as short relative spacing. Experiments on the widely used NGSIM and HighD datasets demonstrate that our method reduces average prediction errors by 4.8% and 31.2% respectively compared to state-of-the-art approaches, especially in high-risk scenarios. The proposed framework provides interpretable, risk-aware predictions, contributing to more robust decision-making for autonomous driving systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, accepted at ITSC 2025</p></details> |
| **[Learning Flexible Forward Trajectories for Masked Molecular Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16790v3)** | 2025-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have achieved notable progress in modeling discrete data, while their potential in molecular generation remains underexplored. In this work, we explore their potential and introduce the surprising result that naively applying standards MDMs severely degrades the performance. We identify the critical cause of this issue as a state-clashing problem-where the forward diffusion of distinct molecules collapse into a common state, resulting in a mixture of reconstruction targets that cannot be learned using typical reverse diffusion process with unimodal predictions. To mitigate this, we propose Masked Element-wise Learnable Diffusion (MELD) that orchestrates per-element corruption trajectories to avoid collision between distinct molecular graphs. This is achieved through a parameterized noise scheduling network that assigns distinct corruption rates to individual graph elements, i.e., atoms and bonds. Extensive experiments on diverse molecular benchmarks reveal that MELD markedly enhances overall generation quality compared to element-agnostic noise scheduling, increasing the chemical validity of vanilla MDMs on ZINC250K from 15% to 93%, Furthermore, it achieves state-of-the-art property alignment in conditional generation tasks.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods for detecting driving trajectories typically rely on map-matching the path using Global Positioning System (GPS) data, which is susceptible to GPS data outage. This paper introduces CAN-Trace, a novel privacy attack mechanism that leverages Controller Area Network (CAN) messages to uncover driving trajectories, posing a significant risk to drivers' long-term privacy. A new trajectory reconstruction algorithm is proposed to transform the CAN messages, specifically vehicle speed and accelerator pedal position, into weighted graphs accommodating various driving statuses. CAN-Trace identifies driving trajectories using graph-matching algorithms applied to the created graphs in comparison to road networks. We also design a new metric to evaluate matched candidates, which allows for potential data gaps and matching inaccuracies. Empirical validation under various real-world conditions, encompassing different vehicles and driving regions, demonstrates the efficacy of CAN-Trace: it achieves an attack success rate of up to 90.59% in the urban region, and 99.41% in the suburban region.</p></details> |  |

While prior work applying diffusion models to planning has demonstrated strong performance, it often suffers from high computational costs due to iterative sampling procedures. CTP supports fast, single-step trajectory generation without significant degradation in policy quality. We evaluate CTP on the D4RL benchmark and show that it consistently outperforms existing diffusion-based planning methods in long-horizon, goal-conditioned tasks. Notably, CTP achieves higher normalized returns while using significantly fewer denoising steps. In particular, CTP achieves comparable performance with over $120\times$ speedup in inference time, demonstrating its practicality and effectiveness for high-performance, low-latency offline planning.</p></details> |  |

These include heavy computational burdens for mapping, sensor occlusion failures for UAVs, and traversal challenges on irregular terrain for UGVs, all compounded by a lack of perception-aware strategies. To address these challenges, we introduce Random Mapping and Random Projection (RMRP). This method constructs a lightweight linear parametric map by first mapping data to a high-dimensional space, followed by a sparse random projection for dimensionality reduction. Our novel Residual Energy Preservation Theorem provides theoretical guarantees for this process, ensuring critical geometric properties are preserved. Based on this map, we propose the RPATR (Robust Perception-Aware Trajectory Planner) framework. For UAVs, our method unifies grid and Euclidean Signed Distance Field (ESDF) maps. The front-end uses an analytical occupancy gradient to refine initial paths for safety and smoothness, while the back-end uses a closed-form ESDF for trajectory optimization. Leveraging the trained RMRP model's generalization, the planner predicts unobserved areas for proactive navigation. For UGVs, the model characterizes terrain and provides closed-form gradients, enabling online planning to circumvent large holes. Validated in diverse scenarios, our framework demonstrates superior mapping performance in time, memory, and accuracy, and enables computationally efficient, safe navigation for high-speed UAVs and UGVs. The code will be released to foster community collaboration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Robotics (TRO) in July 2025</p></details> |
| **[Shortening the Trajectories: Identity-Aware Gaussian Approximation for Efficient 3D Molecular Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09043v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gaussian-based Probabilistic Generative Models (GPGMs) generate data by reversing a stochastic process that progressively corrupts samples with Gaussian noise. While these models have achieved state-of-the-art performance across diverse domains, their practical deployment remains constrained by the high computational cost of long generative trajectories, which often involve hundreds to thousands of steps during training and sampling. In this work, we introduce a theoretically grounded and empirically validated framework that improves generation efficiency without sacrificing training granularity or inference fidelity. Our key insight is that for certain data modalities, the noising process causes data to rapidly lose its identity and converge toward a Gaussian distribution. We analytically identify a characteristic step at which the data has acquired sufficient Gaussianity, and then replace the remaining generation trajectory with a closed-form Gaussian approximation. Unlike existing acceleration techniques that coarsening the trajectories by skipping steps, our method preserves the full resolution of learning dynamics while avoiding redundant stochastic perturbations between `Gaussian-like' distributions. Empirical results across multiple data modalities demonstrate substantial improvements in both sample quality and computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[GoalNet: Goal Areas Oriented Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19002v2)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting the future trajectories of pedestrians on the road is an important task for autonomous driving. The pedestrian trajectory prediction is affected by scene paths, pedestrian's intentions and decision-making, which is a multi-modal problem. Most recent studies use past trajectories to predict a variety of potential future trajectory distributions, which do not account for the scene context and pedestrian targets. Instead of predicting the future trajectory directly, we propose to use scene context and observed trajectory to predict the goal points first, and then reuse the goal points to predict the future trajectories. By leveraging the information from scene context and observed trajectory, the uncertainty can be limited to a few target areas, which represent the "goals" of the pedestrians. In this paper, we propose GoalNet, a new trajectory prediction neural network based on the goal areas of a pedestrian. Our network can predict both pedestrian's trajectories and bounding boxes. The overall model is efficient and modular, and its outputs can be changed according to the usage scenario. Experimental results show that GoalNet significantly improves the previous state-of-the-art performance by 48.7% on the JAAD and 40.8% on the PIE dataset.</p></details> |  |

However, current deep learning models often lack trustworthiness as their predictions can be physically infeasible and illogical to humans. To make predictions more trustworthy, recent research has incorporated prior knowledge, like the social force model for modeling interactions and kinematic models for physical realism. However, these approaches focus on priors that suit either vehicles or pedestrians and do not generalize to traffic with mixed agent classes. We propose incorporating interaction and kinematic priors of all agent classes--vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists with class-specific interaction layers to capture agent behavioral differences. To improve the interpretability of the agent interactions, we introduce DG-SFM, a rule-based interaction importance score that guides the interaction layer. To ensure physically feasible predictions, we proposed suitable kinematic models for all agent classes with a novel pedestrian kinematic model. We benchmark our approach on the Argoverse 2 dataset, using the state-of-the-art transformer HPTR as our baseline. Experiments demonstrate that our method improves interaction interpretability, revealing a correlation between incorrect predictions and divergence from our interaction prior. Even though incorporating the kinematic models causes a slight decrease in accuracy, they eliminate infeasible trajectories found in the dataset and the baseline model. Thus, our approach fosters trust in trajectory prediction as its interaction reasoning is interpretable, and its predictions adhere to physics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in the 36th IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV 2025) for oral presentation.

| **[Boundary-Guided Trajectory Prediction for Road Aware and Physically Feasible Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06740v2)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of surrounding road users' trajectories is essential for safe and efficient autonomous driving. While deep learning models have improved performance, challenges remain in preventing off-road predictions and ensuring kinematic feasibility. Existing methods incorporate road-awareness modules and enforce kinematic constraints but lack plausibility guarantees and often introduce trade-offs in complexity and flexibility. This paper proposes a novel framework that formulates trajectory prediction as a constrained regression guided by permissible driving directions and their boundaries. Using the agent's current state and an HD map, our approach defines the valid boundaries and ensures on-road predictions by training the network to learn superimposed paths between left and right boundary polylines. To guarantee feasibility, the model predicts acceleration profiles that determine the vehicle's travel distance along these paths while adhering to kinematic constraints. We evaluate our approach on the Argoverse-2 dataset against the HPTR baseline. Our approach shows a slight decrease in benchmark metrics compared to HPTR but notably improves final displacement error and eliminates infeasible trajectories. Moreover, the proposed approach has superior generalization to less prevalent maneuvers and unseen out-of-distribution scenarios, reducing the off-road rate under adversarial attacks from 66% to just 1%. These results highlight the effectiveness of our approach in generating feasible and robust predictions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in the 36th IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV 2025)</p></details> |

However, most existing methods are limited by domain specificity (e.g., facial or human videos) or an excessive dependence on high-level text guidance, which often fails to capture motion details and results in unrealistic reconstructions. To address these challenges, we propose a Trajectory-Guided Generative Video Coding framework (dubbed T-GVC). T-GVC employs a semantic-aware sparse motion sampling pipeline to effectively bridge low-level motion tracking with high-level semantic understanding by extracting pixel-wise motion as sparse trajectory points based on their semantic importance, not only significantly reducing the bitrate but also preserving critical temporal semantic information. In addition, by incorporating trajectory-aligned loss constraints into diffusion processes, we introduce a training-free latent space guidance mechanism to ensure physically plausible motion patterns without sacrificing the inherent capabilities of generative models. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms both traditional codecs and state-of-the-art end-to-end video compression methods under ULB conditions. Furthermore, additional experiments confirm that our approach achieves more precise motion control than existing text-guided methods, paving the way for a novel direction of generative video coding guided by geometric motion modeling.</p></details> |  |

To enlarge the training data, model-based offline RL learns a dynamics model which is utilized as a virtual environment to generate simulation data and enhance policy learning. However, existing data augmentation methods for offline RL suffer from (i) trivial improvement from short-horizon simulation; and (ii) the lack of evaluation and correction for generated data, leading to low-qualified augmentation. In this paper, we propose offline trajectory optimization for offline reinforcement learning (OTTO). The key motivation is to conduct long-horizon simulation and then utilize model uncertainty to evaluate and correct the augmented data. Specifically, we propose an ensemble of Transformers, a.k.a. World Transformers, to predict environment state dynamics and the reward function. Three strategies are proposed to use World Transformers to generate long-horizon trajectory simulation by perturbing the actions in the offline data. Then, an uncertainty-based World Evaluator is introduced to firstly evaluate the confidence of the generated trajectories and then perform the correction for low-confidence data. Finally, we jointly use the original data with the corrected augmentation data to train an offline RL algorithm. OTTO serves as a plug-in module and can be integrated with existing model-free offline RL methods. Experiments on various benchmarks show that OTTO can effectively improve the performance of representative offline RL algorithms, including in complex environments with sparse rewards like AntMaze.

Existing approaches struggle as they rely on static augmentations that fail under object deformations, occlusions, and camera movement, leading to inconsistent feature learning over time. We propose a motion-guided self-supervised learning framework that clusters dense point tracks to learn spatiotemporally consistent representations. By leveraging an off-the-shelf point tracker, we extract long-range motion trajectories and optimize feature clustering through a momentum-encoder-based optimal transport mechanism. To ensure temporal coherence, we propagate cluster assignments along tracked points, enforcing feature consistency across views despite viewpoint changes. Integrating motion as an implicit supervisory signal, our method learns representations that generalize across frames, improving robustness in dynamic scenes and challenging occlusion scenarios. By initializing from strong image-pretrained models and leveraging video data for training, we improve state-of-the-art by 1% to 6% on six image and video datasets and four evaluation benchmarks. The implementation is publicly available at our GitHub repository: https://github.com/SMSD75/MoSiC/tree/main</p></details> | Accepted to ICCV2025 |
| **[GoalFlow: Goal-Driven Flow Matching for Multimodal Trajectories Generation in End-to-End Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05689v4)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose GoalFlow, an end-to-end autonomous driving method for generating high-quality multimodal trajectories. In autonomous driving scenarios, there is rarely a single suitable trajectory. Recent methods have increasingly focused on modeling multimodal trajectory distributions. However, they suffer from trajectory selection complexity and reduced trajectory quality due to high trajectory divergence and inconsistencies between guidance and scene information. To address these issues, we introduce GoalFlow, a novel method that effectively constrains the generative process to produce high-quality, multimodal trajectories. To resolve the trajectory divergence problem inherent in diffusion-based methods, GoalFlow constrains the generated trajectories by introducing a goal point. GoalFlow establishes a novel scoring mechanism that selects the most appropriate goal point from the candidate points based on scene information. Furthermore, GoalFlow employs an efficient generative method, Flow Matching, to generate multimodal trajectories, and incorporates a refined scoring mechanism to select the optimal trajectory from the candidates. Our experimental results, validated on the Navsim\cite{Dauner2024_navsim}, demonstrate that GoalFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering robust multimodal trajectories for autonomous driving. GoalFlow achieved PDMS of 90.3, significantly surpassing other methods. Compared with other diffusion-policy-based methods, our approach requires only a single denoising step to obtain excellent performance.

Whereas visual inertial odometry (VIO) accumulates drift over time, scene coordinate regression (SCR) yields drift-free, high accuracy absolute pose estimation. We present a perception-aware framework that couples an evidential learning-based SCR pose estimator with a receding horizon trajectory optimizer. The optimizer steers the onboard camera toward pixels whose uncertainty predicts reliable scene coordinates, while a fixed-lag smoother fuses the low rate SCR stream with high rate IMU data to close the perception control loop in real time. In simulation, our planner reduces translation (rotation) mean error by 54% / 15% (40% / 31%) relative to yaw fixed and forward-looking baselines, respectively. Moreover, hardware in the loop experiment validates the feasibility of our proposed framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[One Trajectory, One Token: Grounded Video Tokenization via Panoptic Sub-object Trajectory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23617v2)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective video tokenization is critical for scaling transformer models for long videos. Current approaches tokenize videos using space-time patches, leading to excessive tokens and computational inefficiencies. The best token reduction strategies degrade performance and barely reduce the number of tokens when the camera moves. We introduce grounded video tokenization, a paradigm that organizes tokens based on panoptic sub-object trajectories rather than fixed patches. Our method aligns with fundamental perceptual principles, ensuring that tokenization reflects scene complexity rather than video duration. We propose TrajViT, a video encoder that extracts object trajectories and converts them into semantically meaningful tokens, significantly reducing redundancy while maintaining temporal coherence. Trained with contrastive learning, TrajViT significantly outperforms space-time ViT (ViT3D) across multiple video understanding benchmarks, e.g., TrajViT outperforms ViT3D by a large margin of 6% top-5 recall in average at video-text retrieval task with 10x token deduction. We also show TrajViT as a stronger model than ViT3D for being the video encoder for modern VideoLLM, obtaining an average of 5.2% performance improvement across 6 VideoQA benchmarks while having 4x faster training time and 18x less inference FLOPs. TrajViT is the first efficient encoder to consistently outperform ViT3D across diverse video analysis tasks, making it a robust and scalable solution.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |
| **[Physics-Grounded Motion Forecasting via Equation Discovery for Trajectory-Guided Image-to-Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06830v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in diffusion-based and autoregressive video generation models have achieved remarkable visual realism. However, these models typically lack accurate physical alignment, failing to replicate real-world dynamics in object motion. This limitation arises primarily from their reliance on learned statistical correlations rather than capturing mechanisms adhering to physical laws. To address this issue, we introduce a novel framework that integrates symbolic regression (SR) and trajectory-guided image-to-video (I2V) models for physics-grounded video forecasting. Our approach extracts motion trajectories from input videos, uses a retrieval-based pre-training mechanism to enhance symbolic regression, and discovers equations of motion to forecast physically accurate future trajectories. These trajectories then guide video generation without requiring fine-tuning of existing models. Evaluated on scenarios in Classical Mechanics, including spring-mass, pendulums, and projectile motions, our method successfully recovers ground-truth analytical equations and improves the physical alignment of generated videos over baseline methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[ILNet: Trajectory Prediction with Inverse Learning Attention for Enhancing Intention Capture](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06531v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction for multi-agent interaction scenarios is a crucial challenge. Most advanced methods model agent interactions by efficiently factorized attention based on the temporal and agent axes. However, this static and foward modeling lacks explicit interactive spatio-temporal coordination, capturing only obvious and immediate behavioral intentions. Alternatively, the modern trajectory prediction framework refines the successive predictions by a fixed-anchor selection strategy, which is difficult to adapt in different future environments. It is acknowledged that human drivers dynamically adjust initial driving decisions based on further assumptions about the intentions of surrounding vehicles. Motivated by human driving behaviors, this paper proposes ILNet, a multi-agent trajectory prediction method with Inverse Learning (IL) attention and Dynamic Anchor Selection (DAS) module. IL Attention employs an inverse learning paradigm to model interactions at neighboring moments, introducing proposed intentions to dynamically encode the spatio-temporal coordination of interactions, thereby enhancing the model's ability to capture complex interaction patterns. Then, the learnable DAS module is proposed to extract multiple trajectory change keypoints as anchors in parallel with almost no increase in parameters. Experimental results show that the ILNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the INTERACTION and Argoverse motion forecasting datasets. Particularly, in challenged interaction scenarios, ILNet achieves higher accuracy and more multimodal distributions of trajectories over fewer parameters.

However, quality growing data of plants at scale is difficult to generate. Here we use a mobile robotic platform to capture high-resolution environmental sensing and phenotyping measurements of a large-scale hydroponic leafy greens system. We describe a self-supervised modeling approach to build a map from observed growing data to the entire plant growth trajectory. We demonstrate our approach by forecasting future plant height and harvest mass of crops in this system. This approach represents a significant advance in combining robotic automation and machine learning, as well as providing actionable insights for agronomic research and operational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Driving View Synthesis on Free-form Trajectories with Generative Prior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01717v3)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Driving view synthesis along free-form trajectories is essential for realistic driving simulations, enabling closed-loop evaluation of end-to-end driving policies. Existing methods excel at view interpolation along recorded paths but struggle to generalize to novel trajectories due to limited viewpoints in driving videos. To tackle this challenge, we propose DriveX, a novel free-form driving view synthesis framework, that progressively distills generative prior into the 3D Gaussian model during its optimization. Within this framework, we utilize a video diffusion model to refine the degraded novel trajectory renderings from the in-training Gaussian model, while the restored videos in turn serve as additional supervision for optimizing the 3D Gaussian. Concretely, we craft an inpainting-based video restoration task, which can disentangle the identification of degraded regions from the generative capability of the diffusion model and remove the need of simulating specific degraded pattern in the training of the diffusion model. To further enhance the consistency and fidelity of generated contents, the pseudo ground truth is progressively updated with gradually improved novel trajectory rendering, allowing both components to co-adapt and reinforce each other while minimizing the disruption on the optimization. By tightly integrating 3D scene representation with generative prior, DriveX achieves high-quality view synthesis beyond recorded trajectories in real time--unlocking new possibilities for flexible and realistic driving simulations on free-form trajectories.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |
| **[GC-GAT: Multimodal Vehicular Trajectory Prediction using Graph Goal Conditioning and Cross-context Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11150v2)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting future trajectories of surrounding vehicles heavily relies on what contextual information is given to a motion prediction model. The context itself can be static (lanes, regulatory elements, etc) or dynamic (traffic participants). This paper presents a lane graph-based motion prediction model that first predicts graph-based goal proposals and later fuses them with cross attention over multiple contextual elements. We follow the famous encoder-interactor-decoder architecture where the encoder encodes scene context using lightweight Gated Recurrent Units, the interactor applies cross-context attention over encoded scene features and graph goal proposals, and the decoder regresses multimodal trajectories via Laplacian Mixture Density Network from the aggregated encodings. Using cross-attention over graph-based goal proposals gives robust trajectory estimates since the model learns to attend to future goal-relevant scene elements for the intended agent. We evaluate our work on nuScenes motion prediction dataset, achieving state-of-the-art results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging the Spatial Hierarchy: Coarse-to-fine Trajectory Generation via Cascaded Hybrid Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13366v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban mobility data has significant connections with economic growth and plays an essential role in various smart-city applications. However, due to privacy concerns and substantial data collection costs, fine-grained human mobility trajectories are difficult to become publicly available on a large scale. A promising solution to address this issue is trajectory synthesizing. However, existing works often ignore the inherent structural complexity of trajectories, unable to handle complicated high-dimensional distributions and generate realistic fine-grained trajectories. In this paper, we propose Cardiff, a coarse-to-fine Cascaded hybrid diffusion-based trajectory synthesizing framework for fine-grained and privacy-preserving mobility generation. By leveraging the hierarchical nature of urban mobility, Cardiff decomposes the generation process into two distinct levels, i.e., discrete road segment-level and continuous fine-grained GPS-level: (i) In the segment-level, to reduce computational costs and redundancy in raw trajectories, we first encode the discrete road segments into low-dimensional latent embeddings and design a diffusion transformer-based latent denoising network for segment-level trajectory synthesis. (ii) Taking the first stage of generation as conditions, we then design a fine-grained GPS-level conditional denoising network with a noise augmentation mechanism to achieve robust and high-fidelity generation. Additionally, the Cardiff framework not only progressively generates high-fidelity trajectories through cascaded denoising but also flexibly enables a tunable balance between privacy preservation and utility. Experimental results on three large real-world trajectory datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in various metrics.</p></details> |  |

However, due to the imbalance between self-consistency and cross-consistency, these CD-based methods inherently suffer from improper conditional guidance, leading to sub-optimal generation results. To address this issue, we present SegmentDreamer, a novel framework designed to fully unleash the potential of consistency models for high-fidelity text-to-3D generation. Specifically, we reformulate SDS through the proposed Segmented Consistency Trajectory Distillation (SCTD), effectively mitigating the imbalance issues by explicitly defining the relationship between self- and cross-consistency. Moreover, SCTD partitions the Probability Flow Ordinary Differential Equation (PF-ODE) trajectory into multiple sub-trajectories and ensures consistency within each segment, which can theoretically provide a significantly tighter upper bound on distillation error. Additionally, we propose a distillation pipeline for a more swift and stable generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our SegmentDreamer outperforms state-of-the-art methods in visual quality, enabling high-fidelity 3D asset creation through 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025, project page: https://zjhjojo.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[From Marginal to Joint Predictions: Evaluating Scene-Consistent Trajectory Prediction Approaches for Automated Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05254v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate motion prediction of surrounding traffic participants is crucial for the safe and efficient operation of automated vehicles in dynamic environments. Marginal prediction models commonly forecast each agent's future trajectories independently, often leading to sub-optimal planning decisions for an automated vehicle. In contrast, joint prediction models explicitly account for the interactions between agents, yielding socially and physically consistent predictions on a scene level. However, existing approaches differ not only in their problem formulation but also in the model architectures and implementation details used, making it difficult to compare them. In this work, we systematically investigate different approaches to joint motion prediction, including post-processing of the marginal predictions, explicitly training the model for joint predictions, and framing the problem as a generative task. We evaluate each approach in terms of prediction accuracy, multi-modality, and inference efficiency, offering a comprehensive analysis of the strengths and limitations of each approach.

Testing on a longitudinal dataset of N=45 individuals affected by General Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and/or Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) derived from Fisher et al. 2017, we propose a novel pipeline for the analysis of the temporal dynamics of psychopathological symptoms. First, we employ the PCMCI+ algorithm with nonparametric independence test to determine the causal network of nonlinear dependencies between symptoms in individuals with different mental disorders. We found that the PCMCI+ effectively highlights the individual peculiarities of each symptom network, which could be leveraged towards personalized therapies. At the same time, aggregating the networks by diagnosis sheds light to disorder-specific causal mechanisms, in agreement with previous psychopathological literature. Then, we enrich the dataset by computing complexity-based measures (e.g. entropy, fractal dimension, recurrence) from the symptom time series, and feed it to a suitably selected machine learning algorithm to aid the diagnosis of each individual. The new dataset yields 91% accuracy in the classification of the symptom dynamics, proving to be an effective diagnostic support tool. Overall, these findings highlight how integrating causal modeling and temporal complexity can enhance diagnostic differentiation, offering a principled, data-driven foundation for both personalized assessment in clinical psychology and structural advances in psychological research.</p></details> |  |

This work systematically examines how feature selection, cross-dataset transfer, and geographic diversity influence trajectory prediction accuracy in multi-agent settings. We evaluate a state-of-the-art model using our novel L4 Motion Forecasting dataset based on our own data recordings in Germany and the US. This includes enhanced map and agent features. We compare our dataset to the US-centric Argoverse 2 benchmark. First, we find that incorporating supplementary map and agent features unique to our dataset, yields no measurable improvement over baseline features, demonstrating that modern architectures do not need extensive feature sets for optimal performance. The limited features of public datasets are sufficient to capture convoluted interactions without added complexity. Second, we perform cross-dataset experiments to evaluate how effective domain knowledge can be transferred between datasets. Third, we group our dataset by country and check the knowledge transfer between different driving cultures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Discrete Diffusion Trajectory Alignment via Stepwise Decomposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04832v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discrete diffusion models have demonstrated great promise in modeling various sequence data, ranging from human language to biological sequences. Inspired by the success of RL in language models, there is growing interest in further improving the models by alignment with a certain reward. In this work, we propose a novel preference optimization method for masked discrete diffusion models through a principled diffusion trajectory alignment. Instead of applying the reward on the final output and backpropagating the gradient to the entire discrete denoising process, we decompose the problem into a set of stepwise alignment objectives. This framework enables efficient diffusion optimization, is compatible with arbitrary reward functions, and importantly, guarantees an equivalent optimal solution under additive factorization of the trajectory reward. Experiments across multiple domains including DNA sequence design, protein inverse folding, and language modeling consistently demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Notably, it achieves an up to 12\% improvement over the most competitive RL-based baseline in terms of predicted activity on DNA sequence design, and further improves the GSM8K score from 78.6 to 80.7 on LLaDA-8B-Instruct for language modeling.</p></details> | 22 pages, 3 figures |

The neural representation of a set is used as the terminal set constraint for a model predictive control (MPC) local planner, resulting in improved recursive feasibility and safety. To achieve real-time performance and desired generalization properties, we employ the idea of hypernetworks. We use the Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis as the source of supervision during the training process, allowing us to consider general nonlinear dynamics and arbitrary constraints. The proposed method is extensively evaluated against relevant baselines in simulations for different environments and robot dynamics. The results show an increase in success rate of up to 52% compared to the best baseline while maintaining comparable execution speed. Additionally, we deploy our proposed method, NTC-MPC, on a physical robot and demonstrate its ability to safely avoid obstacles in scenarios where the baselines fail.</p></details> |  |

The key challenge lies in the significant uncertainty in drag and weight parameters introduced by the collected litter. We propose a dynamical model for the coupled UUV-USV system in the primary plane of motion and a risk-aware optimization approach incorporating parameter uncertainty and noise to ensure safe interactions with the environment. A stochastic optimization problem is solved using a conditional value-at-risk framework. Simulations demonstrate that our approach reduces collision risks and energy consumption, highlighting its reliability compared to existing control methods.</p></details> |  |

As each state of an agent is closely related to the states of adjacent time steps, capturing the local temporal dependency is beneficial for prediction, while most studies often overlook it. Besides, learning the high-order motion state attributes is expected to enhance spatial interaction modeling, but it is rarely seen in previous works. To address this, we propose a lightweight framework, LTMSformer, to extract temporal-spatial interaction features for multi-modal trajectory prediction. Specifically, we introduce a Local Trend-Aware Attention mechanism to capture the local temporal dependency by leveraging a convolutional attention mechanism with hierarchical local time boxes. Next, to model the spatial interaction dependency, we build a Motion State Encoder to incorporate high-order motion state attributes, such as acceleration, jerk, heading, etc. To further refine the trajectory prediction, we propose a Lightweight Proposal Refinement Module that leverages Multi-Layer Perceptrons for trajectory embedding and generates the refined trajectories with fewer model parameters. Experiment results on the Argoverse 1 dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms the baseline HiVT-64, reducing the minADE by approximately 4.35%, the minFDE by 8.74%, and the MR by 20%. We also achieve higher accuracy than HiVT-128 with a 68% reduction in model size.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial-Temporal Conditional Random Field for Human Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18198v2)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is of significant importance in computer vision. Accurate pedestrian trajectory prediction benefits autonomous vehicles and robots in planning their motion. Pedestrians' trajectories are greatly influenced by their intentions. Prior studies having introduced various deep learning methods only pay attention to the spatial and temporal information of trajectory, overlooking the explicit intention information. In this study, we introduce a novel model, termed the \textbf{S-T CRF}: \textbf{S}patial-\textbf{T}emporal \textbf{C}onditional \textbf{R}andom \textbf{F}ield, which judiciously incorporates intention information besides spatial and temporal information of trajectory. This model uses a Conditional Random Field (CRF) to generate a representation of future intentions, greatly improving the prediction of subsequent trajectories when combined with spatial-temporal representation. Furthermore, the study innovatively devises a space CRF loss and a time CRF loss, meticulously designed to enhance interaction constraints and temporal dynamics, respectively. Extensive experimental evaluations on dataset ETH/UCY and SDD demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses existing baseline approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predicting Drivers' Route Trajectories in Last-Mile Delivery Using A Pair-wise Attention-based Pointer Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03802v2)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In last-mile delivery, drivers frequently deviate from planned delivery routes because of their tacit knowledge of the road and curbside infrastructure, customer availability, and other characteristics of the respective service areas. Hence, the actual stop sequences chosen by an experienced human driver may be potentially preferable to the theoretical shortest-distance routing under real-life operational conditions. Thus, being able to predict the actual stop sequence that a human driver would follow can help to improve route planning in last-mile delivery. This paper proposes a pair-wise attention-based pointer neural network for this prediction task using drivers' historical delivery trajectory data. In addition to the commonly used encoder-decoder architecture for sequence-to-sequence prediction, we propose a new attention mechanism based on an alternative specific neural network to capture the local pair-wise information for each pair of stops. To further capture the global efficiency of the route, we propose a new iterative sequence generation algorithm that is used after model training to identify the first stop of a route that yields the lowest operational cost. Results from an extensive case study on real operational data from Amazon's last-mile delivery operations in the US show that our proposed method can significantly outperform traditional optimization-based approaches and other machine learning methods (such as the Long Short-Term Memory encoder-decoder and the original pointer network) in finding stop sequences that are closer to high-quality routes executed by experienced drivers in the field. Compared to benchmark models, the proposed model can increase the average prediction accuracy of the first four stops from around 0.229 to 0.312, and reduce the disparity between the predicted route and the actual route by around 15%.</p></details> |  |

Our key insight is that high-quality trajectories can be discovered merely by denoising noisy trajectories sampled from a distribution. This approach has no learning component, relying instead on only two ingredients: a dynamical model of the robots to obtain feasible trajectories via rollout, and a fitness function to guide denoising with Monte Carlo gradient approximation. The proposed framework iteratively optimizes a deformation for the previous trajectory with the current denoising process, allows anytime refinement as time permits, supports different dynamics, and benefits from GPU acceleration. Our evaluations for differential-drive and holonomic teams with up to 16 robots in 2D and 3D worlds show its ability to discover high-quality solutions faster than other black-box optimization methods such as MPPI. In a 2D holonomic case with 16 robots, it is almost twice as fast. As evidence for feasibility, we demonstrate zero-shot deployment of the planned trajectories on eight multirotors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 2025 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)</p></details> |

However, its effectiveness has been primarily limited in short-horizon tasks, and its performance significantly degrades in the presence of image noise. To address these limitations, we propose a VLM-guided trajectory-conditioned diffusion policy (VLM-TDP) for robust and long-horizon manipulation. Specifically, the proposed method leverages state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) to decompose long-horizon tasks into concise, manageable sub-tasks, while also innovatively generating voxel-based trajectories for each sub-task. The generated trajectories serve as a crucial conditioning factor, effectively steering the diffusion policy and substantially enhancing its performance. The proposed Trajectory-conditioned Diffusion Policy (TDP) is trained on trajectories derived from demonstration data and validated using the trajectories generated by the VLM. Simulation experimental results indicate that our method significantly outperforms classical diffusion policies, achieving an average 44% increase in success rate, over 100% improvement in long-horizon tasks, and a 20% reduction in performance degradation in challenging conditions, such as noisy images or altered environments. These findings are further reinforced by our real-world experiments, where the performance gap becomes even more pronounced in long-horizon tasks.

| **[Rapid and Safe Trajectory Planning over Diverse Scenes through Diffusion Composition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04384v1)** | 2025-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safe trajectory planning remains a significant challenge in complex environments, where traditional methods often trade off computational efficiency for safety. Comprehensive obstacle modeling improves safety but is computationally expensive, while approximate methods are more efficient but may compromise safety. To address this issue, this paper introduces a rapid and safe trajectory planning framework based on state-based diffusion models. Leveraging only low-dimensional vehicle states, the diffusion models achieve notable inference efficiency while ensuring sufficient collision-free characteristics. By composing diffusion models, the proposed framework can safely generalize across diverse scenarios, planning collision-free trajectories even in unseen scenes. To further ensure the safety of the generated trajectories, an efficient, rule-based safety filter is proposed, which selects optimal trajectories that satisfy both sufficient safety and control feasibility from among candidate trajectories. Both in seen and unseen scenarios, the proposed method achieves efficient inference time while maintaining high safety and stability. Evaluations on the F1TENTH vehicle further demonstrate that the proposed method is practical in real-world applications.

| **[WebSynthesis: World-Model-Guided MCTS for Efficient WebUI-Trajectory Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04370v1)** | 2025-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved the capabilities of web agents. However, effectively navigating complex and dynamic web environments still requires more advanced trajectory-level planning and execution. Prior studies have addressed self-improving agents by collecting extensive GUI trajectories from real-environment interactions. Despite their effectiveness, these approaches encounter two critical challenges: (1) Uncontrollable environment states, where real or sandboxed web environments often yield unstable and non-deterministic feedback, complicating the reproduction and debugging of agent behaviors; and (2) High API costs, as generating even a single interaction trajectory can involve hundreds of queries, leading to considerable API usage and computational expenses. To address these limitations and enable scalable self-improvement for agents, we propose WebSynthesis, a novel framework for trajectory synthesis and training. WebSynthesis leverages a learned world model to simulate virtual web environments, allowing a policy agent to perform efficient and reversible tree-based planning. This approach supports the large-scale generation of diverse and high-quality trajectories, which are subsequently utilized to refine the agent's policy. Experimental results demonstrate that an agent trained using WebSynthesis on a small-scale synthetic dataset achieves performance comparable to or even surpassing that of models trained on large-scale real-world data.</p></details> |  |
| **[K Nearest Neighbor-Guided Trajectory Similarity Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00285v2)** | 2025-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory similarity is fundamental to many spatio-temporal data mining applications. Recent studies propose deep learning models to approximate conventional trajectory similarity measures, exploiting their fast inference time once trained. Although efficient inference has been reported, challenges remain in similarity approximation accuracy due to difficulties in trajectory granularity modeling and in exploiting similarity signals in the training data. To fill this gap, we propose TSMini, a highly effective trajectory similarity model with a sub-view modeling mechanism capable of learning multi-granularity trajectory patterns and a k nearest neighbor-based loss that guides TSMini to learn not only absolute similarity values between trajectories but also their relative similarity ranks. Together, these two innovations enable highly accurate trajectory similarity approximation. Experiments show that TSMini can outperform the state-of-the-art models by 22% in accuracy on average when learning trajectory similarity measures.</p></details> |  |

Trajectory refinement has emerged as a key strategy to enhance prediction accuracy. However, existing refinement methods often overlook the topological relationships between trajectories, which are vital for improving prediction precision. Inspired by braid theory, we propose a novel trajectory refinement approach, Soft-Braid Refiner (SRefiner), guided by the soft-braid topological structure of trajectories using Soft-Braid Attention. Soft-Braid Attention captures spatio-temporal topological relationships between trajectories by considering both spatial proximity and vehicle motion states at ``soft intersection points". Additionally, we extend this approach to model interactions between trajectories and lanes, further improving the prediction accuracy. SRefiner is a multi-iteration, multi-agent framework that iteratively refines trajectories, incorporating topological information to enhance interactions within traffic scenarios. SRefiner achieves significant performance improvements over four baseline methods across two datasets, establishing a new state-of-the-art in trajectory refinement.

| **[AMD: Adaptive Momentum and Decoupled Contrastive Learning Framework for Robust Long-Tail Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01801v2)** | 2025-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately predicting the future trajectories of traffic agents is essential in autonomous driving. However, due to the inherent imbalance in trajectory distributions, tail data in natural datasets often represents more complex and hazardous scenarios. Existing studies typically rely solely on a base model's prediction error, without considering the diversity and uncertainty of long-tail trajectory patterns. We propose an adaptive momentum and decoupled contrastive learning framework (AMD), which integrates unsupervised and supervised contrastive learning strategies. By leveraging an improved momentum contrast learning (MoCo-DT) and decoupled contrastive learning (DCL) module, our framework enhances the model's ability to recognize rare and complex trajectories. Additionally, we design four types of trajectory random augmentation methods and introduce an online iterative clustering strategy, allowing the model to dynamically update pseudo-labels and better adapt to the distributional shifts in long-tail data. We propose three different criteria to define long-tail trajectories and conduct extensive comparative experiments on the nuScenes and ETH$/$UCY datasets. The results show that AMD not only achieves optimal performance in long-tail trajectory prediction but also demonstrates outstanding overall prediction accuracy.</p></details> |  |

While many promising methods have been developed using online corpora and captioned photographs, their application to scientific domains, where data encodes highly specialized knowledge, remains a challenge. Liquid Argon Time Projection Chambers (LArTPCs) provide high-resolution 3D imaging for fundamental physics, but analysis of their sparse, complex point cloud data often relies on supervised methods trained on large simulations, introducing potential biases. We introduce the Point-based Liquid Argon Masked Autoencoder (PoLAr-MAE), applying masked point modeling to unlabeled LArTPC images using domain-specific volumetric tokenization and energy prediction. We show this SSL approach learns physically meaningful trajectory representations directly from data. This yields remarkable data efficiency: fine-tuning on just 100 labeled events achieves track/shower semantic segmentation performance comparable to the state-of-the-art supervised baseline trained on $>$100,000 events. Furthermore, internal attention maps exhibit emergent instance segmentation of particle trajectories. While challenges remain, particularly for fine-grained features, we make concrete SSL's potential for building a foundation model for LArTPC image analysis capable of serving as a common base for all data reconstruction tasks. To facilitate further progress, we release PILArNet-M, a large dataset of 1M LArTPC events.

In this work, we propose DIVER, an end-to-end driving framework that integrates reinforcement learning with diffusion-based generation to produce diverse and feasible trajectories. At the core of DIVER lies a reinforced diffusion-based generation mechanism. First, the model conditions on map elements and surrounding agents to generate multiple reference trajectories from a single ground-truth trajectory, alleviating the limitations of imitation learning that arise from relying solely on single expert demonstrations. Second, reinforcement learning is employed to guide the diffusion process, where reward-based supervision enforces safety and diversity constraints on the generated trajectories, thereby enhancing their practicality and generalization capability. Furthermore, to address the limitations of L2-based open-loop metrics in capturing trajectory diversity, we propose a novel Diversity metric to evaluate the diversity of multi-mode predictions.Extensive experiments on the closed-loop NAVSIM and Bench2Drive benchmarks, as well as the open-loop nuScenes dataset, demonstrate that DIVER significantly improves trajectory diversity, effectively addressing the mode collapse problem inherent in imitation learning.</p></details> | 16 pages, 6 figures |

Coordination between heterogeneous units is paramount for precision tasks -- whether in manipulation, legged locomotion, or multi-robot interaction. Such modular systems introduce challenges far exceeding those in monolithic robot architectures. This study presents a robust method for synchronizing the trajectories of multiple heterogeneous actuators, adapting dynamically to system variations with minimal system knowledge. This design makes it inherently robot-agnostic, thus highly suited for modularity. To ensure smooth trajectory adherence, the multidimensional state is constrained within a hypersphere representing the allowable deviation. The distance metric can be adapted hence, depending on the task and system under control, deformation of the constraint region is possible. This approach is compatible with a wide range of robotic platforms and serves as a core interface for Motion-Stack, our new open-source universal framework for limb coordination (available at https://github.com/2lian/Motion-Stack ). The method is validated by synchronizing the end-effectors of six highly heterogeneous robotic limbs, evaluating both trajectory adherence and recovery from significant external disturbances.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 15 figures.

Their high agility and unpredictable motion make drones difficult to track and intercept. While existing methods focus on detecting current positions, many counter-drone strategies rely on forecasting future trajectories and thus require more than reactive detection to be effective. To address this critical gap, we propose an unsupervised vision-based method for predicting the three-dimensional trajectories of drones. Our approach first uses an unsupervised technique to extract drone trajectories from raw LiDAR point clouds, then aligns these trajectories with camera images through motion consistency to generate reliable pseudo-labels. We then combine kinematic estimation with a visual Mamba neural network in a self-supervised manner to predict future drone trajectories. We evaluate our method on the challenging MMAUD dataset, including the V2 sequences that feature wide-field-of-view multimodal sensors and dynamic UAV motion in urban scenes. Extensive experiments show that our framework outperforms supervised image-only and audio-visual baselines in long-horizon trajectory prediction, reducing 5-second 3D error by around 40 percent without using any manual 3D labels. The proposed system offers a cost-effective, scalable alternative for real-time counter-drone deployment. All code will be released upon acceptance to support reproducible research in the robotics community.</p></details> |  |

However, existing trajectory-based methods primarily focus on individual object motion and struggle to capture multi-object interaction crucial in complex robotic manipulation. This limitation arises from multi-feature entanglement in overlapping regions, which leads to degraded visual fidelity. To address this, we present RoboMaster, a novel framework that models inter-object dynamics through a collaborative trajectory formulation. Unlike prior methods that decompose objects, our core is to decompose the interaction process into three sub-stages: pre-interaction, interaction, and post-interaction. Each stage is modeled using the feature of the dominant object, specifically the robotic arm in the pre- and post-interaction phases and the manipulated object during interaction, thereby mitigating the drawback of multi-object feature fusion present during interaction in prior work. To further ensure subject semantic consistency throughout the video, we incorporate appearance- and shape-aware latent representations for objects. Extensive experiments on the challenging Bridge V2 dataset, as well as in-the-wild evaluation, demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches, establishing new state-of-the-art performance in trajectory-controlled video generation for robotic manipulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://fuxiao0719.github.io/projects/robomaster/ Code: https://github.com/KwaiVGI/RoboMaster</p></details> |

Previous methods on controllable video generation primarily leverage 2D control signals to manipulate object motions and have achieved remarkable synthesis results. However, 2D control signals are inherently limited in expressing the 3D nature of object motions. To overcome this problem, we introduce 3DTrajMaster, a robust controller that regulates multi-entity dynamics in 3D space, given user-desired 6DoF pose (location and rotation) sequences of entities. At the core of our approach is a plug-and-play 3D-motion grounded object injector that fuses multiple input entities with their respective 3D trajectories through a gated self-attention mechanism. In addition, we exploit an injector architecture to preserve the video diffusion prior, which is crucial for generalization ability. To mitigate video quality degradation, we introduce a domain adaptor during training and employ an annealed sampling strategy during inference. To address the lack of suitable training data, we construct a 360-Motion Dataset, which first correlates collected 3D human and animal assets with GPT-generated trajectory and then captures their motion with 12 evenly-surround cameras on diverse 3D UE platforms. Extensive experiments show that 3DTrajMaster sets a new state-of-the-art in both accuracy and generalization for controlling multi-entity 3D motions.

We consider both co-located and separated transmitter/receiver pairs, i.e., mono-static and bi-static configurations, respectively, as well as multi-static settings involving both types. We propose coherent track before detect: A detection approach which is capable of coherently integrating these reflections within a coherent processing interval (CPI) in all these configurations and continuing integration for an arbitrarily long time across consecutive CPIs. {We estimate the complex value of the reflection coefficients for integration while simultaneously estimating the object trajectory. Compounded with these computations is the estimation of the unknown time reference shift of the separated transmitters necessary for coherent processing.} Detection is made by using the resulting integration value in a Neyman-Pearson test against a constant false alarm rate threshold.

However, current IRL works cannot learn incrementally from an ongoing trajectory because they have to wait to collect at least one complete trajectory to learn. To bridge the gap, this paper considers the problem of learning a reward function and a corresponding policy while observing the initial state-action pair of an ongoing trajectory and keeping updating the learned reward and policy when new state-action pairs of the ongoing trajectory are observed. We formulate this problem as an online bi-level optimization problem where the upper level dynamically adjusts the learned reward according to the newly observed state-action pairs with the help of a meta-regularization term, and the lower level learns the corresponding policy. We propose a novel algorithm to solve this problem and guarantee that the algorithm achieves sub-linear local regret $O(\sqrt{T}+\log T+\sqrt{T}\log T)$. If the reward function is linear, we prove that the proposed algorithm achieves sub-linear regret $O(\log T)$. Experiments are used to validate the proposed algorithm.</p></details> |  |

By explicitly conditioning on surrounding vehicles and road geometry, Ctx2TrajGen generates interaction-aware trajectories aligned with real-world context.

| **[R-Stitch: Dynamic Trajectory Stitching for Efficient Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17307v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning enhances the problem-solving capabilities of large language models by encouraging step-by-step intermediate reasoning during inference. While effective, CoT introduces substantial computational overhead due to its reliance on autoregressive decoding over long token sequences. Existing acceleration strategies either reduce sequence length through early stopping or compressive reward designs, or improve decoding speed via speculative decoding with smaller models. However, speculative decoding suffers from limited speedup when the agreement between small and large models is low, and fails to exploit the potential advantages of small models in producing concise intermediate reasoning. In this paper, we present R-Stitch, a token-level, confidence-based hybrid decoding framework that accelerates CoT inference by switching between a small language model (SLM) and a large language model (LLM) along the reasoning trajectory. R-Stitch uses the SLM to generate tokens by default and delegates to the LLM only when the SLM's confidence falls below a threshold. This design avoids full-sequence rollback and selectively invokes the LLM on uncertain steps, preserving both efficiency and answer quality. R-Stitch is model-agnostic, training-free, and compatible with standard decoding pipelines. Experiments on math reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that R-Stitch achieves up to 85\% reduction in inference latency with negligible accuracy drop, highlighting its practical effectiveness in accelerating CoT reasoning.</p></details> |  |

In order to ensure that construction robots can perform tasks efficiently and accurately in complex construction environments, traditional single-objective trajectory optimization methods are difficult to meet the complex requirements of the changing construction environment. Therefore, we propose a multi-objective trajectory optimization for the robotic arm used in the curtain wall installation. First, we design a robotic arm for curtain wall installation, integrating serial, parallel, and folding arm elements, while considering its physical properties and motion characteristics. In addition, this paper proposes an NSGA-III-FO algorithm (NSGA-III with Focused Operator, NSGA-III-FO) that incorporates a focus operator screening mechanism to accelerate the convergence of the algorithm towards the Pareto front, thereby effectively balancing the multi-objective constraints of construction robots. The proposed algorithm is tested against NSGA-III, MOEA/D, and MSOPS-II in ten consecutive trials on the DTLZ3 and WFG3 test functions, showing significantly better convergence efficiency than the other algorithms. Finally, we conduct two sets of experiments on the designed robotic arm platform, which confirm the efficiency and practicality of the NSGA-III-FO algorithm in solving multi-objective trajectory planning problems for curtain wall installation tasks.</p></details> |  |

To tackle this challenge, our study innovatively draws inspiration from the mechanics of human upper limb movements during weight lifting, proposing a bio-inspired trajectory planning framework that incorporates human energy conversion principles. By collecting motion trajectories and electromyography (EMG) signals during dumbbell curls, we construct an anthropomorphic trajectory planning that integrates human force exertion patterns and energy consumption patterns. Utilizing the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm, we achieve dynamic load distribution for robotic arm trajectory planning based on human-like movement features. In practical application, these bio-inspired movement characteristics are applied to curtain wall installation tasks, validating the correctness and superiority of our trajectory planning method. Simulation results demonstrate a 48.4% reduction in energy consumption through intelligent conversion between kinetic and potential energy. This approach provides new insights and theoretical support for optimizing energy use in curtain wall installation robots during actual handling tasks.</p></details> |  |

First, we derive the Geometric Feature Metric (GFM) from the fundamental LiDAR localization problem. Next, we design a 2D grid-based Metric Encoding Map (MEM) to efficiently store GFM values across the environment. A constant-time decoding algorithm is further proposed to retrieve GFM values for arbitrary poses from the MEM. Finally, we develop a perception-aware trajectory planning algorithm that improves LiDAR localization capabilities by guiding the robot in selecting trajectories through feature-rich areas. Both simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that our approach enables the robot to actively select trajectories that significantly enhance LiDAR localization accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IROS 2025</p></details> |

The model applies the Adaboost algorithm to divide multiple weak learners, and each submodel utilizes CNN to extract spatial features, LSTM to capture temporal features, and attention mechanism to capture global features comprehensively. The strong learner model, combined with multiple sub-models, then optimizes the hyperparameters of the prediction model through the natural selection behavior pattern simulated by SO. In this study, based on the real ADS-B data from Xi'an to Tianjin, the comparison experiments and ablation studies of multiple optimizers are carried out, and a comprehensive test and evaluation analysis is carried out. The results show that SO-CLA-adaboost outperforms traditional optimizers such as particle swarm, whale, and gray wolf in handling large-scale high-dimensional trajectory data. In addition, introducing the full-strategy collaborative improvement SO algorithm improves the model's prediction accuracy by 39.89%.</p></details> | in Chinese language |

However, current automated methods are limited to establishing cell developmental trajectories within individual samples, necessitating biologists to manually link cells across samples to construct complete cross-sample evolutionary trajectories that consider cellular spatial dynamics. This process demands substantial human effort due to the complex spatial correspondence between each pair of samples. To address this challenge, we first proposed a GNN-based model to predict cross-sample cell developmental trajectories. We then developed TrajLens, a visual analytics system that supports biologists in exploring and refining the cell developmental trajectories based on predicted links. Specifically, we designed the visualization that integrates features on cell distribution and developmental direction across multiple samples, providing an overview of the spatial evolutionary patterns of cell populations along trajectories. Additionally, we included contour maps superimposed on the original cell distribution data, enabling biologists to explore them intuitively. To demonstrate our system's performance, we conducted quantitative evaluations of our model with two case studies and expert interviews to validate its usefulness and effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

We demonstrate that large learning rates also produce desirable representation properties such as invariant feature utilization, class separation, and activation sparsity. Importantly, our findings indicate that large learning rates compare favorably to other hyperparameters and regularization methods, in consistently satisfying these properties in tandem. In addition to demonstrating the positive effect of large learning rates across diverse spurious correlation datasets, models, and optimizers, we also present strong evidence that the previously documented success of large learning rates in standard classification tasks is likely due to its effect on addressing hidden/rare spurious correlations in the training dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV 2025, 23 pages</p></details> |

Recently, learning-based approaches have shown a potential to speed up MIP solving via offline training that then guides important design decisions during the search. However, a significant drawback of these methods is their heavy reliance on offline training, which requires collecting training datasets and computationally costly training epochs yet offering only limited generalization to unseen (larger) instances. In this paper, we propose Balans, an adaptive meta-solver for MIPs with online learning capability that does not require any supervision or apriori training. At its core, Balans is based on adaptive large-neighborhood search, operating on top of an MIP solver by successive applications of destroy and repair neighborhood operators. During the search, the selection among different neighborhood definitions is guided on the fly for the instance at hand via multi-armed bandit algorithms. Our extensive experiments on hard optimization instances show that Balans offers significant performance gains over the default MIP solver, is better than committing to any single best neighborhood, and improves over the state-of-the-art large-neighborhood search for MIPs. Finally, we release Balans as a highly configurable, MIP solver agnostic, open-source software.</p></details> |  |

To enable alternative, simulation-based exploration of different stakeholder perspectives, we develop the HoPeS (Human-Oriented Perspective Shifting) modelling framework. HoPeS employs agents powered by large language models (LLMs) to represent various stakeholders; users can step into the agent roles to experience perspectival differences. A simulation protocol serves as a "scaffold" to streamline multiple perspective-taking simulations, supporting users in reflecting on, transitioning between, and integrating across perspectives. A prototype system is developed to demonstrate HoPeS in the context of institutional dynamics and land use change, enabling both narrative-driven and numerical experiments. In an illustrative experiment, a user successively adopts the perspectives of a system observer and a researcher - a role that analyses data from the embedded land use model to inform evidence-based decision-making for other LLM agents representing various institutions. Despite the user's effort to recommend technically sound policies, discrepancies persist between the policy recommendation and implementation due to stakeholders' competing advocacies, mirroring real-world misalignment between researcher and policymaker perspectives. The user's reflection highlights the subjective feelings of frustration and disappointment as a researcher, especially due to the challenge of maintaining political neutrality while attempting to gain political influence. Despite this, the user exhibits high motivation to experiment with alternative narrative framing strategies, suggesting the system's potential in exploring different perspectives. Further system and protocol refinement are likely to enable new forms of interdisciplinary collaboration in socio-ecological simulations.</p></details> |  |

Building foundational models for ST can significantly enhance the analysis of vast and complex data sources, unlocking new perspectives on the intricacies of biological tissues. However, modeling ST data is inherently challenging due to the need to extract multi-scale information from tissue slices containing vast numbers of cells. This process requires integrating macro-scale tissue morphology, micro-scale cellular microenvironment, and gene-scale gene expression profile. To address this challenge, we propose SToFM, a multi-scale Spatial Transcriptomics Foundation Model. SToFM first performs multi-scale information extraction on each ST slice, to construct a set of ST sub-slices that aggregate macro-, micro- and gene-scale information. Then an SE(2) Transformer is used to obtain high-quality cell representations from the sub-slices.

| **[MIRA: Medical Time Series Foundation Model for Real-World Health Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07584v3)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A unified foundation model for medical time series -- pretrained on open access and ethics board-approved medical corpora -- offers the potential to reduce annotation burdens, minimize model customization, and enable robust transfer across clinical institutions, modalities, and tasks, particularly in data-scarce or privacy-constrained environments. However, existing generalist time series foundation models struggle to handle medical time series data due to their inherent challenges, including irregular intervals, heterogeneous sampling rates, and frequent missing values. To address these challenges, we introduce MIRA, a unified foundation model specifically designed for medical time series forecasting. MIRA incorporates a Continuous-Time Rotary Positional Encoding that enables fine-grained modeling of variable time intervals, a frequency-specific mixture-of-experts layer that routes computation across latent frequency regimes to further promote temporal specialization, and a Continuous Dynamics Extrapolation Block based on Neural ODE that models the continuous trajectory of latent states, enabling accurate forecasting at arbitrary target timestamps. Pretrained on a large-scale and diverse medical corpus comprising over 454 billion time points collect from publicly available datasets, MIRA achieves reductions in forecasting errors by an average of 10% and 7% in out-of-distribution and in-distribution scenarios, respectively, when compared to other zero-shot and fine-tuned baselines. We also introduce a comprehensive benchmark spanning multiple downstream clinical tasks, establishing a foundation for future research in medical time series modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Well Does GPT-4o Understand Vision? Evaluating Multimodal Foundation Models on Standard Computer Vision Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01955v2)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal foundation models, such as GPT-4o, have recently made remarkable progress, but it is not clear where exactly these models stand in terms of understanding vision. In this paper, we benchmark the performance of popular multimodal foundation models (GPT-4o, o4-mini, Gemini 1.5 Pro and Gemini 2.0 Flash, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Qwen2-VL, Llama 3.2) on standard computer vision tasks (semantic segmentation, object detection, image classification, depth and surface normal prediction) using established datasets (e.g., COCO, ImageNet and its variants, etc). The main challenges to performing this are: 1) most models are trained to output text and cannot natively express versatile domains, such as segments or 3D geometry, and 2) many leading models are proprietary and accessible only at an API level, i.e., there is no weight access to adapt them. We address these challenges by translating standard vision tasks into equivalent text-promptable and API-compatible tasks via prompt chaining to create a standardized benchmarking framework. We observe that 1) the models are not close to the state-of-the-art specialist models at any task. However, 2) they are respectable generalists; this is remarkable as they are presumably trained on primarily image-text-based tasks. 3) They perform semantic tasks notably better than geometric ones. 4) While the prompt-chaining techniques affect performance, better models exhibit less sensitivity to prompt variations. 5) GPT-4o performs the best among non-reasoning models, securing the top position in 4 out of 6 tasks, 6) reasoning models, e.g. o3, show improvements in geometric tasks, and 7) a preliminary analysis of models with native image generation, like the latest GPT-4o, shows they exhibit quirks like hallucinations and spatial misalignments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page at https://fm-vision-evals.epfl.ch/</p></details> |
| **[Risk In Context: Benchmarking Privacy Leakage of Foundation Models in Synthetic Tabular Data Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17066v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthetic tabular data is essential for machine learning workflows, especially for expanding small or imbalanced datasets and enabling privacy-preserving data sharing. However, state-of-the-art generative models (GANs, VAEs, diffusion models) rely on large datasets with thousands of examples. In low-data settings, often the primary motivation for synthetic data, these models can overfit, leak sensitive records, and require frequent retraining. Recent work uses large pre-trained transformers to generate rows via in-context learning (ICL), which needs only a few seed examples and no parameter updates, avoiding retraining. But ICL repeats seed rows verbatim, introducing a new privacy risk that has only been studied in text. The severity of this risk in tabular synthesis-where a single row may identify a person-remains unclear. We address this gap with the first benchmark of three foundation models (GPT-4o-mini, LLaMA 3.3 70B, TabPFN v2) against four baselines on 35 real-world tables from health, finance, and policy. We evaluate statistical fidelity, downstream utility, and membership inference leakage. Results show foundation models consistently have the highest privacy risk. LLaMA 3.3 70B reaches up to 54 percentage points higher true-positive rate at 1% FPR than the safest baseline. GPT-4o-mini and TabPFN are also highly vulnerable. We plot the privacy-utility frontier and show that CTGAN and GPT-4o-mini offer better tradeoffs. A factorial study finds that three zero-cost prompt tweaks-small batch size, low temperature, and using summary statistics-can reduce worst-case AUC by 14 points and rare-class leakage by up to 39 points while maintaining over 90% fidelity. Our benchmark offers a practical guide for safer low-data synthesis with foundation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Agentic & GenAI Evaluation KDD2025, poster presentation</p></details> |
| **[AI and Deep Learning for Terahertz Ultra-Massive MIMO: From Model-Driven Approaches to Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09839v3)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study explored the transformative potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in addressing the challenges posed by terahertz ultra-massive multiple-input multiple-output (UM-MIMO) systems. It begins by outlining the characteristics of terahertz UM-MIMO systems and identifies three primary challenges for transceiver design: computational complexity, modeling difficulty, and measurement limitations. The study posits that AI provides a promising solution to these challenges. Three systematic research roadmaps are proposed for developing AI algorithms tailored to terahertz UM-MIMO systems. The first roadmap, model-driven deep learning (DL), emphasizes the importance of leveraging available domain knowledge and advocates the adoption of AI only to enhance bottleneck modules within an established signal processing or optimization framework. Four essential steps are discussed: algorithmic frameworks, basis algorithms, loss-function design, and neural architecture design. The second roadmap presents channel state information (CSI) foundation models, aimed at unifying the design of different transceiver modules by focusing on their shared foundation, that is, the wireless channel. The training of a single compact foundation model is proposed to estimate the score function of wireless channels, which serve as a versatile prior for designing a wide variety of transceiver modules. Four essential steps are outlined: general frameworks, conditioning, site-specific adaptation, joint design of CSI foundation models, and model-driven DL. The third roadmap aims to explore potential directions for applying pretrained large language models (LLMs) to terahertz UM-MIMO systems. Several application scenarios are envisioned, including LLM-based estimation, optimization, search, network management, and protocol understanding. Finally, the study highlights open problems and future research directions.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 8 figures, 1 table, accepted by Engineering.

This gap is primarily due to the absence of domain-specific foundational models, with existing solutions often relying on general-purpose LLMs that fail to address the unique challenges and technical intricacies of O-RAN. To bridge this gap, we introduce ORANSight-2.0 (O-RAN Insights), a pioneering initiative to develop specialized foundational LLMs tailored for O-RAN. Built on 18 models spanning five open-source LLM frameworks -- Mistral, Qwen, Llama, Phi, and Gemma -- ORANSight-2.0 fine-tunes models ranging from 1B to 70B parameters, significantly reducing reliance on proprietary, closed-source models while enhancing performance in O-RAN-specific tasks. At the core of ORANSight-2.0 is RANSTRUCT, a novel Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based instruction-tuning framework that employs two LLM agents -- a Mistral-based Question Generator and a Qwen-based Answer Generator -- to create high-quality instruction-tuning datasets. The generated dataset is then used to fine-tune the 18 pre-trained open-source LLMs via QLoRA. To evaluate ORANSight-2.0, we introduce srsRANBench, a novel benchmark designed for code generation and codebase understanding in the context of srsRAN, a widely used 5G O-RAN stack.</p></details> |  |

However, training new models requires large amounts of labeled data, a challenge due to high cost of precise annotations and data privacy. To address this issue, we introduce the MRI-CORE, a vision foundation model trained using more than 6 million slices from over 110 thousand MRI volumes across 18 body locations. Our experiments show notable improvements in performance over state-of-the-art methods in 13 data-restricted segmentation tasks, as well as in image classification, and zero-shot segmentation, showing the strong potential of MRI-CORE to enable data-efficient development of artificial intelligence models. We also present data on which strategies yield most useful foundation models and a novel analysis relating similarity between pre-training and downstream task data with transfer learning performance.

| **[FISHER: A Foundation Model for Multi-Modal Industrial Signal Comprehensive Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16696v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid deployment of SCADA systems, how to effectively analyze industrial signals and detect abnormal states is an urgent need for the industry. Due to the significant heterogeneity of these signals, which we summarize as the M5 problem, previous works only focus on small sub-problems and employ specialized models, failing to utilize the synergies between modalities and the powerful scaling law. However, we argue that the M5 signals can be modeled in a unified manner due to the intrinsic similarity. As a result, we propose FISHER, a Foundation model for multi-modal Industrial Signal compreHEnsive Representation. To support arbitrary sampling rates, FISHER considers the increment of sampling rate as the concatenation of sub-band information. Specifically, FISHER takes the STFT sub-band as the modeling unit and adopts a teacher student SSL framework for pre-training. We also develop the RMIS benchmark, which evaluates the representations of M5 industrial signals on multiple health management tasks. Compared with top SSL models, FISHER showcases versatile and outstanding capabilities with a general performance gain up to 5.03%, along with much more efficient scaling curves. We also investigate the scaling law on downstream tasks and derive potential avenues for future works. FISHER is now open-sourced on https://github.com/jianganbai/FISHER</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |

However, current vision-language models in EO, particularly CLIP-based variants, remain confined to individual modalities, limiting generalization and scalability across diverse tasks. We present DOFA-CLIP (Dynamic-One-For-All CLIP), a unified vision-language foundation model that dynamically adapts to EO modalities with flexible spectral configurations through a single Transformer backbone. Our approach introduces three key contributions: 1) the construction of GeoLangBind-2M, a large-scale EO image-text dataset covering six heterogeneous modalities with rich natural language descriptions; 2) a novel training strategy called VECT (Vision-models Enhanced Contrastive Text-image pretraining), which enhances the spatial awareness of CLIP features with multiple vision foundation models; and 3) a Modality-aware Knowledge Agglomeration (MaKA) module that refines feature distillation with modality-specific awareness. DOFA-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance across a wide range of EO benchmarks, including unseen modalities and a diverse number of input spectral bands. Together, these contributions establish a scalable foundation for multimodal EO understanding and open new avenues for integrating heterogeneous EO data with large language models. Code and datasets will be released.

| **[Beyond English: Evaluating Automated Measurement of Moral Foundations in Non-English Discourse with a Chinese Case Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02451v3)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study explores computational approaches for measuring moral foundations (MFs) in non-English corpora. Since most resources are developed primarily for English, cross-linguistic applications of moral foundation theory remain limited. Using Chinese as a case study, this paper evaluates the effectiveness of applying English resources to machine translated text, local language lexicons, multilingual language models, and large language models (LLMs) in measuring MFs in non-English texts. The results indicate that machine translation and local lexicon approaches are insufficient for complex moral assessments, frequently resulting in a substantial loss of cultural information. In contrast, multilingual models and LLMs demonstrate reliable cross-language performance with transfer learning, with LLMs excelling in terms of data efficiency. Importantly, this study also underscores the need for human-in-the-loop validation of automated MF assessment, as the most advanced models may overlook cultural nuances in cross-language measurements. The findings highlight the potential of LLMs for cross-language MF measurements and other complex multilingual deductive coding tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 2 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[Are Foundation Models All You Need for Zero-shot Face Presentation Attack Detection?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16393v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although face recognition systems have undergone an impressive evolution in the last decade, these technologies are vulnerable to attack presentations (AP). These attacks are mostly easy to create and, by executing them against the system's capture device, the malicious actor can impersonate an authorised subject and thus gain access to the latter's information (e.g., financial transactions). To protect facial recognition schemes against presentation attacks, state-of-the-art deep learning presentation attack detection (PAD) approaches require a large amount of data to produce reliable detection performances and even then, they decrease their performance for unknown presentation attack instruments (PAI) or database (information not seen during training), i.e. they lack generalisability. To mitigate the above problems, this paper focuses on zero-shot PAD. To do so, we first assess the effectiveness and generalisability of foundation models in established and challenging experimental scenarios and then propose a simple but effective framework for zero-shot PAD. Experimental results show that these models are able to achieve performance in difficult scenarios with minimal effort of the more advanced PAD mechanisms, whose weights were optimised mainly with training sets that included APs and bona fide presentations. The top-performing foundation model outperforms by a margin the best from the state of the art observed with the leaving-one-out protocol on the SiW-Mv2 database, which contains challenging unknown 2D and 3D attacks</p></details> | Accepted at FG 2025 |
| **[M-SpecGene: Generalized Foundation Model for RGBT Multispectral Vision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16318v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>RGB-Thermal (RGBT) multispectral vision is essential for robust perception in complex environments. Most RGBT tasks follow a case-by-case research paradigm, relying on manually customized models to learn task-oriented representations. Nevertheless, this paradigm is inherently constrained by artificial inductive bias, modality bias, and data bottleneck. To address these limitations, we make the initial attempt to build a Generalized RGBT MultiSpectral foundation model (M-SpecGene), which aims to learn modality-invariant representations from large-scale broad data in a self-supervised manner. M-SpecGene provides new insights into multispectral fusion and integrates prior case-by-case studies into a unified paradigm. Considering the unique characteristic of information imbalance in RGBT data, we introduce the Cross-Modality Structural Sparsity (CMSS) metric to quantify the information density across two modalities. Then we develop the GMM-CMSS progressive masking strategy to facilitate a flexible, easy-to-hard, and object-centric pre-training process. Comprehensive experiments validate M-SpecGene's generalizability across eleven datasets for four RGBT downstream tasks. The code will be available at https://github.com/CalayZhou/M-SpecGene.</p></details> | accepted by ICCV2025 |
| **[Dens3R: A Foundation Model for 3D Geometry Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16290v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in dense 3D reconstruction have led to significant progress, yet achieving accurate unified geometric prediction remains a major challenge. Most existing methods are limited to predicting a single geometry quantity from input images. However, geometric quantities such as depth, surface normals, and point maps are inherently correlated, and estimating them in isolation often fails to ensure consistency, thereby limiting both accuracy and practical applicability. This motivates us to explore a unified framework that explicitly models the structural coupling among different geometric properties to enable joint regression. In this paper, we present Dens3R, a 3D foundation model designed for joint geometric dense prediction and adaptable to a wide range of downstream tasks. Dens3R adopts a two-stage training framework to progressively build a pointmap representation that is both generalizable and intrinsically invariant. Specifically, we design a lightweight shared encoder-decoder backbone and introduce position-interpolated rotary positional encoding to maintain expressive power while enhancing robustness to high-resolution inputs. By integrating image-pair matching features with intrinsic invariance modeling, Dens3R accurately regresses multiple geometric quantities such as surface normals and depth, achieving consistent geometry perception from single-view to multi-view inputs. Additionally, we propose a post-processing pipeline that supports geometrically consistent multi-view inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of Dens3R across various dense 3D prediction tasks and highlight its potential for broader applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://g-1nonly.github.io/Dens3R/, Code: https://github.com/G-1nOnly/Dens3R</p></details> |

Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSSS) has emerged as a solution to alleviate the labeling burden by leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data through self-training techniques. Meanwhile, the advent of foundational segmentation models pre-trained on massive data, has shown the potential to generalize across domains effectively. This work explores whether a foundational segmentation model can address label scarcity in the pixel-level vision task as an annotator for unlabeled images. Specifically, we investigate the efficacy of using SEEM, a Segment Anything Model (SAM) variant fine-tuned for textual input, to generate predictive masks for unlabeled data. To address the shortcomings of using SEEM-generated masks as supervision, we propose ConformalSAM, a novel SSSS framework which first calibrates the foundation model using the target domain's labeled data and then filters out unreliable pixel labels of unlabeled data so that only high-confidence labels are used as supervision. By leveraging conformal prediction (CP) to adapt foundation models to target data through uncertainty calibration, ConformalSAM exploits the strong capability of the foundational segmentation model reliably which benefits the early-stage learning, while a subsequent self-reliance training strategy mitigates overfitting to SEEM-generated masks in the later training stage. Our experiment demonstrates that, on three standard benchmarks of SSSS, ConformalSAM achieves superior performance compared to recent SSSS methods and helps boost the performance of those methods as a plug-in.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |

We explore how these architectures, with their global receptive fields and adaptability, address challenges such as long-range dependency modeling, contextual modeling and data scarcity. The survey categorizes VAD methods into reconstruction-based, feature-based and zero/few-shot approaches, highlighting the paradigm shift brought about by foundation models. By integrating attention mechanisms and leveraging large-scale pre-training, Transformers and foundation models enable more robust, interpretable, and scalable anomaly detection solutions. This work provides a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art techniques, their strengths, limitations, and emerging trends in leveraging these architectures for VAD.</p></details> |  |

Various scientific and engineering applications demand a versatile and differentiable PDE solver that can quickly generate solutions with adequate accuracy, and limitations of the traditional solvers and specialized neural operators motivate the development of foundation models for solving PDEs. This paper introduces PDEformer-2, a versatile foundation model for two-dimensional PDEs. Based on our previous one-dimensional PDEformer-1 model, PDEformer-2 receives the PDE form as network input via computational graph representation, which has the flexibility to encode most common PDEs. The mesh-free predicted solutions can be directly queried at arbitrary spatio-temporal coordinates. A large (40TB) diverse dataset is employed to pretrain the current model, making it capable of simultaneously addressing PDEs with different symbolic forms, domain shapes, boundary conditions, number of variables, and time-dependency. Accurate zero-shot prediction is allowed for PDEs that resemble the pretraining ones. When adapted to new unseen PDEs, PDEformer-2 demonstrates faster learning than many specialized models, and has smaller errors given limited (less than 100) samples. Additionally, PDEformer-2 can be employed in the inverse problems thanks to its fast and differentiable nature and produces reasonable results in our experiments to recover coefficient scalars and fields of a PDE.</p></details> |  |

We present a method for self-supervised domain adaptation for the scenario where annotated source domain data (e.g. from synthetic generation) is available, but the target domain data is completely unannotated. Our method targets the semantic segmentation task and leverages a segmentation foundation model (Segment Anything Model) to obtain segment information on unannotated data. We take inspiration from recent advances in unsupervised local feature learning and propose an invariance-variance loss over the detected segments for regularizing feature representations in the target domain. Crucially, this loss structure and network architecture can handle overlapping segments and oversegmentation as produced by Segment Anything. We demonstrate the advantage of our method on the challenging YCB-Video and HomebrewedDB datasets and show that it outperforms prior work and, on YCB-Video, even a network trained with real annotations. Additionally, we provide insight through model ablations and show applicability to a custom robotic application.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for IEEE International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE) 2025.

Recent advancements in deep learning have led to powerful depth foundation models (DFMs), yet their evaluation remains challenging due to inconsistencies in existing protocols. Traditional benchmarks rely on alignment-based metrics that introduce biases, favor certain depth representations, and complicate fair comparisons. In this work, we propose BenchDepth, a new benchmark that evaluates DFMs through five carefully selected downstream proxy tasks: depth completion, stereo matching, monocular feed-forward 3D scene reconstruction, SLAM, and vision-language spatial understanding. Unlike conventional evaluation protocols, our approach assesses DFMs based on their practical utility in real-world applications, bypassing problematic alignment procedures. We benchmark eight state-of-the-art DFMs and provide an in-depth analysis of key findings and observations. We hope our work sparks further discussion in the community on best practices for depth model evaluation and paves the way for future research and advancements in depth estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Webpa...</summary><p>Webpage: https://zhyever.github.io/benchdepth</p></details> |
