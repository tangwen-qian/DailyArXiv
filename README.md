However, existing 2D editing-based methods often rely on spatial priors such as 2D masks or 3D bounding boxes, and they struggle to ensure consistency of the inserted object. These limitations hinder flexibility and scalability in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose FreeInsert, a novel framework that leverages foundation models including MLLMs, LGMs, and diffusion models to disentangle object generation from spatial placement. This enables unsupervised and flexible object insertion in 3D scenes without spatial priors. FreeInsert starts with an MLLM-based parser that extracts structured semantics, including object types, spatial relationships, and attachment regions, from user instructions. These semantics guide both the reconstruction of the inserted object for 3D consistency and the learning of its degrees of freedom. We leverage the spatial reasoning capabilities of MLLMs to initialize object pose and scale. A hierarchical, spatially aware refinement stage further integrates spatial semantics and MLLM-inferred priors to enhance placement. Finally, the appearance of the object is improved using the inserted-object image to enhance visual fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that FreeInsert achieves semantically coherent, spatially precise, and visually realistic 3D insertions without relying on spatial priors, offering a user-friendly and flexible editing experience.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modeling Large Nonstationary Spatial Data with the Full-Scale Basis Graphical Lasso](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01318v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a new approach for the modeling large datasets of nonstationary spatial processes that combines a latent low rank process and a sparse covariance model. The low rank component coefficients are endowed with a flexible graphical Gaussian Markov random field model. The utilization of a low rank and compactly-supported covariance structure combines the full-scale approximation and the basis graphical lasso; we term this new approach the full-scale basis graphical lasso (FSBGL). Estimation employs a graphical lasso-penalized likelihood, which is optimized using a difference-of-convex scheme. We illustrate the proposed approach with a challenging high-resolution simulation dataset of the thermosphere. In a comparison against state-of-the-art spatial models, the FSBGL performs better at capturing salient features of the thermospheric temperature fields, even with limited available training data.</p></details> | 37 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Uncovering complementary information sharing in spider monkey collective foraging using higher-order spatial networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01167v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collectives are often able to process information in a distributed fashion, surpassing each individual member's processing capacity. In fission-fusion dynamics, where group members come together and split from others often, sharing complementary information about uniquely known foraging areas could allow a group to track a heterogenous foraging environment better than any group member on its own. We analyse the partial overlaps between individual core ranges, which we assume represent the knowledge of an individual during a given season. We identify sets of individuals whose overlap shows a balance between redundantly and uniquely known portions and we use simplicial complexes to represent these higher-order interactions. The structure of the simplicial complexes shows holes in various dimensions, revealing complementarity in the foraging information that is being shared. We propose that the complex spatial networks arising from fission-fusion dynamics allow for adaptive, collective processing of foraging information in dynamic environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 6 figures plus supplementary information with 12 pages, methods, model and 4 figures of results</p></details> |
| **[3D Human Pose Estimation via Spatial Graph Order Attention and Temporal Body Aware Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01003v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nowadays, Transformers and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are the prevailing techniques for 3D human pose estimation. However, Transformer-based methods either ignore the spatial neighborhood relationships between the joints when used for skeleton representations or disregard the local temporal patterns of the local joint movements in skeleton sequence modeling, while GCN-based methods often neglect the need for pose-specific representations. To address these problems, we propose a new method that exploits the graph modeling capability of GCN to represent each skeleton with multiple graphs of different orders, incorporated with a newly introduced Graph Order Attention module that dynamically emphasizes the most representative orders for each joint. The resulting spatial features of the sequence are further processed using a proposed temporal Body Aware Transformer that models the global body feature dependencies in the sequence with awareness of the local inter-skeleton feature dependencies of joints. Given that our 3D pose output aligns with the central 2D pose in the sequence, we improve the self-attention mechanism to be aware of the central pose while diminishing its focus gradually towards the first and the last poses. Extensive experiments on Human3.6m, MPIINF-3DHP, and HumanEva-I datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Code and models are made available on Github.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 9 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[Quasi-Score Matching Estimation for Spatial Autoregressive Model with Random Weights Matrix and Regressors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19721v2)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancements in technology for data collection, the application of the spatial autoregressive (SAR) model has become increasingly prevalent in real-world analysis, particularly when dealing with large datasets. However, the commonly used quasi-maximum likelihood estimation (QMLE) for the SAR model is not computationally scalable to handle the data with a large size. In addition, when establishing the asymptotic properties of the parameter estimators of the SAR model, both weights matrix and regressors are assumed to be nonstochastic in classical spatial econometrics, which is perhaps not realistic in real applications. Motivated by the machine learning literature, this paper proposes quasi-score matching estimation for the SAR model. This new estimation approach is developed based on the likelihood, but significantly reduces the computational complexity of the QMLE. The asymptotic properties of parameter estimators under the random weights matrix and regressors are established, which provides a new theoretical framework for the asymptotic inference of the SAR-type models. The usefulness of the quasi-score matching estimation and its asymptotic inference is illustrated via extensive simulation studies and a case study of an anti-conflict social network experiment for middle school students.</p></details> | 35 pages |
| **[SpatialLLM: A Compound 3D-Informed Design towards Spatially-Intelligent Large Multimodal Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00788v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans naturally understand 3D spatial relationships, enabling complex reasoning like predicting collisions of vehicles from different directions. Current large multimodal models (LMMs), however, lack of this capability of 3D spatial reasoning. This limitation stems from the scarcity of 3D training data and the bias in current model designs toward 2D data. In this paper, we systematically study the impact of 3D-informed data, architecture, and training setups, introducing SpatialLLM, a large multi-modal model with advanced 3D spatial reasoning abilities. To address data limitations, we develop two types of 3D-informed training datasets: (1) 3D-informed probing data focused on object's 3D location and orientation, and (2) 3D-informed conversation data for complex spatial relationships. Notably, we are the first to curate VQA data that incorporate 3D orientation relationships on real images. Furthermore, we systematically integrate these two types of training data with the architectural and training designs of LMMs, providing a roadmap for optimal design aimed at achieving superior 3D reasoning capabilities. Our SpatialLLM advances machines toward highly capable 3D-informed reasoning, surpassing GPT-4o performance by 8.7%. Our systematic empirical design and the resulting findings offer valuable insights for future research in this direction.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025 highlight, camera ready version</p></details> |
| **[Explainable AI in Spatial Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00591v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This chapter discusses the opportunities of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) within the realm of spatial analysis. A key objective in spatial analysis is to model spatial relationships and infer spatial processes to generate knowledge from spatial data, which has been largely based on spatial statistical methods. More recently, machine learning offers scalable and flexible approaches that complement traditional methods and has been increasingly applied in spatial data science. Despite its advantages, machine learning is often criticized for being a black box, which limits our understanding of model behavior and output. Recognizing this limitation, XAI has emerged as a pivotal field in AI that provides methods to explain the output of machine learning models to enhance transparency and understanding. These methods are crucial for model diagnosis, bias detection, and ensuring the reliability of results obtained from machine learning models. This chapter introduces key concepts and methods in XAI with a focus on Shapley value-based approaches, which is arguably the most popular XAI method, and their integration with spatial analysis. An empirical example of county-level voting behaviors in the 2020 Presidential election is presented to demonstrate the use of Shapley values and spatial analysis with a comparison to multi-scale geographically weighted regression. The chapter concludes with a discussion on the challenges and limitations of current XAI techniques and proposes new directions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interpretable Spatial-Temporal Fusion Transformers: Multi-Output Prediction for Parametric Dynamical Systems with Time-Varying Inputs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00473v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We explore the promising performance of a transformer model in predicting outputs of parametric dynamical systems with external time-varying input signals. The outputs of such systems vary not only with physical parameters but also with external time-varying input signals. Accurately catching the dynamics of such systems is challenging. We have adapted and extended an existing transformer model for single output prediction to a multiple-output transformer that is able to predict multiple output responses of these systems. The multiple-output transformer generalizes the interpretability of the original transformer. The generalized interpretable attention weight matrix explores not only the temporal correlations in the sequence, but also the interactions between the multiple outputs, providing explanation for the spatial correlation in the output domain. This multiple-output transformer accurately predicts the sequence of multiple outputs, regardless of the nonlinearity of the system and the dimensionality of the parameter space.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluation of Thermal Control Based on Spatial Thermal Comfort with Reconstructed Environmental Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00468v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving thermal comfort while maintaining energy efficiency is a critical objective in building system control. Conventional thermal comfort models, such as the Predicted Mean Vote (PMV), rely on both environmental and personal variables. However, the use of fixed-location sensors limits the ability to capture spatial variability, which reduces the accuracy of occupant-specific comfort estimation. To address this limitation, this study proposes a new PMV estimation method that incorporates spatial environmental data reconstructed using the Gappy Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (Gappy POD) algorithm. In addition, a group PMV-based control framework is developed to account for the thermal comfort of multiple occupants. The Gappy POD method enables fast and accurate reconstruction of indoor temperature fields from sparse sensor measurements. Using these reconstructed fields and occupant location data, spatially resolved PMV values are calculated. Group-level thermal conditions are then derived through statistical aggregation methods and used to control indoor temperature in a multi-occupant living lab environment. Experimental results show that the Gappy POD algorithm achieves an average relative error below 3\% in temperature reconstruction. PMV distributions varied by up to 1.26 scale units depending on occupant location. Moreover, thermal satisfaction outcomes varied depending on the group PMV method employed. These findings underscore the importance for adaptive thermal control strategies that incorporate both spatial and individual variability, offering valuable insights for future occupant-centric building operations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial vertical regression for spatial panel data: Evaluating the effect of the Florentine tramway's first line on commercial vitality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00450v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthetic control methods are commonly used in panel data settings to evaluate the effect of an intervention. In many of these cases, the treated and control units correspond to spatial units such as regions or neighborhoods. Our approach addresses the challenge of understanding how an intervention applied at specific locations influences the surrounding area. Traditional synthetic control applications may struggle with defining the effective area of impact, the extent of treatment propagation across space, and the variation of effects with distance from the treatment sites. To address these challenges, we introduce Spatial Vertical Regression (SVR) within the Bayesian paradigm. This innovative approach allows us to accurately predict the outcomes in varying proximities to the treatment sites, while meticulously accounting for the spatial structure inherent in the data. Specifically, rooted on the vertical regression framework of the synthetic control method, SVR employs a Gaussian process to ensure that the imputation of missing potential outcomes for areas of different distance around the treatment sites is spatially coherent, reflecting the expectation that nearby areas experience similar outcomes and have similar relationships to control areas. This approach is particularly pertinent to our study on the Florentine tramway's first line construction. We study its influence on the local commercial landscape, focusing on how business prevalence varies at different distances from the tram stops.</p></details> |  |
| **[DeepSTA: A Spatial-Temporal Attention Network for Logistics Delivery Timely Rate Prediction in Anomaly Conditions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00402v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prediction of couriers' delivery timely rates in advance is essential to the logistics industry, enabling companies to take preemptive measures to ensure the normal operation of delivery services. This becomes even more critical during anomaly conditions like the epidemic outbreak, during which couriers' delivery timely rate will decline markedly and fluctuates significantly. Existing studies pay less attention to the logistics scenario. Moreover, many works focusing on prediction tasks in anomaly scenarios fail to explicitly model abnormal events, e.g., treating external factors equally with other features, resulting in great information loss. Further, since some anomalous events occur infrequently, traditional data-driven methods perform poorly in these scenarios. To deal with them, we propose a deep spatial-temporal attention model, named DeepSTA. To be specific, to avoid information loss, we design an anomaly spatio-temporal learning module that employs a recurrent neural network to model incident information. Additionally, we utilize Node2vec to model correlations between road districts, and adopt graph neural networks and long short-term memory to capture the spatial-temporal dependencies of couriers. To tackle the issue of insufficient training data in abnormal circumstances, we propose an anomaly pattern attention module that adopts a memory network for couriers' anomaly feature patterns storage via attention mechanisms. The experiments on real-world logistics datasets during the COVID-19 outbreak in 2022 show the model outperforms the best baselines by 12.11% in MAE and 13.71% in MSE, demonstrating its superior performance over multiple competitive baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM 2023</p></details> |
| **[A Unified Approach for Multi-Granularity Search over Spatial Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04805v4)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There has been increased interest in data search as a means to find relevant datasets or data points in data lakes and repositories. Although approaches have been proposed to support spatial dataset search and data point search, they consider the two types of searches independently. To enable search operations ranging from the coarse-grained dataset level to the fine-grained data point level, we provide an integrated one that supports diverse query types and distance metrics. In this paper, we focus on designing a multi-granularity spatial data search system, called Spadas, that supports both dataset and data point search operations. To address the challenges of the high cost of indexing and susceptibility to outliers, we propose a unified index that can drastically improve query efficiency in various scenarios by organizing data reasonably and removing outliers in datasets. Moreover, to accelerate all data search operations, we propose a set of pruning mechanisms based on the unified index, including fast bound estimation, approximation technique with error bound, and pruning in batch techniques, to effectively filter out non-relevant datasets and points. Finally, we report the results of a detailed experimental evaluation using six spatial data repositories, achieving orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art algorithms and demonstrating the effectiveness by case study. An online spatial data search system of Spadas is also implemented and made accessible to users.</p></details> |  |
| **[PRISM-DP: Spatial Pose-based Observations for Diffusion-Policies via Segmentation, Mesh Generation, and Pose Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20359v2)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based visuomotor policies generate robot motions by learning to denoise action-space trajectories conditioned on observations. These observations are commonly streams of RGB images, whose high dimensionality includes substantial task-irrelevant information, requiring large models to extract relevant patterns. In contrast, using more structured observations, such as the spatial poses (positions and orientations) of key objects over time, enables training more compact policies that can recognize relevant patterns with fewer parameters. However, obtaining accurate object poses in open-set, real-world environments remains challenging. For instance, it is impractical to assume that all relevant objects are equipped with markers, and recent learning-based 6D pose estimation and tracking methods often depend on pre-scanned object meshes, requiring manual reconstruction. In this work, we propose PRISM-DP, an approach that leverages segmentation, mesh generation, pose estimation, and pose tracking models to enable compact diffusion policy learning directly from the spatial poses of task-relevant objects. Crucially, because PRISM-DP uses a mesh generation model, it eliminates the need for manual mesh processing or creation, improving scalability and usability in open-set, real-world environments. Experiments across a range of tasks in both simulation and real-world settings show that PRISM-DP outperforms high-dimensional image-based diffusion policies and achieves performance comparable to policies trained with ground-truth state information. We conclude with a discussion of the broader implications and limitations of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fine-grained spatial-temporal perception for gas leak segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00295v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gas leaks pose significant risks to human health and the environment. Despite long-standing concerns, there are limited methods that can efficiently and accurately detect and segment leaks due to their concealed appearance and random shapes. In this paper, we propose a Fine-grained Spatial-Temporal Perception (FGSTP) algorithm for gas leak segmentation. FGSTP captures critical motion clues across frames and integrates them with refined object features in an end-to-end network. Specifically, we first construct a correlation volume to capture motion information between consecutive frames. Then, the fine-grained perception progressively refines the object-level features using previous outputs. Finally, a decoder is employed to optimize boundary segmentation. Because there is no highly precise labeled dataset for gas leak segmentation, we manually label a gas leak video dataset, GasVid. Experimental results on GasVid demonstrate that our model excels in segmenting non-rigid objects such as gas leaks, generating the most accurate mask compared to other state-of-the-art (SOTA) models.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, ICIP 2025 Conference</p></details> |
| **[SDWPF: A Dataset for Spatial Dynamic Wind Power Forecasting Challenge at KDD Cup 2022](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04360v2)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The variability of wind power supply can present substantial challenges to incorporating wind power into a grid system. Thus, Wind Power Forecasting (WPF) has been widely recognized as one of the most critical issues in wind power integration and operation. There has been an explosion of studies on wind power forecasting problems in the past decades. Nevertheless, how to well handle the WPF problem is still challenging, since high prediction accuracy is always demanded to ensure grid stability and security of supply. We present a unique Spatial Dynamic Wind Power Forecasting dataset: SDWPF, which includes the spatial distribution of wind turbines, as well as the dynamic context factors. Whereas, most of the existing datasets have only a small number of wind turbines without knowing the locations and context information of wind turbines at a fine-grained time scale. By contrast, SDWPF provides the wind power data of 134 wind turbines from a wind farm over half a year with their relative positions and internal statuses. We use this dataset to launch the Baidu KDD Cup 2022 to examine the limit of current WPF solutions. The dataset is released at https://aistudio.baidu.com/aistudio/competition/detail/152/0/datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a journal paper published in Scientific Data, titled SDWPF: A Dataset for Spatial Dynamic Wind Power Forecasting over a Large Turbine Array.

| **[MoSAM: Motion-Guided Segment Anything Model with Spatial-Temporal Memory Selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00739v1)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) has demonstrated exceptional capabilities in interactive object segmentation for both images and videos. However, as a foundational model on interactive segmentation, SAM2 performs segmentation directly based on mask memory from the past six frames, leading to two significant challenges. Firstly, during inference in videos, objects may disappear since SAM2 relies solely on memory without accounting for object motion information, which limits its long-range object tracking capabilities. Secondly, its memory is constructed from fixed past frames, making it susceptible to challenges associated with object disappearance or occlusion, due to potentially inaccurate segmentation results in memory. To address these problems, we present MoSAM, incorporating two key strategies to integrate object motion cues into the model and establish more reliable feature memory. Firstly, we propose Motion-Guided Prompting (MGP), which represents the object motion in both sparse and dense manners, then injects them into SAM2 through a set of motion-guided prompts. MGP enables the model to adjust its focus towards the direction of motion, thereby enhancing the object tracking capabilities. Furthermore, acknowledging that past segmentation results may be inaccurate, we devise a Spatial-Temporal Memory Selection (ST-MS) mechanism that dynamically identifies frames likely to contain accurate segmentation in both pixel- and frame-level. By eliminating potentially inaccurate mask predictions from memory, we can leverage more reliable memory features to exploit similar regions for improving segmentation results. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks of video object segmentation and video instance segmentation demonstrate that our MoSAM achieves state-of-the-art results compared to other competitors.</p></details> |  |
| **[SpaRE: Enhancing Spatial Reasoning in Vision-Language Models with Synthetic Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20648v1)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) work well in tasks ranging from image captioning to visual question answering (VQA), yet they struggle with spatial reasoning, a key skill for understanding our physical world that humans excel at. We find that spatial relations are generally rare in widely used VL datasets, with only a few being well represented, while most form a long tail of underrepresented relations. This gap leaves VLMs ill-equipped to handle diverse spatial relationships. To bridge it, we construct a synthetic VQA dataset focused on spatial reasoning generated from hyper-detailed image descriptions in Localized Narratives, DOCCI, and PixMo-Cap. Our dataset consists of 455k samples containing 3.4 million QA pairs. Trained on this dataset, our Spatial-Reasoning Enhanced (SpaRE) VLMs show strong improvements on spatial reasoning benchmarks, achieving up to a 49% performance gain on the What's Up benchmark, while maintaining strong results on general tasks. Our work narrows the gap between human and VLM spatial reasoning and makes VLMs more capable in real-world tasks such as robotics and navigation.</p></details> |  |
| **[LiLIS: Enhancing Big Spatial Data Processing with Lightweight Distributed Learned Index](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18883v2)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The efficient management of big spatial data is crucial for location-based services, particularly in smart cities. However, existing systems such as Simba and Sedona, which incorporate distributed spatial indexing, still incur substantial index construction overheads, rendering them far from optimal for real-time analytics. Recent studies demonstrate that learned indices can achieve high efficiency through well-designed machine learning models, but how to design a learned index for distributed spatial analytics remains unaddressed. In this paper, we present LiLIS, a Lightweight Distributed Learned Index for big spatial data. LiLIS combines machine-learned search strategies with spatial-aware partitioning within a distributed framework, and efficiently implements common spatial queries, including point query, range query, k-nearest neighbors (kNN), and spatial joins. Extensive experimental results over real-world and synthetic datasets show that LiLIS outperforms state-of-the-art big spatial data analytics by $2-3$ orders of magnitude for most spatial queries, and the index building achieves $1.5-2\times$ speed-up. The code is available at https://github.com/SWUFE-DB-Group/learned-index-spark.</p></details> |  |
| **[A spatial-correlated multitask linear mixed-effects model for imaging genetics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04530v3)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imaging genetics aims to uncover the hidden relationship between imaging quantitative traits (QTs) and genetic markers (e.g. single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)), and brings valuable insights into the pathogenesis of complex diseases, such as cancers and cognitive disorders (e.g. the Alzheimer's Disease). However, most linear models in imaging genetics didn't explicitly model the inner relationship among QTs, which might miss some potential efficiency gains from information borrowing across brain regions. In this work, we developed a novel Bayesian regression framework for identifying significant associations between QTs and genetic markers while explicitly modeling spatial dependency between QTs, with the main contributions as follows. Firstly, we developed a spatial-correlated multitask linear mixed-effects model (LMM) to account for dependencies between QTs. We incorporated a population-level mixed effects term into the model, taking full advantage of the dependent structure of brain imaging-derived QTs. Secondly, we implemented the model in the Bayesian framework and derived a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to achieve the model inference. Further, we incorporated the MCMC samples with the Cauchy combination test (CCT) to examine the association between SNPs and QTs, which avoided computationally intractable multi-test issues. The simulation studies indicated improved power of our proposed model compared to classic models where inner dependencies of QTs were not modeled. We also applied the new spatial model to an imaging dataset obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database.</p></details> | 32 pages, 5 figures |
| **[ISDrama: Immersive Spatial Drama Generation through Multimodal Prompting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20630v1)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal immersive spatial drama generation focuses on creating continuous multi-speaker binaural speech with dramatic prosody based on multimodal prompts, with potential applications in AR, VR, and others. This task requires simultaneous modeling of spatial information and dramatic prosody based on multimodal inputs, with high data collection costs. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first attempt to address these challenges. We construct MRSDrama, the first multimodal recorded spatial drama dataset, containing binaural drama audios, scripts, videos, geometric poses, and textual prompts. Then, we propose ISDrama, the first immersive spatial drama generation model through multimodal prompting. ISDrama comprises these primary components: 1) Multimodal Pose Encoder, based on contrastive learning, considering the Doppler effect caused by moving speakers to extract unified pose information from multimodal prompts. 2) Immersive Drama Transformer, a flow-based mamba-transformer model that generates high-quality drama, incorporating Drama-MOE to select proper experts for enhanced prosody and pose control. We also design a context-consistent classifier-free guidance strategy to coherently generate complete drama. Experimental results show that ISDrama outperforms baseline models on objective and subjective metrics. The demos and dataset are available at https://aaronz345.github.io/ISDramaDemo.</p></details> |  |
| **[MambaMoE: Mixture-of-Spectral-Spatial-Experts State Space Model for Hyperspectral Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20509v1)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Mamba model has recently demonstrated strong potential in hyperspectral image (HSI) classification, owing to its ability to perform context modeling with linear computational complexity. However, existing Mamba-based methods usually neglect the spectral and spatial directional characteristics related to heterogeneous objects in hyperspectral scenes, leading to limited classification performance. To address these issues, we propose MambaMoE, a novel spectral-spatial mixture-of-experts framework, representing the first MoE-based approach in the HSI classification community. Specifically, we design a Mixture of Mamba Expert Block (MoMEB) that leverages sparse expert activation to enable adaptive spectral-spatial modeling. Furthermore, we introduce an uncertainty-guided corrective learning (UGCL) strategy to encourage the model's attention toward complex regions prone to prediction ambiguity. Extensive experiments on multiple public HSI benchmarks demonstrate that MambaMoE achieves state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and efficiency compared to existing advanced approaches, especially for Mamba-based methods. Code will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[SFIBA: Spatial-based Full-target Invisible Backdoor Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21052v1)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-target backdoor attacks pose significant security threats to deep neural networks, as they can preset multiple target classes through a single backdoor injection. This allows attackers to control the model to misclassify poisoned samples with triggers into any desired target class during inference, exhibiting superior attack performance compared with conventional backdoor attacks. However, existing multi-target backdoor attacks fail to guarantee trigger specificity and stealthiness in black-box settings, resulting in two main issues. First, they are unable to simultaneously target all classes when only training data can be manipulated, limiting their effectiveness in realistic attack scenarios. Second, the triggers often lack visual imperceptibility, making poisoned samples easy to detect. To address these problems, we propose a Spatial-based Full-target Invisible Backdoor Attack, called SFIBA. It restricts triggers for different classes to specific local spatial regions and morphologies in the pixel space to ensure specificity, while employing a frequency-domain-based trigger injection method to guarantee stealthiness. Specifically, for injection of each trigger, we first apply fast fourier transform to obtain the amplitude spectrum of clean samples in local spatial regions. Then, we employ discrete wavelet transform to extract the features from the amplitude spectrum and use singular value decomposition to integrate the trigger. Subsequently, we selectively filter parts of the trigger in pixel space to implement trigger morphology constraints and adjust injection coefficients based on visual effects. We conduct experiments on multiple datasets and models. The results demonstrate that SFIBA can achieve excellent attack performance and stealthiness, while preserving the model's performance on benign samples, and can also bypass existing backdoor defenses.</p></details> |  |
| **[STAA-SNN: Spatial-Temporal Attention Aggregator for Spiking Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02689v3)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have gained significant attention due to their biological plausibility and energy efficiency, making them promising alternatives to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). However, the performance gap between SNNs and ANNs remains a substantial challenge hindering the widespread adoption of SNNs. In this paper, we propose a Spatial-Temporal Attention Aggregator SNN (STAA-SNN) framework, which dynamically focuses on and captures both spatial and temporal dependencies. First, we introduce a spike-driven self-attention mechanism specifically designed for SNNs. Additionally, we pioneeringly incorporate position encoding to integrate latent temporal relationships into the incoming features. For spatial-temporal information aggregation, we employ step attention to selectively amplify relevant features at different steps. Finally, we implement a time-step random dropout strategy to avoid local optima. As a result, STAA-SNN effectively captures both spatial and temporal dependencies, enabling the model to analyze complex patterns and make accurate predictions. The framework demonstrates exceptional performance across diverse datasets and exhibits strong generalization capabilities.

However, traditional endoscopic imaging often struggles with accurate polyp localization and lacks comprehensive contextual awareness, which can limit the explainability of diagnoses. To address these issues, we propose the Dynamic Contextual Attention Network (DCAN). This novel approach transforms spatial representations into adaptive contextual insights, using an attention mechanism that enhances focus on critical polyp regions without explicit localization modules. By integrating contextual awareness into the classification process, DCAN improves decision interpretability and overall diagnostic performance. This advancement in imaging could lead to more reliable colorectal cancer detection, enabling better patient outcomes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 47th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC) 2025</p></details> |

However, these methods typically perform spatial reasoning in an implicit manner, and it remains underexplored whether the acquired 3D knowledge generalizes to unseen question types at any stage of the training. In this work we introduce SpatialReasoner, a novel large vision-language model (LVLM) that address 3D spatial reasoning with explicit 3D representations shared between stages -- 3D perception, computation, and reasoning. Explicit 3D representations provide a coherent interface that supports advanced 3D spatial reasoning and enable us to study the factual errors made by LVLMs. Results show that our SpatialReasoner achieve improved performance on a variety of spatial reasoning benchmarks and generalizes better when evaluating on novel 3D spatial reasoning questions. Our study bridges the 3D parsing capabilities of prior visual foundation models with the powerful reasoning abilities of large language models, opening new directions for 3D spatial reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://spatial-reasoner.github.io</p></details> |

To address this gap, we propose a novel generalized linear model to analyze such that using a von Mises Fisher (vMF) distributed error structure. Using a novel link function that relies on the transformation between Cartesian and spherical coordinates, we regress the vMF-distributed directional data on the external covariates. This regression model enables us to quantify the impact of external factors on the observed directional data. Furthermore, we impose the spatial dependence using an autoregressive model, appropriately accounting for the directional dependence in the outcome. This novel specification renders computational efficiency and flexibility. In addition, a comprehensive Bayesian inferential toolbox is thoroughly developed and applied to our analysis. Subsequently, employing our regression model on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data, we gain new insights into the relationship between cognitive impairment and the orientations of brain fibers, along with examining empirical efficacy through simulation experiments. The code for implementing our proposed method is available on GitHub: https://github.com/lanzhouBWH/Spatial_VMF_Regression.</p></details> |  |
| **[STCOcc: Sparse Spatial-Temporal Cascade Renovation for 3D Occupancy and Scene Flow Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19749v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D occupancy and scene flow offer a detailed and dynamic representation of 3D scene. Recognizing the sparsity and complexity of 3D space, previous vision-centric methods have employed implicit learning-based approaches to model spatial and temporal information. However, these approaches struggle to capture local details and diminish the model's spatial discriminative ability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel explicit state-based modeling method designed to leverage the occupied state to renovate the 3D features. Specifically, we propose a sparse occlusion-aware attention mechanism, integrated with a cascade refinement strategy, which accurately renovates 3D features with the guidance of occupied state information. Additionally, we introduce a novel method for modeling long-term dynamic interactions, which reduces computational costs and preserves spatial information. Compared to the previous state-of-the-art methods, our efficient explicit renovation strategy not only delivers superior performance in terms of RayIoU and mAVE for occupancy and scene flow prediction but also markedly reduces GPU memory usage during training, bringing it down to 8.7GB.

| **[GPA-RAM: Grasp-Pretraining Augmented Robotic Attention Mamba for Spatial Task Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19683v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most existing robot manipulation methods prioritize task learning by enhancing perception through complex deep network architectures. However, they face challenges in real-time collision-free planning. Hence, Robotic Attention Mamba (RAM) is designed for refined planning. Specifically, by integrating Mamba and parallel single-view attention, RAM aligns multi-view vision and task-related language features, ensuring efficient fine-grained task planning with linear complexity and robust real-time performance. Nevertheless, it has the potential for further improvement in high-precision grasping and manipulation. Thus, Grasp-Pretraining Augmentation (GPA) is devised, with a grasp pose feature extractor pretrained utilizing object grasp poses directly inherited from whole-task demonstrations. Subsequently, the extracted grasp features are fused with the spatially aligned planning features from RAM through attention-based Pre-trained Location Fusion, preserving high-resolution grasping cues overshadowed by an overemphasis on global planning. To summarize, we propose Grasp-Pretraining Augmented Robotic Attention Mamba (GPA-RAM), dividing spatial task learning into RAM for planning skill learning and GPA for grasping skill learning. GPA-RAM demonstrates superior performance across three robot systems with distinct camera configurations in simulation and the real world. Compared with previous state-of-the-art methods, it improves the absolute success rate by 8.2% (from 79.3% to 87.5%) on the RLBench multi-task benchmark and 40\% (from 16% to 56%), 12% (from 86% to 98%) on the ALOHA bimanual manipulation tasks, while delivering notably faster inference. Furthermore, experimental results demonstrate that both RAM and GPA enhance task learning, with GPA proving robust to different architectures of pretrained grasp pose feature extractors.

| **[Generalizing Egocentric Temporal Neighborhoods to probe for spatial correlations in temporal networks and infer their topology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16070v2)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motifs are thought to be some fundamental components of social face-to-face interaction temporal networks. However, the motifs previously considered are either limited to a handful of nodes and edges, or do not include triangles, which are thought to be of critical relevance to understand the dynamics of social systems. Thus, we introduce a new class of motifs, that include these triangles, are not limited in their number of nodes or edges, and yet can be mined efficiently in any temporal network. Referring to these motifs as the edge-centered motifs, we show analytically how they subsume the Egocentric Temporal Neighborhoods motifs of the literature. We also confirm in empirical data that the edge-centered motifs bring relevant information with respect to the Egocentric motifs by using a principle of maximum entropy. Then, we show how mining for the edge-centered motifs in a network can be used to probe for spatial correlations in the underlying dynamics that have produced that network. We deduce an approximate formula for the distribution of the edge-centered motifs in empirical networks of social face-to-face interactions. In the last section of this paper, we explore how the statistics of the edge-centered motifs can be used to infer the complete topology of the network they were sampled from. This leads to the needs of mathematical development, that we inaugurate here under the name of graph tiling theory.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bullet: Boosting GPU Utilization for LLM Serving via Dynamic Spatial-Temporal Orchestration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19516v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern LLM serving systems confront inefficient GPU utilization due to the fundamental mismatch between compute-intensive prefill and memory-bound decode phases. While current practices attempt to address this by organizing these phases into hybrid batches, such solutions create an inefficient tradeoff that sacrifices either throughput or latency, leaving substantial GPU resources underutilized. We identify two key root causes: 1) the prefill phase suffers from suboptimal compute utilization due to wave quantization and attention bottlenecks. 2) hybrid batches disproportionately prioritize latency over throughput, resulting in wasted compute and memory bandwidth. To mitigate the issues, we present Bullet, a novel spatial-temporal orchestration system that eliminates these inefficiencies through precise phase coordination. Bullet enables concurrent execution of prefill and decode phases, while dynamically provisioning GPU resources using real-time performance modeling. By integrating SLO-aware scheduling and adaptive resource allocation, Bullet maximizes utilization without compromising latency targets. Experimental evaluations on real-world workloads demonstrate that Bullet delivers 1.26x average throughput gains (up to 1.55x) over state-of-the-arts, while consistently meeting latency constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[Frequency Domain Resampling for Gridded Spatial Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19337v1)** | 2025-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In frequency domain analysis for spatial data, spectral averages based on the periodogram often play an important role in understanding spatial covariance structure, but also have complicated sampling distributions due to complex variances from aggregated periodograms. In order to nonparametrically approximate these sampling distributions for purposes of inference, resampling can be useful, but previous developments in spatial bootstrap have faced challenges in the scope of their validity, specifically due to issues in capturing the complex variances of spatial spectral averages. As a consequence, existing frequency domain bootstraps for spatial data are highly restricted in application to only special processes (e.g. Gaussian) or certain spatial statistics. To address this limitation and to approximate a wide range of spatial spectral averages, we propose a practical hybrid-resampling approach that combines two different resampling techniques in the forms of spatial subsampling and spatial bootstrap. Subsampling helps to capture the variance of spectral averages while bootstrap captures the distributional shape. The hybrid resampling procedure can then accurately quantify uncertainty in spectral inference under mild spatial assumptions. Moreover, compared to the more studied time series setting, this work fills a gap in the theory of subsampling/bootstrap for spatial data regarding spectral average statistics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial-Sign based High dimensional Change Point Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19306v1)** | 2025-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-dimensional changepoint inference, adaptable to diverse alternative scenarios, has attracted significant attention in recent years. In this paper, we propose an adaptive and robust approach to changepoint testing. Specifically, by generalizing the classical mean-based cumulative sum (CUSUM) statistic, we construct CUSUM statistics based on spatial medians and spatial signs. We introduce test statistics that consider the maximum and summation of the CUSUM statistics across different dimensions, respectively, and take the maximum across all potential changepoint locations. The asymptotic distributions of test statistics under the null hypothesis are derived. Furthermore, the test statistics exhibit asymptotic independence under mild conditions. Building on these results, we propose an adaptive testing procedure that combines the max-$L_\infty$-type and max-$L_2$-type statistics to achieve high power under both sparse and dense alternatives. Through numerical experiments and theoretical analysis, the proposed method demonstrates strong performance and exhibits robustness across a wide range of signal sparsity levels and heavy-tailed distributions.</p></details> |  |
| **[RadioFormer: A Multiple-Granularity Radio Map Estimation Transformer with 1\textpertenthousand Spatial Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19161v1)** | 2025-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The task of radio map estimation aims to generate a dense representation of electromagnetic spectrum quantities, such as the received signal strength at each grid point within a geographic region, based on measurements from a subset of spatially distributed nodes (represented as pixels). Recently, deep vision models such as the U-Net have been adapted to radio map estimation, whose effectiveness can be guaranteed with sufficient spatial observations (typically 0.01% to 1% of pixels) in each map, to model local dependency of observed signal power. However, such a setting of sufficient measurements can be less practical in real-world scenarios, where extreme sparsity in spatial sampling can be widely encountered. To address this challenge, we propose RadioFormer, a novel multiple-granularity transformer designed to handle the constraints posed by spatial sparse observations. Our RadioFormer, through a dual-stream self-attention (DSA) module, can respectively discover the correlation of pixel-wise observed signal power and also learn patch-wise buildings' geometries in a style of multiple granularities, which are integrated into multi-scale representations of radio maps by a cross stream cross-attention (CCA) module. Extensive experiments on the public RadioMapSeer dataset demonstrate that RadioFormer outperforms state-of-the-art methods in radio map estimation while maintaining the lowest computational cost. Furthermore, the proposed approach exhibits exceptional generalization capabilities and robust zero-shot performance, underscoring its potential to advance radio map estimation in a more practical setting with very limited observation nodes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sparse VideoGen: Accelerating Video Diffusion Transformers with Spatial-Temporal Sparsity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01776v2)** | 2025-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) dominate video generation but their high computational cost severely limits real-world applicability, usually requiring tens of minutes to generate a few seconds of video even on high-performance GPUs. This inefficiency primarily arises from the quadratic computational complexity of 3D Full Attention with respect to the context length. In this paper, we propose a training-free framework termed Sparse VideoGen (SVG) that leverages the inherent sparsity in 3D Full Attention to boost inference efficiency. We reveal that the attention heads can be dynamically classified into two groups depending on distinct sparse patterns: (1) Spatial Head, where only spatially-related tokens within each frame dominate the attention output, and (2) Temporal Head, where only temporally-related tokens across different frames dominate. Based on this insight, SVG proposes an online profiling strategy to capture the dynamic sparse patterns and predicts the type of attention head. Combined with a novel hardware-efficient tensor layout transformation and customized kernel implementations, SVG achieves up to 2.28x and 2.33x end-to-end speedup on CogVideoX-v1.5 and HunyuanVideo, respectively, while preserving generation quality.

We show that this approximate posterior retains the rate of recovery of the full data posterior distribution, where the rate of recovery adapts to the smoothness of the true regression function. As particular examples we consider Gaussian process priors based on integrated Brownian motion and the Mat\'ern kernel augmented with a prior on the length scale. Besides theoretical guarantees we present a numerical study of the methods both on synthetic and real world data. We also propose a new aggregation technique, which numerically outperforms previous approaches. Finally, we demonstrate empirically that spatially distributed methods can adapt to local regularities, potentially outperforming the original Gaussian process.</p></details> | 90 pages, 6 figures |

However, they either struggle to capture pose-dependent appearance details with a single MLP, or rely on a computationally intensive neural network to reconstruct high-fidelity appearance but with rendering performance degraded to non-real-time. We propose a novel Gaussian human avatar representation that can reconstruct high-fidelity pose-dependence appearance with details and meanwhile can be rendered in real time. Our Gaussian avatar is empowered by spatially distributed MLPs which are explicitly located on different positions on human body. The parameters stored in each Gaussian are obtained by interpolating from the outputs of its nearby MLPs based on their distances. To avoid undesired smooth Gaussian property changing during interpolation, for each Gaussian we define a set of Gaussian offset basis, and a linear combination of basis represents the Gaussian property offsets relative to the neutral properties. Then we propose to let the MLPs output a set of coefficients corresponding to the basis. In this way, although Gaussian coefficients are derived from interpolation and change smoothly, the Gaussian offset basis is learned freely without constraints. The smoothly varying coefficients combined with freely learned basis can still produce distinctly different Gaussian property offsets, allowing the ability to learn high-frequency spatial signals. We further use control points to constrain the Gaussians distributed on a surface layer rather than allowing them to be irregularly distributed inside the body, to help the human avatar generalize better when animated under novel poses. Compared to the state-of-the-art method, our method achieves better appearance quality with finer details while the rendering speed is significantly faster under novel views and novel poses.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

| **[GeoConformal prediction: a model-agnostic framework of measuring the uncertainty of spatial prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08661v3)** | 2025-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial prediction is a fundamental task in geography. In recent years, with advances in geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI), numerous models have been developed to improve the accuracy of geographic variable predictions. Beyond achieving higher accuracy, it is equally important to obtain predictions with uncertainty measures to enhance model credibility and support responsible spatial prediction. Although geostatistic methods like Kriging offer some level of uncertainty assessment, such as Kriging variance, these measurements are not always accurate and lack general applicability to other spatial models. To address this issue, we propose a model-agnostic uncertainty assessment method called GeoConformal Prediction, which incorporates geographical weighting into conformal prediction. We applied it to two classic spatial prediction cases, spatial regression and spatial interpolation, to evaluate its reliability. First, in the spatial regression case, we used XGBoost to predict housing prices, followed by GeoConformal to calculate uncertainty. Our results show that GeoConformal achieved a coverage rate of 93.67%, while Bootstrap methods only reached a maximum coverage of 81.00% after 2000 runs. Next, we applied GeoConformal to spatial interpolation models. We found that the uncertainty obtained from GeoConformal aligned closely with the variance in Kriging. Finally, using GeoConformal, we analyzed the sources of uncertainty in spatial prediction. We found that explicitly including local features in AI models can significantly reduce prediction uncertainty, especially in areas with strong local dependence. Our findings suggest that GeoConformal holds potential not only for geographic knowledge discovery but also for guiding the design of future GeoAI models, paving the way for more reliable and interpretable spatial prediction frameworks.</p></details> |  |

We introduce spatial speech translation, a novel concept for hearables that translate speakers in the wearer's environment, while maintaining the direction and unique voice characteristics of each speaker in the binaural output. To achieve this, we tackle several technical challenges spanning blind source separation, localization, real-time expressive translation, and binaural rendering to preserve the speaker directions in the translated audio, while achieving real-time inference on the Apple M2 silicon. Our proof-of-concept evaluation with a prototype binaural headset shows that, unlike existing models, which fail in the presence of interference, we achieve a BLEU score of up to 22.01 when translating between languages, despite strong interference from other speakers in the environment. User studies further confirm the system's effectiveness in spatially rendering the translated speech in previously unseen real-world reverberant environments. Taking a step back, this work marks the first step towards integrating spatial perception into speech translation.</p></details> | Accepted by CHI2025 |

However, this task is often challenging due to the diversity of scenes, large number of fine-grained objects, and complex free-form nature of language references. Furthermore, in the 3D domain, obtaining large amounts of natural language training data is difficult. Thus, it is important for methods to learn from little data and zero-shot generalize to new environments. To address these challenges, we propose SORT3D, an approach that utilizes rich object attributes from 2D data and merges a heuristics-based spatial reasoning toolbox with the ability of large language models (LLMs) to perform sequential reasoning. Importantly, our method does not require text-to-3D data for training and can be applied zero-shot to unseen environments. We show that SORT3D achieves state-of-the-art performance on complex view-dependent grounding tasks on two benchmarks. We also implement the pipeline to run real-time on an autonomous vehicle and demonstrate that our approach can be used for object-goal navigation on previously unseen real-world environments.

In this work, we present a novel system architecture that incorporates spatial speech understanding into LLMs, enabling contextually aware and adaptive applications for wearable technologies. Our approach leverages microstructure-based spatial sensing to extract precise Direction of Arrival (DoA) information using a monaural microphone. To address the lack of existing dataset for microstructure-assisted speech recordings, we synthetically create a dataset called OmniTalk by using the LibriSpeech dataset. This spatial information is fused with linguistic embeddings from OpenAI's Whisper model, allowing each modality to learn complementary contextual representations. The fused embeddings are aligned with the input space of LLaMA-3.2 3B model and fine-tuned with lightweight adaptation technique LoRA to optimize for on-device processing. SING supports spatially-aware automatic speech recognition (ASR), achieving a mean error of $25.72^\circ$-a substantial improvement compared to the 88.52$^\circ$ median error in existing work-with a word error rate (WER) of 5.3. SING also supports soundscaping, for example, inference how many people were talking and their directions, with up to 5 people and a median DoA error of 16$^\circ$. Our system demonstrates superior performance in spatial speech understanding while addressing the challenges of power efficiency, privacy, and hardware constraints, paving the way for advanced applications in augmented reality, accessibility, and immersive experiences.</p></details> |  |

We present a spatial reasoning framework that bridges geometric facts with symbolic predicates and relations to handle key tasks such as determining how 3D objects are arranged among each other ('on', 'behind', 'near', etc.). Its foundation relies on oriented 3D bounding box representations, enhanced by a comprehensive set of spatial predicates, ranging from topology and connectivity to directionality and orientation, expressed in a formalism related to natural language. The derived predicates form a spatial knowledge graph and, in combination with a pipeline-based inference model, enable spatial queries and dynamic rule evaluation. Implementations for client- and server-side processing demonstrate the framework's capability to efficiently translate geometric data into actionable knowledge, ensuring scalable and technology-independent spatial reasoning in complex 3D environments. The Spatial Reasoner framework is fostering the creation of spatial ontologies, and seamlessly integrates with and therefore enriches machine learning, natural language processing, and rule systems in XR applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, preprint of ICVARS 2025 paper</p></details> |

Compared to previous work, our Flow MAtching Postprocessing (FMAP) better represents the correlation structures of the observations distribution, while also improving marginal performance at the stations. FMAP generates forecasts that are not bound to what is already modeled by the underlying gridded prediction and can infer new correlation structures from data. The resulting model can generate an arbitrary number of forecasts from a limited number of numerical simulations, allowing for low-cost forecasting systems. A single training is sufficient to perform postprocessing at multiple lead times, in contrast with other methods which use multiple trained networks at generation time. This work details our methodology, including a spatial attention transformer backbone trained within a flow matching generative modeling framework. FMAP shows promising performance in experiments on the EUPPBench dataset, forecasting surface temperature and wind gust values at station locations in western Europe up to five-day lead times.</p></details> | 26 pages, 7 figures |

However, conventional MIL methods such as Attention-Based Deep Multiple Instance Learning (ABMIL) typically disregard spatial interactions among patches that are crucial to pathological diagnosis. Recent advancements, such as Transformer based MIL (TransMIL), have incorporated spatial context and inter-patch relationships. However, it remains unclear whether explicitly modeling patch relationships yields similar performance gains in ABMIL, which relies solely on Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). In contrast, TransMIL employs Transformer-based layers, introducing a fundamental architectural shift at the cost of substantially increased computational complexity. In this work, we enhance the ABMIL framework by integrating interaction-aware representations to address this question. Our proposed model, Global ABMIL (GABMIL), explicitly captures inter-instance dependencies while preserving computational efficiency. Experimental results on two publicly available datasets for tumor subtyping in breast and lung cancers demonstrate that GABMIL achieves up to a 7 percentage point improvement in AUPRC and a 5 percentage point increase in the Kappa score over ABMIL, with minimal or no additional computational overhead. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating patch interactions within MIL frameworks.

| **[RSRNav: Reasoning Spatial Relationship for Image-Goal Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17991v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent image-goal navigation (ImageNav) methods learn a perception-action policy by separately capturing semantic features of the goal and egocentric images, then passing them to a policy network. However, challenges remain: (1) Semantic features often fail to provide accurate directional information, leading to superfluous actions, and (2) performance drops significantly when viewpoint inconsistencies arise between training and application. To address these challenges, we propose RSRNav, a simple yet effective method that reasons spatial relationships between the goal and current observations as navigation guidance. Specifically, we model the spatial relationship by constructing correlations between the goal and current observations, which are then passed to the policy network for action prediction. These correlations are progressively refined using fine-grained cross-correlation and direction-aware correlation for more precise navigation. Extensive evaluation of RSRNav on three benchmark datasets demonstrates superior navigation performance, particularly in the "user-matched goal" setting, highlighting its potential for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

They have demonstrated excellent performance in multiple domains involving graph-structured data. However, an important category of learning tasks, namely link weight prediction, has received less emphasis due to its increased complexity compared to binary link classification. Link weight prediction becomes even more challenging when considering multilayer networks, where nodes can be interconnected across multiple layers. To address these challenges, we propose a new method named Multiplex Spatial Graph Convolution Network (MSGCN), which spatially embeds information across multiple layers to predict interlayer link weights. The MSGCN model generalizes spatial graph convolution to multiplex networks and captures the geometric structure of nodes across multiple layers. Extensive experiments using data with known interlayer link information show that the MSGCN model has robust, accurate, and generalizable link weight prediction performance across a wide variety of multiplex network structures.</p></details> |  |

This problem is important for many applications, such as oncology, for analyzing immune-tumor relationships and designing new immunotherapies. It is challenging due to spatial variability and interpretability needs. Previously proposed techniques require dense training data or have limited ability to handle significant spatial variability within a single place-type. Most importantly, these deep neural network (DNN) approaches are not designed to work in non-Euclidean space, particularly point sets. Existing non-Euclidean DNN methods are limited to one-size-fits-all approaches. We explore a spatial ensemble framework that explicitly uses different training strategies, including weighted-distance learning rate and spatial domain adaptation, on various place-types for spatially-lucid classification. Experimental results on real-world datasets (e.g., MxIF oncology data) show that the proposed framework provides higher prediction accuracy than baseline methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>SIAM ...</summary><p>SIAM International Conference on Data Mining (SDM24)</p></details> |

To address these challenges, we propose the StereoMamba architecture, which is specifically designed for stereo disparity estimation in RAMIS. Our approach is based on a novel Feature Extraction Mamba (FE-Mamba) module, which enhances long-range spatial dependencies both within and across stereo images. To effectively integrate multi-scale features from FE-Mamba, we then introduce a novel Multidimensional Feature Fusion (MFF) module. Experiments against the state-of-the-art on the ex-vivo SCARED benchmark demonstrate that StereoMamba achieves superior performance on EPE of 2.64 px and depth MAE of 2.55 mm, the second-best performance on Bad2 of 41.49% and Bad3 of 26.99%, while maintaining an inference speed of 21.28 FPS for a pair of high-resolution images (1280*1024), striking the optimum balance between accuracy, robustness, and efficiency. Furthermore, by comparing synthesized right images, generated from warping left images using the generated disparity maps, with the actual right image, StereoMamba achieves the best average SSIM (0.8970) and PSNR (16.0761), exhibiting strong zero-shot generalization on the in-vivo RIS2017 and StereoMIS datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[SPAARC: Spatial Proximity and Association based prefetching for Augmented Reality in edge Cache](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15192v2)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mobile Augmented Reality (MAR) applications face performance challenges due to their high computational demands and need for low-latency responses. Traditional approaches like on-device storage or reactive data fetching from the cloud often result in limited AR experiences or unacceptable lag. Edge caching, which caches AR objects closer to the user, provides a promising solution. However, existing edge caching approaches do not consider AR-specific features such as AR object sizes, user interactions, and physical location. This paper investigates how to further optimize edge caching by employing AR-aware prefetching techniques. We present SPAARC, a Spatial Proximity and Association-based Prefetching policy specifically designed for MAR Caches. SPAARC intelligently prioritizes the caching of virtual objects based on their association with other similar objects and the user's proximity to them. It also considers the recency of associations and uses a lazy fetching strategy to efficiently manage edge resources and maximize Quality of Experience (QoE). Through extensive evaluation using both synthetic and real-world workloads, we demonstrate that SPAARC significantly improves cache hit rates compared to standard caching algorithms, achieving gains ranging from 3% to 40% while reducing the need for on-demand data retrieval from the cloud. Further, we present an adaptive tuning algorithm that automatically tunes SPAARC parameters to achieve optimal performance. Our findings demonstrate the potential of SPAARC to substantially enhance the user experience in MAR applications by ensuring the timely availability of virtual objects.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Generalizable Deepfake Detection with Spatial-Frequency Collaborative Learning and Hierarchical Cross-Modal Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17223v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid evolution of deep generative models poses a critical challenge to deepfake detection, as detectors trained on forgery-specific artifacts often suffer significant performance degradation when encountering unseen forgeries. While existing methods predominantly rely on spatial domain analysis, frequency domain operations are primarily limited to feature-level augmentation, leaving frequency-native artifacts and spatial-frequency interactions insufficiently exploited. To address this limitation, we propose a novel detection framework that integrates multi-scale spatial-frequency analysis for universal deepfake detection. Our framework comprises three key components: (1) a local spectral feature extraction pipeline that combines block-wise discrete cosine transform with cascaded multi-scale convolutions to capture subtle spectral artifacts; (2) a global spectral feature extraction pipeline utilizing scale-invariant differential accumulation to identify holistic forgery distribution patterns; and (3) a multi-stage cross-modal fusion mechanism that incorporates shallow-layer attention enhancement and deep-layer dynamic modulation to model spatial-frequency interactions. Extensive evaluations on widely adopted benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art deepfake detection methods in both accuracy and generalizability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatially-Delineated Domain-Adapted AI Classification: An Application for Oncology Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11695v2)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given multi-type point maps from different place-types (e.g., tumor regions), our objective is to develop a classifier trained on the source place-type to accurately distinguish between two classes of the target place-type based on their point arrangements. This problem is societally important for many applications, such as generating clinical hypotheses for designing new immunotherapies for cancer treatment. The challenge lies in the spatial variability, the inherent heterogeneity and variation observed in spatial properties or arrangements across different locations (i.e., place-types). Previous techniques focus on self-supervised tasks to learn domain-invariant features and mitigate domain differences; however, they often neglect the underlying spatial arrangements among data points, leading to significant discrepancies across different place-types. We explore a novel multi-task self-learning framework that targets spatial arrangements, such as spatial mix-up masking and spatial contrastive predictive coding, for spatially-delineated domain-adapted AI classification. Experimental results on real-world datasets (e.g., oncology data) show that the proposed framework provides higher prediction accuracy than baseline methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian Function-on-Function Regression for Spatial Functional Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08175v3)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial functional data arise in many settings, such as particulate matter curves observed at monitoring stations and age population curves at each areal unit. Most existing functional regression models have limited applicability because they do not consider spatial correlations. Although functional kriging methods can predict the curves at unobserved spatial locations, they are based on variogram fittings rather than constructing hierarchical statistical models. In this manuscript, we propose a Bayesian framework for spatial function-on-function regression that can carry out parameter estimations and predictions. However, the proposed model has computational and inferential challenges because the model needs to account for within and between-curve dependencies. Furthermore, high-dimensional and spatially correlated parameters can lead to the slow mixing of Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms. To address these issues, we first utilize a basis transformation approach to simplify the covariance and apply projection methods for dimension reduction. We also develop a simultaneous band score for the proposed model to detect the significant region in the regression function. We apply our method to both areal and point-level spatial functional data, showing the proposed method is computationally efficient and provides accurate estimations and predictions.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Delayed Acceptance Auxiliary Variable MCMC for Spatial Models with Intractable Likelihood Function](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17147v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A large class of spatial models contains intractable normalizing functions, such as spatial lattice models, interaction spatial point processes, and social network models. Bayesian inference for such models is challenging since the resulting posterior distribution is doubly intractable. Although auxiliary variable MCMC (AVM) algorithms are known to be the most practical, they are computationally expensive due to the repeated auxiliary variable simulations. To address this, we propose delayed-acceptance AVM (DA-AVM) methods, which can reduce the number of auxiliary variable simulations. The first stage of the kernel uses a cheap surrogate to decide whether to accept or reject the proposed parameter value. The second stage guarantees detailed balance with respect to the posterior. The auxiliary variable simulation is performed only on the parameters accepted in the first stage. We construct various surrogates specifically tailored for doubly intractable problems, including subsampling strategy, Gaussian process emulation, and frequentist estimator-based approximation. We validate our method through simulated and real data applications, demonstrating its practicality for complex spatial models.</p></details> |  |

We explore various ways to integrate information from multiple subjects and show improved performance compared to standard CSP. Across three datasets, our method shows marginal improvements over standard CSP; however, when training data are limited, the improvements become more significant.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial Distribution-Shift Aware Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14840v2)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given inputs of diverse soil characteristics and climate data gathered from various regions, we aimed to build a model to predict accurate land emissions. The problem is important since accurate quantification of the carbon cycle in agroecosystems is crucial for mitigating climate change and ensuring sustainable food production. Predicting accurate land emissions is challenging since calibrating the heterogeneous nature of soil properties, moisture, and environmental conditions is hard at decision-relevant scales. Traditional approaches do not adequately estimate land emissions due to location-independent parameters failing to leverage the spatial heterogeneity and also require large datasets. To overcome these limitations, we proposed Spatial Distribution-Shift Aware Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning (SDSA-KGML), which leverages location-dependent parameters that account for significant spatial heterogeneity in soil moisture from multiple sites within the same region. Experimental results demonstrate that SDSA-KGML models achieve higher local accuracy for the specified states in the Midwest Region.</p></details> |  |

However, its effectiveness in video recognition tasks is hampered by two main challenges. First, fast adversarial training for video models remains largely unexplored, which severely impedes its practical applications. Specifically, most video adversarial training methods are computationally costly, with long training times and high expenses. Second, existing methods struggle with the trade-off between clean accuracy and adversarial robustness. To address these challenges, we introduce Video Fast Adversarial Training with Weak-to-Strong consistency (VFAT-WS), the first fast adversarial training method for video data. Specifically, VFAT-WS incorporates the following key designs: First, it integrates a straightforward yet effective temporal frequency augmentation (TF-AUG), and its spatial-temporal enhanced form STF-AUG, along with a single-step PGD attack to boost training efficiency and robustness. Second, it devises a weak-to-strong spatial-temporal consistency regularization, which seamlessly integrates the simpler TF-AUG and the more complex STF-AUG. Leveraging the consistency regularization, it steers the learning process from simple to complex augmentations. Both of them work together to achieve a better trade-off between clean accuracy and robustness. Extensive experiments on UCF-101 and HMDB-51 with both CNN and Transformer-based models demonstrate that VFAT-WS achieves great improvements in adversarial robustness and corruption robustness, while accelerating training by nearly 490%.</p></details> | <details><summary>After...</summary><p>After the submission of the paper, we realized that the study still has room for expansion.

Some research suggests that VLMs can exhibit humanlike scene understanding, while other investigations reveal difficulties in their ability to process relational information. To achieve widespread applicability, VLMs must perform reliably, yielding comparable competence across a wide variety of related tasks. We sought to test how reliable these architectures are at engaging in trivial spatial cognition, e.g., recognizing whether one object is left of another in an uncluttered scene. We developed a benchmark dataset -- TableTest -- whose images depict 3D scenes of objects arranged on a table, and used it to evaluate state-of-the-art VLMs. Results show that performance could be degraded by minor variations of prompts that use logically equivalent descriptions. These analyses suggest limitations in how VLMs may reason about spatial relations in real-world applications. They also reveal novel opportunities for bolstering image caption corpora for more efficient training and testing.</p></details> |  |

| **[Visual Place Cell Encoding: A Computational Model for Spatial Representation and Cognitive Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15953v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents the Visual Place Cell Encoding (VPCE) model, a biologically inspired computational framework for simulating place cell-like activation using visual input. Drawing on evidence that visual landmarks play a central role in spatial encoding, the proposed VPCE model activates visual place cells by clustering high-dimensional appearance features extracted from images captured by a robot-mounted camera. Each cluster center defines a receptive field, and activation is computed based on visual similarity using a radial basis function. We evaluate whether the resulting activation patterns correlate with key properties of biological place cells, including spatial proximity, orientation alignment, and boundary differentiation. Experiments demonstrate that the VPCE can distinguish between visually similar yet spatially distinct locations and adapt to environment changes such as the insertion or removal of walls. These results suggest that structured visual input, even in the absence of motion cues or reward-driven learning, is sufficient to generate place-cell-like spatial representations and support biologically inspired cognitive mapping.</p></details> |  |
| **[Joint leave-group-out cross-validation in Bayesian spatial models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15586v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-validation (CV) is a widely-used method of predictive assessment based on repeated model fits to different subsets of the available data. CV is applicable in a wide range of statistical settings. However, in cases where data are not exchangeable, the design of CV schemes should account for suspected correlation structures within the data. CV scheme designs include the selection of left-out blocks and the choice of scoring function for evaluating predictive performance. This paper focuses on the impact of two scoring strategies for block-wise CV applied to spatial models with Gaussian covariance structures. We investigate, through several experiments, whether evaluating the predictive performance of blocks of left-out observations jointly, rather than aggregating individual (pointwise) predictions, improves model selection performance. Extending recent findings for data with serial correlation (such as time-series data), our experiments suggest that joint scoring reduces the variability of CV estimates, leading to more reliable model selection, particularly when spatial dependence is strong and model differences are subtle.</p></details> |  |
| **[Location-Oriented Sound Event Localization and Detection with Spatial Mapping and Regression Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08365v2)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sound Event Localization and Detection (SELD) combines the Sound Event Detection (SED) with the corresponding Direction Of Arrival (DOA). Recently, adopted event oriented multi-track methods affect the generality in polyphonic environments due to the limitation of the number of tracks. To enhance the generality in polyphonic environments, we propose Spatial Mapping and Regression Localization for SELD (SMRL-SELD). SMRL-SELD segments the 3D spatial space, mapping it to a 2D plane, and a new regression localization loss is proposed to help the results converge toward the location of the corresponding event. SMRL-SELD is location-oriented, allowing the model to learn event features based on orientation. Thus, the method enables the model to process polyphonic sounds regardless of the number of overlapping events. We conducted experiments on STARSS23 and STARSS22 datasets and our proposed SMRL-SELD outperforms the existing SELD methods in overall evaluation and polyphony environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[CAPTURe: Evaluating Spatial Reasoning in Vision Language Models via Occluded Object Counting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15485v1)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recognizing and reasoning about occluded (partially or fully hidden) objects is vital to understanding visual scenes, as occlusions frequently occur in real-world environments and act as obstacles for spatial comprehension. To test models' ability to reason about multiple occluded objects, we introduce a novel task, Counting Amodally for Patterns Through Unseen REgions (CAPTURe), which requires a model to count objects arranged in a pattern by inferring how the pattern continues behind an occluder (an object which blocks parts of the scene). CAPTURe requires both recognizing visual patterns and reasoning, making it a useful testbed for evaluating vision-language models (VLMs) on whether they understand occluded patterns and possess spatial understanding skills. By requiring models to reason about occluded objects, CAPTURe also tests VLMs' ability to form world models that would allow them to fill in missing information. CAPTURe consists of two parts: (1) CAPTURe-real, with manually filtered images of real objects in patterns and (2) CAPTURe-synthetic, a controlled diagnostic with generated patterned images. We evaluate four strong VLMs (GPT-4o, Intern-VL2, Molmo, and Qwen2-VL) on CAPTURe, finding that models struggle to count on both occluded and unoccluded patterns. Crucially, we find that models perform worse with occlusion, suggesting that VLMs are also deficient in inferring unseen spatial relationships: even the strongest VLMs like GPT-4o fail to count with occlusion. In contrast, we find that humans achieve very little error on CAPTURe. We also find that providing auxiliary information of occluded object locations increases performance, underscoring that the model error comes both from an inability to handle occlusion as well as difficulty counting in images.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and data: https://github.com/atinpothiraj/CAPTURe</p></details> |

Current surrogate models fall short in the flexibility of point- or region-based predictions as the entire field reconstruction is required for each parameter setting, hence hindering the efficiency of parameter space exploration. Limitations exist in capturing physical attribute distributions and pinpointing optimal parameter configurations. In this work, we propose Explorable INR, a novel implicit neural representation-based surrogate model, designed to facilitate exploration and allow point-based spatial queries without computing full-scale field data. In addition, to further address computational bottlenecks of spatial exploration, we utilize probabilistic affine forms (PAFs) for uncertainty propagation through Explorable INR to obtain statistical summaries, facilitating various ensemble analysis and visualization tasks that are expensive with existing models. Furthermore, we reformulate the parameter exploration problem as optimization tasks using gradient descent and KL divergence minimization that ensures scalability. We demonstrate that the Explorable INR with the proposed approach for spatial and parameter exploration can significantly reduce computation and memory costs while providing effective ensemble analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (TVCG)</p></details> |

While MLLMs have been extensively studied for visual semantic understanding tasks, their ability to perform precise and quantitative spatial-temporal understanding in real-world applications remains largely unexamined, leading to uncertain prospects. To evaluate models' Spatial-Temporal Intelligence, we introduce STI-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' spatial-temporal understanding through challenging tasks such as estimating and predicting the appearance, pose, displacement, and motion of objects. Our benchmark encompasses a wide range of robot and vehicle operations across desktop, indoor, and outdoor scenarios. The extensive experiments reveals that the state-of-the-art MLLMs still struggle in real-world spatial-temporal understanding, especially in tasks requiring precise distance estimation and motion analysis.</p></details> |  |

However, recent studies have exposed critical limitations in their spatial reasoning capabilities. This deficiency in spatial reasoning significantly constrains MLLMs' ability to interact effectively with the physical world, thereby limiting their broader applications. We argue that spatial reasoning capabilities will not naturally emerge from merely scaling existing architectures and training methodologies. Instead, this challenge demands dedicated attention to fundamental modifications in the current MLLM development approach. In this position paper, we first establish a comprehensive framework for spatial reasoning within the context of MLLMs. We then elaborate on its pivotal role in real-world applications. Through systematic analysis, we examine how individual components of the current methodology-from training data to reasoning mechanisms-influence spatial reasoning capabilities. This examination reveals critical limitations while simultaneously identifying promising avenues for advancement. Our work aims to direct the AI research community's attention toward these crucial yet underexplored aspects. By highlighting these challenges and opportunities, we seek to catalyze progress toward achieving human-like spatial reasoning capabilities in MLLMs.</p></details> |  |

To address this limitation, we introduce a novel task, 360V2SA, to generate spatial audio from 360-degree videos, specifically producing First-order Ambisonics (FOA) audio - a standard format for representing 3D spatial audio that captures sound directionality and enables realistic 3D audio reproduction. We first create Sphere360, a novel dataset tailored for this task that is curated from real-world data. We also design an efficient semi-automated pipeline for collecting and cleaning paired video-audio data. To generate spatial audio from 360-degree video, we propose a novel framework OmniAudio, which leverages self-supervised pre-training using both spatial audio data (in FOA format) and large-scale non-spatial data. Furthermore, OmniAudio features a dual-branch framework that utilizes both panoramic and FoV video inputs to capture comprehensive local and global information from 360-degree videos. Experimental results demonstrate that OmniAudio achieves state-of-the-art performance across both objective and subjective metrics on Sphere360. Code and datasets will be released at https://github.com/liuhuadai/OmniAudio. The demo page is available at https://OmniAudio-360V2SA.github.io.</p></details> | Work in Progress |
| **[Backdoor Defense in Diffusion Models via Spatial Attention Unlearning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18563v1)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image diffusion models are increasingly vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where malicious modifications to the training data cause the model to generate unintended outputs when specific triggers are present. While classification models have seen extensive development of defense mechanisms, generative models remain largely unprotected due to their high-dimensional output space, which complicates the detection and mitigation of subtle perturbations. Defense strategies for diffusion models, in particular, remain under-explored. In this work, we propose Spatial Attention Unlearning (SAU), a novel technique for mitigating backdoor attacks in diffusion models. SAU leverages latent space manipulation and spatial attention mechanisms to isolate and remove the latent representation of backdoor triggers, ensuring precise and efficient removal of malicious effects. We evaluate SAU across various types of backdoor attacks, including pixel-based and style-based triggers, and demonstrate its effectiveness in achieving 100% trigger removal accuracy. Furthermore, SAU achieves a CLIP score of 0.7023, outperforming existing methods while preserving the model's ability to generate high-quality, semantically aligned images. Our results show that SAU is a robust, scalable, and practical solution for securing text-to-image diffusion models against backdoor attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Segmentation with Noisy Labels via Spatially Correlated Distributions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14795v1)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In semantic segmentation, the accuracy of models heavily depends on the high-quality annotations. However, in many practical scenarios such as medical imaging and remote sensing, obtaining true annotations is not straightforward and usually requires significant human labor. Relying on human labor often introduces annotation errors, including mislabeling, omissions, and inconsistency between annotators. In the case of remote sensing, differences in procurement time can lead to misaligned ground truth annotations. These label errors are not independently distributed, and instead usually appear in spatially connected regions where adjacent pixels are more likely to share the same errors. To address these issues, we propose an approximate Bayesian estimation based on a probabilistic model that assumes training data includes label errors, incorporating the tendency for these errors to occur with spatial correlations between adjacent pixels. Bayesian inference requires computing the posterior distribution of label errors, which becomes intractable when spatial correlations are present. We represent the correlation of label errors between adjacent pixels through a Gaussian distribution whose covariance is structured by a Kac-Murdock-Szeg\"{o} (KMS) matrix, solving the computational challenges. Through experiments on multiple segmentation tasks, we confirm that leveraging the spatial correlation of label errors significantly improves performance. Notably, in specific tasks such as lung segmentation, the proposed method achieves performance comparable to training with clean labels under moderate noise levels.

However, the high cost, limited coverage, and technical complexity of current ST technologies restrict their widespread use in clinical and research settings, making obtaining high-resolution transcriptomic profiles across large tissue areas challenging. Predicting ST from H\&E-stained histology images has emerged as a promising alternative to address these limitations but remains challenging due to the heterogeneous relationship between histomorphology and gene expression, which is affected by substantial variability across patients and tissue sections. In response, we propose PH2ST, a prompt-guided hypergraph learning framework, which leverages limited ST signals to guide multi-scale histological representation learning for accurate and robust spatial gene expression prediction. Extensive evaluations on two public ST datasets and multiple prompt sampling strategies simulating real-world scenarios demonstrate that PH2ST not only outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, but also shows strong potential for practical applications such as imputing missing spots, ST super-resolution, and local-to-global prediction, highlighting its value for scalable and cost-effective spatial gene expression mapping in biomedical contexts.</p></details> |  |

Traditional solutions typically involve training dedicated models per degradation, resulting in inefficiency and redundancy. More recent approaches either introduce additional modules to learn visual prompts, significantly increasing model size, or incorporate cross-modal transfer from large language models trained on vast datasets, adding complexity to the system architecture. In contrast, our approach, termed AnyIR, takes a unified path that leverages inherent similarity across various degradations to enable both efficient and comprehensive restoration through a joint embedding mechanism, without scaling up the model or relying on large language models.Specifically, we examine the sub-latent space of each input, identifying key components and reweighting them first in a gated manner. To fuse the intrinsic degradation awareness and the contextualized attention, a spatial-frequency parallel fusion strategy is proposed for enhancing spatial-aware local-global interactions and enriching the restoration details from the frequency perspective. Extensive benchmarking in the all-in-one restoration setting confirms AnyIR's SOTA performance, reducing model complexity by around 82\% in parameters and 85\% in FLOPs.

Neural network-based thermal prediction models can perform real-time predictions for many unseen new designs. However, existing CNN-based and GCN-based methods cannot effectively capture the global thermal features, especially for high-frequency components, hindering prediction accuracy enhancement. In this paper, we propose a novel frequency-spatial dual domain aware prediction network (FSA-Heat) for fast and high-accuracy thermal prediction in 2.5D ICs. It integrates high-to-low frequency and spatial domain encoder (FSTE) module with frequency domain cross-scale interaction module (FCIFormer) to achieve high-to-low frequency and global-to-local thermal dissipation feature extraction. Additionally, a frequency-spatial hybrid loss (FSL) is designed to effectively attenuate high-frequency thermal gradient noise and spatial misalignments. The experimental results show that the performance enhancements offered by our proposed method are substantial, outperforming the newly-proposed 2.5D method, GCN+PNA, by considerable margins (over 99% RMSE reduction, 4.23X inference time speedup). Moreover, extensive experiments demonstrate that FSA-Heat also exhibits robust generalization capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures, 22nd Design, Automation and Test in Europe Conference (DATE '25)</p></details> |

This allows models to develop a comprehensive understanding of the 3D scene, enabling their applicability to a broader range of areas, such as autonomous navigation, robotics, and AR/VR. While large multi-modal models (LMMs) have achieved remarkable progress in a wide range of image and video understanding tasks, their capabilities to perform 3D spatial reasoning on diverse natural images are less studied. In this work we present the first comprehensive 3D spatial reasoning benchmark, 3DSRBench, with 2,772 manually annotated visual question-answer pairs across 12 question types. We conduct robust and thorough evaluation of 3D spatial reasoning capabilities by balancing the data distribution and adopting a novel FlipEval strategy. To further study the robustness of 3D spatial reasoning w.r.t. camera 3D viewpoints, our 3DSRBench includes two subsets with 3D spatial reasoning questions on paired images with common and uncommon viewpoints. We benchmark a wide range of open-sourced and proprietary LMMs, uncovering their limitations in various aspects of 3D awareness, such as height, orientation, location, and multi-object reasoning, as well as their degraded performance on images with uncommon camera viewpoints. Our 3DSRBench provide valuable findings and insights about the future development of LMMs with strong 3D reasoning capabilities.

Accurate predictive models rely on high-resolution spatio-temporal data to capture the complex interplay of environmental and anthropogenic factors. To address the lack of localised and fine-grained datasets in Spain, this work introduces IberFire, a spatio-temporal datacube at 1 km x 1 km x 1-day resolution covering mainland Spain and the Balearic Islands from December 2007 to December 2024. IberFire integrates 260 features across eight main categories: auxiliary features, fire history, geography, topography, meteorology, vegetation indices, human activity, and land cover. All features are derived from open-access sources, ensuring transparency and real-time applicability. The data processing pipeline was implemented entirely using open-source tools, and the codebase has been made publicly available. This work not only enhances spatio-temporal granularity and feature diversity compared to existing European datacubes but also provides a reproducible methodology for constructing similar datasets. IberFire supports advanced wildfire risk modelling through Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques, enables climate pattern analysis and informs strategic planning in fire prevention and land management. The dataset is publicly available on Zenodo to promote open research and collaboration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-temporal data fusion of censored threshold exceedances](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20268v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data fusion models are widely used in air quality monitoring to integrate in situ and remote-sensing data, offering spatially complete and temporally detailed estimates. However, traditional Gaussian-based models often underestimate extreme pollution values, leading to biased risk assessments. To address this, we present a Bayesian hierarchical data fusion framework rooted in extreme value theory, using the Dirac-delta generalised Pareto distribution to jointly account for threshold and non-threshold exceedances while preserving the temporal structure of extreme events. Our model is used to describe and predict censored threshold exceedances of PM2.5 pollution in the Greater London region by using remote sensing observations from the EAC4 dataset, a reanalysis product from the Copernicus Atmospheric Monitoring Service (CAMS), and in situ observation stations from the automatic urban and rural network (AURN) ran by the UK government. Some of our approach's key innovations include combining data with varying spatio-temporal resolutions and fully accounting for parameter uncertainties. Results show that our model outperforms Gaussian-based alternatives and standalone remote-sensing data in predicting threshold exceedances at the majority of observation sites and can even result in improved spatial patterns of PM2.5 pollution than those discernible from the remote-sensing data. Moreover, our approach captures greater variability and spatial patterns, such as higher PM2.5 concentrations near coastal areas, which are not evident in remote-sensing data alone.</p></details> |  |
| **[3DPyranet Features Fusion for Spatio-temporal Feature Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18977v1)** | 2025-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Convolutional neural network (CNN) slides a kernel over the whole image to produce an output map. This kernel scheme reduces the number of parameters with respect to a fully connected neural network (NN). While CNN has proven to be an effective model in recognition of handwritten characters and traffic signal sign boards, etc. recently, its deep variants have proven to be effective in similar as well as more challenging applications like object, scene and action recognition. Deep CNN add more layers and kernels to the classical CNN, increasing the number of parameters, and partly reducing the main advantage of CNN which is less parameters. In this paper, a 3D pyramidal neural network called 3DPyraNet and a discriminative approach for spatio-temporal feature learning based on it, called 3DPyraNet-F, are proposed. 3DPyraNet introduces a new weighting scheme which learns features from both spatial and temporal dimensions analyzing multiple adjacent frames and keeping a biological plausible structure. It keeps the spatial topology of the input image and presents fewer parameters and lower computational and memory costs compared to both fully connected NNs and recent deep CNNs. 3DPyraNet-F extract the features maps of the highest layer of the learned network, fuse them in a single vector, and provide it as input in such a way to a linear-SVM classifier that enhances the recognition of human actions and dynamic scenes from the videos. Encouraging results are reported with 3DPyraNet in real-world environments, especially in the presence of camera induced motion. Further, 3DPyraNet-F clearly outperforms the state-of-the-art on three benchmark datasets and shows comparable result for the fourth.</p></details> |  |
| **[STP4D: Spatio-Temporal-Prompt Consistent Modeling for Text-to-4D Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18318v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-4D generation is rapidly developing and widely applied in various scenarios. However, existing methods often fail to incorporate adequate spatio-temporal modeling and prompt alignment within a unified framework, resulting in temporal inconsistencies, geometric distortions, or low-quality 4D content that deviates from the provided texts. Therefore, we propose STP4D, a novel approach that aims to integrate comprehensive spatio-temporal-prompt consistency modeling for high-quality text-to-4D generation. Specifically, STP4D employs three carefully designed modules: Time-varying Prompt Embedding, Geometric Information Enhancement, and Temporal Extension Deformation, which collaborate to accomplish this goal. Furthermore, STP4D is among the first methods to exploit the Diffusion model to generate 4D Gaussians, combining the fine-grained modeling capabilities and the real-time rendering process of 4DGS with the rapid inference speed of the Diffusion model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STP4D excels in generating high-fidelity 4D content with exceptional efficiency (approximately 4.6s per asset), surpassing existing methods in both quality and speed.</p></details> |  |

Multi-sensor synchronous measurement has proven to be more effective for WHAR than using a single sensor. However, existing WHAR methods use shared convolutional kernels for indiscriminate temporal feature extraction across each sensor variable, which fails to effectively capture spatio-temporal relationships of intra-sensor and inter-sensor variables. We propose the DecomposeWHAR model consisting of a decomposition phase and a fusion phase to better model the relationships between modality variables. The decomposition creates high-dimensional representations of each intra-sensor variable through the improved Depth Separable Convolution to capture local temporal features while preserving their unique characteristics. The fusion phase begins by capturing relationships between intra-sensor variables and fusing their features at both the channel and variable levels. Long-range temporal dependencies are modeled using the State Space Model (SSM), and later cross-sensor interactions are dynamically captured through a self-attention mechanism, highlighting inter-sensor spatial correlations. Our model demonstrates superior performance on three widely used WHAR datasets, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art models while maintaining acceptable computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[OmniMamba4D: Spatio-temporal Mamba for longitudinal CT lesion segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09655v2)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate segmentation of longitudinal CT scans is important for monitoring tumor progression and evaluating treatment responses. However, existing 3D segmentation models solely focus on spatial information. To address this gap, we propose OmniMamba4D, a novel segmentation model designed for 4D medical images (3D images over time). OmniMamba4D utilizes a spatio-temporal tetra-orientated Mamba block to effectively capture both spatial and temporal features. Unlike traditional 3D models, which analyze single-time points, OmniMamba4D processes 4D CT data, providing comprehensive spatio-temporal information on lesion progression. Evaluated on an internal dataset comprising of 3,252 CT scans, OmniMamba4D achieves a competitive Dice score of 0.682, comparable to state-of-the-arts (SOTA) models, while maintaining computational efficiency and better detecting disappeared lesions. This work demonstrates a new framework to leverage spatio-temporal information for longitudinal CT lesion segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) 2025</p></details> |
| **[STFM: A Spatio-Temporal Information Fusion Model Based on Phase Space Reconstruction for Sea Surface Temperature Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16970v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The sea surface temperature (SST), a key environmental parameter, is crucial to optimizing production planning, making its accurate prediction a vital research topic. However, the inherent nonlinearity of the marine dynamic system presents significant challenges. Current forecasting methods mainly include physics-based numerical simulations and data-driven machine learning approaches. The former, while describing SST evolution through differential equations, suffers from high computational complexity and limited applicability, whereas the latter, despite its computational benefits, requires large datasets and faces interpretability challenges. This study presents a prediction framework based solely on data-driven techniques. Using phase space reconstruction, we construct initial-delay attractor pairs with a mathematical homeomorphism and design a Spatio-Temporal Fusion Mapping (STFM) to uncover their intrinsic connections. Unlike conventional models, our method captures SST dynamics efficiently through phase space reconstruction and achieves high prediction accuracy with minimal training data in comparative tests</p></details> | 19 pages, 14 figures |
| **[STARS: Sparse Learning Correlation Filter with Spatio-temporal Regularization and Super-resolution Reconstruction for Thermal Infrared Target Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14491v1)** | 2025-04-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Thermal infrared (TIR) target tracking methods often adopt the correlation filter (CF) framework due to its computational efficiency. However, the low resolution of TIR images, along with tracking interference, significantly limits the perfor-mance of TIR trackers. To address these challenges, we introduce STARS, a novel sparse learning-based CF tracker that incorporates spatio-temporal regulari-zation and super-resolution reconstruction. First, we apply adaptive sparse filter-ing and temporal domain filtering to extract key features of the target while reduc-ing interference from background clutter and noise. Next, we introduce an edge-preserving sparse regularization method to stabilize target features and prevent excessive blurring. This regularization integrates multiple terms and employs the alternating direction method of multipliers to optimize the solution. Finally, we propose a gradient-enhanced super-resolution method to extract fine-grained TIR target features and improve the resolution of TIR images, addressing performance degradation in tracking caused by low-resolution sequences. To the best of our knowledge, STARS is the first to integrate super-resolution methods within a sparse learning-based CF framework. Extensive experiments on the LSOTB-TIR, PTB-TIR, VOT-TIR2015, and VOT-TIR2017 benchmarks demonstrate that STARS outperforms state-of-the-art trackers in terms of robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Recognition of Frequencies of Short-Time SSVEP Signals Utilizing an SSCCA-Based Spatio-Spectral Feature Fusion Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14269v1)** | 2025-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A brain-computer interface (BCI) facilitates direct communication between the brain and external equipment through EEG, which is preferred for its superior temporal resolution. Among EEG techniques, the steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) is favored due to its robust signal-to-noise ratio, minimal training demands, and elevated information transmission rate. Frequency detection in SSVEP-based brain-computer interfaces commonly employs canonical correlation analysis (CCA). SSCCA (spatio-spectral canonical correlation analysis) augments CCA by refining spatial filtering. This paper presents a multistage feature fusion methodology for short-duration SSVEP frequency identification, employing SSCCA with template signals derived via leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV). A filterbank generates bandpass filters for stimulus frequencies and their harmonics, whereas SSCCA calculates correlation coefficients between subbands and templates. Two phases of non-linear weighting amalgamate these coefficients to discern the target stimulus. This multistage methodology surpasses traditional techniques, attaining a accuracy of 94.5%.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is presented in the Undergraduate Conference on Intelligent Computing and Systems (UCICS 2025) organised by Varendra University, Rajshahi, Bangladesh, 2025</p></details> |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Fuzzy-oriented Multi-Modal Meta-Learning for Fine-grained Emotion Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13541v3)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-grained emotion recognition (FER) plays a vital role in various fields, such as disease diagnosis, personalized recommendations, and multimedia mining. However, existing FER methods face three key challenges in real-world applications: (i) they rely on large amounts of continuously annotated data to ensure accuracy since emotions are complex and ambiguous in reality, which is costly and time-consuming; (ii) they cannot capture the temporal heterogeneity caused by changing emotion patterns, because they usually assume that the temporal correlation within sampling periods is the same; (iii) they do not consider the spatial heterogeneity of different FER scenarios, that is, the distribution of emotion information in different data may have bias or interference. To address these challenges, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Fuzzy-oriented Multi-modal Meta-learning framework (ST-F2M). Specifically, ST-F2M first divides the multi-modal videos into multiple views, and each view corresponds to one modality of one emotion. Multiple randomly selected views for the same emotion form a meta-training task. Next, ST-F2M uses an integrated module with spatial and temporal convolutions to encode the data of each task, reflecting the spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Then it adds fuzzy semantic information to each task based on generalized fuzzy rules, which helps handle the complexity and ambiguity of emotions. Finally, ST-F2M learns emotion-related general meta-knowledge through meta-recurrent neural networks to achieve fast and robust fine-grained emotion recognition. Extensive experiments show that ST-F2M outperforms various state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and model efficiency. In addition, we construct ablation studies and further analysis to explore why ST-F2M performs well.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[Multimodal Spatio-temporal Graph Learning for Alignment-free RGBT Video Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11779v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>RGB-Thermal Video Object Detection (RGBT VOD) can address the limitation of traditional RGB-based VOD in challenging lighting conditions, making it more practical and effective in many applications. However, similar to most RGBT fusion tasks, it still mainly relies on manually aligned multimodal image pairs. In this paper, we propose a novel Multimodal Spatio-temporal Graph learning Network (MSGNet) for alignment-free RGBT VOD problem by leveraging the robust graph representation learning model. Specifically, we first design an Adaptive Partitioning Layer (APL) to estimate the corresponding regions of the Thermal image within the RGB image (high-resolution), achieving a preliminary inexact alignment. Then, we introduce the Spatial Sparse Graph Learning Module (S-SGLM) which employs a sparse information passing mechanism on the estimated inexact alignment to achieve reliable information interaction between different modalities. Moreover, to fully exploit the temporal cues for RGBT VOD problem, we introduce Hybrid Structured Temporal Modeling (HSTM), which involves a Temporal Sparse Graph Learning Module (T-SGLM) and Temporal Star Block (TSB). T-SGLM aims to filter out some redundant information between adjacent frames by employing the sparse aggregation mechanism on the temporal graph. Meanwhile, TSB is dedicated to achieving the complementary learning of local spatial relationships. Extensive comparative experiments conducted on both the aligned dataset VT-VOD50 and the unaligned dataset UVT-VOD2024 demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method. Our project will be made available on our website for free public access.</p></details> |  |
| **[SPOT: Spatio-Temporal Pattern Mining and Optimization for Load Consolidation in Freight Transportation Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09680v1)** | 2025-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Freight consolidation has significant potential to reduce transportation costs and mitigate congestion and pollution. An effective load consolidation plan relies on carefully chosen consolidation points to ensure alignment with existing transportation management processes, such as driver scheduling, personnel planning, and terminal operations. This complexity represents a significant challenge when searching for optimal consolidation strategies. Traditional optimization-based methods provide exact solutions, but their computational complexity makes them impractical for large-scale instances and they fail to leverage historical data. Machine learning-based approaches address these issues but often ignore operational constraints, leading to infeasible consolidation plans. This work proposes SPOT, an end-to-end approach that integrates the benefits of machine learning (ML) and optimization for load consolidation. The ML component plays a key role in the planning phase by identifying the consolidation points through spatio-temporal clustering and constrained frequent itemset mining, while the optimization selects the most cost-effective feasible consolidation routes for a given operational day. Extensive experiments conducted on industrial load data demonstrate that SPOT significantly reduces travel distance and transportation costs (by about 50% on large terminals) compared to the existing industry-standard load planning strategy and a neighborhood-based heuristic. Moreover, the ML component provides valuable tactical-level insights by identifying frequently recurring consolidation opportunities that guide proactive planning. In addition, SPOT is computationally efficient and can be easily scaled to accommodate large transportation networks.</p></details> |  |

While approaches such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and rule-based reward mechanisms demonstrate promise in text and image domains, their application to video understanding remains limited. This paper presents a systematic exploration of Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) with GRPO for video MLLMs, aiming to enhance spatio-temporal perception while maintaining general capabilities. Our experiments reveal that RFT is highly data-efficient for task-specific improvements. Through multi-task RFT on spatio-temporal perception objectives with limited samples, we develop VideoChat-R1, a powerful video MLLM that achieves state-of-the-art performance on spatio-temporal perception tasks without sacrificing chat ability, while exhibiting emerging spatio-temporal reasoning abilities. Compared to Qwen2.5-VL-7B, VideoChat-R1 boosts performance several-fold in tasks like temporal grounding (+31.8) and object tracking (+31.2). Additionally, it significantly improves on general QA benchmarks such as VideoMME (+0.9), MVBench (+1.0), and Perception Test (+0.9). Our findings underscore the potential of RFT for specialized task enhancement of Video MLLMs. We hope our work offers valuable insights for future RL research in video MLLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Spatio-Temporal Signal Recognition on Edge Devices Using PointLCA-Net](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14585v2)** | 2025-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in machine learning, particularly through deep learning architectures like PointNet, have transformed the processing of three-dimensional (3D) point clouds, significantly improving 3D object classification and segmentation tasks. While 3D point clouds provide detailed spatial information, spatio-temporal signals introduce a dynamic element that accounts for changes over time. However, applying deep learning techniques to spatio-temporal signals and deploying them on edge devices presents challenges, including real-time processing, memory capacity, and power consumption. To address these issues, this paper presents a novel approach that combines PointNet's feature extraction with the in-memory computing capabilities and energy efficiency of neuromorphic systems for spatio-temporal signal recognition. The proposed method consists of a two-stage process: in the first stage, PointNet extracts features from the spatio-temporal signals, which are then stored in non-volatile memristor crossbar arrays. In the second stage, these features are processed by a single-layer spiking neural encoder-decoder that employs the Locally Competitive Algorithm (LCA) for efficient encoding and classification. This work integrates the strengths of both PointNet and LCA, enhancing computational efficiency and energy performance on edge devices. PointLCA-Net achieves high recognition accuracy for spatio-temporal data with substantially lower energy burden during both inference and training than comparable approaches, thus advancing the deployment of advanced neural architectures in energy-constrained environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to International Joint Conference on Neural Networks(IJCNN), 2015</p></details> |

The key challenge of accurate prediction is how to model the complex spatio-temporal dependencies and adapt to the inherent dynamics in data. Traditional Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) often struggle with static adjacency matrices that introduce domain bias or learnable matrices that may be overfitting to specific patterns. This challenge becomes more complex when considering Multi-Task Learning (MTL). While MTL has the potential to enhance prediction accuracy through task synergies, it can also face significant hurdles due to task interference. To overcome these challenges, this study introduces a novel MTL framework, Dynamic Group-wise Spatio-Temporal Multi-Task Learning (DG-STMTL). DG-STMTL proposes a hybrid adjacency matrix generation module that combines static matrices with dynamic ones through a task-specific gating mechanism. We also introduce a group-wise GCN module to enhance the modelling capability of spatio-temporal dependencies. We conduct extensive experiments on two real-world datasets to evaluate our method. Results show that our method outperforms other state-of-the-arts, indicating its effectiveness and robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-resolution filters via linear projection for large spatio-temporal datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05315v3)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advances in compact sensing devices mounted on satellites have facilitated the collection of large spatio-temporal datasets with coordinates. Since such datasets are often incomplete and noisy, it is useful to create the prediction surface of a spatial field. To this end, we consider an online filtering inference by using the Kalman filter based on linear Gaussian state-space models. However, the Kalman filter is impractically time-consuming when the number of locations in spatio-temporal datasets is large. To address this problem, we propose a multi-resolution filter via linear projection (MRF-lp), a fast computation method for online filtering inference. In the MRF-lp, by carrying out a multi-resolution approximation via linear projection (MRA-lp), the forecast covariance matrix can be approximated while capturing both the large- and small-scale spatial variations. As a result of this approximation, our proposed MRF-lp preserves a block-sparse structure of some matrices appearing in the MRF-lp through time, which leads to the scalability of this algorithm. Additionally, we discuss extensions of the MRF-lp to a nonlinear and non-Gaussian case. Simulation studies and real data analysis for total precipitable water vapor demonstrate that our proposed approach performs well compared with the related methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>44 pa...</summary><p>44 pages, 10 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[SpaceVLLM: Endowing Multimodal Large Language Model with Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding Capability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13983v3)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made remarkable progress in either temporal or spatial localization. However, they struggle to perform spatio-temporal video grounding. This limitation stems from two major challenges. Firstly, it is difficult to extract accurate spatio-temporal information of each frame in the video. Secondly, the substantial number of visual tokens makes it challenging to precisely map visual tokens of each frame to their corresponding spatial coordinates. To address these issues, we introduce SpaceVLLM, a MLLM endowed with spatio-temporal video grounding capability. Specifically, we adopt a set of interleaved Spatio-Temporal Aware Queries to capture temporal perception and dynamic spatial information. Moreover, we propose a Query-Guided Space Decoder to establish a corresponding connection between the queries and spatial coordinates. Additionally, due to the lack of spatio-temporal datasets, we construct the Unified Spatio-Temporal Grounding (Uni-STG) dataset, comprising 480K instances across three tasks. This dataset fully exploits the potential of MLLM to simultaneously facilitate localization in both temporal and spatial dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SpaceVLLM achieves the state-of-the-art performance across 11 benchmarks covering temporal, spatial, spatio-temporal and video understanding tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach. Our code, datasets and model will be released at https://github.com/Jayce1kk/SpaceVLLM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep spatio-temporal point processes: Advances and new directions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06364v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal point processes (STPPs) model discrete events distributed in time and space, with important applications in areas such as criminology, seismology, epidemiology, and social networks. Traditional models often rely on parametric kernels, limiting their ability to capture heterogeneous, nonstationary dynamics. Recent innovations integrate deep neural architectures -- either by modeling the conditional intensity function directly or by learning flexible, data-driven influence kernels, substantially broadening their expressive power. This article reviews the development of the deep influence kernel approach, which enjoys statistical explainability, since the influence kernel remains in the model to capture the spatiotemporal propagation of event influence and its impact on future events, while also possessing strong expressive power, thereby benefiting from both worlds. We explain the main components in developing deep kernel point processes, leveraging tools such as functional basis decomposition and graph neural networks to encode complex spatial or network structures, as well as estimation using both likelihood-based and likelihood-free methods, and address computational scalability for large-scale data. We also discuss the theoretical foundation of kernel identifiability. Simulated and real-data examples highlight applications to crime analysis, earthquake aftershock prediction, and sepsis prediction modeling, and we conclude by discussing promising directions for the field.</p></details> |  |
| **[STNAGNN: Data-driven Spatio-temporal Brain Connectivity beyond FC](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12065v2)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely applied in the analysis of brain fMRI, yet defining the connectivity between ROIs remains a challenge in noisy fMRI data. Among all approaches, Functional Connectome (FC) is the most popular method. Computed by the correlation coefficients between ROI time series, FC is a powerful and computationally efficient way to estimate ROI connectivity. However, it is well known for neglecting structural connections and causality in ROI interactions. Also, FC becomes much more noisy in the short spatio-temporal sliding-window subsequences of fMRI. Effective Connectome (EC) is proposed as a directional alternative, but is difficult to accurately estimate. Furthermore, for optimal GNN performance, usually only a small percentage of the strongest connections are selected as sparse edges, resulting in oversimplification of complex brain connections. To tackle these challenges, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Node Attention Graph Neural Network (STNAGNN) as a data-driven alternative that combines sparse predefined FC with dense data-driven spatio-temporal connections, allowing for flexible and spatio-temporal learning of ROI interaction patterns.</p></details> |  |
| **[STPro: Spatial and Temporal Progressive Learning for Weakly Supervised Spatio-Temporal Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20678v2)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work we study Weakly Supervised Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding (WSTVG), a challenging task of localizing subjects spatio-temporally in videos using only textual queries and no bounding box supervision. Inspired by recent advances in vision-language foundation models, we investigate their utility for WSTVG, leveraging their zero-shot grounding capabilities. However, we find that a simple adaptation lacks essential spatio-temporal grounding abilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce Tubelet Referral Grounding (TRG), which connects textual queries to tubelets to enable spatio-temporal predictions. Despite its promise, TRG struggles with compositional action understanding and dense scene scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose STPro, a novel progressive learning framework with two key modules: (1) Sub-Action Temporal Curriculum Learning (SA-TCL), which incrementally builds compositional action understanding, and (2) Congestion-Guided Spatial Curriculum Learning (CG-SCL), which adapts the model to complex scenes by spatially increasing task difficulty. STPro achieves state-of-the-art results on three benchmark datasets, with improvements of 1.0% on VidSTG-Declarative and 3.0% on HCSTVG-v1.</p></details> | CVPR'25 Conference |

Although spatio-temporal traffic prediction has received extensive research attention, further improvements in prediction accuracy and computational efficiency remain necessary. In particular, existing decomposition-based methods or hybrid architectures often incur heavy overhead when capturing local and global feature correlations, necessitating novel approaches that optimize accuracy and complexity. In this paper, we propose an efficient spatio-temporal network traffic prediction framework, DP-LET, which consists of a data processing module, a local feature enhancement module, and a Transformer-based prediction module. The data processing module is designed for high-efficiency denoising of network data and spatial decoupling. In contrast, the local feature enhancement module leverages multiple Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) to capture fine-grained local features. Meanwhile, the prediction module utilizes a Transformer encoder to model long-term dependencies and assess feature relevance. A case study on real-world cellular traffic prediction demonstrates the practicality of DP-LET, which maintains low computational complexity while achieving state-of-the-art performance, significantly reducing MSE by 31.8% and MAE by 23.1% compared to baseline models.</p></details> | 6 pages |

We would like to verify these systems during runtime when they are deployed. Thus, we propose robust predictive runtime verification (RPRV) algorithms for: (1) general stochastic CPS under signal temporal logic (STL) tasks, and (2) stochastic multi-agent systems (MAS) under spatio-temporal logic tasks. The RPRV problem presents the following challenges: (1) there may not be sufficient data on the behavior of the deployed CPS, (2) predictive models based on design phase system trajectories may encounter distribution shift during real-world deployment, and (3) the algorithms need to scale to the complexity of MAS and be applicable to spatio-temporal logic tasks. To address these challenges, we assume knowledge of an upper bound on the statistical distance (in terms of an f-divergence) between the trajectory distributions of the system at deployment and design time. We are motivated by our prior work [1, 2] where we proposed an accurate and an interpretable RPRV algorithm for general CPS, which we here extend to the MAS setting and spatio-temporal logic tasks. Specifically, we use a learned predictive model to estimate the system behavior at runtime and robust conformal prediction to obtain probabilistic guarantees by accounting for distribution shifts. Building on [1], we perform robust conformal prediction over the robust semantics of spatio-temporal reach and escape logic (STREL) to obtain centralized RPRV algorithms for MAS. We empirically validate our results in a drone swarm simulator, where we show the scalability of our RPRV algorithms to MAS and analyze the impact of different trajectory predictors on the verification result. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first statistically valid algorithms for MAS under distribution shift.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2311.09482</p></details> |

Traditional approaches often simplify road networks into standard graphs, which results in a failure to consider the dynamic nature of traffic data at neighboring intersections, thereby neglecting higher-order interconnections necessary for real-time control. To address this, we propose a novel TSCS framework to realize intelligent traffic control. This framework collaborates with multiple neighboring edge computing servers to collect traffic information across the road network. To elevate the efficiency of traffic signal control, we have crafted a multi-agent soft actor-critic (MA-SAC) reinforcement learning algorithm. Within this algorithm, individual agents are deployed at each intersection with a mandate to optimize traffic flow across the road network collectively. Furthermore, we introduce hypergraph learning into the critic network of MA-SAC to enable the spatio-temporal interactions from multiple intersections in the road network. This method fuses hypergraph and spatio-temporal graph structures to encode traffic data and capture the complex spatio-temporal correlations between multiple intersections. Our empirical evaluation, tested on varied datasets, demonstrates the superiority of our framework in minimizing average vehicle travel times and sustaining high-throughput performance. This work facilitates the development of more intelligent urban traffic management solutions.

Decoding covert speech from electroencephalogram (EEG) is challenging due to a limited understanding of neural pronunciation mapping and the low signal-to-noise ratio of the signal. In this study, we developed a large-scale multi-utterance speech EEG dataset from 57 right-handed native English-speaking subjects, each performing covert and overt speech tasks by repeating the same word in five utterances within a ten-second duration. Given the spatio-temporal nature of the neural activation process during speech pronunciation, we developed a Functional Areas Spatio-temporal Transformer (FAST), an effective framework for converting EEG signals into tokens and utilizing transformer architecture for sequence encoding. Our results reveal distinct and interpretable speech neural features by the visualization of FAST-generated activation maps across frontal and temporal brain regions with each word being covertly spoken, providing new insights into the discriminative features of the neural representation of covert speech. This is the first report of such a study, which provides interpretable evidence for speech decoding from EEG.

| **[DRAN: A Distribution and Relation Adaptive Network for Spatio-temporal Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01531v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate predictions of spatio-temporal systems' states are crucial for tasks such as system management, control, and crisis prevention. However, the inherent time variance of spatio-temporal systems poses challenges to achieving accurate predictions whenever stationarity is not granted. To address non-stationarity frameworks, we propose a Distribution and Relation Adaptive Network (DRAN) capable of dynamically adapting to relation and distribution changes over time. While temporal normalization and de-normalization are frequently used techniques to adapt to distribution shifts, this operation is not suitable for the spatio-temporal context as temporal normalization scales the time series of nodes and possibly disrupts the spatial relations among nodes. In order to address this problem, we develop a Spatial Factor Learner (SFL) module that enables the normalization and de-normalization process in spatio-temporal systems. To adapt to dynamic changes in spatial relationships among sensors, we propose a Dynamic-Static Fusion Learner (DSFL) module that effectively integrates features learned from both dynamic and static relations through an adaptive fusion ratio mechanism. Furthermore, we introduce a Stochastic Learner to capture the noisy components of spatio-temporal representations. Our approach outperforms state of the art methods in weather prediction and traffic flows forecasting tasks. Experimental results show that our SFL efficiently preserves spatial relationships across various temporal normalization operations. Visualizations of the learned dynamic and static relations demonstrate that DSFL can capture both local and distant relationships between nodes. Moreover, ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each component.</p></details> | 15 pages, 9 figures |

Such data occurs widely, ranging from the scientific and medical domains to the industrial and environmental domains. When the properties in time series exhibit spatial variations, we often call the data spatio-temporal. As part of the continued digitalization of processes throughout society, increasingly large volumes of time series and spatio-temporal data are available. In this tutorial, we focus on data-driven decision making with such data, e.g., enabling greener and more efficient transportation based on traffic time series forecasting. The tutorial adopts the holistic paradigm of ``data-governance-analytics-decision.'' We first introduce the data foundation of time series and spatio-temporal data, which is often heterogeneous. Next, we discuss data governance methods that aim to improve data quality. We then cover data analytics, focusing on the ``AGREE'' principles: Automation, Generalization, Robustness, Explainability, and Efficiency. We finally cover data-driven decision making strategies and briefly discuss promising research directions.

However, the inherently sparse and non-deterministic nature of radar data limits the effectiveness of traditional single-frame BEV paradigms. In this paper, we addresses this limitation by introducing AttentiveGRU, a novel attention-based recurrent approach tailored for radar constraints, which extracts individualized spatio-temporal context for objects by dynamically identifying and fusing temporally correlated structures across present and memory states. By leveraging the consistency of object's latent representation over time, our approach exploits temporal relations to enrich feature representations for both stationary and moving objects, thereby enhancing detection performance and eliminating the need for externally providing or estimating any information about ego vehicle motion. Our experimental results on the public nuScenes dataset show a significant increase in mAP for the car category by 21% over the best radar-only submission. Further evaluations on an additional dataset demonstrate notable improvements in object detection capabilities, underscoring the applicability and effectiveness of our method.</p></details> |  |

Additionally, SNN possess a crucial characteristic, namely the ability to process spatio-temporal information. However, this ability is constrained by both internal and external factors in practical applications, thereby affecting the performance of SNN. Firstly, the internal issue of SNN lies in the inherent limitations of their network structure and neuronal model, which result in the network adopting a unified processing approach for information of different temporal dimensions when processing input data containing complex temporal information. Secondly, the external issue of SNN stems from the direct encoding method commonly adopted by directly trained SNN, which uses the same feature map for input at each time step, failing to fully exploit the spatio-temporal characteristics of SNN. To address these issues, this paper proposes an Unconstrained Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (ULIF) neuronal model that allows for learning different membrane potential parameters at different time steps, thereby enhancing SNN' ability to process information of different temporal dimensions. Additionally, this paper presents a hybrid encoding scheme aimed at solving the problem of direct encoding lacking temporal dimension information. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods effectively improve the overall performance of SNN in object detection and object recognition tasks. related code is available at https://github.com/hhx0320/ASNN.</p></details> |  |
| **[EventMamba: Enhancing Spatio-Temporal Locality with State Space Models for Event-Based Video Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19721v3)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging its robust linear global modeling capability, Mamba has notably excelled in computer vision. Despite its success, existing Mamba-based vision models have overlooked the nuances of event-driven tasks, especially in video reconstruction. Event-based video reconstruction (EBVR) demands spatial translation invariance and close attention to local event relationships in the spatio-temporal domain. Unfortunately, conventional Mamba algorithms apply static window partitions and standard reshape scanning methods, leading to significant losses in local connectivity. To overcome these limitations, we introduce EventMamba--a specialized model designed for EBVR tasks. EventMamba innovates by incorporating random window offset (RWO) in the spatial domain, moving away from the restrictive fixed partitioning. Additionally, it features a new consistent traversal serialization approach in the spatio-temporal domain, which maintains the proximity of adjacent events both spatially and temporally. These enhancements enable EventMamba to retain Mamba's robust modeling capabilities while significantly preserving the spatio-temporal locality of event data. Comprehensive testing on multiple datasets shows that EventMamba markedly enhances video reconstruction, drastically improving computation speed while delivering superior visual quality compared to Transformer-based methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[UniFlow: A Foundation Model for Unified Urban Spatio-Temporal Flow Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12972v3)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban spatio-temporal flow prediction, encompassing traffic flows and crowd flows, is crucial for optimizing city infrastructure and managing traffic and emergency responses. Traditional approaches have relied on separate models tailored to either grid-based data, representing cities as uniform cells, or graph-based data, modeling cities as networks of nodes and edges. In this paper, we build UniFlow, a foundational model for general urban flow prediction that unifies both grid-based and graphbased data. We first design a multi-view spatio-temporal patching mechanism to standardize different data into a consistent sequential format and then introduce a spatio-temporal transformer architecture to capture complex correlations and dynamics. To leverage shared spatio-temporal patterns across different data types and facilitate effective cross-learning, we propose SpatioTemporal Memory Retrieval Augmentation (ST-MRA). By creating structured memory modules to store shared spatio-temporal patterns, ST-MRA enhances predictions through adaptive memory retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniFlow outperforms existing models in both grid-based and graph-based flow prediction, excelling particularly in scenarios with limited data availability, showcasing its superior performance and broad applicability.

The hurdles to enhancing this capability include extensive manual labor, the lack of spatio-temporal compositionality in existing data and the absence of explicit reasoning supervision. In this paper, we propose STEP, a novel graph-guided self-training method that enables Video-LLMs to generate reasoning-rich fine-tuning data from any raw videos to improve itself. Specifically, we first induce Spatio-Temporal Scene Graph (STSG) representation of diverse videos to capture fine-grained, multi-granular video semantics. Then, the STSGs guide the derivation of multi-step reasoning Question-Answer (QA) data with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rationales. Both answers and rationales are integrated as training objective, aiming to enhance model's reasoning abilities by supervision over explicit reasoning steps. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of STEP across models of varying scales, with a significant 21.3\% improvement in tasks requiring three or more reasoning steps. Furthermore, it achieves superior performance with a minimal amount of self-generated rationale-enriched training samples in both compositional reasoning and comprehensive understanding benchmarks, highlighting the broad applicability and vast potential.</p></details> |  |

Built upon the powerful Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture, JavisDiT is able to generate high-quality audio and video content simultaneously from open-ended user prompts. To ensure optimal synchronization, we introduce a fine-grained spatio-temporal alignment mechanism through a Hierarchical Spatial-Temporal Synchronized Prior (HiST-Sypo) Estimator. This module extracts both global and fine-grained spatio-temporal priors, guiding the synchronization between the visual and auditory components. Furthermore, we propose a new benchmark, JavisBench, consisting of 10,140 high-quality text-captioned sounding videos spanning diverse scenes and complex real-world scenarios. Further, we specifically devise a robust metric for evaluating the synchronization between generated audio-video pairs in real-world complex content. Experimental results demonstrate that JavisDiT significantly outperforms existing methods by ensuring both high-quality generation and precise synchronization, setting a new standard for JAVG tasks.

However, existing multi-sensor fusion research predominantly integrates complementary context from multiple images rather than videos. This primarily stems from two factors: 1) the scarcity of large-scale multi-sensor video datasets, limiting research in video fusion, and 2) the inherent difficulty of jointly modeling spatial and temporal dependencies in a unified framework. This paper proactively compensates for the dilemmas. First, we construct M3SVD, a benchmark dataset with $220$ temporally synchronized and spatially registered infrared-visible video pairs comprising 153,797 frames, filling the data gap for the video fusion community. Secondly, we propose VideoFusion, a multi-modal video fusion model that fully exploits cross-modal complementarity and temporal dynamics to generate spatio-temporally coherent videos from (potentially degraded) multi-modal inputs. Specifically, 1) a differential reinforcement module is developed for cross-modal information interaction and enhancement, 2) a complete modality-guided fusion strategy is employed to adaptively integrate multi-modal features, and 3) a bi-temporal co-attention mechanism is devised to dynamically aggregate forward-backward temporal contexts to reinforce cross-frame feature representations. Extensive experiments reveal that VideoFusion outperforms existing image-oriented fusion paradigms in sequential scenarios, effectively mitigating temporal inconsistency and interference.</p></details> |  |

VT migration is an effective way that migrates the VT when the locations of physical entities keep changing to maintain seamless immersive VT services. However, an efficient VT migration is challenging due to the rapid movement of vehicles, dynamic workloads of Roadside Units (RSUs), and heterogeneous resources of the RSUs. To achieve efficient migration decisions and a minimum latency for the VT migration, we propose a multi-agent split Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework combined with spatio-temporal trajectory generation. In this framework, multiple split DRL agents utilize split architecture to efficiently determine VT migration decisions. Furthermore, we propose a spatio-temporal trajectory generation algorithm based on trajectory datasets and road network data to simulate vehicle trajectories, enhancing the generalization of the proposed scheme for managing VT migration in dynamic network environments. Finally, experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme not only enhances the Quality of Experience (QoE) by 29% but also reduces the computational parameter count by approximately 25% while maintaining similar performances, enhancing users' immersive experiences in vehicular metaverses.</p></details> |  |

Our approach combines Bayesian Structural Time Series for modeling marginal crop yields, ensuring a more robust quantification of uncertainty given the typically short historical records. To capture dynamic dependencies between regions, we develop a time-varying conditional copula model, where the copula parameter evolves over time as a function of its previous lag and extreme weather covariates. Unlike traditional approaches that treat climatic factors as fixed inputs, we incorporate dynamic Generalized Extreme Value models to characterize extreme weather events, enabling a more accurate reflection of their impact on crop yields. Furthermore, to ensure scalability for large-scale applications, we build on the existing Partitioning Around Medoids clustering algorithm and introduce a novel dissimilarity measure that integrates both spatial and copula-based dependence, enabling an effective reduction of the dimensionality in the dependence structure.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches face a trilemma: diffusion-based methods achieve high visual fidelity but suffer from prohibitive computational costs, while GAN-based solutions sacrifice lip-sync accuracy or dental details for real-time performance. We present MuseTalk, a novel two-stage training framework that resolves this trade-off through latent space optimization and spatio-temporal data sampling strategy. Our key innovations include: (1) During the Facial Abstract Pretraining stage, we propose Informative Frame Sampling to temporally align reference-source pose pairs, eliminating redundant feature interference while preserving identity cues. (2) In the Lip-Sync Adversarial Finetuning stage, we employ Dynamic Margin Sampling to spatially select the most suitable lip-movement-promoting regions, balancing audio-visual synchronization and dental clarity. (3) MuseTalk establishes an effective audio-visual feature fusion framework in the latent space, delivering 30 FPS output at 256*256 resolution on an NVIDIA V100 GPU. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MuseTalk outperforms state-of-the-art methods in visual fidelity while achieving comparable lip-sync accuracy. %The codes and models will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

Recent advances have improved the spatial reasoning ability of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by introducing large-scale data, but these models still struggle to analyze kinematic elements like traveled distance and speed of moving objects. To bridge this gap, we construct a spatio-temporal reasoning dataset and benchmark involving kinematic instruction tuning, referred to as STKit and STKit-Bench. They consist of real-world videos with 3D annotations, detailing object motion dynamics: traveled distance, speed, movement direction, inter-object distance comparisons, and relative movement direction. To further scale such data construction to videos without 3D labels, we propose an automatic pipeline to generate pseudo-labels using 4D reconstruction in real-world scale. With our kinematic instruction tuning data for spatio-temporal reasoning, we present ST-VLM, a VLM enhanced for spatio-temporal reasoning, which exhibits outstanding performance on STKit-Bench. Furthermore, we show that ST-VLM generalizes robustly across diverse domains and tasks, outperforming baselines on other spatio-temporal benchmarks (eg, ActivityNet, TVQA+). Finally, by integrating learned spatio-temporal reasoning with existing abilities, ST-VLM enables complex multi-step reasoning. Project page: https://ikodoh.github.io/ST-VLM.</p></details> |  |

However, real-world visual relationships often exhibit a long-tailed distribution, causing existing methods for tasks like Video Scene Graph Generation (VidSGG) and Scene Graph Anticipation (SGA) to produce biased scene graphs. To this end, we propose ImparTail, a novel training framework that leverages loss masking and curriculum learning to mitigate bias in the generation and anticipation of spatio-temporal scene graphs. Unlike prior methods that add extra architectural components to learn unbiased estimators, we propose an impartial training objective that reduces the dominance of head classes during learning and focuses on underrepresented tail relationships. Our curriculum-driven mask generation strategy further empowers the model to adaptively adjust its bias mitigation strategy over time, enabling more balanced and robust estimations. To thoroughly assess performance under various distribution shifts, we also introduce two new tasks Robust Spatio-Temporal Scene Graph Generation and Robust Scene Graph Anticipation offering a challenging benchmark for evaluating the resilience of STSG models. Extensive experiments on the Action Genome dataset demonstrate the superior unbiased performance and robustness of our method compared to existing baselines.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |

Compared to its predecessor SV4D, SV4D 2.0 is more robust to occlusions and large motion, generalizes better to real-world videos, and produces higher-quality outputs in terms of detail sharpness and spatio-temporal consistency. We achieve this by introducing key improvements in multiple aspects: 1) network architecture: eliminating the dependency of reference multi-views and designing blending mechanism for 3D and frame attention, 2) data: enhancing quality and quantity of training data, 3) training strategy: adopting progressive 3D-4D training for better generalization, and 4) 4D optimization: handling 3D inconsistency and large motion via 2-stage refinement and progressive frame sampling.

However, relation modeling between different image patches exhibits significant variations. For instance, background regions dominated by target-irrelevant information require reduced attention allocation, while foreground, particularly boundary areas, need to be be emphasized. A single model may not effectively handle all kinds of relation modeling simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a novel tracker called SPMTrack based on mixture-of-experts tailored for visual tracking task (TMoE), combining the capability of multiple experts to handle diverse relation modeling more flexibly. Benefiting from TMoE, we extend relation modeling from image pairs to spatio-temporal context, further improving tracking accuracy with minimal increase in model parameters. Moreover, we employ TMoE as a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method, substantially reducing trainable parameters, which enables us to train SPMTrack of varying scales efficiently and preserve the generalization ability of pretrained models to achieve superior performance. We conduct experiments on seven datasets, and experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art trackers.

Despite its importance, conventional LVEF estimation remains time-consuming and operator-dependent. Recent deep learning advancements have enhanced automation, yet many existing models are computationally demanding, hindering their feasibility for real-time clinical applications. Additionally, the interplay between spatial and temporal features is crucial for accurate estimation but is often overlooked. In this work, we propose Echo-E$^3$Net, an efficient Endo-Epi spatio-temporal network tailored for LVEF estimation. Our method introduces the Endo-Epi Cardial Border Detector (E$^2$CBD) module, which enhances feature extraction by leveraging spatial and temporal landmark cues. Complementing this, the Endo-Epi Feature Aggregator (E$^2$FA) distills statistical descriptors from backbone feature maps, refining the final EF prediction. These modules, along with a multi-component loss function tailored to align with the clinical definition of EF, collectively enhance spatial-temporal representation learning, ensuring robust and efficient EF estimation. We evaluate Echo-E$^3$Net on the EchoNet-Dynamic dataset, achieving a RMSE of 5.15 and an R$^2$ score of 0.82, setting a new benchmark in efficiency with 6.8 million parameters and only 8.49G Flops.

While recent data-driven methods like deep reinforcement learning improve microscopic realism, they often overlook critical macroscopic features such as crowd density and flow, which are governed by spatio-temporal spawn dynamics, namely, when and where agents enter a scene. Traditional methods, like random spawn rates, stochastic processes, or fixed schedules, are not guaranteed to capture the underlying complexity or lack diversity and realism. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach called nTPP-GMM that models spatio-temporal spawn dynamics using Neural Temporal Point Processes (nTPPs) that are coupled with a spawn-conditional Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for agent spawn and goal positions. We evaluate our approach by orchestrating crowd simulations of three diverse real-world datasets with nTPP-GMM. Our experiments demonstrate the orchestration with nTPP-GMM leads to realistic simulations that reflect real-world crowd scenarios and allow crowd analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Assessment of Spatio-Temporal Predictors in the Presence of Missing and Heterogeneous Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01701v2)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning approaches achieve outstanding predictive performance in modeling modern data, despite the increasing complexity and scale. However, evaluating the quality of predictive models becomes more challenging, as traditional statistical assumptions often no longer hold. In particular, spatio-temporal data exhibit dependencies across both time and space, often involving nonlinear dynamics, non-stationarities, and missing observations. As a result, advanced predictors such as spatio-temporal graph neural networks require novel evaluation methodologies. This paper introduces a residual correlation analysis framework designed to assess the optimality of spatio-temporal predictive neural models, particularly in scenarios with incomplete and heterogeneous data. By leveraging the principle that residual correlation indicates information not captured by the model, this framework serves as a powerful tool to identify and localize regions in space and time where model performance can be improved. A key advantage of the proposed approach is its ability to operate under minimal assumptions, enabling robust evaluation of deep learning models applied to multivariate time series, even in the presence of missing and heterogeneous data. The methodology employs tailored spatio-temporal graphs to encode sparse spatial and temporal dependencies within the data and utilizes asymptotically distribution-free summary statistics to pinpoint time intervals and spatial regions where the model underperforms. The effectiveness of the proposed residual analysis is demonstrated through validation on both synthetic and real-world scenarios involving state-of-the-art predictive models.</p></details> |  |

Despite various reduction policies implemented across different sectors, PM10 concentrations in South Korea continue to exceed the annual recommended limits set by the World Health Organization. Spatio-temporal PM10 concentrations may exhibit both spatial and temporal dependencies. Additionally, interactions between PM10 and environmental factors can further influence the variability in PM10. Therefore, this study proposes a method that incorporates the spatio-temporal neighbors of covariates alongside those of PM10 by adopting an approach that explains spatio-temporal interactions through spatio-temporal neighbors. Vine copulas are used to integrate the pairwise dependence structures between a given location and its surrounding spatio-temporal neighbors. We applied the model to weekly average PM10 data from South Korea in 2019, using PM2.5 and CO as covariates. Given that all three variables exhibited skewness, we assumed the Gumbel and Generalized Extreme Value distributions as marginal distributions. The proposed model outperformed a traditional Bayesian spatio-temporal model, a kriging method, and an alternative copula-based approach, particularly in predicting the top 5% of extreme values, by effectively capturing tail dependencies crucial for extreme value analysis. This study highlights the importance of utilizing vine copulas to effectively model diverse dependency structures in spatio-temporal data while simultaneously accommodating spatial and temporal dimensions, including spatio-temporal dependencies among covariates. The results underscore the broader applicability of the proposed approach to other fields where complex dependency structures are present.</p></details> |  |

However, Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) continue to encounter challenges related to low inference speed, primarily due to the iterative denoising process. To address this issue, we propose BlockDance, a training-free approach that explores feature similarities at adjacent time steps to accelerate DiTs. Unlike previous feature-reuse methods that lack tailored reuse strategies for features at different scales, BlockDance prioritizes the identification of the most structurally similar features, referred to as Structurally Similar Spatio-Temporal (STSS) features. These features are primarily located within the structure-focused blocks of the transformer during the later stages of denoising. BlockDance caches and reuses these highly similar features to mitigate redundant computation, thereby accelerating DiTs while maximizing consistency with the generated results of the original model. Furthermore, considering the diversity of generated content and the varying distributions of redundant features, we introduce BlockDance-Ada, a lightweight decision-making network tailored for instance-specific acceleration. BlockDance-Ada dynamically allocates resources and provides superior content quality. Both BlockDance and BlockDance-Ada have proven effective across various generation tasks and models, achieving accelerations between 25% and 50% while maintaining generation quality.</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2025 |

However, the scarcity of data coupled with the high expenses involved in sensor deployment results in notable data imbalances. Furthermore, models that are excessively customized and devoid of causal connections further undermine the generalizability and interpretability. To this end, we establish a causal framework for ST predictions, termed CaPaint, which targets to identify causal regions in data and endow model with causal reasoning ability in a two-stage process. Going beyond this process, we utilize the back-door adjustment to specifically address the sub-regions identified as non-causal in the upstream phase. Specifically, we employ a novel image inpainting technique. By using a fine-tuned unconditional Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) as the generative prior, we in-fill the masks defined as environmental parts, offering the possibility of reliable extrapolation for potential data distributions. CaPaint overcomes the high complexity dilemma of optimal ST causal discovery models by reducing the data generation complexity from exponential to quasi-linear levels. Extensive experiments conducted on five real-world ST benchmarks demonstrate that integrating the CaPaint concept allows models to achieve improvements ranging from 4.3% to 77.3%. Moreover, compared to traditional mainstream ST augmenters, CaPaint underscores the potential of diffusion models in ST enhancement, offering a novel paradigm for this field.

However, these models do not fully capture the complexity of the language learning process of an infant when used in isolation. In this paper, we examine how a model of language acquisition for infants and young children can be constructed and adapted for use in a Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (STGCN), taking into account the different types of linguistic relationships that occur during child language learning. We introduce a novel approach for predicting child vocabulary acquisition, and evaluate the efficacy of such a model with respect to the different types of linguistic relationships that occur during language acquisition, resulting in insightful observations on model calibration and norm selection. An evaluation of this model found that the mean accuracy of models for predicting new words when using sensorimotor relationships (0.733) and semantic relationships (0.729) were found to be superior to that observed with a 2-layer Feed-forward neural network. Furthermore, the high recall for some relationships suggested that some relationships (e.g. visual) were superior in identifying a larger proportion of relevant words that a child should subsequently learn than others (such as auditory).</p></details> |  |

In the human language system, experimental studies have observed clusters for syntactic and semantic categories, but the mechanisms underlying this functional organization remain unclear. Here, building on work from the vision literature, we develop TopoLM, a transformer language model with an explicit two-dimensional spatial representation of model units. By combining a next-token prediction objective with a spatial smoothness loss, representations in this model assemble into clusters that correspond to semantically interpretable groupings of text and closely match the functional organization in the brain's language system. TopoLM successfully predicts the emergence of the spatio-functional organization of a cortical language system as well as the organization of functional clusters selective for fine-grained linguistic features empirically observed in human cortex. Our results suggest that the functional organization of the human language system is driven by a unified spatial objective, and provide a functionally and spatially aligned model of language processing in the brain.</p></details> |  |

However, restricted capturing devices and transmission bandwidth lead to low-resolution ODVs. Video super-resolution (SR) is proposed to enhance resolution, but practical ODV spatial projection distortions and temporal flickering are not well addressed directly applying existing methods. To achieve better ODV-SR reconstruction, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Distortion Aware Network (STDAN) oriented to ODV characteristics. Specifically, a spatially continuous distortion modulation module is introduced to improve discrete projection distortions. Next, we design an interlaced multi-frame reconstruction mechanism to refine temporal consistency across frames. Furthermore, we incorporate latitude-saliency adaptive weights during training to concentrate on regions with higher texture complexity and human-watching interest. In general, we explore inference-free and real-world viewing matched strategies to provide an application-friendly method on a novel ODV-SR dataset with practical scenarios. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed STDAN over state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Human-Centric Video Anomaly Detection Through Spatio-Temporal Pose Tokenization and Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15185v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) presents a significant challenge in computer vision, particularly due to the unpredictable and infrequent nature of anomalous events, coupled with the diverse and dynamic environments in which they occur. Human-centric VAD, a specialized area within this domain, faces additional complexities, including variations in human behavior, potential biases in data, and substantial privacy concerns related to human subjects. These issues complicate the development of models that are both robust and generalizable. To address these challenges, recent advancements have focused on pose-based VAD, which leverages human pose as a high-level feature to mitigate privacy concerns, reduce appearance biases, and minimize background interference. In this paper, we introduce SPARTA, a novel transformer-based architecture designed specifically for human-centric pose-based VAD. SPARTA introduces an innovative Spatio-Temporal Pose and Relative Pose (ST-PRP) tokenization method that produces an enriched representation of human motion over time. This approach ensures that the transformer's attention mechanism captures both spatial and temporal patterns simultaneously, rather than focusing on only one aspect. The addition of the relative pose further emphasizes subtle deviations from normal human movements. The architecture's core, a novel Unified Encoder Twin Decoders (UETD) transformer, significantly improves the detection of anomalous behaviors in video data. Extensive evaluations across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that SPARTA consistently outperforms existing methods, establishing a new state-of-the-art in pose-based VAD.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches, including spatio-temporal graph convolutional networks (ST-GCNs), often face high memory demands and struggle to capture complex spatio-temporal dependencies, limiting their efficiency in clinical applications. To address these challenges, we introduce DynSTG-Mamba (Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Graph Mamba), a novel framework that combines DF-STGNN and STG-Mamba to enhance motion sequence modeling. The DF-STGNN incorporates a dynamic spatio-temporal filter that adaptively adjusts spatial connections between skeletal joints and temporal interactions across different movement phases. This approach ensures better feature propagation through dynamic graph structures by considering the hierarchical nature and dynamics of skeletal gait data. Meanwhile, STG-Mamba, an extension of Mamba adapted for skeletal motion data, ensures a continuous propagation of states, facilitating the capture of long-term dependencies while reducing computational complexity. To reduce the number of model parameters and computational costs while maintaining consistency, we propose Cross-Graph Relational Knowledge Distillation, a novel knowledge transfer mechanism that aligns relational information between teacher (large architecture) and student models (small architecture) while using shared memory. This ensures that the interactions and movement patterns of the joints are accurately preserved in the motion sequences. We validate our DynSTG-Mamba on KOA-NM, PD-WALK, and ATAXIA datasets, where it outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by achieving in terms of Accuracy, F1-score, and Recall. Our results highlight the efficiency and robustness of our approach, offering a lightweight yet highly accurate solution for automated gait analysis and movement disorder assessment.</p></details> |  |

Our approach applies query-based detection (DETR) to each frame and matches DETR queries to link the same person across frames. We introduce the Query Matching Module (QMM), which uses metric learning to bring queries for the same person closer together across frames compared to queries for different people. Action classes are predicted using the sequence of queries obtained from QMM matching, allowing for variable-length inputs from videos longer than a single clip. Experimental results on JHMDB, UCF101-24, and AVA datasets demonstrate that our method performs well for large position changes of people while offering superior computational efficiency and lower resource requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>exten...</summary><p>extended version of VISAPP2025</p></details> |

Recently, we have witnessed the rise of variational autoencoder-based latent factor models, which learn latent factors self-adaptively. While these models focus on modeling overall market conditions, they often fail to effectively capture the temporal patterns of individual stocks. Additionally, representing multiple factors as single values simplifies the model but limits its ability to capture complex relationships and dependencies. As a result, the learned factors are of low quality and lack diversity, reducing their effectiveness and robustness across different trading periods. To address these issues, we propose a Spatio-Temporal factOR Model based on dual vector quantized variational autoencoders, named STORM, which extracts features of stocks from temporal and spatial perspectives, then fuses and aligns these features at the fine-grained and semantic level, and represents the factors as multi-dimensional embeddings. The discrete codebooks cluster similar factor embeddings, ensuring orthogonality and diversity, which helps distinguish between different factors and enables factor selection in financial trading. To show the performance of the proposed factor model, we apply it to two downstream experiments: portfolio management on two stock datasets and individual trading tasks on six specific stocks. The extensive experiments demonstrate STORM's flexibility in adapting to downstream tasks and superior performance over baseline models.</p></details> |  |

It is a multimodal task aimed at localizing specific subjects spatio-temporally based on textual queries without bounding box supervision. Motivated by recent advancements in multi-modal foundation models for grounding tasks, we first explore the potential of state-of-the-art object detection models for WSTVG. Despite their robust zero-shot capabilities, our adaptation reveals significant limitations, including inconsistent temporal predictions, inadequate understanding of complex queries, and challenges in adapting to difficult scenarios. We propose CoSPaL (Contextual Self-Paced Learning), a novel approach which is designed to overcome these limitations. CoSPaL integrates three core components: (1) Tubelet Phrase Grounding (TPG), which introduces spatio-temporal prediction by linking textual queries to tubelets; (2) Contextual Referral Grounding (CRG), which improves comprehension of complex queries by extracting contextual information to refine object identification over time; and (3) Self-Paced Scene Understanding (SPS), a training paradigm that progressively increases task difficulty, enabling the model to adapt to complex scenarios by transitioning from coarse to fine-grained understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR'...</summary><p>ICLR'25 Main Conference.

| **[Spatio-temporal Fourier Transformer (StFT) for Long-term Dynamics Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11899v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulating the long-term dynamics of multi-scale and multi-physics systems poses a significant challenge in understanding complex phenomena across science and engineering. The complexity arises from the intricate interactions between scales and the interplay of diverse physical processes. Neural operators have emerged as promising models for predicting such dynamics due to their flexibility and computational efficiency. However, they often fail to effectively capture multi-scale interactions or quantify the uncertainties inherent in the predictions. These limitations lead to rapid error accumulation, particularly in long-term forecasting of systems characterized by complex and coupled dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose a spatio-temporal Fourier transformer (StFT), in which each transformer block is designed to learn dynamics at a specific scale. By leveraging a structured hierarchy of StFT blocks, the model explicitly captures dynamics across both macro- and micro- spatial scales. Furthermore, a generative residual correction mechanism is integrated to estimate and mitigate predictive uncertainties, enhancing both the accuracy and reliability of long-term forecasts. Evaluations conducted on three benchmark datasets (plasma, fluid, and atmospheric dynamics) demonstrate the advantages of our approach over state-of-the-art ML methods.</p></details> | 16 pages, 10 figures |

However, can Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) also "reason through a sequential spatio-temporal logic" in videos? Existing Video-LLM benchmarks primarily focus on assessing object presence, neglecting relational reasoning. Consequently, it is difficult to measure whether a model truly comprehends object interactions (actions/events) in videos or merely relies on pre-trained "memory" of co-occurrences as biases in generating answers. In this work, we introduce a Video Spatio-Temporal Reasoning (V-STaR) benchmark to address these shortcomings. The key idea is to decompose video understanding into a Reverse Spatio-Temporal Reasoning (RSTR) task that simultaneously evaluates what objects are present, when events occur, and where they are located while capturing the underlying Chain-of-thought (CoT) logic. To support this evaluation, we construct a dataset to elicit the spatial-temporal reasoning process of Video-LLMs. It contains coarse-to-fine CoT questions generated by a semi-automated GPT-4-powered pipeline, embedding explicit reasoning chains to mimic human cognition. Experiments from 14 Video-LLMs on our V-STaR reveal significant gaps between current Video-LLMs and the needs for robust and consistent spatio-temporal reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>A ben...</summary><p>A benchmark for Video Spatio-Temporal Reasoning</p></details> |

Nevertheless, conventional Mamba-based models encounter significant challenges in accurately predicting stock time series, as they fail to adequately capture both the overarching market dynamics and the intricate interdependencies among individual stocks. To overcome these constraints, we introduce the Hierarchical Information-Guided Spatio-Temporal Mamba (HIGSTM) framework. HIGSTM introduces Index-Guided Frequency Filtering Decomposition to extract commonality and specificity from time series. The model architecture features a meticulously designed hierarchical framework that systematically captures both temporal dynamic patterns and global static relationships within the stock market. Furthermore, we propose an Information-Guided Mamba that integrates macro informations into the sequence selection process, thereby facilitating more market-conscious decision-making. Comprehensive experimental evaluations conducted on the CSI500, CSI800 and CSI1000 datasets demonstrate that HIGSTM achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

Our approach processes multi-station waveform data and generates station-specific detection probabilities. Experiments show superior performance over a conventional GCN baseline in terms of true positive rate (TPR) and false positive rate (FPR), highlighting its potential for robust multi-station earthquake detection.

Prior work primarily focuses on single-frame cooperative perception, which fuses agents' information across different spatial locations but ignores temporal cues and temporal tasks (e.g., temporal perception and prediction). In this paper, we focus on the spatio-temporal fusion in V2X scenarios and design one-step and multi-step communication strategies (when to transmit) as well as examine their integration with three fusion strategies - early, late, and intermediate (what to transmit), providing comprehensive benchmarks with 11 fusion models (how to fuse). Furthermore, we propose V2XPnP, a novel intermediate fusion framework within one-step communication for end-to-end perception and prediction. Our framework employs a unified Transformer-based architecture to effectively model complex spatio-temporal relationships across multiple agents, frames, and high-definition map. Moreover, we introduce the V2XPnP Sequential Dataset that supports all V2X collaboration modes and addresses the limitations of existing real-world datasets, which are restricted to single-frame or single-mode cooperation. Extensive experiments demonstrate our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both perception and prediction tasks.

Compared to classic STVG locating only a single target, OmniSTVG enables localization of not only an arbitrary number of text-referred targets but also their interacting counterparts in the query from the video, making it more flexible and practical in real scenarios for comprehensive understanding. In order to facilitate exploration of OmniSTVG, we introduce BOSTVG, a large-scale benchmark dedicated to OmniSTVG. Specifically, our BOSTVG consists of 10,018 videos with 10.2M frames and covers a wide selection of 287 classes from diverse scenarios. Each sequence in BOSTVG, paired with a free-form textual query, encompasses a varying number of targets ranging from 1 to 10. To ensure high quality, each video is manually annotated with meticulous inspection and refinement. To our best knowledge, BOSTVG is to date the first and the largest benchmark for OmniSTVG. To encourage future research, we introduce a simple yet effective approach, named OmniTube, which, drawing inspiration from Transformer-based STVG methods, is specially designed for OmniSTVG and demonstrates promising results. By releasing BOSTVG, we hope to go beyond classic STVG by locating every object appearing in the query for more comprehensive understanding, opening up a new direction for STVG. Our benchmark, model, and results will be released at https://github.com/JellyYao3000/OmniSTVG.</p></details> |  |

Traditional deep learning approaches have significantly advanced this field, particularly in the stage of ST data mining. However, these models remain task-specific and often require extensive labeled data. Inspired by the success of Foundation Models (FM), especially large language models, researchers have begun exploring the concept of Spatio-Temporal Foundation Models (STFMs) to enhance adaptability and generalization across diverse ST tasks. Unlike prior architectures, STFMs empower the entire workflow of ST data science, ranging from data sensing, management, to mining, thereby offering a more holistic and scalable approach. Despite rapid progress, a systematic study of STFMs for ST data science remains lacking. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive review of STFMs, categorizing existing methodologies and identifying key research directions to advance ST general intelligence.</p></details> |  |

Utilizing existing observations, spatio-temporal kriging is a method for estimating air quality at unobserved locations during a specific period. Inductive spatio-temporal kriging with increment training strategy has demonstrated its effectiveness using virtual nodes to simulate unobserved nodes. However, a disparity between virtual and real nodes persists, complicating the application of learning patterns derived from virtual nodes to actual unobserved ones. To address these limitations, this paper presents a Physics-Guided Increment Training Strategy (PGITS). Specifically, we design a dynamic graph generation module to incorporate the advection and diffusion processes of airborne particles as physical knowledge into the graph structure, dynamically adjusting the adjacency matrix to reflect physical interactions between nodes. By using physics principles as a bridge between virtual and real nodes, this strategy ensures the features of virtual nodes and their pseudo labels are closer to actual nodes. Consequently, the learned patterns of virtual nodes can be applied to actual unobserved nodes for effective kriging.</p></details> |  |

Although GNNs have shown great promise in handling traffic datasets, their deployment in real-life applications has been hindered by scalability constraints arising from high-order message passing. Additionally, the over-smoothing problem of GNNs may lead to indistinguishable region representations as the number of layers increases, resulting in performance degradation. To address these challenges, we propose a new knowledge distillation paradigm termed LightST that transfers spatial and temporal knowledge from a high-capacity teacher to a lightweight student. Specifically, we introduce a spatio-temporal knowledge distillation framework that helps student MLPs capture graph-structured global spatio-temporal patterns while alleviating the over-smoothing effect with adaptive knowledge distillation. Extensive experiments verify that LightST significantly speeds up traffic flow predictions by 5X to 40X compared to state-of-the-art spatio-temporal GNNs, all while maintaining superior accuracy.</p></details> | 9 pages |

Due to the inherent uncertainty in vessel behavior, trajectory prediction systems must adopt a multimodal approach to accurately model potential future motion states. However, existing vessel trajectory prediction methods lack the ability to comprehensively model behavioral multi-modality. To better capture multimodal behavior in interactive scenarios, we propose modeling interactions as dynamic graphs, replacing traditional aggregation-based techniques that rely on vessel states. By leveraging the natural multimodal capabilities of diffusion models, we frame the trajectory prediction task as an inverse process of motion uncertainty diffusion, wherein uncertainties across potential navigational areas are progressively eliminated until the desired trajectories is produced. In summary, we pioneer the integration of Spatio-Temporal Graph (STG) with diffusion models in ship trajectory prediction. Extensive experiments on real Automatic Identification System (AIS) data validate the superiority of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been ACCEPTED as a FULL PAPER at DASFAA 2025</p></details> |

As systems like autonomous driving become increasingly popular, ensuring their safety has become more important than ever. Therefore, this paper focuses on how to quickly and effectively detect various anomalies in the aforementioned systems, with the goal of making them safer and more effective. Many detection systems have been developed with great success under spatial contexts; however, there is still significant room for improvement when it comes to temporal context. While there is substantial work regarding this task, there is minimal work done regarding the efficiency of models and their ability to be applied to scenarios that require real-time inference, i.e., autonomous driving where anomalies need to be detected the moment they are within view. To address this gap, we propose STEAD (Spatio-Temporal Efficient Anomaly Detection), whose backbone is developed using (2+1)D Convolutions and Performer Linear Attention, which ensures computational efficiency without sacrificing performance. When tested on the UCF-Crime benchmark, our base model achieves an AUC of 91.34%, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art, and our fast version achieves an AUC of 88.87%, while having 99.70% less parameters and outperforming the previous state-of-the-art as well.

Deep Learning (DL), particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs), have revolutionized this field by enhancing the accuracy of classification tasks. In this work, a novel approach combining a transformer-based Swin-Unet architecture with seasonal synthesized spatio-temporal images has been employed to classify LC types using spatio-temporal features extracted from Sentinel-1 (S1) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, organized into seasonal clusters. The study focuses on three distinct regions - Amazonia, Africa, and Siberia - and evaluates the model performance across diverse ecoregions within these areas. By utilizing seasonal feature sequences instead of dense temporal sequences, notable performance improvements have been achieved, especially in regions with temporal data gaps like Siberia, where S1 data distribution is uneven and non-uniform.

Recent studies have shown that SNNs suffer from severe overfitting, which limits their generalization performance. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective Temporal Reversal Regularization (TRR) to mitigate overfitting during training and facilitate generalization of SNNs. We exploit the inherent temporal properties of SNNs to perform input/feature temporal reversal perturbations, prompting the SNN to produce original-reversed consistent outputs and learn perturbation-invariant representations. To further enhance generalization, we utilize the lightweight ``star operation" (Hadamard product) for feature hybridization of original and temporally reversed spike firing rates, which expands the implicit dimensionality and acts as a spatio-temporal regularizer. We show theoretically that our method is able to tighten the upper bound of the generalization error, and extensive experiments on static/neuromorphic recognition as well as 3D point cloud classification tasks demonstrate its effectiveness, versatility, and adversarial robustness. In particular, our regularization significantly improves the recognition accuracy of low-latency SNN for neuromorphic objects, contributing to the real-world deployment of neuromorphic computational software-hardware integration.</p></details> | 17 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Leveraging Consistent Spatio-Temporal Correspondence for Robust Visual Odometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16923v4)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent approaches to VO have significantly improved performance by using deep networks to predict optical flow between video frames. However, existing methods still suffer from noisy and inconsistent flow matching, making it difficult to handle challenging scenarios and long-sequence estimation. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Spatio-Temporal Visual Odometry (STVO), a novel deep network architecture that effectively leverages inherent spatio-temporal cues to enhance the accuracy and consistency of multi-frame flow matching. With more accurate and consistent flow matching, STVO can achieve better pose estimation through the bundle adjustment (BA). Specifically, STVO introduces two innovative components: 1) the Temporal Propagation Module that utilizes multi-frame information to extract and propagate temporal cues across adjacent frames, maintaining temporal consistency; 2) the Spatial Activation Module that utilizes geometric priors from the depth maps to enhance spatial consistency while filtering out excessive noise and incorrect matches. Our STVO achieves state-of-the-art performance on TUM-RGBD, EuRoc MAV, ETH3D and KITTI Odometry benchmarks. Notably, it improves accuracy by 77.8% on ETH3D benchmark and 38.9% on KITTI Odometry benchmark over the previous best methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[DropletVideo: A Dataset and Approach to Explore Integral Spatio-Temporal Consistent Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06053v1)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal consistency is a critical research topic in video generation. A qualified generated video segment must ensure plot plausibility and coherence while maintaining visual consistency of objects and scenes across varying viewpoints. Prior research, especially in open-source projects, primarily focuses on either temporal or spatial consistency, or their basic combination, such as appending a description of a camera movement after a prompt without constraining the outcomes of this movement. However, camera movement may introduce new objects to the scene or eliminate existing ones, thereby overlaying and affecting the preceding narrative. Especially in videos with numerous camera movements, the interplay between multiple plots becomes increasingly complex. This paper introduces and examines integral spatio-temporal consistency, considering the synergy between plot progression and camera techniques, and the long-term impact of prior content on subsequent generation. Our research encompasses dataset construction through to the development of the model. Initially, we constructed a DropletVideo-10M dataset, which comprises 10 million videos featuring dynamic camera motion and object actions. Each video is annotated with an average caption of 206 words, detailing various camera movements and plot developments. Following this, we developed and trained the DropletVideo model, which excels in preserving spatio-temporal coherence during video generation. The DropletVideo dataset and model are accessible at https://dropletx.github.io.</p></details> |  |

However, understanding the predictions from a model is crucial to ensure reliability and trustworthiness, particularly for high-risk applications, such as healthcare and transport. Few existing methods are able to generate explanations for models trained on continuous-time dynamic graph data and, of these, the computational complexity and lack of suitable explanation objectives pose challenges. In this paper, we propose $\textbf{S}$patio-$\textbf{T}$emporal E$\textbf{X}$planation $\textbf{Search}$ (STX-Search), a novel method for generating instance-level explanations that is applicable to static and dynamic temporal graph structures. We introduce a novel search strategy and objective function, to find explanations that are highly faithful and interpretable. When compared with existing methods, STX-Search produces explanations of higher fidelity whilst optimising explanation size to maintain interpretability.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we demonstrate that effective information compression may occur over time or space during sequences of node communications in distributed algorithms, leading to the concept of spatio-temporal compressors. This abstraction classifies existing compressors as spatio-temporal compressors, with their effectiveness described by constructive stability criteria from nonlinear system theory. Subsequently, we apply these spatio-temporal compressors to standard continuous-time consensus flows and distributed prime-dual flows, establishing conditions ensuring convergence. Additionally, we introduce a novel observer-based distributed primal-dual continuous flow integrated with spatio-temporal compressors, which provides broader convergence conditions. These continuous flows achieve exponential convergence to the global optimum when the objective function is strongly convex and can be discretized using Euler approximations. Finally, numerical simulations illustrate the versatility of the proposed spatio-temporal compressors and verify the convergence of algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2408.02332</p></details> |

State-of-the-art association methods in agriculture are dedicated towards matching larger crops using either high-resolution point clouds or temporally stable features, which are both difficult to obtain for smaller fruit in the field. To address these challenges, we propose a transformer-based architecture that encodes the shape and position of each fruitlet, and propagates and refines these features through a series of transformer encoder layers with alternating self and cross-attention. We demonstrate that our method is able to achieve an F1-score of 92.4% on data collected in a commercial apple orchard and outperforms all baselines and ablations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Advancing Spatio-Temporal Processing in Spiking Neural Networks through Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07517v2)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Implementations of spiking neural networks on neuromorphic hardware promise orders of magnitude less power consumption than their non-spiking counterparts. The standard neuron model for spike-based computation on such systems has long been the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron. A computationally light augmentation of the LIF neuron model with an adaptation mechanism has recently been shown to exhibit superior performance on spatio-temporal processing tasks. The root of the superiority of these so-called adaptive LIF neurons however is not well understood. In this article, we thoroughly analyze the dynamical, computational, and learning properties of adaptive LIF neurons and networks thereof. Our investigation reveals significant challenges related to stability and parameterization when employing the conventional Euler-Forward discretization for this class of models. We report a rigorous theoretical and empirical demonstration that these challenges can be effectively addressed by adopting an alternative discretization approach - the Symplectic Euler method, allowing to improve over state-of-the-art performances on common event-based benchmark datasets. Our further analysis of the computational properties of networks of adaptive LIF neurons shows that they are particularly well suited to exploit the spatio-temporal structure of input sequences without any normalization techniques.</p></details> |  |

Here we present new generally applicable methodology to perform this task. We introduce a parsimonious representation of seasonality and a biologically informed specification of the outbreak component to avoid parameter identifiability issues. We develop a computationally efficient Bayesian inference methodology for the proposed models, including techniques to detect outbreaks by computing marginal posterior probabilities at each spatial location and time point. We show that it is possible to efficiently integrate out the discrete parameters associated with outbreak states, enabling the use of dynamic Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) as a complementary alternative to a hybrid Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. Furthermore, we introduce a robust Bayesian model comparison framework based on importance sampling to approximate model evidence in high-dimensional space. The performance of our methodology is validated through systematic simulation studies, where simulated outbreaks were successfully detected, and our model comparison strategy demonstrates strong reliability. We also apply our new methodology to monthly incidence data on invasive meningococcal disease from 28 European countries. The results highlight outbreaks across multiple countries and months, with model comparison analysis showing that the new specification outperforms previous approaches.

To achieve this goal, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Memory Agent (STMA), a novel framework designed to enhance task planning and execution by integrating spatio-temporal memory. STMA is built upon three critical components: (1) a spatio-temporal memory module that captures historical and environmental changes in real time, (2) a dynamic knowledge graph that facilitates adaptive spatial reasoning, and (3) a planner-critic mechanism that iteratively refines task strategies. We evaluate STMA in the TextWorld environment on 32 tasks, involving multi-step planning and exploration under varying levels of complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that STMA achieves a 31.25% improvement in success rate and a 24.7% increase in average score compared to the state-of-the-art model. The results highlight the effectiveness of spatio-temporal memory in advancing the memory capabilities of embodied agents.</p></details> |  |

To address this limitation, we explore automated pain detection using facial expressions. Our study leverages deep learning techniques to improve pain assessment by analyzing facial images from the Pain Emotion Faces Database (PEMF). We propose two novel approaches1: (1) a hybrid ConvNeXt model combined with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) blocks to analyze video frames and predict pain presence, and (2) a Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolution Network (STGCN) integrated with LSTM to process landmarks from facial images for pain detection. Our work represents the first use of the PEMF dataset for binary pain classification and demonstrates the effectiveness of these models through extensive experimentation. The results highlight the potential of combining spatial and temporal features for enhanced pain detection, offering a promising advancement in objective pain assessment methodologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables.

| **[STGFormer: Spatio-Temporal GraphFormer for 3D Human Pose Estimation in Video](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10099v2)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The current methods of video-based 3D human pose estimation have achieved significant progress.However, they still face pressing challenges, such as the underutilization of spatiotemporal bodystructure features in transformers and the inadequate granularity of spatiotemporal interaction modeling in graph convolutional networks, which leads to pervasive depth ambiguity in monocular 3D human pose estimation. To address these limitations, this paper presents the Spatio-Temporal GraphFormer framework (STGFormer) for 3D human pose estimation in videos. First, we introduce a Spatio-Temporal criss-cross Graph (STG) attention mechanism, designed to more effectively leverage the inherent graph priors of the human body within continuous sequence distributions while capturing spatiotemporal long-range dependencies. Next, we present a dual-path Modulated Hop-wise Regular GCN (MHR-GCN) to independently process temporal and spatial dimensions in parallel, preserving features rich in temporal dynamics and the original or high-dimensional representations of spatial structures. Furthermore, the module leverages modulation to optimize parameter efficiency and incorporates spatiotemporal hop-wise skip connections to capture higher-order information. Finally, we demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Human3.6M and MPIINF-3DHP datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[H-FLTN: A Privacy-Preserving Hierarchical Framework for Electric Vehicle Spatio-Temporal Charge Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18697v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs) poses critical challenges for energy providers, particularly in predicting charging time (temporal prediction), ensuring user privacy, and managing resources efficiently in mobility-driven networks. This paper introduces the Hierarchical Federated Learning Transformer Network (H-FLTN) framework to address these challenges. H-FLTN employs a three-tier hierarchical architecture comprising EVs, community Distributed Energy Resource Management Systems (DERMS), and the Energy Provider Data Centre (EPDC) to enable accurate spatio-temporal predictions of EV charging needs while preserving privacy. Temporal prediction is enhanced using Transformer-based learning, capturing complex dependencies in charging behavior. Privacy is ensured through Secure Aggregation, Additive Secret Sharing, and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Sharing with Augmentation, which allow only secret shares of model weights to be exchanged while securing all transmissions. To improve training efficiency and resource management, H-FLTN integrates Dynamic Client Capping Mechanism (DCCM) and Client Rotation Management (CRM), ensuring that training remains both computationally and temporally efficient as the number of participating EVs increases. DCCM optimises client participation by limiting excessive computational loads, while CRM balances training contributions across epochs, preventing imbalanced participation. Our simulation results based on large-scale empirical vehicle mobility data reveal that DCCM and CRM reduce the training time complexity with increasing EVs from linear to constant. Its integration into real-world smart city infrastructure enhances energy demand forecasting, resource allocation, and grid stability, ensuring reliability and sustainability in future mobility ecosystems.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 7 tables, 2 figures, Journal Paper</p></details> |

Recently, advancements in monitoring technology have facilitated the effective recording of nuclear radiation levels and related factors, such as weather conditions. The abundance of monitoring data enables the development of accurate and reliable nuclear radiation forecasting models, which play a crucial role in informing decision-making for individuals and governments. However, this task is challenging due to the imbalanced distribution of monitoring stations over a wide spatial range and the non-stationary radiation variation patterns. In this study, we introduce NRFormer, a novel framework tailored for the nationwide prediction of nuclear radiation variations. By integrating a non-stationary temporal attention module, an imbalance-aware spatial attention module, and a radiation propagation prompting module, NRFormer collectively captures complex spatio-temporal dynamics of nuclear radiation. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework against 11 baselines.</p></details> |  |

The objective is to provide a quality score to ensure correct performance and achieve desired results. To achieve this goal, a new graph-based model, the Dense Spatio-Temporal Graph Conv-GRU Network with Transformer, is introduced. This model combines a modified version of STGCN and transformer architectures for efficient handling of spatio-temporal data. The key idea is to consider skeleton data respecting its non-linear structure as a graph and detecting joints playing the main role in each rehabilitation exercise. Dense connections and GRU mechanisms are used to rapidly process large 3D skeleton inputs and effectively model temporal dynamics. The transformer encoder's attention mechanism focuses on relevant parts of the input sequence, making it useful for evaluating rehabilitation exercises. The evaluation of our proposed approach on the KIMORE and UI-PRMD datasets highlighted its potential, surpassing state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and computational time. This resulted in faster and more accurate learning and assessment of rehabilitation exercises. Additionally, our model provides valuable feedback through qualitative illustrations, effectively highlighting the significance of joints in specific exercises.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, Computers in Biology and Medicine Journal</p></details> |

However, traditional approaches to assess patient actions often rely on manual observation and scoring, which are subjective and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose an automated approach for patient action assessment using a Multi-Residual Spatio Temporal Graph Network (MR-STGN) that incorporates both angular and positional 3D skeletons. The MR-STGN is specifically designed to capture the spatio-temporal dynamics of patient actions. It achieves this by integrating information from multiple residual layers, with each layer extracting features at distinct levels of abstraction. Furthermore, we integrate an attention fusion mechanism into the network, which facilitates the adaptive weighting of various features. This empowers the model to concentrate on the most pertinent aspects of the patient's movements, offering precise instructions regarding specific body parts or movements that require attention. Ablation studies are conducted to analyze the impact of individual components within the proposed model. We evaluate our model on the UI-PRMD dataset demonstrating its performance in accurately predicting real-time patient action scores, surpassing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

However, maintaining its adaptability under diverse object properties and complex working conditions remains challenging. This article highlights the importance of completely representing spatio-temporal features of slip, and proposes a novel approach for incipient slip modeling and detection. Based on the analysis of localized displacement phenomenon, we establish the relationship between the characteristic strain rate extreme events and the local slip state. This approach enables the detection of both the spatial distribution and temporal dynamics of stick-slip regions. Also, the proposed method can be applied to strain distribution sensing devices, such as vision-based tactile sensors. Simulations and prototype experiments validated the effectiveness of this approach under varying contact conditions, including different contact geometries, friction coefficients, and combined loads. Experiments demonstrated that this method not only accurately and reliably delineates incipient slip, but also facilitates friction parameter estimation and adaptive grasping control.</p></details> | 21 pages, 19 figures |

However, most approaches are based on the assumption of the availability of and accessibility to a sufficiently dense data source, which is rather the rare case in reality. Traffic sensors in road networks are generally highly sparse in their distribution: fleet-based traffic sensing is sparse in space but also sparse in time. There are also other traffic application, besides road traffic, like moving objects in the marine space, where observations are sparsely and arbitrarily distributed in space. In this paper, we tackle the problem of traffic prediction on sparse and spatially irregular and non-deterministic traffic observations. We draw a border between imputations and this work as we consider high sparsity rates and no fixed sensor locations. We advance correlation mining methods with a Sparse Unstructured Spatio Temporal Reconstruction (SUSTeR) framework that reconstructs traffic states from sparse non-stationary observations. For the prediction the framework creates a hidden context traffic state which is enriched in a residual fashion with each observation. Such an assimilated hidden traffic state can be used by existing traffic prediction methods to predict future traffic states. We query these states with query locations from the spatial domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted and presented at ACM SIGSPATIAL '23</p></details> |

However, existing whole-body-object interaction video benchmarks overlook the truth that open-world objects are diverse, that is, they usually provide limited and predefined object classes. Therefore, we introduce a new open-world benchmark: Grounding Interacted Objects (GIO) including 1,098 interacted objects class and 290K interacted object boxes annotation. Accordingly, an object grounding task is proposed expecting vision systems to discover interacted objects. Even though today's detectors and grounding methods have succeeded greatly, they perform unsatisfactorily in localizing diverse and rare objects in GIO. This profoundly reveals the limitations of current vision systems and poses a great challenge. Thus, we explore leveraging spatio-temporal cues to address object grounding and propose a 4D question-answering framework (4D-QA) to discover interacted objects from diverse videos. Our method demonstrates significant superiority in extensive experiments compared to current baselines.

HD EEG devices improve the spatial resolution of EEG by placing more electrodes on the scalp, which meet the requirements of clinical diagnostic applications such as epilepsy focus localization. However, this technique faces challenges, such as high acquisition costs and limited usage scenarios. In this paper, spatio-temporal adaptive diffusion models (STAD) are proposed to pioneer the use of diffusion models for achieving spatial SR reconstruction from low-resolution (LR, 64 channels or fewer) EEG to high-resolution (HR, 256 channels) EEG. Specifically, a spatio-temporal condition module is designed to extract the spatio-temporal features of LR EEG, which are then used as conditional inputs to direct the reverse denoising process. Additionally, a multi-scale Transformer denoising module is constructed to leverage multi-scale convolution blocks and cross-attention-based diffusion Transformer blocks for conditional guidance to generate subject-adaptive SR EEG. Experimental results demonstrate that the STAD significantly enhances the spatial resolution of LR EEG and quantitatively outperforms existing methods. Furthermore, STAD demonstrate their value by applying synthetic SR EEG to classification and source localization tasks, indicating their potential to substantially boost the spatial resolution of EEG.</p></details> |  |

With around 2000 ball events per game, their precise and exhaustive annotation based on a monocular video stream remains a tedious and costly manual task. While state-of-the-art spatio-temporal action detection methods show promise for automating this task, they lack contextual understanding of the game. Assuming professional players' behaviors are interdependent, we hypothesize that incorporating surrounding players' information such as positions, velocity and team membership can enhance purely visual predictions. We propose a spatio-temporal action detection approach that combines visual and game state information via Graph Neural Networks trained end-to-end with state-of-the-art 3D CNNs, demonstrating improved metrics through game state integration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Fixed Variables: Expanding-variate Time Series Forecasting via Flat Scheme and Spatio-temporal Focal Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15296v1)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate Time Series Forecasting (MTSF) has long been a key research focus. Traditionally, these studies assume a fixed number of variables, but in real-world applications, Cyber-Physical Systems often expand as new sensors are deployed, increasing variables in MTSF. In light of this, we introduce a novel task, Expanding-variate Time Series Forecasting (EVTSF). This task presents unique challenges, specifically (1) handling inconsistent data shapes caused by adding new variables, and (2) addressing imbalanced spatio-temporal learning, where expanding variables have limited observed data due to the necessity for timely operation. To address these challenges, we propose STEV, a flexible spatio-temporal forecasting framework. STEV includes a new Flat Scheme to tackle the inconsistent data shape issue, which extends the graph-based spatio-temporal modeling architecture into 1D space by flattening the 2D samples along the variable dimension, making the model variable-scale-agnostic while still preserving dynamic spatial correlations through a holistic graph. We introduce a novel Spatio-temporal Focal Learning strategy that incorporates a negative filter to resolve potential conflicts between contrastive learning and graph representation, and a focal contrastive loss as its core to guide the framework to focus on optimizing the expanding variables. We benchmark EVTSF performance using three real-world datasets and compare it against three potential solutions employing SOTA MTSF models tailored for EVSTF. Experimental results show that STEV significantly outperforms its competitors, particularly on expanding variables. Notably, STEV, with only 5% of observations from the expanding period, is on par with SOTA MTSF models trained with complete observations. Further exploration of various expanding strategies underscores the generalizability of STEV in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

In a graphon particle system, the interactions among particles are characterized by the coupled mean field terms through an underlying graphon and the randomness of the coefficients comes from the stochastic processes associated with the particle labels. By constructing two-level approximated sequences converging in 2-Wasserstein distance, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the system. Besides, by constructing two-level approximated functions converging to the graphon mean field terms, we establish the law of large numbers, which reveals that if the number of particles tends to infinity and the discretization step tends to zero, then the discrete-time interacting particle system over a large-scale network converges to the graphon particle system. As a byproduct, we discover that the graphon particle system can describe the limiting dynamics of the distributed stochastic gradient descent algorithm over the large-scale network and prove that if the gradients of the local cost functions are Lipschitz continuous, then the graphon particle system can be regarded as the spatio-temporal approximation of the discrete-time distributed stochastic gradient descent algorithm as the number of network nodes tends to infinity and the algorithm step size tends to zero.</p></details> |  |

Compared with the traditional trajectory composed of a set of point-estimates obtained by a tracker in the measurement time-series, the trajectory that our series of studies including this paper pursued is given by a curve function of time (FoT). The trajectory FoT provides complete information of the movement of the target over time and can be used to infer the state corresponding to arbitrary time, not only at the measurement time. However, there are no metrics available for comparing and evaluating the trajectory FoT. To address this lacuna, we propose a metric denominated as the spatiotemporal-aligned trajectory integral distance (Star-ID). The StarID associates and aligns the estimated and actual trajectories in the spatio-temporal domain and distinguishes between the time-aligned and unaligned segments in calculating the spatial divergence including false alarm, miss-detection and localization errors. The effectiveness of the proposed distance metric and the time-averaged version is validated through theoretical analysis and numerical examples of a single target or multiple targets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Part ...</summary><p>Part I of a series of companion papers; 11 pages, 10 figures</p></details> |

Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA) sequences, recognized as the gold standard for diagnosing CVDs, can clearly visualize the dynamic flow and reveal pathological conditions within the cerebrovasculature. Therefore, precise segmentation of cerebral arteries (CAs) and classification between their main trunks and branches are crucial for physicians to accurately quantify diseases. However, achieving accurate CA segmentation in DSA sequences remains a challenging task due to small vessels with low contrast, and ambiguity between vessels and residual skull structures. Moreover, the lack of publicly available datasets limits exploration in the field. In this paper, we introduce a DSA Sequence-based Cerebral Artery segmentation dataset (DSCA), the publicly accessible dataset designed specifically for pixel-level semantic segmentation of CAs. Additionally, we propose DSANet, a spatio-temporal network for CA segmentation in DSA sequences. Unlike existing DSA segmentation methods that focus only on a single frame, the proposed DSANet introduces a separate temporal encoding branch to capture dynamic vessel details across multiple frames. To enhance small vessel segmentation and improve vessel connectivity, we design a novel TemporalFormer module to capture global context and correlations among sequential frames. Furthermore, we develop a Spatio-Temporal Fusion (STF) module to effectively integrate spatial and temporal features from the encoder.

However, existing approaches often produce overly conservative uncertainty intervals at individual spatial units and fail to properly capture uncertainties when aggregating predictions across different spatial scales. This paper presents a novel hierarchical spatio-temporal model based on the conformal prediction framework to address these challenges. Our approach generates circuit-level DER growth predictions and efficiently aggregates them to the substation level while maintaining statistical validity through a tailored non-conformity score. Applied to a decade of DER installation data from a local utility network, our method demonstrates superior performance over existing approaches, particularly in reducing prediction interval widths while maintaining coverage.</p></details> |  |

They primarily emphasize temporal sharing while overlooking spatial and spectral dimensions. We propose an adaptive, AI-driven spectrum-sharing framework within the O-RAN architecture, integrating discriminative and generative AI (GenAI) to forecast spectrum needs across multiple timescales and spatial granularities. A marketplace model, managed by an authorized spectrum broker, enables operators to trade spectrum dynamically, balancing static assignments with real-time trading. GenAI enhances traffic prediction, spectrum estimation, and allocation, optimizing utilization while reducing costs. This modular, flexible approach fosters operator collaboration, maximizing efficiency and revenue. A key research challenge is refining allocation granularity and spatio-temporal dynamics beyond existing models.</p></details> |  |

Contrary to conventional single bit quantizers which only utilize the transmitted bit to convey information, in our codebook, we use an additional `$\emptyset$' symbol to encode the event of \emph{not transmitting}. Thus, our quantization functions are composed of three decision regions as opposed to the conventional two regions. First, we propose an optimum quantization method in which the optimum quantization functions are obtained by tracking the distributions of the quantization error. However, this method requires a high computational cost and might not be applicable for energy-conserving sensors. Thus, we propose two additional low complexity methods. In the last-bit aware method, three predefined quantization functions are available to both devices, and they switch the quantization function based on the last transmitted bit. With the Gaussian approximation method, we calculate a single quantization function by assuming that the quantization error can be approximated as Gaussian. While previous methods require a constant delay assumption, this method also works for random delay. We observe that all three methods perform similarly in terms of mean-squared error and transmission cost.</p></details> |  |

A Study on Water Level Forecasting in Everglades](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01415v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Everglades play a crucial role in flood and drought regulation, water resource planning, and ecosystem management in the surrounding regions. However, traditional physics-based and statistical methods for predicting water levels often face significant challenges, including high computational costs and limited adaptability to diverse or unforeseen conditions. Recent advancements in large time series models have demonstrated the potential to address these limitations, with state-of-the-art deep learning and foundation models achieving remarkable success in time series forecasting across various domains. Despite this progress, their application to critical environmental systems, such as the Everglades, remains underexplored. In this study, we fill the gap by investigating twelve task-specific models and five time series foundation models across six categories for a real-world application focused on water level prediction in the Everglades. Our primary results show that the foundation model, Chronos, significantly outperforms all other models while the remaining foundation models exhibit relatively poor performance. Moreover, the performance of task-specific models varies with the model architectures. Lastly, we discuss the possible reasons for the varying performance of models.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Efficient Real-Time Planning Method for Swarm Robotics Based on an Optimal Virtual Tube](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01380v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Swarm robotics navigating through unknown obstacle environments is an emerging research area that faces challenges. Performing tasks in such environments requires swarms to achieve autonomous localization, perception, decision-making, control, and planning. The limited computational resources of onboard platforms present significant challenges for planning and control. Reactive planners offer low computational demands and high re-planning frequencies but lack predictive capabilities, often resulting in local minima. Long-horizon planners, on the other hand, can perform multi-step predictions to reduce deadlocks but cost much computation, leading to lower re-planning frequencies. This paper proposes a real-time optimal virtual tube planning method for swarm robotics in unknown environments, which generates approximate solutions for optimal trajectories through affine functions. As a result, the computational complexity of approximate solutions is $O(n_t)$, where $n_t$ is the number of parameters in the trajectory, thereby significantly reducing the overall computational burden. By integrating reactive methods, the proposed method enables low-computation, safe swarm motion in unknown environments. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through several simulations and experiments.</p></details> | 18 pages, 21 figures |
| **[Weight-calibrated estimation for factor models of high-dimensional time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01357v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The factor modeling for high-dimensional time series is powerful in discovering latent common components for dimension reduction and information extraction. Most available estimation methods can be divided into two categories: the covariance-based under asymptotically-identifiable assumption and the autocovariance-based with white idiosyncratic noise. This paper follows the autocovariance-based framework and develops a novel weight-calibrated method to improve the estimation performance. It adopts a linear projection to tackle high-dimensionality, and employs a reduced-rank autoregression formulation. The asymptotic theory of the proposed method is established, relaxing the assumption on white noise. Additionally, we make the first attempt in the literature by providing a systematic theoretical comparison among the covariance-based, the standard autocovariance-based, and our proposed weight-calibrated autocovariance-based methods in the presence of factors with different strengths. Extensive simulations are conducted to showcase the superior finite-sample performance of our proposed method, as well as to validate the newly established theory. The superiority of our proposal is further illustrated through the analysis of one financial and one macroeconomic data sets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Early Detection of Patient Deterioration from Real-Time Wearable Monitoring System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01305v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Early detection of patient deterioration is crucial for reducing mortality rates. Heart rate data has shown promise in assessing patient health, and wearable devices offer a cost-effective solution for real-time monitoring. However, extracting meaningful insights from diverse heart rate data and handling missing values in wearable device data remain key challenges. To address these challenges, we propose TARL, an innovative approach that models the structural relationships of representative subsequences, known as shapelets, in heart rate time series. TARL creates a shapelet-transition knowledge graph to model shapelet dynamics in heart rate time series, indicating illness progression and potential future changes. We further introduce a transition-aware knowledge embedding to reinforce relationships among shapelets and quantify the impact of missing values, enabling the formulation of comprehensive heart rate representations. These representations capture explanatory structures and predict future heart rate trends, aiding early illness detection. We collaborate with physicians and nurses to gather ICU patient heart rate data from wearables and diagnostic metrics assessing illness severity for evaluating deterioration. Experiments on real-world ICU data demonstrate that TARL achieves both high reliability and early detection. A case study further showcases TARL's explainable detection process, highlighting its potential as an AI-driven tool to assist clinicians in recognizing early signs of patient deterioration.</p></details> |  |
| **[A CFL-type Condition and Theoretical Insights for Discrete-Time Sparse Full-Order Model Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01244v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we investigate the data-driven inference of a discrete-time dynamical system via a sparse Full-Order Model (sFOM). We first formulate the involved Least Squares (LS) problem and discuss the need for regularization, indicating a connection between the typically employed $l_2$ regularization and the stability of the inferred discrete-time sFOM. We then provide theoretical insights considering the consistency and stability properties of the inferred numerical schemes that form the sFOM and exemplify them via illustrative, 1D test cases of linear diffusion and linear advection. For linear advection, we analytically derive a "sampling CFL" condition, which dictates a bound for the ratio of spatial and temporal discretization steps in the training data that ensures stability of the inferred sFOM. Finally, we investigate the sFOM inference for two nonlinear problems, namely a 2D Burgers' test case and the incompressible flow in an oscillating lid driven cavity, and draw connections between the theoretical findings and the properties of the inferred, nonlinear sFOMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Space-Time Trade-off for Fast Self-Stabilizing Leader Election in Population Protocols](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01210v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of self-stabilizing leader election in the population model by Angluin, Aspnes, Diamadi, Fischer, and Peralta (JDistComp '06). The population model is a well-established and powerful model for asynchronous, distributed computation with a large number of applications. For self-stabilizing leader election, the population of $n$ anonymous agents, interacting in uniformly random pairs, must stabilize with a single leader from any possible initial configuration. The focus of this paper is to develop time-efficient self-stabilizing protocols whilst minimizing the number of states. We present a parametrized protocol, which, for a suitable setting, achieves the asymptotically optimal time $O(\log n)$ using $2^{O(n^2\log n)}$ states (throughout the paper, ``time'' refers to ``parallel time'', i.e., the number of pairwise interactions divided by $n$). This is a significant improvement over the previously best protocol Sublinear-Time-SSR due to Burman, Chen, Chen, Doty, Nowak, Severson, and Xu (PODC '21), which requires $2^{O(n^{\log n}\log n)}$ states for the same time bound. In general, for $1\le r\le n/2$, our protocol requires $2^{O(r^2\log{n})}$ states and stabilizes in time $O((n\log{n})/r)$, w.h.p.; the above result is achieved for $r=\Theta(n)$. For $r=\log^2n$ our protocol requires only sub-linear time using only $2^{O(\log^3 n)}$ states, resolving an open problem stated in that paper. Sublinear-Time-SSR requires $O(\log n\cdot n^{1/(H+1)})$ time using $2^{\Theta(n^H) \cdot \log n}$ states for all $1\le H\le\Theta(\log n)$. Similar to previous works, it solves leader election by assigning a unique rank from $1$ through $n$ to each agent. The principal bottleneck for self-stabilizing ranking usually is to detect if there exist agents with the same rank. One of our main conceptual contributions is a novel technique for collision detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published at PODC'25</p></details> |
| **[Timeout Asynchronous Session Types: Safe Asynchronous Mixed-Choice For Timed Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11197v4)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mixed-choice has long been barred from models of asynchronous communication since it compromises the decidability of key properties of communicating finite-state machines. Session types inherit this restriction, which precludes them from fully modelling timeouts -- a core property of web and cloud services. To address this deficiency, we present (binary) Timeout Asynchronous Session Types (TOAST) as an extension to (binary) asynchronous timed session types, that permits mixed-choice. TOAST deploys timing constraints to regulate the use of mixed-choice so as to preserve communication safety. We provide a new behavioural semantics for TOAST which guarantees progress in the presence of mixed-choice. Building upon TOAST, we provide a calculus featuring process timers which is capable of modelling timeouts using a receive-after pattern, much like Erlang, and capture the correspondence with TOAST specifications via a type system for which we prove subject reduction.</p></details> | <details><summary>65 pa...</summary><p>65 pages, revised for LMCS (round 2)</p></details> |
| **[DConAD: A Differencing-based Contrastive Representation Learning Framework for Time Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14204v2)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series anomaly detection holds notable importance for risk identification and fault detection across diverse application domains. Unsupervised learning methods have become popular because they have no requirement for labels. However, due to the challenges posed by the multiplicity of abnormal patterns, the sparsity of anomalies, and the growth of data scale and complexity, these methods often fail to capture robust and representative dependencies within the time series for identifying anomalies. To enhance the ability of models to capture normal patterns of time series and avoid the retrogression of modeling ability triggered by the dependencies on high-quality prior knowledge, we propose a differencing-based contrastive representation learning framework for time series anomaly detection (DConAD). Specifically, DConAD generates differential data to provide additional information about time series and utilizes transformer-based architecture to capture spatiotemporal dependencies, which enhances the robustness of unbiased representation learning ability. Furthermore, DConAD implements a novel KL divergence-based contrastive learning paradigm that only uses positive samples to avoid deviation from reconstruction and deploys the stop-gradient strategy to compel convergence. Extensive experiments on five public datasets show the superiority and effectiveness of DConAD compared with nine baselines. The code is available at https://github.com/shaieesss/DConAD.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distilling Two-Timed Flow Models by Separately Matching Initial and Terminal Velocities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01169v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A flow matching model learns a time-dependent vector field $v_t(x)$ that generates a probability path $\{ p_t \}_{0 \leq t \leq 1}$ that interpolates between a well-known noise distribution ($p_0$) and the data distribution ($p_1$). It can be distilled into a \emph{two-timed flow model} (TTFM) $\phi_{s,x}(t)$ that can transform a sample belonging to the distribution at an initial time $s$ to another belonging to the distribution at a terminal time $t$ in one function evaluation. We present a new loss function for TTFM distillation called the \emph{initial/terminal velocity matching} (ITVM) loss that extends the Lagrangian Flow Map Distillation (LFMD) loss proposed by Boffi et al. by adding redundant terms to match the initial velocities at time $s$, removing the derivative from the terminal velocity term at time $t$, and using a version of the model under training, stabilized by exponential moving averaging (EMA), to compute the target terminal average velocity. Preliminary experiments show that our loss leads to better few-step generation performance on multiple types of datasets and model architectures over baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Empirical Comparison of Lightweight Forecasting Models for Seasonal and Non-Seasonal Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01163v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate time series forecasting is essential in many real-time applications that demand both high predictive accuracy and computational efficiency. This study provides an empirical comparison between a Polynomial Classifier and a Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN) across four real-world time series datasets (weather conditions, gold prices, crude oil prices, and beer production volumes) that cover both seasonal and nonseasonal patterns. Model performance is evaluated by forecasting accuracy (using Mean Absolute Error, Root Mean Squared Error, and Coefficient of Variation of Root Mean Squared Error) and computational time to assess each model's viability for real time forecasting. The results show that the PC yields more accurate and faster forecasts for non seasonal series, whereas the RBFNN performs better on series with pronounced seasonal patterns. From an interpretability standpoint, the polynomial model offers a simpler, more transparent structure (in contrast to the black box nature of neural network), which is advantageous for understanding and trust in real time decision making. The performance differences between PC and RBFNN are statistically significant, as confirmed by paired t tests and Wilcoxon signed rank tests. These findings provide practical guidance for model selection in time series forecasting, indicating that PC may be preferable for quick, interpretable forecasts in non-seasonal contexts, whereas RBFNN is superior for capturing complex seasonal behaviors</p></details> |  |
| **[Generating Building-Level Heat Demand Time Series by Combining Occupancy Simulations and Thermal Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05427v2)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite various efforts, decarbonizing the heating sector remains a significant challenge. To tackle it by smart planning, the availability of highly resolved heating demand data is key. Several existing models provide heating demand only for specific applications. Typically, they either offer time series for a larger area or annual demand data on a building level, but not both simultaneously. Additionally, the diversity in heating demand across different buildings is often not considered. To address these limitations, this paper presents a novel method for generating temporally resolved heat demand time series at the building level using publicly available data. The approach integrates a thermal building model with stochastic occupancy simulations that account for variability in user behavior. As a result, the tool serves as a cost-effective resource for cross-sectoral energy system planning and policy development, particularly with a focus on the heating sector. The obtained data can be used to assess the impact of renovation and retrofitting strategies, or to analyze district heating expansion. To illustrate the potential applications of this approach, we conducted a case study in Puertollano (Spain), where we prepared a dataset of heating demand with hourly resolution for each of 9,298 residential buildings. This data was then used to compare two different pathways for the thermal renovation of these buildings. By relying on publicly available data, this method can be adapted and applied to various European regions, offering broad usability in energy system optimization and analysis of decarbonization strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dual-Forecaster: A Multimodal Time Series Model Integrating Descriptive and Predictive Texts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01135v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most existing single-modal time series models rely solely on numerical series, which suffer from the limitations imposed by insufficient information. Recent studies have revealed that multimodal models can address the core issue by integrating textual information. However, these models focus on either historical or future textual information, overlooking the unique contributions each plays in time series forecasting. Besides, these models fail to grasp the intricate relationships between textual and time series data, constrained by their moderate capacity for multimodal comprehension. To tackle these challenges, we propose Dual-Forecaster, a pioneering multimodal time series model that combines both descriptively historical textual information and predictive textual insights, leveraging advanced multimodal comprehension capability empowered by three well-designed cross-modality alignment techniques. Our comprehensive evaluations on fifteen multimodal time series datasets demonstrate that Dual-Forecaster is a distinctly effective multimodal time series model that outperforms or is comparable to other state-of-the-art models, highlighting the superiority of integrating textual information for time series forecasting. This work opens new avenues in the integration of textual information with numerical time series data for multimodal time series analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards an Interpretable Analysis for Estimating the Resolution Time of Software Issues](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01108v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lately, software development has become a predominantly online process, as more teams host and monitor their projects remotely. Sophisticated approaches employ issue tracking systems like Jira, predicting the time required to resolve issues and effectively assigning and prioritizing project tasks. Several methods have been developed to address this challenge, widely known as bug-fix time prediction, yet they exhibit significant limitations. Most consider only textual issue data and/or use techniques that overlook the semantics and metadata of issues (e.g., priority or assignee expertise). Many also fail to distinguish actual development effort from administrative delays, including assignment and review phases, leading to estimates that do not reflect the true effort needed. In this work, we build an issue monitoring system that extracts the actual effort required to fix issues on a per-project basis. Our approach employs topic modeling to capture issue semantics and leverages metadata (components, labels, priority, issue type, assignees) for interpretable resolution time analysis. Final predictions are generated by an aggregated model, enabling contributors to make informed decisions. Evaluation across multiple projects shows the system can effectively estimate resolution time and provide valuable insights.</p></details> |  |

While achieving optimal accuracy, existing CTTA approaches present poor real-world applicability on resource-constrained edge devices, due to the substantial memory overhead and energy consumption. In this work, we first introduce a novel paradigm -- on-demand TTA -- which triggers adaptation only when a significant domain shift is detected. Then, we present OD-TTA, an on-demand TTA framework for accurate and efficient adaptation on edge devices. OD-TTA comprises three innovative techniques: 1) a lightweight domain shift detection mechanism to activate TTA only when it is needed, drastically reducing the overall computation overhead, 2) a source domain selection module that chooses an appropriate source model for adaptation, ensuring high and robust accuracy, 3) a decoupled Batch Normalization (BN) update scheme to enable memory-efficient adaptation with small batch sizes. Extensive experiments show that OD-TTA achieves comparable and even better performance while reducing the energy and computation overhead remarkably, making TTA a practical reality.</p></details> |  |

The design achieves fixed-angle turns in 2D space. Through experimental validation, we demonstrate repeated 21-degree turns using a Dubins path planner with minimal error, establishing a foundation for more versatile Vine robot applications. This approach combines real-time control, multi-degree-of-freedom steering, and structural flexibility, addressing key challenges in soft robotics.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages 8 figures; submitted to IROS2025</p></details> |

However, rapid advancements have produced a diversity of seemingly unrelated architectures, such as Transformers and recurrent alternatives. In this paper, we introduce a unifying framework to understand and derive these sequence models, inspired by the empirical importance of associative recall, the capability to retrieve contextually relevant tokens. We formalize associative recall as a two-step process, memorization and retrieval, casting memorization as a regression problem. Layers that combine these two steps perform associative recall via ``test-time regression'' over its input tokens. Prominent layers, including linear attention, state-space models, fast-weight programmers, online learners, and softmax attention, arise as special cases defined by three design choices: the regression weights, the regressor function class, and the test-time optimization algorithm. Our approach clarifies how linear attention fails to capture inter-token correlations and offers a mathematical justification for the empirical effectiveness of query-key normalization in softmax attention. Further, it illuminates unexplored regions within the design space, which we use to derive novel higher-order generalizations of softmax attention. Beyond unification, our work bridges sequence modeling with classic regression methods, a field with extensive literature, paving the way for developing more powerful and theoretically principled architectures.</p></details> |  |
| **[FreCT: Frequency-augmented Convolutional Transformer for Robust Time Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00941v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series anomaly detection is critical for system monitoring and risk identification, across various domains, such as finance and healthcare. However, for most reconstruction-based approaches, detecting anomalies remains a challenge due to the complexity of sequential patterns in time series data. On the one hand, reconstruction-based techniques are susceptible to computational deviation stemming from anomalies, which can lead to impure representations of normal sequence patterns. On the other hand, they often focus on the time-domain dependencies of time series, while ignoring the alignment of frequency information beyond the time domain. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Frequency-augmented Convolutional Transformer (FreCT). FreCT utilizes patch operations to generate contrastive views and employs an improved Transformer architecture integrated with a convolution module to capture long-term dependencies while preserving local topology information. The introduced frequency analysis based on Fourier transformation could enhance the model's ability to capture crucial characteristics beyond the time domain. To protect the training quality from anomalies and improve the robustness, FreCT deploys stop-gradient Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and absolute error to optimize consistency information in both time and frequency domains. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that FreCT outperforms existing methods in identifying anomalies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Non-Adaptive Cryptanalytic Time-Space Lower Bounds via a Shearer-like Inequality for Permutations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00894v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The power of adaptivity in algorithms has been intensively studied in diverse areas of theoretical computer science. In this paper, we obtain a number of sharp lower bound results which show that adaptivity provides a significant extra power in cryptanalytic time-space tradeoffs with (possibly unlimited) preprocessing time. Most notably, we consider the discrete logarithm (DLOG) problem in a generic group of $N$ elements. The classical `baby-step giant-step' algorithm for the problem has time complexity $T=O(\sqrt{N})$, uses $O(\sqrt{N})$ bits of space (up to logarithmic factors in $N$) and achieves constant success probability. We examine a generalized setting where an algorithm obtains an advice string of $S$ bits and is allowed to make $T$ arbitrary non-adaptive queries that depend on the advice string (but not on the challenge group element). We show that in this setting, the $T=O(\sqrt{N})$ online time complexity of the baby-step giant-step algorithm cannot be improved, unless the advice string is more than $\Omega(\sqrt{N})$ bits long. This lies in stark contrast with the classical adaptive Pollard's rho algorithm for DLOG, which can exploit preprocessing to obtain the tradeoff curve $ST^2=O(N)$. We obtain similar sharp lower bounds for several other cryptanalytic problems. To obtain our results, we present a new model that allows analyzing non-adaptive preprocessing algorithms for a wide array of search and decision problems in a unified way. Since previous proof techniques inherently cannot distinguish between adaptive and non-adaptive algorithms for the problems in our model, they cannot be used to obtain our results. Consequently, our proof uses a variant of Shearer's lemma for this setting, due to Barthe, Cordero-Erausquin, Ledoux, and Maurey (2011). This seems to be the first time a variant of Shearer's lemma for permutations is used in an algorithmic context.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Time Encoding via Learnable Transformation Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00887v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effectively modeling time information and incorporating it into applications or models involving chronologically occurring events is crucial. Real-world scenarios often involve diverse and complex time patterns, which pose significant challenges for time encoding methods. While previous methods focus on capturing time patterns, many rely on specific inductive biases, such as using trigonometric functions to model periodicity. This narrow focus on single-pattern modeling makes them less effective in handling the diversity and complexities of real-world time patterns. In this paper, we investigate to improve the existing commonly used time encoding methods and introduce Learnable Transformation-based Generalized Time Encoding (LeTE). We propose using deep function learning techniques to parameterize non-linear transformations in time encoding, making them learnable and capable of modeling generalized time patterns, including diverse and complex temporal dynamics. By enabling learnable transformations, LeTE encompasses previous methods as specific cases and allows seamless integration into a wide range of tasks. Through extensive experiments across diverse domains, we demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of LeTE.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 13 figures, 10 tables</p></details> |
| **[Caging in Time: A Framework for Robust Object Manipulation under Uncertainties and Limited Robot Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16481v4)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world object manipulation has been commonly challenged by physical uncertainties and perception limitations. Being an effective strategy, while caging configuration-based manipulation frameworks have successfully provided robust solutions, they are not broadly applicable due to their strict requirements on the availability of multiple robots, widely distributed contacts, or specific geometries of robots or objects. Building upon previous sensorless manipulation ideas and uncertainty handling approaches, this work proposes a novel framework termed Caging in Time to allow caging configurations to be formed even with one robot engaged in a task. This concept leverages the insight that while caging requires constraining the object's motion, only part of the cage actively contacts the object at any moment. As such, by strategically switching the end-effector configuration and collapsing it in time, we form a cage with its necessary portion active whenever needed. We instantiate our approach on challenging quasi-static and dynamic manipulation tasks, showing that Caging in Time can be achieved in general cage formulations including geometry-based and energy-based cages. With extensive experiments, we show robust and accurate manipulation, in an open-loop manner, without requiring detailed knowledge of the object geometry or physical properties, or real-time accurate feedback on the manipulation states. In addition to being an effective and robust open-loop manipulation solution, Caging in Time can be a supplementary strategy to other manipulation systems affected by uncertain or limited robot perception.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 26 figures, video available at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ag_jTzazuSM</p></details> |

A crucial component in developing a reliable prediction model is collecting high-quality time series clinical events. In this work, we release such a dataset that consists of 22,588,586 Clinical Time Series events, which we term MIMIC-\RNum{4}-Ext-22MCTS. Our source data are discharge summaries selected from the well-known yet unstructured MIMIC-IV-Note \cite{Johnson2023-pg}. We then extract clinical events as short text span from the discharge summaries, along with the timestamps of these events as temporal information. The general-purpose MIMIC-IV-Note pose specific challenges for our work: it turns out that the discharge summaries are too lengthy for typical natural language models to process, and the clinical events of interest often are not accompanied with explicit timestamps. Therefore, we propose a new framework that works as follows: 1) we break each discharge summary into manageably small text chunks; 2) we apply contextual BM25 and contextual semantic search to retrieve chunks that have a high potential of containing clinical events; and 3) we carefully design prompts to teach the recently released Llama-3.1-8B \cite{touvron2023llama} model to identify or infer temporal information of the chunks. We show that the obtained dataset is so informative and transparent that standard models fine-tuned on our dataset are achieving significant improvements in healthcare applications. In particular, the BERT model fine-tuned based on our dataset achieves 10\% improvement in accuracy on medical question answering task, and 3\% improvement in clinical trial matching task compared with the classic BERT. The GPT-2 model, fine-tuned on our dataset, produces more clinically reliable results for clinical questions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reflections on Diversity: A Real-time Virtual Mirror for Inclusive 3D Face Transformations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20819v2)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time 3D face manipulation has significant applications in virtual reality, social media and human-computer interaction. This paper introduces a novel system, which we call Mirror of Diversity (MOD), that combines Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for texture manipulation and 3D Morphable Models (3DMMs) for facial geometry to achieve realistic face transformations that reflect various demographic characteristics, emphasizing the beauty of diversity and the universality of human features. As participants sit in front of a computer monitor with a camera positioned above, their facial characteristics are captured in real time and can further alter their digital face reconstruction with transformations reflecting different demographic characteristics, such as gender and ethnicity (e.g., a person from Africa, Asia, Europe). Another feature of our system, which we call Collective Face, generates an averaged face representation from multiple participants' facial data. A comprehensive evaluation protocol is implemented to assess the realism and demographic accuracy of the transformations. Qualitative feedback is gathered through participant questionnaires, which include comparisons of MOD transformations with similar filters on platforms like Snapchat and TikTok. Additionally, quantitative analysis is conducted using a pretrained Convolutional Neural Network that predicts gender and ethnicity, to validate the accuracy of demographic transformations.</p></details> |  |

Understanding webpages is challenging due to the visual complexity of GUI images and the large number of interface elements, making accurate action selection difficult. Our approach dynamically zooms in on relevant regions, reducing background clutter and improving grounding accuracy. To support this process, we propose an image-as-map mechanism that visualizes key landmarks at each step, providing a transparent action record and enables the agent to effectively choose among action candidates. Even with a simple region selection strategy, we observe significant performance gains of 28+\% on Screenspot-pro and 24+\% on WebVoyager benchmarks on top of two state-of-the-art open vision language model agents, UI-TARS and Qwen2.5-VL, highlighting the effectiveness of visual test-time scaling in interactive settings. We achieve a new state-of-the-art grounding performance of 61.6\% on the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark by applying RegionFocus to a Qwen2.5-VL-72B model. Our code will be released publicly at https://github.com/tiangeluo/RegionFocus.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Learning Assisted Outer Volume Removal for Highly-Accelerated Real-Time Dynamic MRI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00643v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time (RT) dynamic MRI plays a vital role in capturing rapid physiological processes, offering unique insights into organ motion and function. Among these applications, RT cine MRI is particularly important for functional assessment of the heart with high temporal resolution. RT imaging enables free-breathing, ungated imaging of cardiac motion, making it a crucial alternative for patients who cannot tolerate conventional breath-hold, ECG-gated acquisitions. However, achieving high acceleration rates in RT cine MRI is challenging due to aliasing artifacts from extra-cardiac tissues, particularly at high undersampling factors. In this study, we propose a novel outer volume removal (OVR) method to address this challenge by eliminating aliasing contributions from non-cardiac regions in a post-processing framework. Our approach estimates the outer volume signal for each timeframe using composite temporal images from time-interleaved undersampling patterns, which inherently contain pseudo-periodic ghosting artifacts. A deep learning (DL) model is trained to identify and remove these artifacts, producing a clean outer volume estimate that is subsequently subtracted from the corresponding k-space data. The final reconstruction is performed with a physics-driven DL (PD-DL) method trained using an OVR-specific loss function to restore high spatio-temporal resolution images. Experimental results show that the proposed method at high accelerations achieves image quality that is visually comparable to clinical baseline images, while outperforming conventional reconstruction techniques, both qualitatively and quantitatively. The proposed approach provides a practical and effective solution for artifact reduction in RT cine MRI without requiring acquisition modifications, offering a pathway to higher acceleration rates while preserving diagnostic quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unlocking the Potential of Linear Networks for Irregular Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00590v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting holds significant importance across various industries, including finance, transportation, energy, healthcare, and climate. Despite the widespread use of linear networks due to their low computational cost and effectiveness in modeling temporal dependencies, most existing research has concentrated on regularly sampled and fully observed multivariate time series. However, in practice, we frequently encounter irregular multivariate time series characterized by variable sampling intervals and missing values. The inherent intra-series inconsistency and inter-series asynchrony in such data hinder effective modeling and forecasting with traditional linear networks relying on static weights. To tackle these challenges, this paper introduces a novel model named AiT. AiT utilizes an adaptive linear network capable of dynamically adjusting weights according to observation time points to address intra-series inconsistency, thereby enhancing the accuracy of temporal dependencies modeling. Furthermore, by incorporating the Transformer module on variable semantics embeddings, AiT efficiently captures variable correlations, avoiding the challenge of inter-series asynchrony. Comprehensive experiments across four benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of AiT, improving prediction accuracy by 11% and decreasing runtime by 52% compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Model order reduction of hemodynamics by space-time reduced basis and reduced fluid-structure interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00548v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we apply the space-time Galerkin reduced basis (ST-GRB) method to a reduced fluid-structure interaction model, for the numerical simulation of hemodynamics in arteries. In essence, ST-GRB extends the classical reduced basis (RB) method, exploiting a data-driven low-dimensional linear encoding of the temporal dynamics to further cut the computational costs. The current investigation brings forth two key enhancements, compared to previous works on the topic. On the one side, we model blood flow through the Navier-Stokes equations, hence accounting for convection. In this regard, we implement a hyper-reduction scheme, based on approximate space-time reduced affine decompositions, to deal with nonlinearities effectively. On the other side, we move beyond the constraint of modelling blood vessels as rigid structures, acknowledging the importance of elasticity for the accurate simulation of complex blood flow patterns. To limit computational complexity, we adopt the Coupled Momentum model, incorporating the effect of wall compliance in the fluid's equations through a generalized Robin boundary condition. In particular, we propose an efficient strategy for handling the spatio-temporal projection of the structural displacement, which ultimately configures as a by-product. The performances of ST-GRB are assessed in three different numerical experiments. The results confirm that the proposed approach can outperform the classical RB method, yielding precise approximations of high-fidelity solutions at more convenient costs. However, the computational gains of ST-GRB vanish if the number of retained temporal modes is too large, which occurs either when complex dynamics arise or if very precise solutions are sought.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 8 figures.

| **[Minimizing $\ell_2$ Norm of Flow Time by Starvation Mitigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.14403v4)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The assessment of a job's Quality of Service (QoS) often revolves around its flow time, also referred to as response time. This study delves into two fundamental objectives for scheduling jobs: the average flow time and the maximum flow time. While the Shortest Remaining Processing Time (SRPT) algorithm minimizes average flow time, it can result in job starvation, causing certain jobs to experience disproportionately long and unfair flow times. In contrast, the First-Come-First-Served (FCFS) algorithm minimizes the maximum flow time but may compromise the average flow time. To strike a balance between these two objectives, a common approach is to minimize the $\ell_2$ norm of flow time. SRPT and FCFS are $O(n^{\frac{1}{2}})$-competitive for this problem, where $n$ is the number of jobs. Prior to this work, no algorithm is known to achieve a competitive ratio better than SRPT and FCFS. In this paper, we use FCFS to mitigate the starvation caused by SRPT. Given a good estimate of $n$, we prove that this approach achieves a much better competitive ratio of $O(n^{\frac{1}{3}})$. Our results provide the first theoretical evidence that mitigating starvation in SRPT leads to a provable improvement in scheduling performance.</p></details> | IWOCA 2025 |
| **[Test-time Correlation Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00533v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks often experience performance drops due to distribution shifts between training and test data. Although domain adaptation offers a solution, privacy concerns restrict access to training data in many real-world scenarios. This restriction has spurred interest in Test-Time Adaptation (TTA), which adapts models using only unlabeled test data. However, current TTA methods still face practical challenges: (1) a primary focus on instance-wise alignment, overlooking CORrelation ALignment (CORAL) due to missing source correlations; (2) complex backpropagation operations for model updating, resulting in overhead computation and (3) domain forgetting. To address these challenges, we provide a theoretical analysis to investigate the feasibility of Test-time Correlation Alignment (TCA), demonstrating that correlation alignment between high-certainty instances and test instances can enhance test performances with a theoretical guarantee. Based on this, we propose two simple yet effective algorithms: LinearTCA and LinearTCA+. LinearTCA applies a simple linear transformation to achieve both instance and correlation alignment without additional model updates, while LinearTCA+ serves as a plug-and-play module that can easily boost existing TTA methods. Extensive experiments validate our theoretical insights and show that TCA methods significantly outperforms baselines across various tasks, benchmarks and backbones. Notably, LinearTCA improves adaptation accuracy by 5.88% on OfficeHome dataset, while using only 4% maximum GPU memory usage and 0.6% computation time compared to the best baseline TTA method.</p></details> | Accepted by ICML2025 |

The outputs of such systems vary not only with physical parameters but also with external time-varying input signals. Accurately catching the dynamics of such systems is challenging. We have adapted and extended an existing transformer model for single output prediction to a multiple-output transformer that is able to predict multiple output responses of these systems. The multiple-output transformer generalizes the interpretability of the original transformer. The generalized interpretable attention weight matrix explores not only the temporal correlations in the sequence, but also the interactions between the multiple outputs, providing explanation for the spatial correlation in the output domain. This multiple-output transformer accurately predicts the sequence of multiple outputs, regardless of the nonlinearity of the system and the dimensionality of the parameter space.</p></details> |  |

This causes unavoidable contention overheads and does not provide performance guarantees. In this work, we outline some issues that occur with the probabilistic channel access in highly congested scenarios and how those can be mitigated using deterministic scheduling. Towards this, we propose to use Target Wake Time (TWT) - a feature introduced in Wi-Fi 6 as a power-saving mechanism, to improve the performance of Wi-Fi. To gain insights into the workings of the TWT over commercially available off-the-shelf components and to analyze the factors that affect its performance, we carry out various experiments with it over our Wi-Fi 6 testbed. Using these insights and analysis, we formulate and solve an optimization problem to synthesize deterministic schedules and obtain the optimal values of various system parameters. Lastly, we configure our testbed with these optimal parameter values and show that the TWT based deterministic scheduling consistently results in better performance of the TWT-capable clients and overall system performance compared to traditional CSMA/CA based scheduling.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 13 figures, and 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[Real-Time Animatable 2DGS-Avatars with Detail Enhancement from Monocular Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00421v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-quality, animatable 3D human avatar reconstruction from monocular videos offers significant potential for reducing reliance on complex hardware, making it highly practical for applications in game development, augmented reality, and social media. However, existing methods still face substantial challenges in capturing fine geometric details and maintaining animation stability, particularly under dynamic or complex poses. To address these issues, we propose a novel real-time framework for animatable human avatar reconstruction based on 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS). By leveraging 2DGS and global SMPL pose parameters, our framework not only aligns positional and rotational discrepancies but also enables robust and natural pose-driven animation of the reconstructed avatars. Furthermore, we introduce a Rotation Compensation Network (RCN) that learns rotation residuals by integrating local geometric features with global pose parameters. This network significantly improves the handling of non-rigid deformations and ensures smooth, artifact-free pose transitions during animation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method successfully reconstructs realistic and highly animatable human avatars from monocular videos, effectively preserving fine-grained details while ensuring stable and natural pose variation. Our approach surpasses current state-of-the-art methods in both reconstruction quality and animation robustness on public benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[CICADA: Cross-Domain Interpretable Coding for Anomaly Detection and Adaptation in Multivariate Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00415v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised Time series anomaly detection plays a crucial role in applications across industries. However, existing methods face significant challenges due to data distributional shifts across different domains, which are exacerbated by the non-stationarity of time series over time. Existing models fail to generalize under multiple heterogeneous source domains and emerging unseen new target domains. To fill the research gap, we introduce CICADA (Cross-domain Interpretable Coding for Anomaly Detection and Adaptation), with four key innovations: (1) a mixture of experts (MOE) framework that captures domain-agnostic anomaly features with high flexibility and interpretability; (2) a novel selective meta-learning mechanism to prevent negative transfer between dissimilar domains, (3) an adaptive expansion algorithm for emerging heterogeneous domain expansion, and (4) a hierarchical attention structure that quantifies expert contributions during fusion to enhance interpretability further.Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world industrial datasets demonstrate that CICADA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both cross-domain detection performance and interpretability.</p></details> |  |
| **[DeepSTA: A Spatial-Temporal Attention Network for Logistics Delivery Timely Rate Prediction in Anomaly Conditions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00402v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prediction of couriers' delivery timely rates in advance is essential to the logistics industry, enabling companies to take preemptive measures to ensure the normal operation of delivery services. This becomes even more critical during anomaly conditions like the epidemic outbreak, during which couriers' delivery timely rate will decline markedly and fluctuates significantly. Existing studies pay less attention to the logistics scenario. Moreover, many works focusing on prediction tasks in anomaly scenarios fail to explicitly model abnormal events, e.g., treating external factors equally with other features, resulting in great information loss. Further, since some anomalous events occur infrequently, traditional data-driven methods perform poorly in these scenarios. To deal with them, we propose a deep spatial-temporal attention model, named DeepSTA. To be specific, to avoid information loss, we design an anomaly spatio-temporal learning module that employs a recurrent neural network to model incident information. Additionally, we utilize Node2vec to model correlations between road districts, and adopt graph neural networks and long short-term memory to capture the spatial-temporal dependencies of couriers. To tackle the issue of insufficient training data in abnormal circumstances, we propose an anomaly pattern attention module that adopts a memory network for couriers' anomaly feature patterns storage via attention mechanisms. The experiments on real-world logistics datasets during the COVID-19 outbreak in 2022 show the model outperforms the best baselines by 12.11% in MAE and 13.71% in MSE, demonstrating its superior performance over multiple competitive baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM 2023</p></details> |

While it improves reliability by providing factual texts, it significantly increases inference costs as context length grows and introduces challenging issue of RAG hallucination, primarily caused by the lack of corresponding parametric knowledge in LLMs. An efficient solution is to enhance the knowledge of LLMs at test-time. Parametric RAG (PRAG) addresses this by embedding document into LLMs parameters to perform test-time knowledge enhancement, effectively reducing inference costs through offline training. However, its high training and storage costs, along with limited generalization ability, significantly restrict its practical adoption. To address these challenges, we propose Dynamic Parametric RAG (DyPRAG), a novel framework that leverages a lightweight parameter translator model to efficiently convert documents into parametric knowledge. DyPRAG not only reduces inference, training, and storage costs but also dynamically generates parametric knowledge, seamlessly enhancing the knowledge of LLMs and resolving knowledge conflicts in a plug-and-play manner at test-time. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization capabilities of DyPRAG, offering a powerful and practical RAG paradigm which enables superior knowledge fusion and mitigates RAG hallucination in real-world applications.

| **[Learning to Estimate Package Delivery Time in Mixed Imbalanced Delivery and Pickup Logistics Services](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00375v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately estimating package delivery time is essential to the logistics industry, which enables reasonable work allocation and on-time service guarantee. This becomes even more necessary in mixed logistics scenarios where couriers handle a high volume of delivery and a smaller number of pickup simultaneously. However, most of the related works treat the pickup and delivery patterns on couriers' decision behavior equally, neglecting that the pickup has a greater impact on couriers' decision-making compared to the delivery due to its tighter time constraints. In such context, we have three main challenges: 1) multiple spatiotemporal factors are intricately interconnected, significantly affecting couriers' delivery behavior; 2) pickups have stricter time requirements but are limited in number, making it challenging to model their effects on couriers' delivery process; 3) couriers' spatial mobility patterns are critical determinants of their delivery behavior, but have been insufficiently explored. To deal with these, we propose TransPDT, a Transformer-based multi-task package delivery time prediction model. We first employ the Transformer encoder architecture to capture the spatio-temporal dependencies of couriers' historical travel routes and pending package sets. Then we design the pattern memory to learn the patterns of pickup in the imbalanced dataset via attention mechanism. We also set the route prediction as an auxiliary task of delivery time prediction, and incorporate the prior courier spatial movement regularities in prediction. Extensive experiments on real industry-scale datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method. A system based on TransPDT is deployed internally in JD Logistics to track more than 2000 couriers handling hundreds of thousands of packages per day in Beijing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM SIGSPATIAL 2024</p></details> |

After traditional statistical and machine learning approaches, various fundamental deep learning architectures such as MLPs, CNNs, RNNs, and GNNs have been developed. However, the structural limitations caused by the inductive biases of each deep learning architecture constrained their performance. Transformer models, which excel at handling long-term dependencies, have become significant architectural components for time series forecasting. However, recent research has shown that alternatives such as simple linear layers can outperform Transformers. These findings have opened up new possibilities for using diverse architectures, ranging from fundamental deep learning models to emerging architectures and hybrid approaches. In this context, architectural modeling of time series forecasting has now entered a renaissance. This survey not only provides a historical context for time series forecasting but also offers comprehensive and timely analysis of the movement toward architectural diversification. By comparing and re-examining deep learning models, we uncover new perspectives and present recent trends, including hybrid, diffusion, Mamba, and foundation models. By focusing on the inherent characteristics of time series data, we also address open challenges that have gained attention in time series forecasting, such as channel dependency, distribution shift, causality, and feature extraction. These contributions help lower entry barriers for newcomers by providing a systematic understanding of the diverse research areas in time series forecasting (TSF), while offering seasoned researchers broader perspectives and new opportunities through in-depth exploration of TSF challenges.

| **[Gateformer: Advancing Multivariate Time Series Forecasting through Temporal and Variate-Wise Attention with Gated Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00307v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There has been a recent surge of interest in time series modeling using the Transformer architecture. However, forecasting multivariate time series with Transformer presents a unique challenge as it requires modeling both temporal (cross-time) and variate (cross-variate) dependencies. While Transformer-based models have gained popularity for their flexibility in capturing both sequential and cross-variate relationships, it is unclear how to best integrate these two sources of information in the context of the Transformer architecture while optimizing for both performance and efficiency. We re-purpose the Transformer architecture to effectively model both cross-time and cross-variate dependencies. Our approach begins by embedding each variate independently into a variate-wise representation that captures its cross-time dynamics, and then models cross-variate dependencies through attention mechanisms on these learned embeddings. Gating operations in both cross-time and cross-variate modeling phases regulate information flow, allowing the model to focus on the most relevant features for accurate predictions. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across 13 real-world datasets and can be seamlessly integrated into other Transformer-based and LLM-based forecasters, delivering performance improvements up to 20.7\% over original models.

| **[Temporal Attention Evolutional Graph Convolutional Network for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00302v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series forecasting enables the prediction of future states by leveraging historical data, thereby facilitating decision-making processes. Each data node in a multivariate time series encompasses a sequence of multiple dimensions. These nodes exhibit interdependent relationships, forming a graph structure. While existing prediction methods often assume a fixed graph structure, many real-world scenarios involve dynamic graph structures. Moreover, interactions among time series observed at different time scales vary significantly. To enhance prediction accuracy by capturing precise temporal and spatial features, this paper introduces the Temporal Attention Evolutional Graph Convolutional Network (TAEGCN). This novel method not only integrates causal temporal convolution and a multi-head self-attention mechanism to learn temporal features of nodes, but also construct the dynamic graph structure based on these temporal features to keep the consistency of the changing in spatial feature with temporal series. TAEGCN adeptly captures temporal causal relationships and hidden spatial dependencies within the data. Furthermore, TAEGCN incorporates a unified neural network that seamlessly integrates these components to generate final predictions. Experimental results conducted on two public transportation network datasets, METR-LA and PEMS-BAY, demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed model.</p></details> | 13 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Predicting Estimated Times of Restoration for Electrical Outages Using Longitudinal Tabular Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00225v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As climate variability increases, the ability of utility providers to deliver precise Estimated Times of Restoration (ETR) during natural disasters has become increasingly critical. Accurate and timely ETRs are essential for enabling customer preparedness during extended power outages, where informed decision-making can be crucial, particularly in severe weather conditions. Nonetheless, prevailing utility practices predominantly depend on manual assessments or traditional statistical methods, which often fail to achieve the level of precision required for reliable and actionable predictions. To address these limitations, we propose a Longitudinal Tabular Transformer (LTT) model that leverages historical outage event data along with sequential updates of these events to improve the accuracy of ETR predictions. The model's performance was evaluated over 34,000 storm-related outage events from three major utility companies, collectively serving over 3 million customers over a 2-year period. Results demonstrate that the LTT model improves the Customer Satisfaction Impact (CSI) metric by an average of 19.08% (p > 0.001) compared to existing methods. Additionally, we introduce customer-informed regression metrics that align model evaluation with real-world satisfaction, ensuring the outcomes resonate with customer expectations. Furthermore, we employ interpretability techniques to analyze the temporal significance of incorporating sequential updates in modeling outage events and to identify the contributions of predictive features to a given ETR. This comprehensive approach not only improves predictive accuracy but also enhances transparency, fostering greater trust in the model's capabilities.</p></details> |  |

However, current implementations of BCI-controlled walking still have significant drawbacks. In particular, prior systems are unidirectional and lack sensory feedback for insensate patients, have suboptimal reliance on brain signals from the bilateral arm areas of the motor cortex, and depend on external systems for signal processing. Motivated by these shortcomings, this study is the first time a bidirectional brain-computer interface (BDBCI) has demonstrated the restoration of both brain-controlled walking and leg sensory feedback while utilizing the bilateral leg motor and sensory cortices. Here, a subject undergoing subdural electrocorticogram electrode implantation for epilepsy surgery evaluation leveraged the leg representation areas of the bilateral interhemispheric primary motor and sensory cortices to operate a BDBCI with high performance. Although electrode implantation in the interhemispheric region is uncommon, electrodes can be safely implanted in this region to access rich leg motor information and deliver bilateral leg sensory feedback. Finally, we demonstrated that all BDBCI operations can be executed on a dedicated, portable embedded system. These results indicate that BDBCIs can potentially provide brain-controlled ambulation and artificial leg sensation to people with paraplegia after spinal cord injury in a manner that emulates full-implantability and is untethered from any external systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main text of pre-print and supplementary information included</p></details> |

We introduce and analyze hybrid discontinuous Galerkin discretizations (HDG) that are stable and optimally convergent for all polynomial degrees greater than or equal to one. The proposed methods are robust with respect to the drastic changes in the magnitude of the coefficients that naturally occur in stars. Our analysis is based on the concept of discrete approximation schemes and weak T-compatibility, which exploits the weakly T-coercive structure of the equation. Compared to the $H^1$-conforming discretization of [Halla, Lehrenfeld, Stocker, 2022], our method offers improved stability and robustness. Furthermore, it significantly reduces the computational costs compared to the $H(\operatorname{div})$-conforming DG discretization of [Halla, 2023], which has similar stability properties. These advantages make the proposed HDG methods well-suited for astrophysical simulations.</p></details> |  |

Our nonlinear dynamic control method introduces added flexibility over traditional static and linear approaches, effectively compensating for system nonlinearities and enabling potentially tighter closed-loop intervals. Additionally, we establish a separation principle that allows for the design of observer and control gains. We further derive tractable matrix inequalities to ensure system stability in the closed-loop configuration.

In contrast, our knowledge of the \emph{message complexity} of distributed computing problems and its relationship (if any) with round complexity is still quite limited. To illustrate, for many fundamental distributed graph optimization problems such as (exact) diameter computation, All-Pairs Shortest Paths (APSP), Maximum Matching etc., while (near) round-optimal algorithms are known, message-optimal algorithms are hitherto unknown. More importantly, the existing round-optimal algorithms are not message-optimal. This raises two important questions: (1) Can we design message-optimal algorithms for these problems? (2) Can we give message-time tradeoffs for these problems in case the message-optimal algorithms are not round-optimal? In this work, we focus on a fundamental graph optimization problem, \emph{All Pairs Shortest Path (APSP)}, whose message complexity is still unresolved. We present two main results in the CONGEST model: (1) We give a message-optimal (up to logarithmic factors) algorithm that solves weighted APSP, using $\tilde{O}(n^2)$ messages. This algorithm takes $\tilde{O}(n^2)$ rounds. (2) For any $0 \leq \varepsilon \le 1$, we show how to solve unweighted APSP in $\tilde{O}(n^{2-\varepsilon })$ rounds and $\tilde{O}(n^{2+\varepsilon })$ messages. At one end of this smooth trade-off, we obtain a (nearly) message-optimal algorithm using $\tilde{O}(n^2)$ messages (for $\varepsilon = 0$), whereas at the other end we get a (nearly) round-optimal algorithm using $\tilde{O}(n)$ rounds (for $\varepsilon = 1$). This is the first such message-time trade-off result known.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to PODC 2025, abstract shortened to fit arXiv constraints</p></details> |
| **[An Adaptive Learning Approach to Multivariate Time Forecasting in Industrial Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07554v2)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Industrial processes generate a massive amount of monitoring data that can be exploited to uncover hidden time losses in the system. This can be used to enhance the accuracy of maintenance policies and increase the effectiveness of the equipment. In this work, we propose a method for one-step probabilistic multivariate forecasting of time variables involved in a production process. The method is based on an Input-Output Hidden Markov Model (IO-HMM), in which the parameters of interest are the state transition probabilities and the parameters of the observations' joint density. The ultimate goal of the method is to predict operational process times in the near future, which enables the identification of hidden losses and the location of improvement areas in the process. The input stream in the IO-HMM model includes past values of the response variables and other process features, such as calendar variables, that can have an impact on the model's parameters. The discrete part of the IO-HMM models the operational mode of the process. The state transition probabilities are supposed to change over time and are updated using Bayesian principles. The continuous part of the IO-HMM models the joint density of the response variables. The estimate of the continuous model parameters is recursively computed through an adaptive algorithm that also admits a Bayesian interpretation. The adaptive algorithm allows for efficient updating of the current parameter estimates as soon as new information is available. We evaluate the method's performance using a real data set obtained from a company in a particular sector, and the results are compared with a collection of benchmark models.</p></details> | 25 pages, 5 figures |

However, the current state of the art is mostly focused on mean-value time series predictions and only very few methods provide probabilistic forecasts. In this paper, we rely on kernel density estimation and vine copulas to construct probabilistic models for individual load profiles of private households. Our approach allows the quantification of variability of individual energy consumption in general and of daily peak loads in particular. We draw upon an Australian distribution grid dataset to illustrate our findings. We generate synthetic loads that follow the distribution of the real data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for IEEE PowerTech</p></details> |
| **[Conditional independence testing with a single realization of a multivariate nonstationary nonlinear time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21647v1)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying relationships among stochastic processes is a key goal in disciplines that deal with complex temporal systems, such as economics. While the standard toolkit for multivariate time series analysis has many advantages, it can be difficult to capture nonlinear dynamics using linear vector autoregressive models. This difficulty has motivated the development of methods for variable selection, causal discovery, and graphical modeling for nonlinear time series, which routinely employ nonparametric tests for conditional independence. In this paper, we introduce the first framework for conditional independence testing that works with a single realization of a nonstationary nonlinear process. The key technical ingredients are time-varying nonlinear regression, time-varying covariance estimation, and a distribution-uniform strong Gaussian approximation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Real Time Semantic Segmentation of High Resolution Automotive LiDAR Scans](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21602v1)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent studies, numerous previous works emphasize the importance of semantic segmentation of LiDAR data as a critical component to the development of driver-assistance systems and autonomous vehicles. However, many state-of-the-art methods are tested on outdated, lower-resolution LiDAR sensors and struggle with real-time constraints. This study introduces a novel semantic segmentation framework tailored for modern high-resolution LiDAR sensors that addresses both accuracy and real-time processing demands. We propose a novel LiDAR dataset collected by a cutting-edge automotive 128 layer LiDAR in urban traffic scenes. Furthermore, we propose a semantic segmentation method utilizing surface normals as strong input features. Our approach is bridging the gap between cutting-edge research and practical automotive applications. Additionaly, we provide a Robot Operating System (ROS2) implementation that we operate on our research vehicle.

| **[Real-time Program Evaluation using Anytime-valid Rank Tests](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21595v1)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Counterfactual mean estimators such as difference-in-differences and synthetic control have grown into workhorse tools for program evaluation. Inference for these estimators is well-developed in settings where all post-treatment data is available at the time of analysis. However, in settings where data arrives sequentially, these tests do not permit real-time inference, as they require a pre-specified sample size T. We introduce real-time inference for program evaluation through anytime-valid rank tests. Our methodology relies on interpreting the absence of a treatment effect as exchangeability of the treatment estimates. We then convert these treatment estimates into sequential ranks, and construct optimal finite-sample valid sequential tests for exchangeability. We illustrate our methods in the context of difference-in-differences and synthetic control. In simulations, they control size even under mild exchangeability violations. While our methods suffer slight power loss at T, they allow for early rejection (before T) and preserve the ability to reject later (after T).</p></details> |  |
| **[Masked Diffusion Models are Secretly Time-Agnostic Masked Models and Exploit Inaccurate Categorical Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02908v6)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have emerged as a popular research topic for generative modeling of discrete data, thanks to their superior performance over other discrete diffusion models, and are rivaling the auto-regressive models (ARMs) for language modeling tasks. The recent effort in simplifying the masked diffusion framework further leads to alignment with continuous-space diffusion models and more principled training and sampling recipes. In this paper, however, we reveal that both training and sampling of MDMs are theoretically free from the time variable, arguably the key signature of diffusion models, and are instead equivalent to masked models. The connection on the sampling aspect is drawn by our proposed first-hitting sampler (FHS). Specifically, we show that the FHS is theoretically equivalent to MDMs' original generation process while significantly alleviating the time-consuming categorical sampling and achieving a 20$\times$ speedup. In addition, our investigation raises doubts about whether MDMs can truly beat ARMs in text generation. We identify, for the first time, an underlying numerical issue, even with the commonly used 32-bit floating-point precision, which results in inaccurate categorical sampling. We show that it lowers the effective temperature both theoretically and empirically, and the resulting decrease in token diversity makes previous evaluations, which assess the generation quality solely through the incomplete generative perplexity metric, somewhat unfair.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

Existing watermarking approaches, whether passive, post-hoc, or adapted from image-based techniques, often struggle to withstand video-specific manipulations such as frame insertion, dropping, or reordering, and typically degrade visual quality. In this work, we introduce VIDSTAMP, a watermarking framework that embeds per-frame or per-segment messages directly into the latent space of temporally-aware video diffusion models. By fine-tuning the model's decoder through a two-stage pipeline, first on static image datasets to promote spatial message separation, and then on synthesized video sequences to restore temporal consistency, VIDSTAMP learns to embed high-capacity, flexible watermarks with minimal perceptual impact. Leveraging architectural components such as 3D convolutions and temporal attention, our method imposes no additional inference cost and offers better perceptual quality than prior methods, while maintaining comparable robustness against common distortions and tampering. VIDSTAMP embeds 768 bits per video (48 bits per frame) with a bit accuracy of 95.0%, achieves a log P-value of -166.65 (lower is better), and maintains a video quality score of 0.836, comparable to unwatermarked outputs (0.838) and surpassing prior methods in capacity-quality tradeoffs.

| **[Stabilizing Temporal Difference Learning via Implicit Stochastic Approximation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01361v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal Difference (TD) learning is a foundational algorithm in reinforcement learning (RL). For nearly forty years, TD learning has served as a workhorse for applied RL as well as a building block for more complex and specialized algorithms. However, despite its widespread use, it is not without drawbacks, the most prominent being its sensitivity to step size. A poor choice of step size can dramatically inflate the error of value estimates and slow convergence. Consequently, in practice, researchers must use trial and error in order to identify a suitable step size -- a process that can be tedious and time consuming. As an alternative, we propose implicit TD algorithms that reformulate TD updates into fixed-point equations. These updates are more stable and less sensitive to step size without sacrificing computational efficiency. Moreover, our theoretical analysis establishes asymptotic convergence guarantees and finite-time error bounds. Our results demonstrate their robustness and practicality for modern RL tasks, establishing implicit TD as a versatile tool for policy evaluation and value approximation.</p></details> |  |
| **[TRAVELER: A Benchmark for Evaluating Temporal Reasoning across Vague, Implicit and Explicit References](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01325v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding and resolving temporal references is essential in Natural Language Understanding as we often refer to the past or future in daily communication. Although existing benchmarks address a system's ability to reason about and resolve temporal references, systematic evaluation of specific temporal references remains limited. Towards closing this gap, we introduce TRAVELER, a novel synthetic benchmark dataset that follows a Question Answering paradigm and consists of questions involving temporal references with the corresponding correct answers. TRAVELER assesses models' abilities to resolve explicit, implicit relative to speech time, and vague temporal references. Beyond investigating the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs depending on the type of temporal reference, our benchmark also allows evaluation of performance in relation to the length of the set of events. For the category of vague temporal references, ground-truth answers were established via human surveys on Prolific, following a procedure similar to the one from Kenneweg et al. To demonstrate the benchmark's applicability, we evaluate four state-of-the-art LLMs using a question-answering task encompassing 3,300 questions. Our findings show that while the benchmarked LLMs can answer questions over event sets with a handful of events and explicit temporal references successfully, performance clearly deteriorates with larger event set length and when temporal references get less explicit. Notably, the vague question category exhibits the lowest performance across all models. The benchmark is publicly available at: https://gitlab.ub.uni-bielefeld.de/s.kenneweg/TRAVELER</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 6 figures, submitted to Springer Nature Computer Science</p></details> |

In this paper, we introduce a factorized model that captures the semantics of these adverbials as probabilistic distributions. These distributions are composed with event-specific distributions to yield a contextualized meaning for an adverbial applied to a specific event. We fit the model's parameters using existing data capturing judgments of native speakers regarding the applicability of these vague temporal adverbials to events that took place a given time ago. Comparing our approach to a non-factorized model based on a single Gaussian distribution for each pair of event and temporal adverbial, we find that while both models have similar predictive power, our model is preferable in terms of Occam's razor, as it is simpler and has better extendability.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 1 figure, to be published in CogSci Proceedings 2025</p></details> |
| **[3D Human Pose Estimation via Spatial Graph Order Attention and Temporal Body Aware Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01003v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nowadays, Transformers and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are the prevailing techniques for 3D human pose estimation. However, Transformer-based methods either ignore the spatial neighborhood relationships between the joints when used for skeleton representations or disregard the local temporal patterns of the local joint movements in skeleton sequence modeling, while GCN-based methods often neglect the need for pose-specific representations. To address these problems, we propose a new method that exploits the graph modeling capability of GCN to represent each skeleton with multiple graphs of different orders, incorporated with a newly introduced Graph Order Attention module that dynamically emphasizes the most representative orders for each joint. The resulting spatial features of the sequence are further processed using a proposed temporal Body Aware Transformer that models the global body feature dependencies in the sequence with awareness of the local inter-skeleton feature dependencies of joints. Given that our 3D pose output aligns with the central 2D pose in the sequence, we improve the self-attention mechanism to be aware of the central pose while diminishing its focus gradually towards the first and the last poses. Extensive experiments on Human3.6m, MPIINF-3DHP, and HumanEva-I datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

| **[Towards Explainable Temporal User Profiling with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00886v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately modeling user preferences is vital not only for improving recommendation performance but also for enhancing transparency in recommender systems. Conventional user profiling methods, such as averaging item embeddings, often overlook the evolving, nuanced nature of user interests, particularly the interplay between short-term and long-term preferences. In this work, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate natural language summaries of users' interaction histories, distinguishing recent behaviors from more persistent tendencies. Our framework not only models temporal user preferences but also produces natural language profiles that can be used to explain recommendations in an interpretable manner. These textual profiles are encoded via a pre-trained model, and an attention mechanism dynamically fuses the short-term and long-term embeddings into a comprehensive user representation. Beyond boosting recommendation accuracy over multiple baselines, our approach naturally supports explainability: the interpretable text summaries and attention weights can be exposed to end users, offering insights into why specific items are suggested. Experiments on real-world datasets underscore both the performance gains and the promise of generating clearer, more transparent justifications for content-based recommendations.</p></details> |  |

Accurate predictive models rely on high-resolution spatio-temporal data to capture the complex interplay of environmental and anthropogenic factors. To address the lack of localised and fine-grained datasets in Spain, this work introduces IberFire, a spatio-temporal datacube at 1 km x 1 km x 1-day resolution covering mainland Spain and the Balearic Islands from December 2007 to December 2024. IberFire integrates 260 features across eight main categories: auxiliary features, fire history, geography, topography, meteorology, vegetation indices, human activity, and land cover. All features are derived from open-access sources, ensuring transparency and real-time applicability. The data processing pipeline was implemented entirely using open-source tools, and the codebase has been made publicly available. This work not only enhances spatio-temporal granularity and feature diversity compared to existing European datacubes but also provides a reproducible methodology for constructing similar datasets. IberFire supports advanced wildfire risk modelling through Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques, enables climate pattern analysis and informs strategic planning in fire prevention and land management. The dataset is publicly available on Zenodo to promote open research and collaboration.</p></details> |  |
| **[MIMIC-\RNum{4}-Ext-22MCTS: A 22 Millions-Event Temporal Clinical Time-Series Dataset with Relative Timestamp for Risk Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00827v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clinical risk prediction based on machine learning algorithms plays a vital role in modern healthcare. A crucial component in developing a reliable prediction model is collecting high-quality time series clinical events. In this work, we release such a dataset that consists of 22,588,586 Clinical Time Series events, which we term MIMIC-\RNum{4}-Ext-22MCTS. Our source data are discharge summaries selected from the well-known yet unstructured MIMIC-IV-Note \cite{Johnson2023-pg}. We then extract clinical events as short text span from the discharge summaries, along with the timestamps of these events as temporal information. The general-purpose MIMIC-IV-Note pose specific challenges for our work: it turns out that the discharge summaries are too lengthy for typical natural language models to process, and the clinical events of interest often are not accompanied with explicit timestamps. Therefore, we propose a new framework that works as follows: 1) we break each discharge summary into manageably small text chunks; 2) we apply contextual BM25 and contextual semantic search to retrieve chunks that have a high potential of containing clinical events; and 3) we carefully design prompts to teach the recently released Llama-3.1-8B \cite{touvron2023llama} model to identify or infer temporal information of the chunks. We show that the obtained dataset is so informative and transparent that standard models fine-tuned on our dataset are achieving significant improvements in healthcare applications. In particular, the BERT model fine-tuned based on our dataset achieves 10\% improvement in accuracy on medical question answering task, and 3\% improvement in clinical trial matching task compared with the classic BERT. The GPT-2 model, fine-tuned on our dataset, produces more clinically reliable results for clinical questions.</p></details> |  |

However, most previous works only consider fixed or parametrized STL specifications due to the lack of a diverse STL dataset and encoders to effectively extract temporal logic information for downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose TeLoGraF, Temporal Logic Graph-encoded Flow, which utilizes Graph Neural Networks (GNN) encoder and flow-matching to learn solutions for general STL specifications. We identify four commonly used STL templates and collect a total of 200K specifications with paired demonstrations. We conduct extensive experiments in five simulation environments ranging from simple dynamical models in the 2D space to high-dimensional 7DoF Franka Panda robot arm and Ant quadruped navigation. Results show that our method outperforms other baselines in the STL satisfaction rate. Compared to classical STL planning algorithms, our approach is 10-100X faster in inference and can work on any system dynamics. Besides, we show our graph-encoding method's capability to solve complex STLs and robustness to out-distribution STL specifications.

The outputs of such systems vary not only with physical parameters but also with external time-varying input signals. Accurately catching the dynamics of such systems is challenging. We have adapted and extended an existing transformer model for single output prediction to a multiple-output transformer that is able to predict multiple output responses of these systems. The multiple-output transformer generalizes the interpretability of the original transformer. The generalized interpretable attention weight matrix explores not only the temporal correlations in the sequence, but also the interactions between the multiple outputs, providing explanation for the spatial correlation in the output domain. This multiple-output transformer accurately predicts the sequence of multiple outputs, regardless of the nonlinearity of the system and the dimensionality of the parameter space.</p></details> |  |
| **[Characterizing Human Actions in the Digital Platform by Temporal Context](http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.09535v2)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in digital platforms generate rich, high-dimensional logs of human behavior, and machine learning models have helped social scientists explain knowledge accumulation, communication, and information diffusion. Such models, however, almost always treat behavior as sequences of actions, abstracting the inter-temporal information among actions. To close this gap, we introduce a two-scale Action-Timing Context(ATC) framework that jointly embeds each action and its time interval. ATC obtains low-dimensional representations of actions and characterizes them with inter-temporal information. We provide three applications of ATC to real-world datasets and demonstrate that the method offers a unified view of human behavior. The presented qualitative findings demonstrate that explicitly modeling inter-temporal context is essential for a comprehensive, interpretable understanding of human activity on digital platforms.</p></details> |  |

This becomes even more critical during anomaly conditions like the epidemic outbreak, during which couriers' delivery timely rate will decline markedly and fluctuates significantly. Existing studies pay less attention to the logistics scenario. Moreover, many works focusing on prediction tasks in anomaly scenarios fail to explicitly model abnormal events, e.g., treating external factors equally with other features, resulting in great information loss. Further, since some anomalous events occur infrequently, traditional data-driven methods perform poorly in these scenarios. To deal with them, we propose a deep spatial-temporal attention model, named DeepSTA. To be specific, to avoid information loss, we design an anomaly spatio-temporal learning module that employs a recurrent neural network to model incident information. Additionally, we utilize Node2vec to model correlations between road districts, and adopt graph neural networks and long short-term memory to capture the spatial-temporal dependencies of couriers. To tackle the issue of insufficient training data in abnormal circumstances, we propose an anomaly pattern attention module that adopts a memory network for couriers' anomaly feature patterns storage via attention mechanisms. The experiments on real-world logistics datasets during the COVID-19 outbreak in 2022 show the model outperforms the best baselines by 12.11% in MAE and 13.71% in MSE, demonstrating its superior performance over multiple competitive baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM 2023</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Neural Video Representation with Temporally Coherent Modulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00335v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Implicit neural representations (INR) has found successful applications across diverse domains. To employ INR in real-life, it is important to speed up training. In the field of INR for video applications, the state-of-the-art approach employs grid-type parametric encoding and successfully achieves a faster encoding speed in comparison to its predecessors. However, the grid usage, which does not consider the video's dynamic nature, leads to redundant use of trainable parameters. As a result, it has significantly lower parameter efficiency and higher bitrate compared to NeRV-style methods that do not use a parametric encoding. To address the problem, we propose Neural Video representation with Temporally coherent Modulation (NVTM), a novel framework that can capture dynamic characteristics of video. By decomposing the spatio-temporal 3D video data into a set of 2D grids with flow information, NVTM enables learning video representation rapidly and uses parameter efficiently. Our framework enables to process temporally corresponding pixels at once, resulting in the fastest encoding speed for a reasonable video quality, especially when compared to the NeRV-style method, with a speed increase of over 3 times. Also, it remarks an average of 1.54dB/0.019 improvements in PSNR/LPIPS on UVG (Dynamic) (even with 10% fewer parameters) and an average of 1.84dB/0.013 improvements in PSNR/LPIPS on MCL-JCV (Dynamic), compared to previous grid-type works. By expanding this to compression tasks, we demonstrate comparable performance to video compression standards (H.264, HEVC) and recent INR approaches for video compression. Additionally, we perform extensive experiments demonstrating the superior performance of our algorithm across diverse tasks, encompassing super resolution, frame interpolation and video inpainting.

The primary aim of the paper is to construct the spatiotemporal tube (STT) using a sampling-based approach and thereby devise a closed-form approximation-free control strategy to ensure that system trajectory reaches the target set while avoiding time-dependent unsafe sets. The proposed scheme utilizes a novel method involving STTs to provide controllers that guarantee both system safety and reachability. In our sampling-based framework, we translate the requirements of STTs into a Robust optimization program (ROP). To address the infeasibility of ROP caused by infinite constraints, we utilize the sampling-based Scenario optimization program (SOP). Subsequently, we solve the SOP to generate the tube and closed-form controller for an unknown system, ensuring the temporal reach-avoid-stay specification. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through three case studies: an omnidirectional robot, a SCARA manipulator, and a magnetic levitation system.</p></details> |  |
| **[Gateformer: Advancing Multivariate Time Series Forecasting through Temporal and Variate-Wise Attention with Gated Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00307v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There has been a recent surge of interest in time series modeling using the Transformer architecture. However, forecasting multivariate time series with Transformer presents a unique challenge as it requires modeling both temporal (cross-time) and variate (cross-variate) dependencies. While Transformer-based models have gained popularity for their flexibility in capturing both sequential and cross-variate relationships, it is unclear how to best integrate these two sources of information in the context of the Transformer architecture while optimizing for both performance and efficiency. We re-purpose the Transformer architecture to effectively model both cross-time and cross-variate dependencies. Our approach begins by embedding each variate independently into a variate-wise representation that captures its cross-time dynamics, and then models cross-variate dependencies through attention mechanisms on these learned embeddings. Gating operations in both cross-time and cross-variate modeling phases regulate information flow, allowing the model to focus on the most relevant features for accurate predictions. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across 13 real-world datasets and can be seamlessly integrated into other Transformer-based and LLM-based forecasters, delivering performance improvements up to 20.7\% over original models. Code is available at this repository: https://github.com/nyuolab/Gateformer.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Attention Evolutional Graph Convolutional Network for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00302v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series forecasting enables the prediction of future states by leveraging historical data, thereby facilitating decision-making processes. Each data node in a multivariate time series encompasses a sequence of multiple dimensions. These nodes exhibit interdependent relationships, forming a graph structure. While existing prediction methods often assume a fixed graph structure, many real-world scenarios involve dynamic graph structures. Moreover, interactions among time series observed at different time scales vary significantly. To enhance prediction accuracy by capturing precise temporal and spatial features, this paper introduces the Temporal Attention Evolutional Graph Convolutional Network (TAEGCN). This novel method not only integrates causal temporal convolution and a multi-head self-attention mechanism to learn temporal features of nodes, but also construct the dynamic graph structure based on these temporal features to keep the consistency of the changing in spatial feature with temporal series. TAEGCN adeptly captures temporal causal relationships and hidden spatial dependencies within the data. Furthermore, TAEGCN incorporates a unified neural network that seamlessly integrates these components to generate final predictions. Experimental results conducted on two public transportation network datasets, METR-LA and PEMS-BAY, demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed model.</p></details> | 13 pages, 7 figures |

Despite long-standing concerns, there are limited methods that can efficiently and accurately detect and segment leaks due to their concealed appearance and random shapes. In this paper, we propose a Fine-grained Spatial-Temporal Perception (FGSTP) algorithm for gas leak segmentation. FGSTP captures critical motion clues across frames and integrates them with refined object features in an end-to-end network. Specifically, we first construct a correlation volume to capture motion information between consecutive frames. Then, the fine-grained perception progressively refines the object-level features using previous outputs. Finally, a decoder is employed to optimize boundary segmentation. Because there is no highly precise labeled dataset for gas leak segmentation, we manually label a gas leak video dataset, GasVid. Experimental results on GasVid demonstrate that our model excels in segmenting non-rigid objects such as gas leaks, generating the most accurate mask compared to other state-of-the-art (SOTA) models.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, ICIP 2025 Conference</p></details> |

To address this, we propose a neuro-symbolic explanation framework that generates a weighted signal temporal logic (wSTL) specification to describe a robot policy in a interpretable form. Existing methods typically produce explanations that are verbose and inconsistent, which hinders explainability, and loose, which do not give meaningful insights into the underlying policy. We address these issues by introducing a simplification process consisting of predicate filtering, regularization, and iterative pruning. We also introduce three novel explainability evaluation metrics -- conciseness, consistency, and strictness -- to assess explanation quality beyond conventional classification metrics. Our method is validated in three simulated robotic environments, where it outperforms baselines in generating concise, consistent, and strict wSTL explanations without sacrificing classification accuracy. This work bridges policy learning with formal methods, contributing to safer and more transparent decision-making in robotics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predicting clinical outcomes from patient care pathways represented with temporal knowledge graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21138v2)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: With the increasing availability of healthcare data, predictive modeling finds many applications in the biomedical domain, such as the evaluation of the level of risk for various conditions, which in turn can guide clinical decision making. However, it is unclear how knowledge graph data representations and their embedding, which are competitive in some settings, could be of interest in biomedical predictive modeling. Method: We simulated synthetic but realistic data of patients with intracranial aneurysm and experimented on the task of predicting their clinical outcome. We compared the performance of various classification approaches on tabular data versus a graph-based representation of the same data. Next, we investigated how the adopted schema for representing first individual data and second temporal data impacts predictive performances. Results: Our study illustrates that in our case, a graph representation and Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) embeddings reach the best performance for a predictive task from observational data. We emphasize the importance of the adopted schema and of the consideration of literal values in the representation of individual data. Our study also moderates the relative impact of various time encoding on GCN performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Historically Relevant Event Structuring for Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10621v2)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG) reasoning focuses on predicting events through historical information within snapshots distributed on a timeline. Existing studies mainly concentrate on two perspectives of leveraging the history of TKGs, including capturing evolution of each recent snapshot or correlations among global historical facts. Despite the achieved significant accomplishments, these models still fall short of I) investigating the impact of multi-granular interactions across recent snapshots, and II) harnessing the expressive semantics of significant links accorded with queries throughout the entire history, particularly events exerting a profound impact on the future. These inadequacies restrict representation ability to reflect historical dependencies and future trends thoroughly. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose an innovative TKG reasoning approach towards \textbf{His}torically \textbf{R}elevant \textbf{E}vents \textbf{S}tructuring (HisRES). Concretely, HisRES comprises two distinctive modules excelling in structuring historically relevant events within TKGs, including a multi-granularity evolutionary encoder that captures structural and temporal dependencies of the most recent snapshots, and a global relevance encoder that concentrates on crucial correlations among events relevant to queries from the entire history. Furthermore, HisRES incorporates a self-gating mechanism for adaptively merging multi-granularity recent and historically relevant structuring representations. Extensive experiments on four event-based benchmarks demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of HisRES and indicate the superiority and effectiveness of structuring historical relevance for TKG reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICDE 2025, 12 pages</p></details> |
| **[Rethinking Pseudo-Label Guided Learning for Weakly Supervised Temporal Action Localization from the Perspective of Noise Correction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11124v2)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pseudo-label learning methods have been widely applied in weakly-supervised temporal action localization. Existing works directly utilize weakly-supervised base model to generate instance-level pseudo-labels for training the fully-supervised detection head. We argue that the noise in pseudo-labels would interfere with the learning of fully-supervised detection head, leading to significant performance leakage. Issues with noisy labels include:(1) inaccurate boundary localization; (2) undetected short action clips; (3) multiple adjacent segments incorrectly detected as one segment. To target these issues, we introduce a two-stage noisy label learning strategy to harness every potential useful signal in noisy labels. First, we propose a frame-level pseudo-label generation model with a context-aware denoising algorithm to refine the boundaries. Second, we introduce an online-revised teacher-student framework with a missing instance compensation module and an ambiguous instance correction module to solve the short-action-missing and many-to-one problems. Besides, we apply a high-quality pseudo-label mining loss in our online-revised teacher-student framework to add different weights to the noisy labels to train more effectively. Our model outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method in detection accuracy and inference speed greatly upon the THUMOS14 and ActivityNet v1.2 benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[MoSAM: Motion-Guided Segment Anything Model with Spatial-Temporal Memory Selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00739v1)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) has demonstrated exceptional capabilities in interactive object segmentation for both images and videos. However, as a foundational model on interactive segmentation, SAM2 performs segmentation directly based on mask memory from the past six frames, leading to two significant challenges. Firstly, during inference in videos, objects may disappear since SAM2 relies solely on memory without accounting for object motion information, which limits its long-range object tracking capabilities. Secondly, its memory is constructed from fixed past frames, making it susceptible to challenges associated with object disappearance or occlusion, due to potentially inaccurate segmentation results in memory. To address these problems, we present MoSAM, incorporating two key strategies to integrate object motion cues into the model and establish more reliable feature memory. Firstly, we propose Motion-Guided Prompting (MGP), which represents the object motion in both sparse and dense manners, then injects them into SAM2 through a set of motion-guided prompts. MGP enables the model to adjust its focus towards the direction of motion, thereby enhancing the object tracking capabilities. Furthermore, acknowledging that past segmentation results may be inaccurate, we devise a Spatial-Temporal Memory Selection (ST-MS) mechanism that dynamically identifies frames likely to contain accurate segmentation in both pixel- and frame-level. By eliminating potentially inaccurate mask predictions from memory, we can leverage more reliable memory features to exploit similar regions for improving segmentation results. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks of video object segmentation and video instance segmentation demonstrate that our MoSAM achieves state-of-the-art results compared to other competitors.</p></details> |  |
| **[BOPIM: Bayesian Optimization for influence maximization on temporal networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04700v4)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The goal of influence maximization (IM) is to select a small set of seed nodes which maximizes the spread of influence on a network. In this work, we propose BOPIM, a Bayesian Optimization (BO) algorithm for IM on temporal networks. The IM task is well-suited for a BO solution due to its expensive and complicated objective function. There are at least two key challenges, however, that must be overcome, primarily due to the inputs coming from a cardinality-constrained, non-Euclidean, combinatorial space. The first is constructing the kernel function for the Gaussian Process regression. We propose two kernels, one based on the Hamming distance between seed sets and the other leveraging the Jaccard coefficient between node's neighbors. The second challenge is the acquisition function. For this, we use the Expected Improvement function, suitably adjusting for noise in the observations, and optimize it using a greedy algorithm to account for the cardinality constraint. In numerical experiments on real-world networks, we prove that BOPIM outperforms competing methods and yields comparable influence spreads to a gold-standard greedy algorithm while being as much as ten times faster. In addition, we find that the Hamming kernel performs favorably compared to the Jaccard kernel in nearly all settings, a somewhat surprising result as the former does not explicitly account for the graph structure. Finally, we demonstrate two ways that the proposed method can quantify uncertainty in optimal seed sets. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to look at uncertainty in the seed sets for IM.</p></details> |  |

By combining structured knowledge graphs with contextually enriched text segments, Graph RAG offers a promising solution to address the inherent complexity and vast volume of legal data. The integration of hierarchical structure and temporal evolution into knowledge graphs - along with the concept of comprehensive Text Units - facilitates the construction of richer, interconnected representations of legal knowledge. Through a detailed analysis of Graph RAG and its application to legal norm datasets, this article aims to significantly advance the field of Artificial Intelligence applied to Law, creating opportunities for more effective systems in legal research, legislative analysis, and decision support.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Temporal Logic Task and Motion Planning for Multi-Robot Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18899v2)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Task and motion planning (TAMP) for multi-robot systems, which integrates discrete task planning with continuous motion planning, remains a challenging problem in robotics. Existing TAMP approaches often struggle to scale effectively for multi-robot systems with complex specifications, leading to infeasible solutions and prolonged computation times. This work addresses the TAMP problem in multi-robot settings where tasks are specified using expressive hierarchical temporal logic and task assignments are not pre-determined. Our approach leverages the efficiency of hierarchical temporal logic specifications for task-level planning and the optimization-based graph of convex sets method for motion-level planning, integrating them within a product graph framework. At the task level, we convert hierarchical temporal logic specifications into a single graph, embedding task allocation within its edges. At the motion level, we represent the feasible motions of multiple robots through convex sets in the configuration space, guided by a sampling-based motion planner. This formulation allows us to define the TAMP problem as a shortest path search within the product graph, where efficient convex optimization techniques can be applied. We prove that our approach is both sound and complete under mild assumptions. Additionally, we extend our framework to cooperative pick-and-place tasks involving object handovers between robots. We evaluate our method across various high-dimensional multi-robot scenarios, including simulated and real-world environments with quadrupeds, robotic arms, and automated conveyor systems. Our results show that our approach outperforms existing methods in execution time and solution optimality while effectively scaling with task complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Robotics: Science and Systems (RSS 2025)</p></details> |

However, current monocular 3D lane detection methods suffer from two limitations, including inaccurate geometric information of the predicted 3D lanes and difficulties in maintaining lane integrity. To address these issues, we seek to fully exploit the potential of multiple input frames. First, we aim at enhancing the ability to perceive the geometry of scenes by leveraging temporal geometric consistency. Second, we strive to improve the integrity of lanes by revealing more instance information from temporal sequences. Therefore, we propose a novel Geometry-aware Temporal Aggregation Network (GTA-Net) for monocular 3D lane detection. On one hand, we develop the Temporal Geometry Enhancement Module (TGEM), which exploits geometric consistency across successive frames, facilitating effective geometry perception. On the other hand, we present the Temporal Instance-aware Query Generation (TIQG), which strategically incorporates temporal cues into query generation, thereby enabling the exploration of comprehensive instance information. Experiments demonstrate that our GTA-Net achieves SoTA results, surpassing existing monocular 3D lane detection solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Separation with Entropy Regularization for Knowledge Distillation in Spiking Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03144v2)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), inspired by the human brain, offer significant computational efficiency through discrete spike-based information transfer. Despite their potential to reduce inference energy consumption, a performance gap persists between SNNs and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), primarily due to current training methods and inherent model limitations. While recent research has aimed to enhance SNN learning by employing knowledge distillation (KD) from ANN teacher networks, traditional distillation techniques often overlook the distinctive spatiotemporal properties of SNNs, thus failing to fully leverage their advantages. To overcome these challenge, we propose a novel logit distillation method characterized by temporal separation and entropy regularization. This approach improves existing SNN distillation techniques by performing distillation learning on logits across different time steps, rather than merely on aggregated output features. Furthermore, the integration of entropy regularization stabilizes model optimization and further boosts the performance. Extensive experimental results indicate that our method surpasses prior SNN distillation strategies, whether based on logit distillation, feature distillation, or a combination of both. The code will be available on GitHub.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |

However, the performance gap between SNNs and ANNs remains a substantial challenge hindering the widespread adoption of SNNs. In this paper, we propose a Spatial-Temporal Attention Aggregator SNN (STAA-SNN) framework, which dynamically focuses on and captures both spatial and temporal dependencies. First, we introduce a spike-driven self-attention mechanism specifically designed for SNNs. Additionally, we pioneeringly incorporate position encoding to integrate latent temporal relationships into the incoming features. For spatial-temporal information aggregation, we employ step attention to selectively amplify relevant features at different steps. Finally, we implement a time-step random dropout strategy to avoid local optima. As a result, STAA-SNN effectively captures both spatial and temporal dependencies, enabling the model to analyze complex patterns and make accurate predictions. The framework demonstrates exceptional performance across diverse datasets and exhibits strong generalization capabilities. Notably, STAA-SNN achieves state-of-the-art results on neuromorphic datasets CIFAR10-DVS, with remarkable performances of 97.14%, 82.05% and 70.40% on the static datasets CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet, respectively. Furthermore, our model exhibits improved performance ranging from 0.33\% to 2.80\% with fewer time steps.

| **[ADiff4TPP: Asynchronous Diffusion Models for Temporal Point Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20411v1)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work introduces a novel approach to modeling temporal point processes using diffusion models with an asynchronous noise schedule. At each step of the diffusion process, the noise schedule injects noise of varying scales into different parts of the data. With a careful design of the noise schedules, earlier events are generated faster than later ones, thus providing stronger conditioning for forecasting the more distant future. We derive an objective to effectively train these models for a general family of noise schedules based on conditional flow matching. Our method models the joint distribution of the latent representations of events in a sequence and achieves state-of-the-art results in predicting both the next inter-event time and event type on benchmark datasets. Additionally, it flexibly accommodates varying lengths of observation and prediction windows in different forecasting settings by adjusting the starting and ending points of the generation process. Finally, our method shows superior performance in long-horizon prediction tasks, outperforming existing baseline methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-temporal data fusion of censored threshold exceedances](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20268v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data fusion models are widely used in air quality monitoring to integrate in situ and remote-sensing data, offering spatially complete and temporally detailed estimates. However, traditional Gaussian-based models often underestimate extreme pollution values, leading to biased risk assessments. To address this, we present a Bayesian hierarchical data fusion framework rooted in extreme value theory, using the Dirac-delta generalised Pareto distribution to jointly account for threshold and non-threshold exceedances while preserving the temporal structure of extreme events. Our model is used to describe and predict censored threshold exceedances of PM2.5 pollution in the Greater London region by using remote sensing observations from the EAC4 dataset, a reanalysis product from the Copernicus Atmospheric Monitoring Service (CAMS), and in situ observation stations from the automatic urban and rural network (AURN) ran by the UK government. Some of our approach's key innovations include combining data with varying spatio-temporal resolutions and fully accounting for parameter uncertainties. Results show that our model outperforms Gaussian-based alternatives and standalone remote-sensing data in predicting threshold exceedances at the majority of observation sites and can even result in improved spatial patterns of PM2.5 pollution than those discernible from the remote-sensing data. Moreover, our approach captures greater variability and spatial patterns, such as higher PM2.5 concentrations near coastal areas, which are not evident in remote-sensing data alone.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Neural Operator for Modeling Time-Dependent Physical Phenomena](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20249v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Operators (NOs) are machine learning models designed to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) by learning to map between function spaces. Neural Operators such as the Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) and the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) have demonstrated excellent generalization properties when mapping between spatial function spaces. However, they struggle in mapping the temporal dynamics of time-dependent PDEs, especially for time steps not explicitly seen during training. This limits their temporal accuracy as they do not leverage these dynamics in the training process. In addition, most NOs tend to be prohibitively costly to train, especially for higher-dimensional PDEs. In this paper, we propose the Temporal Neural Operator (TNO), an efficient neural operator specifically designed for spatio-temporal operator learning for time-dependent PDEs. TNO achieves this by introducing a temporal-branch to the DeepONet framework, leveraging the best architectural design choices from several other NOs, and a combination of training strategies including Markov assumption, teacher forcing, temporal bundling, and the flexibility to condition the output on the current state or past states. Through extensive benchmarking and an ablation study on a diverse set of example problems we demonstrate the TNO long range temporal extrapolation capabilities, robustness to error accumulation, resolution invariance, and flexibility to handle multiple input functions.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a novel method at the intersection of artificial intelligence and medicine, aiming to develop machine learning models with direct real-world applications in surgical contexts. We propose a multi-modal framework that leverages recent advancements in computer vision and large language models to generate comprehensive video summaries. % The approach is structured in three key stages. First, surgical videos are divided into clips, and visual features are extracted at the frame level using visual transformers. This step focuses on detecting tools, tissues, organs, and surgical actions. Second, the extracted features are transformed into frame-level captions via large language models. These are then combined with temporal features, captured using a ViViT-based encoder, to produce clip-level summaries that reflect the broader context of each video segment. Finally, the clip-level descriptions are aggregated into a full surgical report using a dedicated LLM tailored for the summarization task. % We evaluate our method on the CholecT50 dataset, using instrument and action annotations from 50 laparoscopic videos. The results show strong performance, achieving 96\% precision in tool detection and a BERT score of 0.74 for temporal context summarization. This work contributes to the advancement of AI-assisted tools for surgical reporting, offering a step toward more intelligent and reliable clinical documentation.</p></details> |  |

Signal Temporal Logic (STL) provides a formal framework for specifying such objectives, with robustness metrics widely employed for control synthesis. Existing optimization-based approaches using neural network (NN)-based controllers often rely on a single NN for both learning and control. However, variations in initial states and obstacle configurations can lead to discontinuous changes in the optimization solution, thereby degrading generalization and control performance. To address this issue, this study proposes a method to enhance recurrent neural network (RNN)-based control by clustering solution trajectories that satisfy STL specifications under diverse initial conditions. The proposed approach utilizes trajectory similarity metrics to generate clustering labels, which are subsequently used to train a classification network. This network assigns new initial states and obstacle configurations to the appropriate cluster, enabling the selection of a specialized controller. By explicitly accounting for variations in solution trajectories, the proposed method improves both estimation accuracy and control performance. Numerical experiments on a dynamic vehicle path planning problem demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted for publication</p></details> |

Recognizing the sparsity and complexity of 3D space, previous vision-centric methods have employed implicit learning-based approaches to model spatial and temporal information. However, these approaches struggle to capture local details and diminish the model's spatial discriminative ability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel explicit state-based modeling method designed to leverage the occupied state to renovate the 3D features. Specifically, we propose a sparse occlusion-aware attention mechanism, integrated with a cascade refinement strategy, which accurately renovates 3D features with the guidance of occupied state information. Additionally, we introduce a novel method for modeling long-term dynamic interactions, which reduces computational costs and preserves spatial information. Compared to the previous state-of-the-art methods, our efficient explicit renovation strategy not only delivers superior performance in terms of RayIoU and mAVE for occupancy and scene flow prediction but also markedly reduces GPU memory usage during training, bringing it down to 8.7GB.

It examines whether LMs can correctly associate a temporal context with a past fact valid over a defined period, by asking them to differentiate correct from incorrect contexts. The accuracy of LMs is analyzed along two dimensions: the distance of the incorrect context from the validity period and the granularity of the context. To this end, a dataset called TimeStress is introduced, enabling the evaluation of 18 diverse LMs. Results reveal that the best LM achieves perfect accuracy for only 6% of the studied facts, with critical errors that humans would not make. This work highlights the limitations of current LMs in temporal representation. We provide all data and code for further research.</p></details> | preprint v4 |

However, the motifs previously considered are either limited to a handful of nodes and edges, or do not include triangles, which are thought to be of critical relevance to understand the dynamics of social systems. Thus, we introduce a new class of motifs, that include these triangles, are not limited in their number of nodes or edges, and yet can be mined efficiently in any temporal network. Referring to these motifs as the edge-centered motifs, we show analytically how they subsume the Egocentric Temporal Neighborhoods motifs of the literature. We also confirm in empirical data that the edge-centered motifs bring relevant information with respect to the Egocentric motifs by using a principle of maximum entropy. Then, we show how mining for the edge-centered motifs in a network can be used to probe for spatial correlations in the underlying dynamics that have produced that network. We deduce an approximate formula for the distribution of the edge-centered motifs in empirical networks of social face-to-face interactions. In the last section of this paper, we explore how the statistics of the edge-centered motifs can be used to infer the complete topology of the network they were sampled from. This leads to the needs of mathematical development, that we inaugurate here under the name of graph tiling theory.</p></details> |  |

While current practices attempt to address this by organizing these phases into hybrid batches, such solutions create an inefficient tradeoff that sacrifices either throughput or latency, leaving substantial GPU resources underutilized. We identify two key root causes: 1) the prefill phase suffers from suboptimal compute utilization due to wave quantization and attention bottlenecks. 2) hybrid batches disproportionately prioritize latency over throughput, resulting in wasted compute and memory bandwidth. To mitigate the issues, we present Bullet, a novel spatial-temporal orchestration system that eliminates these inefficiencies through precise phase coordination. Bullet enables concurrent execution of prefill and decode phases, while dynamically provisioning GPU resources using real-time performance modeling. By integrating SLO-aware scheduling and adaptive resource allocation, Bullet maximizes utilization without compromising latency targets. Experimental evaluations on real-world workloads demonstrate that Bullet delivers 1.26x average throughput gains (up to 1.55x) over state-of-the-arts, while consistently meeting latency constraints.</p></details> |  |

The proposed framework is data-driven and abstraction-based: leveraging observations of the system, our approach learns a high-confidence abstraction of the system in the form of an uncertain Markov decision process (UMDP). The uncertainty in the resulting UMDP is used to formally account for both the error in abstracting the system and for the uncertainty coming from the data. Critically, we show that for any given state-action pair in the resulting UMDP, the uncertainty in the transition probabilities can be represented as a convex polytope obtained by a two-layer state discretization and concentration inequalities. This allows us to obtain tighter uncertainty estimates compared to existing approaches, and guarantees efficiency, as we tailor a synthesis algorithm exploiting the structure of this UMDP. We empirically validate our approach on several case studies, showing substantially improved performance compared to the state-of-the-art.</p></details> |  |

This inefficiency primarily arises from the quadratic computational complexity of 3D Full Attention with respect to the context length. In this paper, we propose a training-free framework termed Sparse VideoGen (SVG) that leverages the inherent sparsity in 3D Full Attention to boost inference efficiency. We reveal that the attention heads can be dynamically classified into two groups depending on distinct sparse patterns: (1) Spatial Head, where only spatially-related tokens within each frame dominate the attention output, and (2) Temporal Head, where only temporally-related tokens across different frames dominate. Based on this insight, SVG proposes an online profiling strategy to capture the dynamic sparse patterns and predicts the type of attention head. Combined with a novel hardware-efficient tensor layout transformation and customized kernel implementations, SVG achieves up to 2.28x and 2.33x end-to-end speedup on CogVideoX-v1.5 and HunyuanVideo, respectively, while preserving generation quality.

This kernel scheme reduces the number of parameters with respect to a fully connected neural network (NN). While CNN has proven to be an effective model in recognition of handwritten characters and traffic signal sign boards, etc. recently, its deep variants have proven to be effective in similar as well as more challenging applications like object, scene and action recognition. Deep CNN add more layers and kernels to the classical CNN, increasing the number of parameters, and partly reducing the main advantage of CNN which is less parameters. In this paper, a 3D pyramidal neural network called 3DPyraNet and a discriminative approach for spatio-temporal feature learning based on it, called 3DPyraNet-F, are proposed. 3DPyraNet introduces a new weighting scheme which learns features from both spatial and temporal dimensions analyzing multiple adjacent frames and keeping a biological plausible structure. It keeps the spatial topology of the input image and presents fewer parameters and lower computational and memory costs compared to both fully connected NNs and recent deep CNNs. 3DPyraNet-F extract the features maps of the highest layer of the learned network, fuse them in a single vector, and provide it as input in such a way to a linear-SVM classifier that enhances the recognition of human actions and dynamic scenes from the videos. Encouraging results are reported with 3DPyraNet in real-world environments, especially in the presence of camera induced motion. Further, 3DPyraNet-F clearly outperforms the state-of-the-art on three benchmark datasets and shows comparable result for the fourth.</p></details> |  |

To fully utilize the local and global temporal information within frames, we systematically modeled the short-term and long-term temporal discrepancies since we observed that these discrepancies offer distinct and mutually complementary properties. Specifically, we devise a Short-term Temporal Difference Module (S-TDM) to extract local motion representations from RGB difference maps between adjacent frames, which yields more clues for accurate texture representation. To explore the global dependency in the entire frame sequence, a Long-term Temporal Difference Module (L-TDM) is proposed, where the differences between forward and backward segments are incorporated and activated to guide the modulation of the temporal feature, leading to a holistic global compensation. Moreover, we further propose a Difference Compensation Unit (DCU) to enrich the interaction between the spatial distribution of the target frame and temporal compensated results, which helps maintain spatial consistency while refining the features to avoid misalignment. Rigorous objective and subjective evaluations conducted across five mainstream video satellites demonstrate that our method performs favorably against state-of-the-art approaches.

The architecture is structured around CNN-based representation layers, each dedicated to an independent representation learning task and designed to capture diverse temporal patterns, followed by an attention-based feature extraction layer and a merge layer, designed to aggregate extracted features. The architecture is fundamentally based on a configuration that is inspired by a Transformer encoder, with self-attention mechanisms at its core. The TSRM architecture outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on most of the seven established benchmark datasets considered in our empirical evaluation for both forecasting and imputation tasks. At the same time, it significantly reduces complexity in the form of learnable parameters. The source code is available at https://github.com/RobertLeppich/TSRM.</p></details> |  |
| **[M2R2: MulitModal Robotic Representation for Temporal Action Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18662v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal action segmentation (TAS) has long been a key area of research in both robotics and computer vision. In robotics, algorithms have primarily focused on leveraging proprioceptive information to determine skill boundaries, with recent approaches in surgical robotics incorporating vision. In contrast, computer vision typically relies on exteroceptive sensors, such as cameras. Existing multimodal TAS models in robotics integrate feature fusion within the model, making it difficult to reuse learned features across different models. Meanwhile, pretrained vision-only feature extractors commonly used in computer vision struggle in scenarios with limited object visibility. In this work, we address these challenges by proposing M2R2, a multimodal feature extractor tailored for TAS, which combines information from both proprioceptive and exteroceptive sensors. We introduce a novel pretraining strategy that enables the reuse of learned features across multiple TAS models. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the REASSEMBLE dataset, a challenging multimodal robotic assembly dataset, outperforming existing robotic action segmentation models by 46.6%. Additionally, we conduct an extensive ablation study to evaluate the contribution of different modalities in robotic TAS tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

While T2-weighted (T2w) MRI with high in-plane resolution is widely used to segment hippocampal subfields due to its higher contrast in hippocampus, its lower out-of-plane resolution reduces the accuracy of subregion thickness measurements. To address this issue, we developed a nearly isotropic segmentation pipeline that incorporates image and label upsampling and high-resolution segmentation in T2w MRI. First, a high-resolution atlas was created based on an existing anisotropic atlas derived from 29 individuals. Both T1-weighted and T2w images in the atlas were upsampled from their original resolution to a nearly isotropic resolution 0.4x0.4x0.52mm3 using a non-local means approach. Manual segmentations within the atlas were also upsampled to match this resolution using a UNet-based neural network, which was trained on a cohort consisting of both high-resolution ex vivo and low-resolution anisotropic in vivo MRI with manual segmentations. Second, a multi-modality deep learning-based segmentation model was trained within this nearly isotropic atlas. Finally, experiments showed the nearly isotropic subregion segmentation improved the accuracy of cortical thickness as an imaging biomarker for neurodegeneration in T2w MRI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Equi-Euler GraphNet: An Equivariant, Temporal-Dynamics Informed Graph Neural Network for Dual Force and Trajectory Prediction in Multi-Body Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13768v3)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate real-time modeling of multi-body dynamical systems is essential for enabling digital twin applications across industries. While many data-driven approaches aim to learn system dynamics, jointly predicting internal loads and system trajectories remains a key challenge. This dual prediction is especially important for fault detection and predictive maintenance, where internal loads-such as contact forces-act as early indicators of faults, reflecting wear or misalignment before affecting motion. These forces also serve as inputs to degradation models (e.g., crack growth), enabling damage prediction and remaining useful life estimation. We propose Equi-Euler GraphNet, a physics-informed graph neural network (GNN) that simultaneously predicts internal forces and global trajectories in multi-body systems. In this mesh-free framework, nodes represent system components and edges encode interactions. Equi-Euler GraphNet introduces two inductive biases: (1) an equivariant message-passing scheme, interpreting edge messages as interaction forces consistent under Euclidean transformations; and (2) a temporal-aware iterative node update mechanism, based on Euler integration, to capture influence of distant interactions over time. Tailored for cylindrical roller bearings, it decouples ring dynamics from constrained motion of rolling elements. Trained on high-fidelity multiphysics simulations, Equi-Euler GraphNet generalizes beyond the training distribution, accurately predicting loads and trajectories under unseen speeds, loads, and configurations. It outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs focused on trajectory prediction, delivering stable rollouts over thousands of time steps with minimal error accumulation. Achieving up to a 200x speedup over conventional solvers while maintaining comparable accuracy, it serves as an efficient reduced-order model for digital twins, design, and maintenance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Reupl...</summary><p>Reuploaded with new version-- equation 16 was incorrect</p></details> |

However, existing methods often fail to incorporate adequate spatio-temporal modeling and prompt alignment within a unified framework, resulting in temporal inconsistencies, geometric distortions, or low-quality 4D content that deviates from the provided texts. Therefore, we propose STP4D, a novel approach that aims to integrate comprehensive spatio-temporal-prompt consistency modeling for high-quality text-to-4D generation. Specifically, STP4D employs three carefully designed modules: Time-varying Prompt Embedding, Geometric Information Enhancement, and Temporal Extension Deformation, which collaborate to accomplish this goal. Furthermore, STP4D is among the first methods to exploit the Diffusion model to generate 4D Gaussians, combining the fine-grained modeling capabilities and the real-time rendering process of 4DGS with the rapid inference speed of the Diffusion model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STP4D excels in generating high-fidelity 4D content with exceptional efficiency (approximately 4.6s per asset), surpassing existing methods in both quality and speed.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Entailment Pretraining for Clinical Language Models over EHR Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18128v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clinical language models have achieved strong performance on downstream tasks by pretraining on domain specific corpora such as discharge summaries and medical notes. However, most approaches treat the electronic health record as a static document, neglecting the temporally-evolving and causally entwined nature of patient trajectories. In this paper, we introduce a novel temporal entailment pretraining objective for language models in the clinical domain. Our method formulates EHR segments as temporally ordered sentence pairs and trains the model to determine whether a later state is entailed by, contradictory to, or neutral with respect to an earlier state. Through this temporally structured pretraining task, models learn to perform latent clinical reasoning over time, improving their ability to generalize across forecasting and diagnosis tasks. We pretrain on a large corpus derived from MIMIC IV and demonstrate state of the art results on temporal clinical QA, early warning prediction, and disease progression modeling.</p></details> |  |

Multi-sensor synchronous measurement has proven to be more effective for WHAR than using a single sensor. However, existing WHAR methods use shared convolutional kernels for indiscriminate temporal feature extraction across each sensor variable, which fails to effectively capture spatio-temporal relationships of intra-sensor and inter-sensor variables. We propose the DecomposeWHAR model consisting of a decomposition phase and a fusion phase to better model the relationships between modality variables. The decomposition creates high-dimensional representations of each intra-sensor variable through the improved Depth Separable Convolution to capture local temporal features while preserving their unique characteristics. The fusion phase begins by capturing relationships between intra-sensor variables and fusing their features at both the channel and variable levels. Long-range temporal dependencies are modeled using the State Space Model (SSM), and later cross-sensor interactions are dynamically captured through a self-attention mechanism, highlighting inter-sensor spatial correlations. Our model demonstrates superior performance on three widely used WHAR datasets, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art models while maintaining acceptable computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[PTCL: Pseudo-Label Temporal Curriculum Learning for Label-Limited Dynamic Graph](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17641v2)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic node classification is critical for modeling evolving systems like financial transactions and academic collaborations. In such systems, dynamically capturing node information changes is critical for dynamic node classification, which usually requires all labels at every timestamp. However, it is difficult to collect all dynamic labels in real-world scenarios due to high annotation costs and label uncertainty (e.g., ambiguous or delayed labels in fraud detection). In contrast, final timestamp labels are easier to obtain as they rely on complete temporal patterns and are usually maintained as a unique label for each user in many open platforms, without tracking the history data. To bridge this gap, we propose PTCL(Pseudo-label Temporal Curriculum Learning), a pioneering method addressing label-limited dynamic node classification where only final labels are available. PTCL introduces: (1) a temporal decoupling architecture separating the backbone (learning time-aware representations) and decoder (strictly aligned with final labels), which generate pseudo-labels, and (2) a Temporal Curriculum Learning strategy that prioritizes pseudo-labels closer to the final timestamp by assigning them higher weights using an exponentially decaying function. We contribute a new academic dataset (CoOAG), capturing long-range research interest in dynamic graph. Experiments across real-world scenarios demonstrate PTCL's consistent superiority over other methods adapted to this task. Beyond methodology, we propose a unified framework FLiD (Framework for Label-Limited Dynamic Node Classification), consisting of a complete preparation workflow, training pipeline, and evaluation standards, and supporting various models and datasets.

Existing deep learning models often lack spatial generalizability, rely on complex architectures, and struggle with real-time deployment. To address these limitations, we propose the Temporal Graph-based Digital Twin (TGDT), a scalable framework that integrates Temporal Convolutional Networks and Attentional Graph Neural Networks for dynamic, direction-aware traffic modeling and assessment at urban corridors. TGDT estimates key Measures of Effectiveness (MOEs) for traffic flow optimization at both the intersection level (e.g., queue length, waiting time) and the corridor level (e.g., traffic volume, travel time). Its modular architecture and sequential optimization scheme enable easy extension to any number of intersections and MOEs. The model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by accurately producing high-dimensional, concurrent multi-output estimates. It also demonstrates high robustness and accuracy across diverse traffic conditions, including extreme scenarios, while relying on only a minimal set of traffic features. Fully parallelized, TGDT can simulate over a thousand scenarios within a matter of seconds, offering a cost-effective, interpretable, and real-time solution for traffic signal optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

A crucial yet underexplored aspect in the development of these systems is the creation of computer vision models capable of autonomously segmenting full-procedure colonoscopy videos into anatomical sections and procedural phases. In this work, we aim to create the first open-access dataset for this task and propose a state-of-the-art approach, benchmarked against competitive models. We annotated the publicly available REAL-Colon dataset, consisting of 2.7 million frames from 60 complete colonoscopy videos, with frame-level labels for anatomical locations and colonoscopy phases across nine categories. We then present ColonTCN, a learning-based architecture that employs custom temporal convolutional blocks designed to efficiently capture long temporal dependencies for the temporal segmentation of colonoscopy videos. We also propose a dual k-fold cross-validation evaluation protocol for this benchmark, which includes model assessment on unseen, multi-center data.ColonTCN achieves state-of-the-art performance in classification accuracy while maintaining a low parameter count when evaluated using the two proposed k-fold cross-validation settings, outperforming competitive models. We report ablation studies to provide insights into the challenges of this task and highlight the benefits of the custom temporal convolutional blocks, which enhance learning and improve model efficiency. We believe that the proposed open-access benchmark and the ColonTCN approach represent a significant advancement in the temporal segmentation of colonoscopy procedures, fostering further open-access research to address this clinical need.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Hybrid Framework for Real-Time Data Drift and Anomaly Identification Using Hierarchical Temporal Memory and Statistical Tests](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18599v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data Drift is the phenomenon where the generating model behind the data changes over time. Due to data drift, any model built on the past training data becomes less relevant and inaccurate over time. Thus, detecting and controlling for data drift is critical in machine learning models. Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) is a machine learning model developed by Jeff Hawkins, inspired by how the human brain processes information. It is a biologically inspired model of memory that is similar in structure to the neocortex, and whose performance is claimed to be comparable to state of the art models in detecting anomalies in time series data. Another unique benefit of HTMs is its independence from training and testing cycle; all the learning takes place online with streaming data and no separate training and testing cycle is required. In sequential learning paradigm, Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT) offers some unique benefit for online learning and inference. This paper proposes a novel hybrid framework combining HTM and SPRT for real-time data drift detection and anomaly identification. Unlike existing data drift methods, our approach eliminates frequent retraining and ensures low false positive rates. HTMs currently work with one dimensional or univariate data. In a second study, we also propose an application of HTM in multidimensional supervised scenario for anomaly detection by combining the outputs of multiple HTM columns, one for each dimension of the data, through a neural network. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms conventional drift detection techniques like the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test, Wasserstein distance, and Population Stability Index (PSI) in terms of accuracy, adaptability, and computational efficiency. Our experiments also provide insights into optimizing hyperparameters for real-time deployment in domains such as Telecom.</p></details> | 26 pages, 9 figures |

In this article, we relax this problem and ask whether a given degree sequence can be realized as a temporally connected graph. Our main results are a complete characterization of the feasible cases, and a recognition algorithm that runs in $O(n)$ time for graphical degree sequences (realized as simple temporal graphs) and in $O(n+m)$ time for multigraphical degree sequences (realized as non-simple temporal graphs, where the number of time labels on an edge corresponds to the multiplicity of the edge in the multigraph). In fact, these algorithms can be made constructive at essentially no cost. Namely, we give a constructive $O(n+m)$ time algorithm that outputs, for a given (multi)graphical degree sequence $\mathbf{d}$, a temporally connected graph whose underlying (multi)graph is a realization of $\mathbf{d}$, if one exists.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automatic Generation of Safety-compliant Linear Temporal Logic via Large Language Model: A Self-supervised Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15840v2)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Converting high-level tasks described by natural language into formal specifications like Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) is a key step towards providing formal safety guarantees over cyber-physical systems (CPS). While the compliance of the formal specifications themselves against the safety restrictions imposed on CPS is crucial for ensuring safety, most existing works only focus on translation consistency between natural languages and formal specifications. In this paper, we introduce AutoSafeLTL, a self-supervised framework that utilizes large language models (LLMs) to automate the generation of LTL specifications complying with a set of safety restrictions while preserving their logical consistency and semantic accuracy. As a key insight, our framework integrates Language Inclusion check with an automated counterexample-guided modification mechanism to ensure the safety-compliance of the resulting LTL specifications. In particular, we develop 1) an LLM-as-an-Aligner, which performs atomic proposition matching between generated LTL specifications and safety restrictions to enforce semantic alignment; and 2) an LLM-as-a-Critic, which automates LTL specification refinement by interpreting counterexamples derived from Language Inclusion checks. Experimental results demonstrate that our architecture effectively guarantees safety-compliance for the generated LTL specifications, achieving a 0% violation rate against imposed safety restrictions. This shows the potential of our work in synergizing AI and formal verification techniques, enhancing safety-aware specification generation and automatic verification for both AI and critical CPS applications.</p></details> |  |

However, existing 3D segmentation models solely focus on spatial information. To address this gap, we propose OmniMamba4D, a novel segmentation model designed for 4D medical images (3D images over time). OmniMamba4D utilizes a spatio-temporal tetra-orientated Mamba block to effectively capture both spatial and temporal features. Unlike traditional 3D models, which analyze single-time points, OmniMamba4D processes 4D CT data, providing comprehensive spatio-temporal information on lesion progression. Evaluated on an internal dataset comprising of 3,252 CT scans, OmniMamba4D achieves a competitive Dice score of 0.682, comparable to state-of-the-arts (SOTA) models, while maintaining computational efficiency and better detecting disappeared lesions.

Traffic speed data is often incomplete due to sensor failures, data transmission delays, or occlusions, resulting in missing speed data in certain road segments. Currently, tensor decomposition based methods are extensively utilized, they mostly rely on the $L_2$-norm to construct their learning objectives, which leads to reduced robustness in the algorithms. To address this, we propose Temporal-Aware Traffic Speed Imputation (TATSI), which combines the $L_2$-norm and smooth $L_1$ (${SL}_1$)-norm in its loss function, thereby achieving both high accuracy and robust performance in imputing missing time-varying traffic speed data. TATSI adopts a single latent factor-dependent, nonnegative, and multiplicative update (SLF-NMU) approach, which serves as an efficient solver for performing nonnegative latent factor analysis (LFA) on a tensor. Empirical studies on three real-world time-varying traffic speed datasets demonstrate that, compared with state-of-the-art traffic speed predictors, TATSI more precisely captures temporal patterns, thereby yielding the most accurate imputations for missing traffic speed data.</p></details> | 11pages,3figures |

However, EEG signals are often noisy, affected by artifacts, and vary across individuals, complicating emotion recognition. While multimodal approaches have used Peripheral Physiological Signals (PPS) like GSR to complement EEG, they often overlook the dynamic synchronization and consistent semantics between the modalities. Additionally, the temporal dynamics of emotional fluctuations across different time resolutions in PPS remain underexplored. To address these challenges, we propose PhysioSync, a novel pre-training framework leveraging temporal and cross-modal contrastive learning, inspired by physiological synchronization phenomena. PhysioSync incorporates Cross-Modal Consistency Alignment (CM-CA) to model dynamic relationships between EEG and complementary PPS, enabling emotion-related synchronizations across modalities. Besides, it introduces Long- and Short-Term Temporal Contrastive Learning (LS-TCL) to capture emotional synchronization at different temporal resolutions within modalities. After pre-training, cross-resolution and cross-modal features are hierarchically fused and fine-tuned to enhance emotion recognition. Experiments on DEAP and DREAMER datasets demonstrate PhysioSync's advanced performance under uni-modal and cross-modal conditions, highlighting its effectiveness for EEG-centered emotion recognition.</p></details> | <details><summary>The s...</summary><p>The source code will be publicly available at https://github.com/MSA-LMC/PhysioSync</p></details> |

In many real-world applications, modeling both the internal structure of sets and their temporal relationships across time is essential for capturing complex underlying patterns. However, existing methods either focus on learning set representations at a static level, ignoring temporal dynamics, or treat sequences as ordered lists of individual elements, lacking explicit mechanisms to represent sets. In this work, we propose Set2Seq Transformer, a novel architecture that jointly models permutation-invariant set structure and temporal dependencies by learning temporal and positional-aware representations of sets within a sequence in an end-to-end multimodal manner. We evaluate our Set2Seq Transformer on two tasks that require modeling both set structure alongside temporal and positional patterns, but differ significantly in domain, modality, and objective. First, we consider a fine-art analysis task, modeling artists' oeuvres for predicting artistic success using a novel dataset, WikiArt-Seq2Rank. Second, we utilize our Set2Seq Transformer for a short-term wildfire danger forecasting task. Through extensive experimentation, we show that our Set2Seq Transformer significantly improves over traditional static multiple-instance learning methods by effectively learning permutation-invariant set, temporal, and positional-aware representations across diverse domains, modalities, and tasks. We will release both the dataset and model implementations on GitHub.</p></details> |  |
| **[Approximating Optimal Labelings for Temporal Connectivity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16837v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In a temporal graph the edge set dynamically changes over time according to a set of time-labels associated with each edge that indicates at which time-steps the edge is available. Two vertices are connected if there is a path connecting them in which the edges are traversed in increasing order of their labels. We study the problem of scheduling the availability time of the edges of a temporal graph in such a way that all pairs of vertices are connected within a given maximum allowed time $a$ and the overall number of labels is minimized. The problem, known as \emph{Minimum Aged Labeling} (MAL), has several applications in logistics, distribution scheduling, and information spreading in social networks, where carefully choosing the time-labels can significantly reduce infrastructure costs, fuel consumption, or greenhouse gases. The problem MAL has previously been proved to be NP-complete on undirected graphs and \APX-hard on directed graphs. In this paper, we extend our knowledge on the complexity and approximability of MAL in several directions. We first show that the problem cannot be approximated within a factor better than $O(\log n)$ when $a\geq 2$, unless $\text{P} = \text{NP}$, and a factor better than $2^{\log ^{1-\epsilon} n}$ when $a\geq 3$, unless $\text{NP}\subseteq \text{DTIME}(2^{\text{polylog}(n)})$, where $n$ is the number of vertices in the graph. Then we give a set of approximation algorithms that, under some conditions, almost match these lower bounds. In particular, we show that the approximation depends on a relation between $a$ and the diameter of the input graph. We further establish a connection with a foundational optimization problem on static graphs called \emph{Diameter Constrained Spanning Subgraph} (DCSS) and show that our hardness results also apply to DCSS.</p></details> |  |

However, the inherent nonlinearity of the marine dynamic system presents significant challenges. Current forecasting methods mainly include physics-based numerical simulations and data-driven machine learning approaches. The former, while describing SST evolution through differential equations, suffers from high computational complexity and limited applicability, whereas the latter, despite its computational benefits, requires large datasets and faces interpretability challenges. This study presents a prediction framework based solely on data-driven techniques. Using phase space reconstruction, we construct initial-delay attractor pairs with a mathematical homeomorphism and design a Spatio-Temporal Fusion Mapping (STFM) to uncover their intrinsic connections. Unlike conventional models, our method captures SST dynamics efficiently through phase space reconstruction and achieves high prediction accuracy with minimal training data in comparative tests</p></details> | 19 pages, 14 figures |

However, its effectiveness in video recognition tasks is hampered by two main challenges. First, fast adversarial training for video models remains largely unexplored, which severely impedes its practical applications. Specifically, most video adversarial training methods are computationally costly, with long training times and high expenses. Second, existing methods struggle with the trade-off between clean accuracy and adversarial robustness. To address these challenges, we introduce Video Fast Adversarial Training with Weak-to-Strong consistency (VFAT-WS), the first fast adversarial training method for video data. Specifically, VFAT-WS incorporates the following key designs: First, it integrates a straightforward yet effective temporal frequency augmentation (TF-AUG), and its spatial-temporal enhanced form STF-AUG, along with a single-step PGD attack to boost training efficiency and robustness. Second, it devises a weak-to-strong spatial-temporal consistency regularization, which seamlessly integrates the simpler TF-AUG and the more complex STF-AUG. Leveraging the consistency regularization, it steers the learning process from simple to complex augmentations. Both of them work together to achieve a better trade-off between clean accuracy and robustness. Extensive experiments on UCF-101 and HMDB-51 with both CNN and Transformer-based models demonstrate that VFAT-WS achieves great improvements in adversarial robustness and corruption robustness, while accelerating training by nearly 490%.</p></details> | <details><summary>After...</summary><p>After the submission of the paper, we realized that the study still has room for expansion.

| **[Chain-of-Thought Textual Reasoning for Few-shot Temporal Action Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13460v2)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional temporal action localization (TAL) methods rely on large amounts of detailed annotated data, whereas few-shot TAL reduces this dependence by using only a few training samples to identify unseen action categories. However, existing few-shot TAL methods typically focus solely on video-level information, neglecting textual information, which can provide valuable semantic support for the localization task. Therefore, we propose a new few-shot temporal action localization method by Chain-of-Thought textual reasoning to improve localization performance. Specifically, we design a novel few-shot learning framework that leverages textual semantic information to enhance the model's ability to capture action commonalities and variations, which includes a semantic-aware text-visual alignment module designed to align the query and support videos at different levels. Meanwhile, to better express the temporal dependencies and causal relationships between actions at the textual level to assist action localization, we design a Chain of Thought (CoT)-like reasoning method that progressively guides the Vision Language Model (VLM) and Large Language Model (LLM) to generate CoT-like text descriptions for videos. The generated texts can capture more variance of action than visual features. We conduct extensive experiments on the publicly available ActivityNet1.3 and THUMOS14 datasets. We introduce the first dataset named Human-related Anomaly Localization and explore the application of the TAL task in human anomaly detection. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms existing methods in single-instance and multi-instance scenarios. We will release our code, data and benchmark.</p></details> |  |

To mitigate the significant manual effort and expertise required to define LTL-encoded tasks, several methods have been proposed for translating Natural Language (NL) instructions into LTL formulas, which, however, lack correctness guarantees. To address this, we introduce a new NL-to-LTL translation method, called ConformalNL2LTL, that can achieve user-defined translation success rates over unseen NL commands. Our method constructs LTL formulas iteratively by addressing a sequence of open-vocabulary Question-Answering (QA) problems with LLMs. To enable uncertainty-aware translation, we leverage conformal prediction (CP), a distribution-free uncertainty quantification tool for black-box models. CP enables our method to assess the uncertainty in LLM-generated answers, allowing it to proceed with translation when sufficiently confident and request help otherwise. We provide both theoretical and empirical results demonstrating that ConformalNL2LTL achieves user-specified translation accuracy while minimizing help rates.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Low-Cost Video Editing with Lightweight Adaptors and Temporal-Aware Inversion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04606v3)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) generation using diffusion models have enabled cost-effective video-editing applications by leveraging pre-trained models, eliminating the need for resource-intensive training. However, the frame-independence of T2I generation often results in poor temporal consistency. Existing methods address this issue through temporal layer fine-tuning or inference-based temporal propagation, but these approaches suffer from high training costs or limited temporal coherence. To address these challenges, we propose a General and Efficient Adapter (GE-Adapter) that integrates temporal-spatial and semantic consistency with Baliteral DDIM inversion. This framework introduces three key components: (1) Frame-based Temporal Consistency Blocks (FTC Blocks) to capture frame-specific features and enforce smooth inter-frame transitions via temporally-aware loss functions; (2) Channel-dependent Spatial Consistency Blocks (SCD Blocks) employing bilateral filters to enhance spatial coherence by reducing noise and artifacts; and (3) Token-based Semantic Consistency Module (TSC Module) to maintain semantic alignment using shared prompt tokens and frame-specific tokens. Our method significantly improves perceptual quality, text-image alignment, and temporal coherence, as demonstrated on the MSR-VTT dataset. Additionally, it achieves enhanced fidelity and frame-to-frame coherence, offering a practical solution for T2V editing.</p></details> |  |
| **[LASER: A Neuro-Symbolic Framework for Learning Spatial-Temporal Scene Graphs with Weak Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07647v5)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Supervised approaches for learning spatio-temporal scene graphs (STSG) from video are greatly hindered due to their reliance on STSG-annotated videos, which are labor-intensive to construct at scale. Is it feasible to instead use readily available video captions as weak supervision? To address this question, we propose LASER, a neuro-symbolic framework to enable training STSG generators using only video captions. LASER employs large language models to first extract logical specifications with rich spatio-temporal semantic information from video captions. LASER then trains the underlying STSG generator to align the predicted STSG with the specification. The alignment algorithm overcomes the challenges of weak supervision by leveraging a differentiable symbolic reasoner and using a combination of contrastive, temporal, and semantics losses. The overall approach efficiently trains low-level perception models to extract a fine-grained STSG that conforms to the video caption. In doing so, it enables a novel methodology for learning STSGs without tedious annotations. We evaluate our method on three video datasets: OpenPVSG, 20BN, and MUGEN. Our approach demonstrates substantial improvements over fully-supervised baselines, achieving a unary predicate prediction accuracy of 27.78% (+12.65%) and a binary recall@5 of 0.42 (+0.22) on OpenPVSG. Additionally, LASER exceeds baselines by 7% on 20BN and 5.2% on MUGEN in terms of overall predicate prediction accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Temporal Consistency in Diffusion-Based Video Editing with Adaptor Modules: A Theoretical Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16016v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adapter-based methods are commonly used to enhance model performance with minimal additional complexity, especially in video editing tasks that require frame-to-frame consistency. By inserting small, learnable modules into pretrained diffusion models, these adapters can maintain temporal coherence without extensive retraining. Approaches that incorporate prompt learning with both shared and frame-specific tokens are particularly effective in preserving continuity across frames at low training cost. In this work, we want to provide a general theoretical framework for adapters that maintain frame consistency in DDIM-based models under a temporal consistency loss. First, we prove that the temporal consistency objective is differentiable under bounded feature norms, and we establish a Lipschitz bound on its gradient. Second, we show that gradient descent on this objective decreases the loss monotonically and converges to a local minimum if the learning rate is within an appropriate range. Finally, we analyze the stability of modules in the DDIM inversion procedure, showing that the associated error remains controlled. These theoretical findings will reinforce the reliability of diffusion-based video editing methods that rely on adapter strategies and provide theoretical insights in video generation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2501.04606</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Discovery of Motif Transition Process for Large-Scale Temporal Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15979v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the dynamic transition of motifs in temporal graphs is essential for revealing how graph structures evolve over time, identifying critical patterns, and predicting future behaviors, yet existing methods often focus on predefined motifs, limiting their ability to comprehensively capture transitions and interrelationships. We propose a parallel motif transition process discovery algorithm, PTMT, a novel parallel method for discovering motif transition processes in large-scale temporal graphs. PTMT integrates a tree-based framework with the temporal zone partitioning (TZP) strategy, which partitions temporal graphs by time and structure while preserving lossless motif transitions and enabling massive parallelism. PTMT comprises three phases: growth zone parallel expansion, overlap-aware result aggregation, and deterministic encoding of motif transitions, ensuring accurate tracking of dynamic transitions and interactions. Results on 10 real-world datasets demonstrate that PTMT achieves speedups ranging from 12.0$\times$ to 50.3$\times$ compared to the SOTA method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Convergent NMPC-based Reinforcement Learning Using Deep Expected Sarsa and Nonlinear Temporal Difference Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04925v2)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present a learning-based nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC) using an original reinforcement learning (RL) method to learn the optimal weights of the NMPC scheme, for which two methods are proposed. Firstly, the controller is used as the current action-value function of a deep Expected Sarsa where the subsequent action-value function, usually obtained with a secondary NMPC, is approximated with a neural network (NN). With respect to existing methods, we add to the NN's input the current value of the NMPC's learned parameters so that the network is able to approximate the action-value function and stabilize the learning performance. Additionally, with the use of the NN, the real-time computational burden is approximately halved without affecting the closed-loop performance. Secondly, we combine gradient temporal difference methods with a parametrized NMPC as a function approximator of the Expected Sarsa RL method to overcome the potential parameters' divergence and instability issues when nonlinearities are present in the function approximation. The simulation results show that the proposed approach converges to a locally optimal solution without instability problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mission-driven Exploration for Accelerated Deep Reinforcement Learning with Temporal Logic Task Specifications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17059v2)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the problem of designing control policies for agents with unknown stochastic dynamics and control objectives specified using Linear Temporal Logic (LTL). Recent Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms have aimed to compute policies that maximize the satisfaction probability of LTL formulas, but they often suffer from slow learning performance. To address this, we introduce a novel Deep Q-learning algorithm that significantly improves learning speed. The enhanced sample efficiency stems from a mission-driven exploration strategy that prioritizes exploration towards directions likely to contribute to mission success. Identifying these directions relies on an automaton representation of the LTL task as well as a learned neural network that partially models the agent-environment interaction. We provide comparative experiments demonstrating the efficiency of our algorithm on robot navigation tasks in unseen environments.</p></details> |  |

While MLLMs have been extensively studied for visual semantic understanding tasks, their ability to perform precise and quantitative spatial-temporal understanding in real-world applications remains largely unexamined, leading to uncertain prospects. To evaluate models' Spatial-Temporal Intelligence, we introduce STI-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' spatial-temporal understanding through challenging tasks such as estimating and predicting the appearance, pose, displacement, and motion of objects. Our benchmark encompasses a wide range of robot and vehicle operations across desktop, indoor, and outdoor scenarios. The extensive experiments reveals that the state-of-the-art MLLMs still struggle in real-world spatial-temporal understanding, especially in tasks requiring precise distance estimation and motion analysis.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional methods struggle with challenges such as data imbalance and feature redundancy in ship motion data, limiting their effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose the Temporal-Graph Contrastive Clustering Sea State Estimator (TGC-SSE), a novel deep learning model that combines three key components: a time dimension factorization module to reduce data redundancy, a dynamic graph-like learning module to capture complex variable interactions, and a contrastive clustering loss function to effectively manage class imbalance. Our experiments demonstrate that TGC-SSE significantly outperforms existing methods across 14 public datasets, achieving the highest accuracy in 9 datasets, with a 20.79% improvement over EDI. Furthermore, in the field of sea state estimation, TGC-SSE surpasses five benchmark methods and seven deep learning models. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each module, demonstrating their respective roles in enhancing overall model performance. Overall, TGC-SSE not only improves the accuracy of sea state estimation but also exhibits strong generalization capabilities, providing reliable support for autonomous vessel operations.</p></details> | 13 pages,15 figures |

While recent approaches employ pseudo labels for training, three key challenges: generating high-quality pseudo labels, making full use of different priors, and optimizing training methods with noisy labels remain unresolved. Due to these perspectives, we propose PseudoFormer, a novel two-branch framework that bridges the gap between weakly and fully-supervised Temporal Action Localization (TAL). We first introduce RickerFusion, which maps all predicted action proposals to a global shared space to generate pseudo labels with better quality. Subsequently, we leverage both snippet-level and proposal-level labels with different priors from the weak branch to train the regression-based model in the full branch. Finally, the uncertainty mask and iterative refinement mechanism are applied for training with noisy pseudo labels. PseudoFormer achieves state-of-the-art WTAL results on the two commonly used benchmarks, THUMOS14 and ActivityNet1.3. Besides, extensive ablation studies demonstrate the contribution of each component of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025: IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</p></details> |

Recently, the evolving dynamics of knowledge have attracted a growing interest in Temporal Knowledge Graph Question Answering (TKGQA), an emerging task to answer temporal questions. However, this field grapples with ambiguities in defining temporal questions and lacks a systematic categorization of existing methods for TKGQA. In response, this paper provides a thorough survey from two perspectives: the taxonomy of temporal questions and the methodological categorization for TKGQA. Specifically, we first establish a detailed taxonomy of temporal questions engaged in prior studies. Subsequently, we provide a comprehensive review of TKGQA techniques of two categories: semantic parsing-based and TKG embedding-based. Building on this review, the paper outlines potential research directions aimed at advancing the field of TKGQA. This work aims to serve as a comprehensive reference for TKGQA and to stimulate further research.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures.

While significant advances have been made in plant phenotyping technologies, comprehensive temporal analysis of root development remains challenging, with most existing solutions providing either limited throughput or restricted structural analysis capabilities. Here, we present ChronoRoot 2.0, an integrated open-source platform that combines affordable hardware with advanced artificial intelligence to enable sophisticated temporal plant phenotyping. The system introduces several major advances, offering an integral perspective of seedling development: (i) simultaneous multi-organ tracking of six distinct plant structures, (ii) quality control through real-time validation, (iii) comprehensive architectural measurements including novel gravitropic response parameters, and (iv) dual specialized user interfaces for both architectural analysis and high-throughput screening. We demonstrate the system's capabilities through three use cases for Arabidopsis thaliana: characterization of circadian growth patterns under different light conditions, detailed analysis of gravitropic responses in transgenic plants, and high-throughput screening of etiolation responses across multiple genotypes. ChronoRoot 2.0 maintains its predecessor's advantages of low cost and modularity while significantly expanding its capabilities, making sophisticated temporal phenotyping more accessible to the broader plant science community. The system's open-source nature, combined with extensive documentation and containerized deployment options, ensures reproducibility and enables community-driven development of new analytical capabilities.</p></details> |  |

We present the first comprehensive study investigating these models' temporal plasticity - their ability to progressively enhance performance through continual learning while maintaining existing capabilities. Through experiments on real-world datasets exhibiting distribution shifts, we evaluate both conventional deep learning models and foundation models using a novel continual learning framework. Our findings reveal that while traditional models struggle with performance deterioration during incremental fine-tuning, foundation models like Time-MoE and Chronos demonstrate sustained improvement in predictive accuracy. This suggests that optimizing foundation model fine-tuning strategies may be more valuable than developing domain-specific small models. Our research introduces new evaluation methodologies and insights for developing foundation time series models with robust continuous learning capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IJCNN 2025</p></details> |

| **[Exploring Temporally-Aware Features for Point Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12218v2)** | 2025-04-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Point tracking in videos is a fundamental task with applications in robotics, video editing, and more. While many vision tasks benefit from pre-trained feature backbones to improve generalizability, point tracking has primarily relied on simpler backbones trained from scratch on synthetic data, which may limit robustness in real-world scenarios. Additionally, point tracking requires temporal awareness to ensure coherence across frames, but using temporally-aware features is still underexplored. Most current methods often employ a two-stage process: an initial coarse prediction followed by a refinement stage to inject temporal information and correct errors from the coarse stage. These approach, however, is computationally expensive and potentially redundant if the feature backbone itself captures sufficient temporal information. In this work, we introduce Chrono, a feature backbone specifically designed for point tracking with built-in temporal awareness. Leveraging pre-trained representations from self-supervised learner DINOv2 and enhanced with a temporal adapter, Chrono effectively captures long-term temporal context, enabling precise prediction even without the refinement stage. Experimental results demonstrate that Chrono achieves state-of-the-art performance in a refiner-free setting on the TAP-Vid-DAVIS and TAP-Vid-Kinetics datasets, among common feature backbones used in point tracking as well as DINOv2, with exceptional efficiency.

However, the low resolution of TIR images, along with tracking interference, significantly limits the perfor-mance of TIR trackers. To address these challenges, we introduce STARS, a novel sparse learning-based CF tracker that incorporates spatio-temporal regulari-zation and super-resolution reconstruction. First, we apply adaptive sparse filter-ing and temporal domain filtering to extract key features of the target while reduc-ing interference from background clutter and noise. Next, we introduce an edge-preserving sparse regularization method to stabilize target features and prevent excessive blurring. This regularization integrates multiple terms and employs the alternating direction method of multipliers to optimize the solution. Finally, we propose a gradient-enhanced super-resolution method to extract fine-grained TIR target features and improve the resolution of TIR images, addressing performance degradation in tracking caused by low-resolution sequences. To the best of our knowledge, STARS is the first to integrate super-resolution methods within a sparse learning-based CF framework. Extensive experiments on the LSOTB-TIR, PTB-TIR, VOT-TIR2015, and VOT-TIR2017 benchmarks demonstrate that STARS outperforms state-of-the-art trackers in terms of robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Realizing temporal transportation trees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18513v3)** | 2025-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we study the complexity of the periodic temporal graph realization problem with respect to upper bounds on the fastest path durations among its vertices. This constraint with respect to upper bounds appears naturally in transportation network design applications where, for example, a road network is given, and the goal is to appropriately schedule periodic travel routes, while not exceeding some desired upper bounds on the travel times. In our work, we focus only on underlying tree topologies, which are fundamental in many transportation network applications. As it turns out, the periodic upper-bounded temporal tree realization problem (TTR) has a very different computational complexity behavior than both (i) the classic graph realization problem with respect to shortest path distances in static graphs and (ii) the periodic temporal graph realization problem with exact given fastest travel times (which was recently introduced). First, we prove that, surprisingly, TTR is NP-hard, even for a constant period $\Delta$ and when the input tree $G$ satisfies at least one of the following conditions: (a) $G$ is a star, or (b) $G$ has constant maximum degree. Second, we prove that TTR is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) with respect to the number of leaves in the input tree $G$, via a novel combination of techniques for totally unimodular matrices and mixed integer linear programming.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interpretable Hybrid-Rule Temporal Point Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11344v2)** | 2025-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal Point Processes (TPPs) are widely used for modeling event sequences in various medical domains, such as disease onset prediction, progression analysis, and clinical decision support. Although TPPs effectively capture temporal dynamics, their lack of interpretability remains a critical challenge. Recent advancements have introduced interpretable TPPs. However, these methods fail to incorporate numerical features, thereby limiting their ability to generate precise predictions. To address this issue, we propose Hybrid-Rule Temporal Point Processes (HRTPP), a novel framework that integrates temporal logic rules with numerical features, improving both interpretability and predictive accuracy in event modeling. HRTPP comprises three key components: basic intensity for intrinsic event likelihood, rule-based intensity for structured temporal dependencies, and numerical feature intensity for dynamic probability modulation. To effectively discover valid rules, we introduce a two-phase rule mining strategy with Bayesian optimization. To evaluate our method, we establish a multi-criteria assessment framework, incorporating rule validity, model fitting, and temporal predictive accuracy. Experimental results on real-world medical datasets demonstrate that HRTPP outperforms state-of-the-art interpretable TPPs in terms of predictive performance and clinical interpretability. In case studies, the rules extracted by HRTPP explain the disease progression, offering valuable contributions to medical diagnosis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Graph Realization With Bounded Stretch](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14258v1)** | 2025-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A periodic temporal graph, in its simplest form, is a graph in which every edge appears exactly once in the first $\Delta$ time steps, and then it reappears recurrently every $\Delta$ time steps, where $\Delta$ is a given period length. This model offers a natural abstraction of transportation networks where each transportation link connects two destinations periodically. From a network design perspective, a crucial task is to assign the time-labels on the edges in a way that optimizes some criterion. In this paper we introduce a very natural optimality criterion that captures how the temporal distances of all vertex pairs are `stretched', compared to their physical distances, i.e. their distances in the underlying static (non-temporal) graph. Given a static graph $G$, the task is to assign to each edge one time-label between 1 and $\Delta$ such that, in the resulting periodic temporal graph with period~$\Delta$, the duration of the fastest temporal path from any vertex $u$ to any other vertex $v$ is at most $\alpha$ times the distance between $u$ and $v$ in $G$. Here, the value of $\alpha$ measures how much the shortest paths are allowed to be \emph{stretched} once we assign the periodic time-labels. Our results span three different directions: First, we provide a series of approximation and NP-hardness results. Second, we provide approximation and fixed-parameter algorithms. Among them, we provide a simple polynomial-time algorithm (the \textit{radius-algorithm}) which always guarantees an approximation strictly smaller than $\Delta$, and which also computes the optimum stretch in some cases. Third, we consider a parameterized local search extension of the problem where we are given the temporal labeling of the graph, but we are allowed to change the time-labels of at most $k$ edges; for this problem we prove that it is W[2]-hard but admits an XP algorithm with respect to $k$.</p></details> |  |

GDFusion opens up the underexplored aspects of temporal fusion within the VisionOcc framework, focusing on both temporal cues and fusion strategies. It systematically examines the entire VisionOcc pipeline, identifying three fundamental yet previously overlooked temporal cues: scene-level consistency, motion calibration, and geometric complementation. These cues capture diverse facets of temporal evolution and make distinct contributions across various modules in the VisionOcc framework. To effectively fuse temporal signals across heterogeneous representations, we propose a novel fusion strategy by reinterpreting the formulation of vanilla RNNs. This reinterpretation leverages gradient descent on features to unify the integration of diverse temporal information, seamlessly embedding the proposed temporal cues into the network. Extensive experiments on nuScenes demonstrate that GDFusion significantly outperforms established baselines. Notably, on Occ3D benchmark, it achieves 1.4\%-4.8\% mIoU improvements and reduces memory consumption by 27\%-72\%.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |
| **[Can Local Representation Alignment RNNs Solve Temporal Tasks?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13531v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are commonly used for real-time processing, streaming data, and cases where the amount of training samples is limited. Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) is the predominant algorithm for training RNNs; however, it is frequently criticized for being prone to exploding and vanishing gradients and being biologically implausible. In this paper, we present and evaluate a target propagation-based method for RNNs, which uses local updates and seeks to reduce the said instabilities. Having stable RNN models increases their practical use in a wide range of fields such as natural language processing, time-series forecasting, anomaly detection, control systems, and robotics. The proposed solution uses local representation alignment (LRA). We thoroughly analyze the performance of this method, experiment with normalization and different local error functions, and invalidate certain assumptions about the behavior of this type of learning. Namely, we demonstrate that despite the decomposition of the network into sub-graphs, the model still suffers from vanishing gradients. We also show that gradient clipping as proposed in LRA has little to no effect on network performance. This results in an LRA RNN model that is very difficult to train due to vanishing gradients. We address this by introducing gradient regularization in the direction of the update and demonstrate that this modification promotes gradient flow and meaningfully impacts convergence. We compare and discuss the performance of the algorithm, and we show that the regularized LRA RNN considerably outperforms the unregularized version on three landmark tasks: temporal order, 3-bit temporal order, and random permutation.</p></details> |  |

Our approach employs attention mechanisms to dynamically weight the contribution of different modalities, along with a specialized tensor interpretation module for feature extraction. To facilitate rapid model iteration in industry applications, we incorporate a mature auto-training scheme that streamlines optimization. When applied to real-world financial datasets, CMTF demonstrates improvements over baseline models in forecasting stock price movements and provides a scalable and effective solution for cross-modal integration in financial market prediction.</p></details> | 10 pages, 2 figures |

In particular, reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in the synthesis of controllers for systems with complex dynamics and modest online compute budgets. However, the poor sample efficiency of RL and the challenges of reward design make training slow and sometimes unstable, especially for high-dimensional systems. In this work, we leverage the inherent Lie group symmetries of robotic systems with a floating base to mitigate these challenges when learning tracking controllers. We model a general tracking problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) that captures the evolution of both the physical and reference states. Next, we prove that symmetry in the underlying dynamics and running costs leads to an MDP homomorphism, a mapping that allows a policy trained on a lower-dimensional "quotient" MDP to be lifted to an optimal tracking controller for the original system. We compare this symmetry-informed approach to an unstructured baseline, using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to learn tracking controllers for three systems: the Particle (a forced point mass), the Astrobee (a fullyactuated space robot), and the Quadrotor (an underactuated system). Results show that a symmetry-aware approach both accelerates training and reduces tracking error at convergence.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first three authors contributed equally to this work.

The challenge is to compute near-optimal sensor placements for detecting targets whose trajectories follow a log-Gaussian Cox line process. We explore sensor deployment in a transformed space, where linear target trajectories are represented as points. While this space simplifies handling the line process, the spatial functions representing sensor performance (i.e. probability of detection) become less intuitive. To illustrate our approach, we focus on positioning sensors of the barrier coverage system on the seafloor to detect passing ships. Through numerical experiments using historical ship data, we compute sensor locations that maximize the probability all ship passing over the barrier coverage system are detected.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work is published in IEEE SysCon 2025</p></details> |
| **[Visual Trajectory Prediction of Vessels for Inland Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00599v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The future of inland navigation increasingly relies on autonomous systems and remote operations, emphasizing the need for accurate vessel trajectory prediction. This study addresses the challenges of video-based vessel tracking and prediction by integrating advanced object detection methods, Kalman filters, and spline-based interpolation. However, existing detection systems often misclassify objects in inland waterways due to complex surroundings. A comparative evaluation of tracking algorithms, including BoT-SORT, Deep OC-SORT, and ByeTrack, highlights the robustness of the Kalman filter in providing smoothed trajectories. Experimental results from diverse scenarios demonstrate improved accuracy in predicting vessel movements, which is essential for collision avoidance and situational awareness. The findings underline the necessity of customized datasets and models for inland navigation. Future work will expand the datasets and incorporate vessel classification to refine predictions, supporting both autonomous systems and human operators in complex environments.</p></details> |  |

Despite its significance, research in this domain remains relatively limited, with most existing studies concentrating on single-modal trajectory prediction of vehicles. In this work, we propose ParkDiffusion, a novel approach that predicts the trajectories of both vehicles and pedestrians in automated parking scenarios. ParkDiffusion employs diffusion models to capture the inherent uncertainty and multi-modality of future trajectories, incorporating several key innovations. First, we propose a dual map encoder that processes soft semantic cues and hard geometric constraints using a two-step cross-attention mechanism. Second, we introduce an adaptive agent type embedding module, which dynamically conditions the prediction process on the distinct characteristics of vehicles and pedestrians. Third, to ensure kinematic feasibility, our model outputs control signals that are subsequently used within a kinematic framework to generate physically feasible trajectories. We evaluate ParkDiffusion on the Dragon Lake Parking (DLP) dataset and the Intersections Drone (inD) dataset. Our work establishes a new baseline for heterogeneous trajectory prediction in parking scenarios, outperforming existing methods by a considerable margin.</p></details> |  |

State-of-the-art motion forecasting models rely on large curated datasets with manually annotated or heavily post-processed trajectories. However, building these datasets is costly, generally manual, hard to scale, and lacks reproducibility. They also introduce domain gaps that limit generalization across environments. We introduce PPT (Pretraining with Pseudo-labeled Trajectories), a simple and scalable alternative that uses unprocessed and diverse trajectories automatically generated from off-the-shelf 3D detectors and tracking. Unlike traditional pipelines aiming for clean, single-label annotations, PPT embraces noise and diversity as useful signals for learning robust representations. With optional finetuning on a small amount of labeled data, models pretrained with PPT achieve strong performance across standard benchmarks particularly in low-data regimes, and in cross-domain, end-to-end and multi-class settings. PPT is easy to implement and improves generalization in motion forecasting. Code and data will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 9 figures, updated results</p></details> |
| **[Stable Trajectory Clustering: An Efficient Split and Merge Algorithm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21808v1)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clustering algorithms group data points by characteristics to identify patterns. Over the past two decades, researchers have extended these methods to analyze trajectories of humans, animals, and vehicles, studying their behavior and movement across applications. This paper presents whole-trajectory clustering and sub-trajectory clustering algorithms based on DBSCAN line segment clustering, which encompasses two key events: split and merge of line segments. The events are employed by object movement history and the average Euclidean distance between line segments. In this framework, whole-trajectory clustering considers entire entities' trajectories, whereas sub-trajectory clustering employs a sliding window model to identify similar sub-trajectories. Many existing trajectory clustering algorithms respond to temporary anomalies in data by splitting trajectories, which often obscures otherwise consistent clustering patterns and leads to less reliable insights. We introduce the stable trajectory clustering algorithm, which leverages the mean absolute deviation concept to demonstrate that selective omission of transient deviations not only preserves the integrity of clusters but also improves their stability and interpretability. We run all proposed algorithms on real trajectory datasets to illustrate their effectiveness and sensitivity to parameter variations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Iterative Trajectory Exploration for Multimodal Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21561v1)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal agents, which integrate a controller (e.g., a large language model) with external tools, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in tackling complex tasks. However, existing agents need to collect a large number of expert data for fine-tuning to adapt to new environments. In this paper, we propose an online self-exploration method for multimodal agents, namely SPORT, via step-wise preference optimization to refine the trajectories of agents, which automatically generates tasks and learns from solving the generated tasks, without any expert annotation. SPORT operates through four iterative components: task synthesis, step sampling, step verification, and preference tuning. First, we synthesize multi-modal tasks using language models. Then, we introduce a novel search scheme, where step sampling and step verification are executed alternately to solve each generated task. We employ a verifier to provide AI feedback to construct step-wise preference data. The data is subsequently used to update the controller's policy through preference tuning, producing a SPORT Agent. By interacting with real environments, the SPORT Agent evolves into a more refined and capable system. Evaluation in the GTA and GAIA benchmarks show that the SPORT Agent achieves 6.41\% and 3.64\% improvements, underscoring the generalization and effectiveness introduced by our method.

Despite their utility in advancing digital automation, a critical bottleneck persists: collecting high-quality trajectory data for training. Common practices for collecting such data rely on human supervision or synthetic data generation through executing pre-defined tasks, which are either resource-intensive or unable to guarantee data quality. Moreover, these methods suffer from limited data diversity and significant gaps between synthetic data and real-world environments. To address these challenges, we propose OS-Genesis, a novel GUI data synthesis pipeline that reverses the conventional trajectory collection process. Instead of relying on pre-defined tasks, OS-Genesis enables agents first to perceive environments and perform step-wise interactions, then retrospectively derive high-quality tasks to enable trajectory-level exploration. A trajectory reward model is then employed to ensure the quality of the generated trajectories. We demonstrate that training GUI agents with OS-Genesis significantly improves their performance on highly challenging online benchmarks. In-depth analysis further validates OS-Genesis's efficiency and its superior data quality and diversity compared to existing synthesis methods. Our codes, data, and checkpoints are available at https://qiushisun.github.io/OS-Genesis-Home/.</p></details> | Work in progress |

In this setup, measurement (output) uncertainties are state-dependent and set-valued. Enveloping ellipsoids are employed to characterize state-dependent uncertainties with unknown distributions. The concept of regularity for set-valued output maps is then introduced, facilitating the formulation of the estimation-aware trajectory generation problem. Specifically, it is demonstrated that for output-regular maps, one can utilize a set-valued observability measure that is concave with respect to the finite horizon state trajectories. By maximizing this measure, estimation-aware trajectories can then be synthesized for a broad class of systems. Trajectory planning routines are also examined in this work, by which the observability measure is optimized for systems with locally linearized dynamics. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, representative examples in the context of trajectory planning with vision-based estimation are presented. Moreover, the paper presents estimation-aware planning for an uncooperative Target-Rendezvous problem, where an Ego-satellite employs an onboard machine learning (ML)-based estimation module to realize the rendezvous trajectory.</p></details> | 40 pages, 9 figures |

However, maintaining tracking continuity and consistency remains a significant challenge. Traditional detection-assignment tracking methods struggle with false positives, false negatives, and frequent identity switches, leading to degraded counting accuracy and making in-depth analysis impossible. This paper introduces a point-oriented online tracking algorithm that improves trajectory continuity and counting reliability in drone-based crowd monitoring. Our method builds on the Simple Online and Real-time Tracking (SORT) framework, replacing the original bounding-box assignment with a point-distance metric. The algorithm is enhanced with three cost-effective techniques: camera motion compensation, altitude-aware assignment, and classification-based trajectory validation. Further, Deep Discriminative Correlation Filters (DDCF) that re-use spatial feature maps from localisation algorithms for increased computational efficiency through neural network resource sharing are integrated to refine object tracking by reducing noise and handling missed detections. The proposed method is evaluated on the DroneCrowd and newly shared UP-COUNT-TRACK datasets, demonstrating substantial improvements in tracking metrics, reducing counting errors to 23% and 15%, respectively. The results also indicate a significant reduction of identity switches while maintaining high tracking accuracy, outperforming baseline online trackers and even an offline greedy optimisation method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint submitted to the Expert Systems with Applications journal</p></details> |
| **[Kinodynamic Trajectory Following with STELA: Simultaneous Trajectory Estimation & Local Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20009v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State estimation and control are often addressed separately, leading to unsafe execution due to sensing noise, execution errors, and discrepancies between the planning model and reality. Simultaneous control and trajectory estimation using probabilistic graphical models has been proposed as a unified solution to these challenges. Previous work, however, relies heavily on appropriate Gaussian priors and is limited to holonomic robots with linear time-varying models. The current research extends graphical optimization methods to vehicles with arbitrary dynamical models via Simultaneous Trajectory Estimation and Local Adaptation (STELA). The overall approach initializes feasible trajectories using a kinodynamic, sampling-based motion planner. Then, it simultaneously: (i) estimates the past trajectory based on noisy observations, and (ii) adapts the controls to be executed to minimize deviations from the planned, feasible trajectory, while avoiding collisions. The proposed factor graph representation of trajectories in STELA can be applied for any dynamical system given access to first or second-order state update equations, and introduces the duration of execution between two states in the trajectory discretization as an optimization variable. These features provide both generalization and flexibility in trajectory following. In addition to targeting computational efficiency, the proposed strategy performs incremental updates of the factor graph using the iSAM algorithm and introduces a time-window mechanism. This mechanism allows the factor graph to be dynamically updated to operate over a limited history and forward horizon of the planned trajectory. This enables online updates of controls at a minimum of 10Hz. Experiments demonstrate that STELA achieves at least comparable performance to previous frameworks on idealized vehicles with linear dynamics.[...]</p></details> | [Accepted] RSS 2025 |

While, the spin is not directly observable in standard broadcasting videos, we show that it can be inferred from the ball's trajectory in the video. We present a novel method to infer the initial spin and 3D trajectory from the corresponding 2D trajectory in a video. Without ground truth labels for broadcast videos, we train a neural network solely on synthetic data. Due to the choice of our input data representation, physically correct synthetic training data, and using targeted augmentations, the network naturally generalizes to real data. Notably, these simple techniques are sufficient to achieve generalization. No real data at all is required for training. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to present a method for spin and trajectory prediction in simple monocular broadcast videos, achieving an accuracy of 92.0% in spin classification and a 2D reprojection error of 0.19% of the image diagonal.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in 2025 IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (CVPRW)</p></details> |

However, existing methods face robotic hardware dependency and control frequency mismatches between teleoperation devices and robotic platforms. Our approach automatically extracts kinematic parameters from unified robot description format (URDF) files, and enables pluggable deployment across diverse robots through uniform interfaces. The proposed interpolation algorithm bridges the frequency gap between low-rate human inputs and high-frequency robotic control commands through online continuous trajectory generation, \n{while requiring no access to the closed, bottom-level control loop}. To enhance trajectory smoothness, we introduce a minimum-stretch spline that optimizes the motion quality. The system further provides precision and rapid modes to accommodate different task requirements. Experiments across various robotic platforms including dual-arm ones demonstrate generality and smooth operation performance of our methods.

Existing deep generative models learn from real trajectories to generate synthetic ones. Despite the progress, most of them suffer from training stability issues and scale poorly with increasing data size. More importantly, they often lack control mechanisms to guide the generated trajectories under constraints such as enforcing specific visits. To address these limitations, we formally define the controlled trajectory generation problem for effectively handling multiple spatiotemporal constraints. We introduce Geo-Llama, a novel LLM finetuning framework that can enforce multiple explicit visit constraints while maintaining contextual coherence of the generated trajectories. In this approach, pre-trained LLMs are fine-tuned on trajectory data with a visit-wise permutation strategy where each visit corresponds to a specific time and location. This strategy enables the model to capture spatiotemporal patterns regardless of visit orders while maintaining flexible and in-context constraint integration through prompts during generation. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets validate the effectiveness of Geo-Llama, demonstrating its versatility and robustness in handling a broad range of constraints to generate more realistic trajectories compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |

Traditional modular methods suffer from error propagation, while existing end-to-end models typically employ static one-shot inference paradigms that inadequately capture the dynamic changes of the environment. ARTEMIS takes a different method by generating trajectory waypoints sequentially, preserves critical temporal dependencies while dynamically routing scene-specific queries to specialized expert networks. It effectively relieves trajectory quality degradation issues encountered when guidance information is ambiguous, and overcomes the inherent representational limitations of singular network architectures when processing diverse driving scenarios. Additionally, we use a lightweight batch reallocation strategy that significantly improves the training speed of the Mixture-of-Experts model. Through experiments on the NAVSIM dataset, ARTEMIS exhibits superior competitive performance, achieving 87.0 PDMS and 83.1 EPDMS with ResNet-34 backbone, demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on multiple metrics.</p></details> |  |

To tackle this, an end-to-end foot trajectory and force optimization framework (FTFOF) is proposed, which optimizes foot adhesion and detachment forces through trajectory adjustments. This framework accepts general foot trajectory constraints and user-defined parameters as input, ultimately producing an optimal single foot trajectory. It integrates three-segment $C^2$ continuous Bezier curves, tailored to various foot structures, enabling the generation of effective climbing trajectories. A dilate-based GRU predictive model establishes the relationship between foot trajectories and the corresponding foot forces. Multi-objective optimization algorithms, combined with a redundancy hierarchical strategy, identify the most suitable foot trajectory for specific tasks, thereby ensuring optimal performance across detachment force, adhesion force and vibration amplitude. Experimental validation on the quadruped climbing robot MST-M3F showed that, compared to commonly used trajectories in existing legged climbing robots, the proposed framework achieved reductions in maximum detachment force by 28 \%, vibration amplitude by 82 \%, which ensures the stable climbing of dry adhesion legged climbing robots.</p></details> |  |

The proposed method utilizes Model Predictive Control (MPC) with a focus on handling the uncertainties associated with the movement prediction of dynamic obstacles. Unlike existing Nav2 trajectory planners which primarily deal with static obstacles or react to the current position of dynamic obstacles, this planner predicts future obstacle positions using a stochastic Vector Auto-Regressive Model (VAR). The obstacles' future positions are represented by probability distributions, and collision avoidance is achieved through constraints based on the Mahalanobis distance, ensuring the robot avoids regions where obstacles are likely to be. This approach considers the robot's kinodynamic constraints, enabling it to track a reference path while adapting to real-time changes in the environment. The paper details the implementation, including obstacle prediction, tracking, and the construction of feasible sets for MPC. Simulation results in a Gazebo environment demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in scenarios where robots must navigate around each other, showing improved collision avoidance capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted to IFAC for publication under a Creative Commons Licence CC-BY-NC-ND</p></details> |

Therefore, fin-driven autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) can achieve high maneuverability with a smaller number of actuators, but their control is challenging. This study proposes an analytic control allocation method for underactuated Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs). By integrating an adaptive hybrid feedback controller, we enable an AUV with 4 actuators to move in 6 degrees of freedom (DOF) in simulation and up to 5-DOF in real-world experiments. The proposed method outperformed state-of-the-art control allocation techniques in 6-DOF trajectory tracking simulations, exhibiting centimeter-scale accuracy and higher energy and computational efficiency. Real-world pool experiments confirmed the method's robustness and efficacy in tracking complex 3D trajectories, with significant computational efficiency gains 0.007 (ms) vs. 22.28 (ms).

These seek to answer a fundamental question: What can we learn from time series measurements of a complex dynamical system? For small systems interacting with external environments, the effective dynamics are inherently stochastic, making it crucial to properly manage noise in data. Here, we explore this for systems obeying Langevin dynamics and, using currents, we construct a learning framework for stochastic modeling. Currents have recently gained increased attention for their role in bounding entropy production (EP) from thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs). We introduce a fundamental relationship between the cumulant currents there and standard machine-learning loss functions. Using this, we derive loss functions for several key thermodynamic functions directly from the system dynamics without the (common) intermediate step of deriving a TUR. These loss functions reproduce results derived both from TURs and other methods. More significantly, they open a path to discover new loss functions for previously inaccessible quantities. Notably, this includes access to per-trajectory entropy production, even if the observed system is driven far from its steady-state. We also consider higher order estimation. Our method is straightforward and unifies dynamic inference with recent approaches to entropy production estimation. Taken altogether, this reveals a deep connection between diffusion models in machine learning and entropy production estimation in stochastic thermodynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 appendices (10 pages), 4 figures; https://csc.ucdavis.edu/~cmg/compmech/pubs/currents.htm</p></details> |
| **[DDAT: Diffusion Policies Enforcing Dynamically Admissible Robot Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15043v2)** | 2025-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models excel at creating images and videos thanks to their multimodal generative capabilities. These same capabilities have made diffusion models increasingly popular in robotics research, where they are used for generating robot motion. However, the stochastic nature of diffusion models is fundamentally at odds with the precise dynamical equations describing the feasible motion of robots. Hence, generating dynamically admissible robot trajectories is a challenge for diffusion models. To alleviate this issue, we introduce DDAT: Diffusion policies for Dynamically Admissible Trajectories to generate provably admissible trajectories of black-box robotic systems using diffusion models. A sequence of states is a dynamically admissible trajectory if each state of the sequence belongs to the reachable set of its predecessor by the robot's equations of motion. To generate such trajectories, our diffusion policies project their predictions onto a dynamically admissible manifold during both training and inference to align the objective of the denoiser neural network with the dynamical admissibility constraint. The auto-regressive nature of these projections along with the black-box nature of robot dynamics render these projections immensely challenging. We thus enforce admissibility by iteratively sampling a polytopic under-approximation of the reachable set of a state onto which we project its predicted successor, before iterating this process with the projected successor. By producing accurate trajectories, this projection eliminates the need for diffusion models to continually replan, enabling one-shot long-horizon trajectory planning. We demonstrate that our framework generates higher quality dynamically admissible robot trajectories through extensive simulations on a quadcopter and various MuJoCo environments, along with real-world experiments on a Unitree GO1 and GO2.</p></details> |  |

Critical to these improvements is understanding AVs' longitudinal behavior, relying heavily on real-world trajectory data. Existing open-source trajectory datasets of AV, however, often fall short in refinement, reliability, and completeness, hindering effective performance metrics analysis and model development. This study addresses these challenges by creating a Unified Longitudinal TRAjectory dataset for AVs (Ultra-AV) to analyze their microscopic longitudinal driving behaviors. This dataset compiles data from 13 distinct sources, encompassing various AV types, test sites, and experiment scenarios. We established a three-step data processing: 1. extraction of longitudinal trajectory data, 2. general data cleaning, and 3. data-specific cleaning to obtain the longitudinal trajectory data and car-following trajectory data. The validity of the processed data is affirmed through performance evaluations across safety, mobility, stability, and sustainability, along with an analysis of the relationships between variables in car-following models. Our work not only furnishes researchers with standardized data and metrics for longitudinal AV behavior studies but also sets guidelines for data collection and model development.</p></details> | NA |

While these methods achieve exceptional performance in defined datasets, they usually rely on the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) assumption and thus tend to be vulnerable to distribution shifts that occur in the real world. In addition, these methods lack explainability due to their black box nature, which poses further challenges in terms of the approval process and social trustworthiness. Therefore, in order to use the capabilities of data-driven statistical AI methods in a reliable and trustworthy manner, the concept of TrustMHE is introduced and investigated in this paper. TrustMHE represents a complementary approach, independent of the underlying AI systems, that combines AI-driven out-of-distribution detection with control-driven moving horizon estimation (MHE) to enable not only detection and monitoring, but also intervention. The effectiveness of the proposed TrustMHE is evaluated and proven in three simulation scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to be published as part of the 2025 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV), JCluj-Napoca, Romania, June 22-25, 2025</p></details> |

While many data-driven approaches aim to learn system dynamics, jointly predicting internal loads and system trajectories remains a key challenge. This dual prediction is especially important for fault detection and predictive maintenance, where internal loads-such as contact forces-act as early indicators of faults, reflecting wear or misalignment before affecting motion. These forces also serve as inputs to degradation models (e.g., crack growth), enabling damage prediction and remaining useful life estimation. We propose Equi-Euler GraphNet, a physics-informed graph neural network (GNN) that simultaneously predicts internal forces and global trajectories in multi-body systems. In this mesh-free framework, nodes represent system components and edges encode interactions. Equi-Euler GraphNet introduces two inductive biases: (1) an equivariant message-passing scheme, interpreting edge messages as interaction forces consistent under Euclidean transformations; and (2) a temporal-aware iterative node update mechanism, based on Euler integration, to capture influence of distant interactions over time. Tailored for cylindrical roller bearings, it decouples ring dynamics from constrained motion of rolling elements. Trained on high-fidelity multiphysics simulations, Equi-Euler GraphNet generalizes beyond the training distribution, accurately predicting loads and trajectories under unseen speeds, loads, and configurations. It outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs focused on trajectory prediction, delivering stable rollouts over thousands of time steps with minimal error accumulation. Achieving up to a 200x speedup over conventional solvers while maintaining comparable accuracy, it serves as an efficient reduced-order model for digital twins, design, and maintenance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Reupl...</summary><p>Reuploaded with new version-- equation 16 was incorrect</p></details> |

However, due to localization errors/uncertainties, trajectory deconfliction can fail even if trajectories are perfectly shared between agents. To address this issue, we first present PARM and PARM*, perception-aware, decentralized, asynchronous multiagent trajectory planners that enable a team of agents to navigate uncertain environments while deconflicting trajectories and avoiding obstacles using perception information. PARM* differs from PARM as it is less conservative, using more computation to find closer-to-optimal solutions. While these methods achieve state-of-the-art performance, they suffer from high computational costs as they need to solve large optimization problems onboard, making it difficult for agents to replan at high rates. To overcome this challenge, we present our second key contribution, PRIMER, a learning-based planner trained with imitation learning (IL) using PARM* as the expert demonstrator. PRIMER leverages the low computational requirements at deployment of neural networks and achieves a computation speed up to 5500 times faster than optimization-based approaches.</p></details> | 7 pages, 3 figures |

However, they have seen limited application in real-world robotics tasks such as trajectory optimization. This is due to the difficulty in reasoning about collisions in radiance models and the computational complexity associated with operating in dense models. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing SPLANNING, a risk-aware trajectory optimizer operating in a Gaussian Splatting model. This paper first derives a method to rigorously upper-bound the probability of collision between a robot and a radiance field. Then, this paper introduces a normalized reformulation of Gaussian Splatting that enables efficient computation of this collision bound. Finally, this paper presents a method to optimize trajectories that avoid collisions in a Gaussian Splat. Experiments show that SPLANNING outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generating collision-free trajectories in cluttered environments. The proposed system is also tested on a real-world robot manipulator.

While these systems offer unprecedented efficiency in transporting people and goods, they rely heavily on computation capability, safety-critical operations such as real-time navigation, environmental sensing, and trajectory tracking--necessitating robust offboard computational support. A widely adopted solution involves offloading these tasks to terrestrial base stations (BSs) along the flight path. However, air-to-ground connectivity is often constrained by spectrum conflicts with terrestrial users, which poses a significant challenge to maintaining reliable task execution. Cognitive radio (CR) techniques offer promising capabilities for dynamic spectrum access, making them a natural fit for addressing this issue. Existing studies often overlook the time-varying nature of BS resources, such as spectrum availability and CPU cycles, which leads to inaccurate trajectory planning, suboptimal offloading success rates, excessive energy consumption, and operational delays. To address these challenges, we propose a trajectory optimization framework for eVTOL swarms that maximizes task offloading success probability while minimizing both energy consumption and resource competition (e.g., spectrum and CPU cycles) with primary terrestrial users. The proposed algorithm integrates a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) model to dynamically estimate BS resource availability and a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to determine optimal offloading decisions, selecting both the BSs and access time windows that align with energy and temporal constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mixed Bernstein-Fourier Approximants for Optimal Trajectory Generation with Periodic Behavior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17969v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient trajectory generation is critical for autonomous systems, yet current numerical methods often struggle to handle periodic behaviors effectively, especially when equidistant time nodes are required. This paper introduces a novel mixed Bernstein-Fourier approximation framework tailored explicitly for optimal motion planning. Our proposed methodology leverages the uniform convergence properties of Bernstein polynomials for nonperiodic behaviors while effectively capturing periodic dynamics through Fourier series. Theoretical results are established, including uniform convergence proofs for approximations of functions, derivatives, and integrals, as well as detailed error bound analyses. We further introduce a regulated least squares approach for determining approximation coefficients, enhancing numerical stability and practical applicability. Within an optimal control context, we establish feasibility and consistency of approximated solutions to their continuous counterparts. We also extend the covector mapping theorem, providing theoretical guarantees for approximating dual variables crucial in verifying the necessary optimality conditions from Pontryagin's Maximum Principle. Comprehensive numerical examples illustrate the method's superior performance, demonstrating substantial improvements in computational efficiency and precision in scenarios with complex periodic constraints and dynamics. Our mixed Bernstein-Fourier methodology thus presents a robust, theoretically grounded, and computationally efficient approach for advanced optimal trajectory planning in autonomous systems.</p></details> | 49 pages, 9 figures |

However, predictive modeling of such data remains challenging due to high dimensionality, irregular sampling, and data sparsity. To address these issues, we propose ImageFlowNet, a novel model designed to forecast disease trajectories from initial images while preserving spatial details. ImageFlowNet first learns multiscale joint representation spaces across patients and time points, then optimizes deterministic or stochastic flow fields within these spaces using a position-parameterized neural ODE/SDE framework. The model leverages a UNet architecture to create robust multiscale representations and mitigates data scarcity by combining knowledge from all patients. We provide theoretical insights that support our formulation of ODEs, and motivate our regularizations involving high-level visual features, latent space organization, and trajectory smoothness. We validate ImageFlowNet on three longitudinal medical image datasets depicting progression in geographic atrophy, multiple sclerosis, and glioblastoma, demonstrating its ability to effectively forecast disease progression and outperform existing methods. Our contributions include the development of ImageFlowNet, its theoretical underpinnings, and empirical validation on real-world datasets. The official implementation is available at https://github.com/KrishnaswamyLab/ImageFlowNet.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICASS...</summary><p>ICASSP 2025, Oral Presentation</p></details> |

Operating in such settings presents many challenges -- most notably, because the agent cannot predict the ground-truth future paths of obstacles, a previously planned trajectory can become unsafe at any moment, requiring rapid replanning to avoid collisions. Recently developed planners have used soft-constraint approaches to achieve the necessary fast computation times; however, these methods do not guarantee collision-free paths even with static obstacles. In contrast, hard-constraint methods ensure collision-free safety, but typically have longer computation times. To address these issues, we propose three key contributions. First, the DYNUS Global Planner (DGP) and Temporal Safe Corridor Generation operate in spatio-temporal space and handle both static and dynamic obstacles in the 3D environment. Second, the Safe Planning Framework leverages a combination of exploratory, safe, and contingency trajectories to flexibly re-route when potential future collisions with dynamic obstacles are detected. Finally, the Fast Hard-Constraint Local Trajectory Formulation uses a variable elimination approach to reduce the problem size and enable faster computation by pre-computing dependencies between free and dependent variables while still ensuring collision-free trajectories. We evaluated DYNUS in a variety of simulations, including dense forests, confined office spaces, cave systems, and dynamic environments. Our experiments show that DYNUS achieves a success rate of 100% and travel times that are approximately 25.0% faster than state-of-the-art methods. We also evaluated DYNUS on multiple platforms -- a quadrotor, a wheeled robot, and a quadruped -- in both simulation and hardware experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 30 figures, Under review at IEEE Transactions on Robotics</p></details> |

There is a urgent need to minimize the data size in LLM training. Compared with data selection method, the data distillation method aims to synthesize a small number of data samples to achieve the training effect of the full data set and has better flexibility. Despite its successes in computer vision, the discreteness of text data has hitherto stymied its exploration in natural language processing (NLP). In this work, we proposed a method that involves learning pseudo prompt data based on trajectory matching and finding its nearest neighbor ID to achieve cross-architecture transfer. During the distillation process, we introduce a regularization loss to improve the robustness of our distilled data. To our best knowledge, this is the first data distillation work suitable for text generation tasks such as instruction tuning. Evaluations on two benchmarks, including ARC-Easy and MMLU instruction tuning datasets, established the superiority of our distillation approach over the SOTA data selection method LESS. Furthermore, our method demonstrates a good transferability over LLM structures (i.e., OPT to Llama).</p></details> |  |
| **[SHIFT Planner: Speedy Hybrid Iterative Field and Segmented Trajectory Optimization with IKD-tree for Uniform Lightweight Coverage](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10706v2)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a comprehensive planning and navigation framework that address these limitations by integrating semantic mapping, adaptive coverage planning, dynamic obstacle avoidance and precise trajectory tracking. Our framework begins by generating panoptic occupancy local semantic maps and accurate localization information from data aligned between a monocular camera, IMU, and GPS. This information is combined with input terrain point clouds or preloaded terrain information to initialize the planning process. We propose the Radiant Field-Informed Coverage Planning algorithm, which utilizes a diffusion field model to dynamically adjust the robot's coverage trajectory and speed based on environmental attributes such as dirtiness and dryness. By modeling the spatial influence of the robot's actions using a Gaussian field, ensures a speed-optimized, uniform coverage trajectory while adapting to varying environmental conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Building Real-time Awareness of Out-of-distribution in Trajectory Prediction for Autonomous Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17277v2)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate trajectory prediction is essential for the safe operation of autonomous vehicles in real-world environments. Even well-trained machine learning models may produce unreliable predictions due to discrepancies between training data and real-world conditions encountered during inference. In particular, the training dataset tends to overrepresent common scenes (e.g., straight lanes) while underrepresenting less frequent ones (e.g., traffic circles). In addition, it often overlooks unpredictable real-world events such as sudden braking or falling objects. To ensure safety, it is critical to detect in real-time when a model's predictions become unreliable. Leveraging the intuition that in-distribution (ID) scenes exhibit error patterns similar to training data, while out-of-distribution (OOD) scenes do not, we introduce a principled, real-time approach for OOD detection by framing it as a change-point detection problem. We address the challenging settings where the OOD scenes are deceptive, meaning that they are not easily detectable by human intuitions. Our lightweight solutions can handle the occurrence of OOD at any time during trajectory prediction inference. Experimental results on multiple real-world datasets using a benchmark trajectory prediction model demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[TraCeS: Trajectory Based Credit Assignment From Sparse Safety Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12557v2)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In safe reinforcement learning (RL), auxiliary safety costs are used to align the agent to safe decision making. In practice, safety constraints, including cost functions and budgets, are unknown or hard to specify, as it requires anticipation of all possible unsafe behaviors. We therefore address a general setting where the true safety definition is unknown, and has to be learned from sparsely labeled data. Our key contributions are: first, we design a safety model that performs credit assignment to estimate each decision step's impact on the overall safety using a dataset of diverse trajectories and their corresponding binary safety labels (i.e., whether the corresponding trajectory is safe/unsafe). Second, we illustrate the architecture of our safety model to demonstrate its ability to learn a separate safety score for each timestep. Third, we reformulate the safe RL problem using the proposed safety model and derive an effective algorithm to optimize a safe yet rewarding policy. Finally, our empirical results corroborate our findings and show that this approach is effective in satisfying unknown safety definition, and scalable to various continuous control tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[SILM: A Subjective Intent Based Low-Latency Framework for Multiple Traffic Participants Joint Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16377v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is a fundamental technology for advanced autonomous driving systems and represents one of the most challenging problems in the field of cognitive intelligence. Accurately predicting the future trajectories of each traffic participant is a prerequisite for building high safety and high reliability decision-making, planning, and control capabilities in autonomous driving. However, existing methods often focus solely on the motion of other traffic participants without considering the underlying intent behind that motion, which increases the uncertainty in trajectory prediction. Autonomous vehicles operate in real-time environments, meaning that trajectory prediction algorithms must be able to process data and generate predictions in real-time. While many existing methods achieve high accuracy, they often struggle to effectively handle heterogeneous traffic scenarios. In this paper, we propose a Subjective Intent-based Low-latency framework for Multiple traffic participants joint trajectory prediction. Our method explicitly incorporates the subjective intent of traffic participants based on their key points, and predicts the future trajectories jointly without map, which ensures promising performance while significantly reducing the prediction latency. Additionally, we introduce a novel dataset designed specifically for trajectory prediction. Related code and dataset will be available soon.</p></details> |  |

As this is a novel task, there is currently no relevant dataset available in the community. To address this gap, we first devised a new visualization language called Trajectory Visualization Language (TVL) to facilitate querying trajectory data and generating visualizations. Building on this foundation, we further proposed a dataset construction method that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with human efforts to create high-quality data. Specifically, we first generate TVLs using a comprehensive and systematic process, and then label each TVL with corresponding natural language questions using LLMs. This process results in the creation of the first large-scale Text-to-TrajVis dataset, named TrajVL, which contains 18,140 (question, TVL) pairs. Based on this dataset, we systematically evaluated the performance of multiple LLMs (GPT, Qwen, Llama, etc.) on this task. The experimental results demonstrate that this task is both feasible and highly challenging and merits further exploration within the research community.</p></details> |  |
| **[DriVerse: Navigation World Model for Driving Simulation via Multimodal Trajectory Prompting and Motion Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18576v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents DriVerse, a generative model for simulating navigation-driven driving scenes from a single image and a future trajectory. Previous autonomous driving world models either directly feed the trajectory or discrete control signals into the generation pipeline, leading to poor alignment between the control inputs and the implicit features of the 2D base generative model, which results in low-fidelity video outputs. Some methods use coarse textual commands or discrete vehicle control signals, which lack the precision to guide fine-grained, trajectory-specific video generation, making them unsuitable for evaluating actual autonomous driving algorithms. DriVerse introduces explicit trajectory guidance in two complementary forms: it tokenizes trajectories into textual prompts using a predefined trend vocabulary for seamless language integration, and converts 3D trajectories into 2D spatial motion priors to enhance control over static content within the driving scene. To better handle dynamic objects, we further introduce a lightweight motion alignment module, which focuses on the inter-frame consistency of dynamic pixels, significantly enhancing the temporal coherence of moving elements over long sequences. With minimal training and no need for additional data, DriVerse outperforms specialized models on future video generation tasks across both the nuScenes and Waymo datasets. The code and models will be released to the public.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Dynamic Intent Queries for Motion Transformer-based Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15766v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In autonomous driving, accurately predicting the movements of other traffic participants is crucial, as it significantly influences a vehicle's planning processes. Modern trajectory prediction models strive to interpret complex patterns and dependencies from agent and map data. The Motion Transformer (MTR) architecture and subsequent work define the most accurate methods in common benchmarks such as the Waymo Open Motion Benchmark. The MTR model employs pre-generated static intention points as initial goal points for trajectory prediction. However, the static nature of these points frequently leads to misalignment with map data in specific traffic scenarios, resulting in unfeasible or unrealistic goal points. Our research addresses this limitation by integrating scene-specific dynamic intention points into the MTR model. This adaptation of the MTR model was trained and evaluated on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset. Our findings demonstrate that incorporating dynamic intention points has a significant positive impact on trajectory prediction accuracy, especially for predictions over long time horizons. Furthermore, we analyze the impact on ground truth trajectories which are not compliant with the map data or are illegal maneuvers.</p></details> |  |
| **[SocialMOIF: Multi-Order Intention Fusion for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15616v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The analysis and prediction of agent trajectories are crucial for decision-making processes in intelligent systems, with precise short-term trajectory forecasting being highly significant across a range of applications. Agents and their social interactions have been quantified and modeled by researchers from various perspectives; however, substantial limitations exist in the current work due to the inherent high uncertainty of agent intentions and the complex higher-order influences among neighboring groups. SocialMOIF is proposed to tackle these challenges, concentrating on the higher-order intention interactions among neighboring groups while reinforcing the primary role of first-order intention interactions between neighbors and the target agent. This method develops a multi-order intention fusion model to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of both direct and indirect intention information. Within SocialMOIF, a trajectory distribution approximator is designed to guide the trajectories toward values that align more closely with the actual data, thereby enhancing model interpretability. Furthermore, a global trajectory optimizer is introduced to enable more accurate and efficient parallel predictions. By incorporating a novel loss function that accounts for distance and direction during training, experimental results demonstrate that the model outperforms previous state-of-the-art baselines across multiple metrics in both dynamic and static datasets.</p></details> | 11 pages,6 figures |
| **[Offline Safe Reinforcement Learning Using Trajectory Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15429v5)** | 2025-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline safe reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach for learning safe behaviors without engaging in risky online interactions with the environment. Most existing methods in offline safe RL rely on cost constraints at each time step (derived from global cost constraints) and this can result in either overly conservative policies or violation of safety constraints. In this paper, we propose to learn a policy that generates desirable trajectories and avoids undesirable trajectories. To be specific, we first partition the pre-collected dataset of state-action trajectories into desirable and undesirable subsets. Intuitively, the desirable set contains high reward and safe trajectories, and undesirable set contains unsafe trajectories and low-reward safe trajectories. Second, we learn a policy that generates desirable trajectories and avoids undesirable trajectories, where (un)desirability scores are provided by a classifier learnt from the dataset of desirable and undesirable trajectories. This approach bypasses the computational complexity and stability issues of a min-max objective that is employed in existing methods. Theoretically, we also show our approach's strong connections to existing learning paradigms involving human feedback. Finally, we extensively evaluate our method using the DSRL benchmark for offline safe RL. Empirically, our method outperforms competitive baselines, achieving higher rewards and better constraint satisfaction across a wide variety of benchmark tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 2025.

Directly mapping camera data to actions via neural networks can result in jerky motions and difficulties in meeting critical constraints, compromising safety and robustness in real-world deployment. For tasks that require high robustness or strict adherence to constraints, ensuring trajectory quality is crucial. However, the lack of interpretability in neural networks makes it challenging to generate constraint-compliant actions in a controlled manner. This paper introduces differentiable policy trajectory optimization with generalizability (DiffOG), a learning-based trajectory optimization framework designed to enhance visuomotor policies. By leveraging the proposed differentiable formulation of trajectory optimization with transformer, DiffOG seamlessly integrates policies with a generalizable optimization layer. Visuomotor policies enhanced by DiffOG generate smoother, constraint-compliant action trajectories in a more interpretable way. DiffOG exhibits strong generalization capabilities and high flexibility. We evaluated DiffOG across 11 simulated tasks and 2 real-world tasks. The results demonstrate that DiffOG significantly enhances the trajectory quality of visuomotor policies while having minimal impact on policy performance, outperforming trajectory processing baselines such as greedy constraint clipping and penalty-based trajectory optimization. Furthermore, DiffOG achieves superior performance compared to existing constrained visuomotor policy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Through Retrospection: Improving Trajectory Prediction for Automated Driving with Error Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13785v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In automated driving, predicting trajectories of surrounding vehicles supports reasoning about scene dynamics and enables safe planning for the ego vehicle. However, existing models handle predictions as an instantaneous task of forecasting future trajectories based on observed information. As time proceeds, the next prediction is made independently of the previous one, which means that the model cannot correct its errors during inference and will repeat them. To alleviate this problem and better leverage temporal data, we propose a novel retrospection technique. Through training on closed-loop rollouts the model learns to use aggregated feedback. Given new observations it reflects on previous predictions and analyzes its errors to improve the quality of subsequent predictions. Thus, the model can learn to correct systematic errors during inference. Comprehensive experiments on nuScenes and Argoverse demonstrate a considerable decrease in minimum Average Displacement Error of up to 31.9% compared to the state-of-the-art baseline without retrospection. We further showcase the robustness of our technique by demonstrating a better handling of out-of-distribution scenarios with undetected road-users.</p></details> |  |

So we present a lightweight multi-modal framework for 3D object detection and trajectory prediction. Our system synergistically integrates LiDAR and camera inputs to achieve real-time perception of pedestrians, vehicles, and riders in 3D space. The framework proposes two novel modules: 1) a Cross-Modal Deformable Transformer (CMDT) for object detection with high accuracy and acceptable amount of computation, and 2) a Reference Trajectory-based Multi-Class Transformer (RTMCT) for efficient and diverse trajectory prediction of mult-class objects with flexible trajectory lengths. Evaluations on the CODa benchmark demonstrate superior performance over existing methods across detection (+2.03% in mAP) and trajectory prediction (-0.408m in minADE5 of pedestrians) metrics. Remarkably, the system exhibits exceptional deployability - when implemented on a wheelchair robot with an entry-level NVIDIA 3060 GPU, it achieves real-time inference at 13.2 fps. To facilitate reproducibility and practical deployment, we release the related code of the method at https://github.com/TossherO/3D_Perception and its ROS inference version at https://github.com/TossherO/ros_packages.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stochastic Trajectory Optimization for Robotic Skill Acquisition From a Suboptimal Demonstration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03131v4)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning from Demonstration (LfD) has emerged as a crucial method for robots to acquire new skills. However, when given suboptimal task trajectory demonstrations with shape characteristics reflecting human preferences but subpar dynamic attributes such as slow motion, robots not only need to mimic the behaviors but also optimize the dynamic performance. In this work, we leverage optimization-based methods to search for a superior-performing trajectory whose shape is similar to that of the demonstrated trajectory. Specifically, we use Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to quantify the difference between two trajectories and combine it with additional performance metrics, such as collision cost, to construct the cost function. Moreover, we develop a multi-policy version of the Stochastic Trajectory Optimization for Motion Planning (STOMP), called MSTOMP, which is more stable and robust to parameter changes. To deal with the jitter in the demonstrated trajectory, we further utilize the gain-controlling method in the frequency domain to denoise the demonstration and propose a computationally more efficient metric, called Mean Square Error in the Spectrum (MSES), that measures the trajectories' differences in the frequency domain. We also theoretically highlight the connections between the time domain and the frequency domain methods. Finally, we verify our method in both simulation experiments and real-world experiments, showcasing its improved optimization performance and stability compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Estimation of Battery State of Health Using Reference Voltage Trajectory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13324v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate estimation of state of health (SOH) is critical for battery applications. Current model-based SOH estimation methods typically rely on low C-rate constant current tests to extract health parameters like solid phase volume fraction and lithium-ion stoichiometry, which are often impractical in real-world scenarios due to time and operational constraints. Additionally, these methods are susceptible to modeling uncertainties that can significantly degrade the estimation accuracy, especially when jointly estimating multiple parameters. In this paper, we present a novel reference voltage-based method for robust battery SOH estimation. This method utilizes the voltage response of a battery under a predefined current excitation at the beginning of life (BOL) as a reference to compensate for modeling uncertainty. As the battery degrades, the same excitation is applied to generate the voltage response, which is compared with the BOL trajectory to estimate the key health parameters accurately. The current excitation is optimally designed using the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm to maximize the information content of the target parameters. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly improves parameter estimation accuracy under different degradation levels, compared to conventional methods relying only on direct voltage measurements. Furthermore, our method jointly estimates four key SOH parameters in only 10 minutes, making it practical for real-world battery health diagnostics, e.g., fast testing to enable battery repurposing.</p></details> |  |

However, their out-of-distribution generalization remains a significant challenge, particularly due to unbalanced data and a lack of enough data and diversity to ensure robustness and calibration. To address this, we propose SHIFT (Spectral Heteroscedastic Informed Forecasting for Trajectories), a novel framework that uniquely combines well-calibrated uncertainty modeling with informative priors derived through automated rule extraction. SHIFT reformulates trajectory prediction as a classification task and employs heteroscedastic spectral-normalized Gaussian processes to effectively disentangle epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. We learn informative priors from training labels, which are automatically generated from natural language driving rules, such as stop rules and drivability constraints, using a retrieval-augmented generation framework powered by a large language model. Extensive evaluations over the nuScenes dataset, including challenging low-data and cross-location scenarios, demonstrate that SHIFT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving substantial gains in uncertainty calibration and displacement metrics. In particular, our model excels in complex scenarios, such as intersections, where uncertainty is inherently higher.

| **[Set You Straight: Auto-Steering Denoising Trajectories to Sidestep Unwanted Concepts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12782v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring the ethical deployment of text-to-image models requires effective techniques to prevent the generation of harmful or inappropriate content. While concept erasure methods offer a promising solution, existing finetuning-based approaches suffer from notable limitations. Anchor-free methods risk disrupting sampling trajectories, leading to visual artifacts, while anchor-based methods rely on the heuristic selection of anchor concepts. To overcome these shortcomings, we introduce a finetuning framework, dubbed ANT, which Automatically guides deNoising Trajectories to avoid unwanted concepts. ANT is built on a key insight: reversing the condition direction of classifier-free guidance during mid-to-late denoising stages enables precise content modification without sacrificing early-stage structural integrity. This inspires a trajectory-aware objective that preserves the integrity of the early-stage score function field, which steers samples toward the natural image manifold, without relying on heuristic anchor concept selection. For single-concept erasure, we propose an augmentation-enhanced weight saliency map to precisely identify the critical parameters that most significantly contribute to the unwanted concept, enabling more thorough and efficient erasure. For multi-concept erasure, our objective function offers a versatile plug-and-play solution that significantly boosts performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ANT achieves state-of-the-art results in both single and multi-concept erasure, delivering high-quality, safe outputs without compromising the generative fidelity.

This work proposes a flexible language-based framework to adapt generic robotic trajectories produced by off-the-shelf motion planners like RRT, A-star, etc, or learned from human demonstrations. We utilize pre-trained LLMs to adapt trajectory waypoints by generating code as a policy for dense robot manipulation, enabling more complex and flexible instructions than current methods. This approach allows us to incorporate a broader range of commands, including numerical inputs. Compared to state-of-the-art feature-based sequence-to-sequence models which require training, our method does not require task-specific training and offers greater interpretability and more effective feedback mechanisms. We validate our approach through simulation experiments on the robotic manipulator, aerial vehicle, and ground robot in the Pybullet and Gazebo simulation environments, demonstrating that LLMs can successfully adapt trajectories to complex human instructions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CoRL LangRob workshop 2024</p></details> |

Recent score distillation methods distill a heavy teacher model into a student generator to achieve one-step generation, which is optimized by calculating the difference between the two score functions on the samples generated by the student model. However, there is a score mismatch issue in the early stage of the distillation process, because existing methods mainly focus on using the endpoint of pre-trained diffusion models as teacher models, overlooking the importance of the convergence trajectory between the student generator and the teacher model. To address this issue, we extend the score distillation process by introducing the entire convergence trajectory of teacher models and propose Distribution Backtracking Distillation (DisBack). DisBask is composed of two stages: Degradation Recording and Distribution Backtracking. Degradation Recording is designed to obtain the convergence trajectory of the teacher model, which records the degradation path from the trained teacher model to the untrained initial student generator. The degradation path implicitly represents the teacher model's intermediate distributions, and its reverse can be viewed as the convergence trajectory from the student generator to the teacher model. Then Distribution Backtracking trains a student generator to backtrack the intermediate distributions along the path to approximate the convergence trajectory of teacher models. Extensive experiments show that DisBack achieves faster and better convergence than the existing distillation method and accomplishes comparable generation performance, with FID score of 1.38 on ImageNet 64x64 dataset. Notably, DisBack is easy to implement and can be generalized to existing distillation methods to boost performance.

In complex environments, like modern 3D video games, distribution shift and stochasticity necessitate robust approaches beyond simple action replay. In this study, we apply Inverse Dynamics Models (IDM) with different encoders and policy heads to trajectory following in a modern 3D video game -- Bleeding Edge. Additionally, we investigate several future alignment strategies that address the distribution shift caused by the aleatoric uncertainty and imperfections of the agent. We measure both the trajectory deviation distance and the first significant deviation point between the reference and the agent's trajectory and show that the optimal configuration depends on the chosen setting. Our results show that in a diverse data setting, a GPT-style policy head with an encoder trained from scratch performs the best, DINOv2 encoder with the GPT-style policy head gives the best results in the low data regime, and both GPT-style and MLP-style policy heads had comparable results when pre-trained on a diverse setting and fine-tuned for a specific behaviour setting.</p></details> |  |
| **[GripMap: An Efficient, Spatially Resolved Constraint Framework for Offline and Online Trajectory Planning in Autonomous Racing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12115v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional trajectory planning approaches for autonomous vehicles often assume a fixed vehicle model that remains constant regardless of the vehicle's location. This overlooks the critical fact that the tires and the surface are the two force-transmitting partners in vehicle dynamics; while the tires stay with the vehicle, surface conditions vary with location. Recognizing these challenges, this paper presents a novel framework for spatially resolving dynamic constraints in both offline and online planning algorithms applied to autonomous racing. We introduce the GripMap concept, which provides a spatial resolution of vehicle dynamic constraints in the Frenet frame, allowing adaptation to locally varying grip conditions. This enables compensation for location-specific effects, more efficient vehicle behavior, and increased safety, unattainable with spatially invariant vehicle models. The focus is on low storage demand and quick access through perfect hashing. This framework proved advantageous in real-world applications in the presented form. Experiments inspired by autonomous racing demonstrate its effectiveness. In future work, this framework can serve as a foundational layer for developing future interpretable learning algorithms that adjust to varying grip conditions in real-time.</p></details> |  |

We propose to analyse facial landmark trajectories, a compact yet informative representation, that encodes these subtle motions from a high-level structural perspective. Hence, we introduce Trajectory-guided Motion Perception Transformer (TraMP-Former), a novel FEQA framework that fuses landmark trajectory features for fine-grained motion capture with visual semantic cues from RGB frames, ultimately regressing the combined features into a quality score. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TraMP-Former achieves new state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets with neurological disorders, including PFED5 (up by 6.51%) and an augmented Toronto NeuroFace (up by 7.62%). Our ablation studies further validate the efficiency and effectiveness of landmark trajectories in FEQA.

| **[Trajectory Encoding Temporal Graph Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11386v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal Graph Networks (TGNs) have demonstrated significant success in dynamic graph tasks such as link prediction and node classification. Both tasks comprise transductive settings, where the model predicts links among known nodes, and in inductive settings, where it generalises learned patterns to previously unseen nodes. Existing TGN designs face a dilemma under these dual scenarios. Anonymous TGNs, which rely solely on temporal and structural information, offer strong inductive generalisation but struggle to distinguish known nodes. In contrast, non-anonymous TGNs leverage node features to excel in transductive tasks yet fail to adapt to new nodes. To address this challenge, we propose Trajectory Encoding TGN (TETGN). Our approach introduces automatically expandable node identifiers (IDs) as learnable temporal positional features and performs message passing over these IDs to capture each node's historical context. By integrating this trajectory-aware module with a standard TGN using multi-head attention, TETGN effectively balances transductive accuracy with inductive generalisation. Experimental results on three real-world datasets show that TETGN significantly outperforms strong baselines on both link prediction and node classification tasks, demonstrating its ability to unify the advantages of anonymous and non-anonymous models for dynamic graph learning.</p></details> |  |

The context itself can be static (lanes, regulatory elements, etc) or dynamic (traffic participants). This paper presents a lane graph-based motion prediction model that first predicts graph-based goal proposals and later fuses them with cross attention over multiple contextual elements. We follow the famous encoder-interactor-decoder architecture where the encoder encodes scene context using lightweight Gated Recurrent Units, the interactor applies cross-context attention over encoded scene features and graph goal proposals, and the decoder regresses multimodal trajectories via Laplacian Mixture Density Network from the aggregated encodings. Using cross-attention over graph-based goal proposals gives robust trajectory estimates since the model learns to attend to future goal-relevant scene elements for the intended agent. We evaluate our work on nuScenes motion prediction dataset, achieving state-of-the-art results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Robust Trajectory Embedding for Similarity Computation: When Triangle Inequality Violations in Distance Metrics Matter](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10933v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory similarity is a cornerstone of trajectory data management and analysis. Traditional similarity functions often suffer from high computational complexity and a reliance on specific distance metrics, prompting a shift towards deep representation learning in Euclidean space. However, existing Euclidean-based trajectory embeddings often face challenges due to the triangle inequality constraints that do not universally hold for trajectory data. To address this issue, this paper introduces a novel approach by incorporating non-Euclidean geometry, specifically hyperbolic space, into trajectory representation learning. We present the first-ever integration of hyperbolic space to resolve the inherent limitations of the triangle inequality in Euclidean embeddings. In particular, we achieve it by designing a Lorentz distance measure, which is proven to overcome triangle inequality constraints. Additionally, we design a model-agnostic framework LH-plugin to seamlessly integrate hyperbolic embeddings into existing representation learning pipelines. This includes a novel projection method optimized with the Cosh function to prevent the diminishment of distances, supported by a theoretical foundation. Furthermore, we propose a dynamic fusion distance that intelligently adapts to variations in triangle inequality constraints across different trajectory pairs, blending Lorentzian and Euclidean distances for more robust similarity calculations. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that our approach effectively enhances the accuracy of trajectory similarity measures in state-of-the-art models across multiple real-world datasets. The LH-plugin not only addresses the triangle inequality issues but also significantly refines the precision of trajectory similarity computations, marking a substantial advancement in the field of trajectory representation learning.</p></details> | 14 pages, 8 figures |

Although predicting the ego-vehicle's path is valuable for driver-assistance systems, existing methods mainly focus on external factors like other vehicles' motions, often neglecting the driver's attention and intent. To address this gap, we infer the ego-trajectory by integrating the driver's gaze and the surrounding scene. We introduce RouteFormer, a novel multimodal ego-trajectory prediction network combining GPS data, environmental context, and the driver's field-of-view, comprising first-person video and gaze fixations. We also present the Path Complexity Index (PCI), a new metric for trajectory complexity that enables a more nuanced evaluation of challenging scenarios. To tackle data scarcity and enhance diversity, we introduce GEM, a comprehensive dataset of urban driving scenarios enriched with synchronized driver field-of-view and gaze data. Extensive evaluations on GEM and DR(eye)VE demonstrate that RouteFormer significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving notable improvements in prediction accuracy across diverse conditions. Ablation studies reveal that incorporating driver field-of-view data yields significantly better average displacement error, especially in challenging scenarios with high PCI scores, underscoring the importance of modeling driver attention.

This paper presents RINGO: Real-time Navigation with a Guiding Trajectory, a novel planning framework that enables aerial manipulators to navigate unknown environments in real time. The proposed method simultaneously considers the positions of both the multi-rotor and the end-effector. A pre-obtained multi-rotor trajectory serves as a guiding reference, allowing the end-effector to generate a smooth, collision-free, and workspace-compatible trajectory. Leveraging the convex hull property of B-spline curves, we theoretically guarantee that the trajectory remains within the reachable workspace. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that enables real-time navigation of aerial manipulators in unknown environments. The simulation and experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method. The proposed method generates less conservative trajectories than approaches that consider only the multi-rotor.</p></details> | 9 pages, 15 figures |
| **[Enhancing Offline Reinforcement Learning with Curriculum Learning-Based Trajectory Valuation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00601v2)** | 2025-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The success of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) relies on the availability and quality of training data, often requiring extensive interactions with specific environments. In many real-world scenarios, where data collection is costly and risky, offline reinforcement learning (RL) offers a solution by utilizing data collected by domain experts and searching for a batch-constrained optimal policy. This approach is further augmented by incorporating external data sources, expanding the range and diversity of data collection possibilities. However, existing offline RL methods often struggle with challenges posed by non-matching data from these external sources. In this work, we specifically address the problem of source-target domain mismatch in scenarios involving mixed datasets, characterized by a predominance of source data generated from random or suboptimal policies and a limited amount of target data generated from higher-quality policies. To tackle this problem, we introduce Transition Scoring (TS), a novel method that assigns scores to transitions based on their similarity to the target domain, and propose Curriculum Learning-Based Trajectory Valuation (CLTV), which effectively leverages these transition scores to identify and prioritize high-quality trajectories through a curriculum learning approach. Our extensive experiments across various offline RL methods and MuJoCo environments, complemented by rigorous theoretical analysis, demonstrate that CLTV enhances the overall performance and transferability of policies learned by offline RL algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAMAS 2025</p></details> |

Traditional assessment tools often fail to fully cover course content, leading to imprecise evaluations of student mastery. To tackle this problem, the study proposes a knowledge graph construction method based on large language models (LLMs), which transforms learning materials into structured data and generates personalized learning trajectory graphs by analyzing students' test data. Experimental results demonstrate that the model effectively alerts teachers to potential biases in their exam questions and tracks individual student progress. This system not only enhances the accuracy of learning assessments but also helps teachers provide timely guidance to students who are falling behind, thereby improving overall teaching strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Conformal Slit Mapping Based Spiral Tool Trajectory Planning for Ball-end Milling on Complex Freeform Surfaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06310v2)** | 2025-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study presents a spiral-based complete coverage strategy for ball-end milling on freeform surfaces, utilizing conformal slit mapping to generate milling trajectories that are more compact, smoother, and evenly distributed when machining 2D cavities with islands. This approach, an upgrade from traditional methods, extends the original algorithm to effectively address 3D perforated surface milling. Unlike conventional algorithms, the method embeds a continuous spiral trajectory within perforated surfaces without requiring cellular decomposition or additional boundaries. The proposed method addresses three primary challenges, including modifying conformal slit mapping for mesh surfaces, maintaining uniform scallop height between adjacent spiral trajectories, and optimizing the mapped origin point to ensure uniform scallop height distribution. To overcome these challenges, surface flattening techniques are incorporated into the original approach to accommodate mesh surfaces effectively. Tool path spacing is then optimized using a binary search strategy to regulate scallop height. A functional energy metric associated with scallop height uniformity is introduced for rapid evaluation of points mapped to the origin, with the minimum functional energy determined through perturbation techniques. The optimal placement of this point is identified using a modified gradient descent approach applied to the energy function. Validation on intricate surfaces, including low-quality and high-genus meshes, verifies the robustness of the algorithm. Surface milling experiments comparing this method with conventional techniques indicate a 15.63% improvement in scallop height uniformity while reducing machining time, average spindle impact, and spindle impact variance by up to 7.36%, 27.79%, and 55.98%, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>The r...</summary><p>The revised manuscript has improved the quality of the figures</p></details> |
| **[IMPACT: Behavioral Intention-aware Multimodal Trajectory Prediction with Adaptive Context Trimming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09103v1)** | 2025-04-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While most prior research has focused on improving the precision of multimodal trajectory predictions, the explicit modeling of multimodal behavioral intentions (e.g., yielding, overtaking) remains relatively underexplored. This paper proposes a unified framework that jointly predicts both behavioral intentions and trajectories to enhance prediction accuracy, interpretability, and efficiency. Specifically, we employ a shared context encoder for both intention and trajectory predictions, thereby reducing structural redundancy and information loss. Moreover, we address the lack of ground-truth behavioral intention labels in mainstream datasets (Waymo, Argoverse) by auto-labeling these datasets, thus advancing the community's efforts in this direction. We further introduce a vectorized occupancy prediction module that infers the probability of each map polyline being occupied by the target vehicle's future trajectory. By leveraging these intention and occupancy prediction priors, our method conducts dynamic, modality-dependent pruning of irrelevant agents and map polylines in the decoding stage, effectively reducing computational overhead and mitigating noise from non-critical elements. Our approach ranks first among LiDAR-free methods on the Waymo Motion Dataset and achieves first place on the Waymo Interactive Prediction Dataset. Remarkably, even without model ensembling, our single-model framework improves the soft mean average precision (softmAP) by 10 percent compared to the second-best method in the Waymo Interactive Prediction Leaderboard. Furthermore, the proposed framework has been successfully deployed on real vehicles, demonstrating its practical effectiveness in real-world applications.</p></details> | under review |

In this paper, we propose a novel method for trajectory synthesis by adapting the Time-Based Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (TimeVQVAE). Our approach leverages time-frequency domain processing, vector quantization, and transformer-based priors to capture both global and local dynamics in flight data. By discretizing the latent space and integrating transformer priors, the model learns long-range spatiotemporal dependencies and preserves coherence across entire flight paths. We evaluate the adapted TimeVQVAE using an extensive suite of quality, statistical, and distributional metrics, as well as a flyability assessment conducted in an open-source air traffic simulator. Results indicate that TimeVQVAE outperforms a temporal convolutional VAE baseline, generating synthetic trajectories that mirror real flight data in terms of spatial accuracy, temporal consistency, and statistical properties. Furthermore, the simulator-based assessment shows that most generated trajectories maintain operational feasibility, although occasional outliers underscore the potential need for additional domain-specific constraints. Overall, our findings underscore the importance of multi-scale representation learning for capturing complex flight behaviors and demonstrate the promise of TimeVQVAE in producing representative synthetic trajectories for downstream tasks such as model training, airspace design, and air traffic forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was presented at the 25th Integrated Communications, Navigation and Surveillance Conference (ICNS 2025), April 8--10, 2025, Brussels, Belgium</p></details> |

Evaluating web agents trajectories is an important problem, since it helps us determine whether the agent successfully completed the tasks. Rule-based methods are widely used for this purpose, but they are challenging to extend to new tasks and may not always recognize successful trajectories. We may achieve higher accuracy through human evaluation, but the process would be substantially slower and more expensive. Automatic evaluations with LLMs may avoid the challenges of designing new rules and manually annotating trajectories, enabling faster and cost-effective evaluation. However, it is unclear how effective they are at evaluating web agents. To this end, we propose AgentRewardBench, the first benchmark to assess the effectiveness of LLM judges for evaluating web agents. AgentRewardBench contains 1302 trajectories across 5 benchmarks and 4 LLMs. Each trajectory in AgentRewardBench is reviewed by an expert, who answers questions pertaining to the success, side effects, and repetitiveness of the agent. Using our benchmark, we evaluate 12 LLM judges and find that no single LLM excels across all benchmarks. We also find that the rule-based evaluation used by common benchmarks tends to underreport the success rate of web agents, highlighting a key weakness of rule-based evaluation and the need to develop more flexible automatic evaluations. We release the benchmark at: https://agent-reward-bench.github.io</p></details> |  |

In This paper, an adaptive transpose Jacobian approach is proposed to deal with the dynamic model complexity, which utilizes an adaptive PI-algorithm to adjust the control gains. The performance of the proposed control algorithm is compared with the conventional transpose Jacobian and sliding mode control algorithms and evaluated by the root mean square of the errors and control input energy criteria. In order to appraise the effectiveness of the proposed control system, simulations are carried out in MATLAB/Simulink software for a quadruped robot leg for semi-elliptical path tracking. The obtained results show that the proposed adaptive transpose Jacobian reduces the overshoot and root mean square of the errors and at the same time, decreases the control input energy. Moreover, transpose Jacobin and adaptive transpose Jacobian are more robust to changes in initial conditions compared to the conventional sliding mode control. Furthermore, sliding mode control performs well up to 20% uncertainties in the parameters due to its model-based nature, whereas the transpose Jacobin and the proposed adaptive transpose Jacobian algorithms show promising results even in higher mass uncertainties.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE Xplore</p></details> |

Thereby, kinematic constraints with respect to velocity, acceleration and jerk are taken into account. The trajectories are composed of several motion primitives, the most crucial of which is termed jerk segment. Within this contribution, the focus is put on the composition of the overall trajectories, assuming the required motion primitives to be readily available. Since the scheme considered is not time-optimal, even decreasing particular constraints can reduce the overall transition time, which is analysed in detail. This observation implies that replanning of the underlying jerk segments is required as an integral part of the motion planning scheme, further insight into which has been analysed in a complementary contribution. Although the proposed scheme is not time-optimal, it allows for significantly shorter transition times than established methods, such as zero-vibration shaping, while requiring significantly lower computational power than a fully time-optimal scheme.</p></details> |  |

The proposed filter, the trajectory measurement PMBM (TM-PMBM) filter, propagates a PMBM density on the set of target states. In prediction, the filter obtains the PMBM density on the set of trajectories over the last two time steps. This density is then updated with the set of trajectory measurements. After the update step, the PMBM posterior on the set of two-step trajectories is marginalised to obtain a PMBM density on the set of target states. The filter provides a closed-form solution for multi-target filtering based on sets of trajectory measurements, estimating the set of target states at the end of each time window. Additionally, the paper proposes computationally lighter alternatives to the TM-PMBM filter by deriving a Poisson multi-Bernoulli (PMB) density through Kullback-Leibler divergence minimisation in an augmented space with auxiliary variables. The performance of the proposed filters are evaluated in a simulation study.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 7 figures, journal paper</p></details> |

Moreover, incorporating prior information input into such perception model represents an effective approach to ensure the robustness and accuracy. However, utilizing diverse sources of prior information still faces three key challenges: the acquisition of high-quality prior information, alignment between prior and online perception, efficient integration. To address these issues, we investigate prior augmentation from a novel perspective of trajectory priors. In this paper, we initially extract crowdsourcing trajectory data from Argoverse2 motion forecasting dataset and encode trajectory data into rasterized heatmap and vectorized instance tokens, then we incorporate such prior information into the online mapping model through different ways. Besides, with the purpose of mitigating the misalignment between prior and online perception, we design a confidence-based fusion module that takes alignment into account during the fusion process. We conduct extensive experiments on OpenLane-V2 dataset. The results indicate that our method's performance significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods.

However, estimating trajectories of brain biomarkers is challenging due to biological variability, inconsistencies in measurement protocols (e.g., differences in MRI scanners), scarcity, and irregularity in longitudinal measurements. Herein, we introduce a novel personalized deep kernel regression framework for forecasting brain biomarkers, with application to regional volumetric measurements. Our approach integrates two key components: a population model that captures brain trajectories from a large and diverse cohort, and a subject-specific model that captures individual trajectories. To optimally combine these, we propose Adaptive Shrinkage Estimation, which effectively balances population and subject-specific models. We assess our model's performance through predictive accuracy metrics, uncertainty quantification, and validation against external clinical studies. Benchmarking against state-of-the-art statistical and machine learning models -- including linear mixed effects models, generalized additive models, and deep learning methods -- demonstrates the superior predictive performance of our approach. Additionally, we apply our method to predict trajectories of composite neuroimaging biomarkers, which highlights the versatility of our approach in modeling the progression of longitudinal neuroimaging biomarkers. Furthermore, validation on three external neuroimaging studies confirms the robustness of our method across different clinical contexts. We make the code available at https://github.com/vatass/AdaptiveShrinkageDKGP.</p></details> |  |

In cinematography, Directors of Photography meticulously craft camera movements to achieve expressive and intentional framing. However, existing methods for camera trajectory generation remain limited: Traditional approaches rely on geometric optimization or handcrafted procedural systems, while recent learning-based methods often inherit structural biases or lack textual alignment, constraining creative synthesis. In this work, we introduce an auto-regressive model inspired by the expertise of Directors of Photography to generate artistic and expressive camera trajectories. We first introduce DataDoP, a large-scale multi-modal dataset containing 29K real-world shots with free-moving camera trajectories, depth maps, and detailed captions in specific movements, interaction with the scene, and directorial intent. Thanks to the comprehensive and diverse database, we further train an auto-regressive, decoder-only Transformer for high-quality, context-aware camera movement generation based on text guidance and RGBD inputs, named GenDoP. Extensive experiments demonstrate that compared to existing methods, GenDoP offers better controllability, finer-grained trajectory adjustments, and higher motion stability. We believe our approach establishes a new standard for learning-based cinematography, paving the way for future advancements in camera control and filmmaking.

Traditional approaches often rely on static snapshots of network states, which can obscure the underlying dynamics of opinion evolution. In this study, we introduce a dynamic framework that quantifies the unpredictability of opinion trajectories using the normalized Lempel-Ziv (nLZ) complexity. Our approach leverages an adaptive social network model where each node is characterized by three behavioral parameters - homophily, neophily, and social conformity - and where opinions evolve continuously according to a system of ordinary differential equations. The results reveal distinct nLZ complexity signatures for each node type: homophilic nodes exhibit consistently rising complexity, reflecting increasingly unpredictable opinion shifts that are counterintuitive given their tendency for similarity; neophilic nodes maintain low and stable complexity, suggesting that openness to novelty can, surprisingly, lead to stable opinion dynamics; and conformic nodes display a U-shaped complexity trend, transitioning from early opinion stagnation to later unpredictability. In fully heterogeneous networks, modest interaction effects emerge, with slight shifts in the unpredictability of each faction's trajectories. These findings underscore the importance of temporal analysis in uncovering hidden dynamical patterns, offering novel insights into the mechanisms underlying social adaptation and polarization.</p></details> |  |

Typically such approaches operate by computing $\tilde{N}$ perturbed rollouts around the nominal dynamics to estimate the collision risk associated with a sequence of control commands. We consider a setting where it is expensive to estimate risk using perturbed rollouts, for example, due to expensive collision-checks. We put forward two key contributions. First, we develop an algorithm that distills the statistical information from a larger set of rollouts to a reduced-set with sample size $N<<\tilde{N}$. Consequently, we estimate collision risk using just $N$ rollouts instead of $\tilde{N}$. Second, we formulate a novel surrogate for the collision risk that can leverage the distilled statistical information contained in the reduced-set. We formalize both algorithmic contributions using distribution embedding in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). We perform extensive benchmarking to demonstrate that our MMD-based approach leads to safer trajectories at low sample regime than existing baselines using Conditional Value-at Risk (CVaR) based collision risk estimate.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/Basant1861/MPC-MMD</p></details> |

The existing trajectory planners that account for the robot's physical geometry severely suffer from the intractable runtime. To achieve both computational efficiency and Continuous Collision Avoidance (CCA) of arbitrary-shaped ground robot planning, we proposed a novel coarse-to-fine navigation framework that significantly accelerates planning. In the first stage, a sampling-based method selectively generates distinct topological paths that guarantee a minimum inflated margin. In the second stage, a geometry-aware front-end strategy is designed to discretize these topologies into full-state robot motion sequences while concurrently partitioning the paths into SE(2) sub-problems and simpler R2 sub-problems for back-end optimization. In the final stage, an SVSDF-based optimizer generates trajectories tailored to these sub-problems and seamlessly splices them into a continuous final motion plan. Extensive benchmark comparisons show that the proposed method is one to several orders of magnitude faster than the cutting-edge methods in runtime while maintaining a high planning success rate and ensuring CCA.</p></details> |  |

Existing hand trajectory prediction (HTP) methods forecast the future hand waypoints in 3D space conditioned on past egocentric observations. However, such models are only designed to accommodate 2D egocentric video inputs. There is a lack of awareness of multimodal environmental information from both 2D and 3D observations, hindering the further improvement of 3D HTP performance. In addition, these models overlook the synergy between hand movements and headset camera egomotion, either predicting hand trajectories in isolation or encoding egomotion only from past frames. To address these limitations, we propose novel diffusion models (MMTwin) for multimodal 3D hand trajectory prediction. MMTwin is designed to absorb multimodal information as input encompassing 2D RGB images, 3D point clouds, past hand waypoints, and text prompt. Besides, two latent diffusion models, the egomotion diffusion and the HTP diffusion as twins, are integrated into MMTwin to predict camera egomotion and future hand trajectories concurrently. We propose a novel hybrid Mamba-Transformer module as the denoising model of the HTP diffusion to better fuse multimodal features. The experimental results on three publicly available datasets and our self-recorded data demonstrate that our proposed MMTwin can predict plausible future 3D hand trajectories compared to the state-of-the-art baselines, and generalizes well to unseen environments. The code and pretrained models will be released at https://github.com/IRMVLab/MMTwin.</p></details> |  |

In particular, reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in the synthesis of controllers for systems with complex dynamics and modest online compute budgets. However, the poor sample efficiency of RL and the challenges of reward design make training slow and sometimes unstable, especially for high-dimensional systems. In this work, we leverage the inherent Lie group symmetries of robotic systems with a floating base to mitigate these challenges when learning tracking controllers. We model a general tracking problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) that captures the evolution of both the physical and reference states. Next, we prove that symmetry in the underlying dynamics and running costs leads to an MDP homomorphism, a mapping that allows a policy trained on a lower-dimensional "quotient" MDP to be lifted to an optimal tracking controller for the original system. We compare this symmetry-informed approach to an unstructured baseline, using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to learn tracking controllers for three systems: the Particle (a forced point mass), the Astrobee (a fullyactuated space robot), and the Quadrotor (an underactuated system). Results show that a symmetry-aware approach both accelerates training and reduces tracking error at convergence.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first three authors contributed equally to this work.

The challenge is to compute near-optimal sensor placements for detecting targets whose trajectories follow a log-Gaussian Cox line process. We explore sensor deployment in a transformed space, where linear target trajectories are represented as points. While this space simplifies handling the line process, the spatial functions representing sensor performance (i.e. probability of detection) become less intuitive. To illustrate our approach, we focus on positioning sensors of the barrier coverage system on the seafloor to detect passing ships. Through numerical experiments using historical ship data, we compute sensor locations that maximize the probability all ship passing over the barrier coverage system are detected.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work is published in IEEE SysCon 2025</p></details> |
| **[Visual Trajectory Prediction of Vessels for Inland Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00599v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The future of inland navigation increasingly relies on autonomous systems and remote operations, emphasizing the need for accurate vessel trajectory prediction. This study addresses the challenges of video-based vessel tracking and prediction by integrating advanced object detection methods, Kalman filters, and spline-based interpolation. However, existing detection systems often misclassify objects in inland waterways due to complex surroundings. A comparative evaluation of tracking algorithms, including BoT-SORT, Deep OC-SORT, and ByeTrack, highlights the robustness of the Kalman filter in providing smoothed trajectories. Experimental results from diverse scenarios demonstrate improved accuracy in predicting vessel movements, which is essential for collision avoidance and situational awareness. The findings underline the necessity of customized datasets and models for inland navigation. Future work will expand the datasets and incorporate vessel classification to refine predictions, supporting both autonomous systems and human operators in complex environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[ParkDiffusion: Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Multi-Modal Trajectory Prediction for Automated Parking using Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00586v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated parking is a critical feature of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), where accurate trajectory prediction is essential to bridge perception and planning modules. Despite its significance, research in this domain remains relatively limited, with most existing studies concentrating on single-modal trajectory prediction of vehicles. In this work, we propose ParkDiffusion, a novel approach that predicts the trajectories of both vehicles and pedestrians in automated parking scenarios. ParkDiffusion employs diffusion models to capture the inherent uncertainty and multi-modality of future trajectories, incorporating several key innovations. First, we propose a dual map encoder that processes soft semantic cues and hard geometric constraints using a two-step cross-attention mechanism. Second, we introduce an adaptive agent type embedding module, which dynamically conditions the prediction process on the distinct characteristics of vehicles and pedestrians. Third, to ensure kinematic feasibility, our model outputs control signals that are subsequently used within a kinematic framework to generate physically feasible trajectories. We evaluate ParkDiffusion on the Dragon Lake Parking (DLP) dataset and the Intersections Drone (inD) dataset. Our work establishes a new baseline for heterogeneous trajectory prediction in parking scenarios, outperforming existing methods by a considerable margin.</p></details> |  |
| **[PPT: Pretraining with Pseudo-Labeled Trajectories for Motion Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06491v2)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately predicting how agents move in dynamic scenes is essential for safe autonomous driving. State-of-the-art motion forecasting models rely on large curated datasets with manually annotated or heavily post-processed trajectories. However, building these datasets is costly, generally manual, hard to scale, and lacks reproducibility. They also introduce domain gaps that limit generalization across environments. We introduce PPT (Pretraining with Pseudo-labeled Trajectories), a simple and scalable alternative that uses unprocessed and diverse trajectories automatically generated from off-the-shelf 3D detectors and tracking. Unlike traditional pipelines aiming for clean, single-label annotations, PPT embraces noise and diversity as useful signals for learning robust representations. With optional finetuning on a small amount of labeled data, models pretrained with PPT achieve strong performance across standard benchmarks particularly in low-data regimes, and in cross-domain, end-to-end and multi-class settings. PPT is easy to implement and improves generalization in motion forecasting. Code and data will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 9 figures, updated results</p></details> |
| **[Stable Trajectory Clustering: An Efficient Split and Merge Algorithm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21808v1)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clustering algorithms group data points by characteristics to identify patterns. Over the past two decades, researchers have extended these methods to analyze trajectories of humans, animals, and vehicles, studying their behavior and movement across applications. This paper presents whole-trajectory clustering and sub-trajectory clustering algorithms based on DBSCAN line segment clustering, which encompasses two key events: split and merge of line segments. The events are employed by object movement history and the average Euclidean distance between line segments. In this framework, whole-trajectory clustering considers entire entities' trajectories, whereas sub-trajectory clustering employs a sliding window model to identify similar sub-trajectories. Many existing trajectory clustering algorithms respond to temporary anomalies in data by splitting trajectories, which often obscures otherwise consistent clustering patterns and leads to less reliable insights. We introduce the stable trajectory clustering algorithm, which leverages the mean absolute deviation concept to demonstrate that selective omission of transient deviations not only preserves the integrity of clusters but also improves their stability and interpretability. We run all proposed algorithms on real trajectory datasets to illustrate their effectiveness and sensitivity to parameter variations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Iterative Trajectory Exploration for Multimodal Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21561v1)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal agents, which integrate a controller (e.g., a large language model) with external tools, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in tackling complex tasks. However, existing agents need to collect a large number of expert data for fine-tuning to adapt to new environments. In this paper, we propose an online self-exploration method for multimodal agents, namely SPORT, via step-wise preference optimization to refine the trajectories of agents, which automatically generates tasks and learns from solving the generated tasks, without any expert annotation. SPORT operates through four iterative components: task synthesis, step sampling, step verification, and preference tuning. First, we synthesize multi-modal tasks using language models. Then, we introduce a novel search scheme, where step sampling and step verification are executed alternately to solve each generated task. We employ a verifier to provide AI feedback to construct step-wise preference data. The data is subsequently used to update the controller's policy through preference tuning, producing a SPORT Agent. By interacting with real environments, the SPORT Agent evolves into a more refined and capable system. Evaluation in the GTA and GAIA benchmarks show that the SPORT Agent achieves 6.41\% and 3.64\% improvements, underscoring the generalization and effectiveness introduced by our method.

Despite their utility in advancing digital automation, a critical bottleneck persists: collecting high-quality trajectory data for training. Common practices for collecting such data rely on human supervision or synthetic data generation through executing pre-defined tasks, which are either resource-intensive or unable to guarantee data quality. Moreover, these methods suffer from limited data diversity and significant gaps between synthetic data and real-world environments. To address these challenges, we propose OS-Genesis, a novel GUI data synthesis pipeline that reverses the conventional trajectory collection process. Instead of relying on pre-defined tasks, OS-Genesis enables agents first to perceive environments and perform step-wise interactions, then retrospectively derive high-quality tasks to enable trajectory-level exploration. A trajectory reward model is then employed to ensure the quality of the generated trajectories. We demonstrate that training GUI agents with OS-Genesis significantly improves their performance on highly challenging online benchmarks. In-depth analysis further validates OS-Genesis's efficiency and its superior data quality and diversity compared to existing synthesis methods. Our codes, data, and checkpoints are available at https://qiushisun.github.io/OS-Genesis-Home/.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[Estimation-Aware Trajectory Optimization with Set-Valued Measurement Uncertainties](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09192v2)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, an optimization-based framework for generating estimation-aware trajectories is presented. In this setup, measurement (output) uncertainties are state-dependent and set-valued. Enveloping ellipsoids are employed to characterize state-dependent uncertainties with unknown distributions. The concept of regularity for set-valued output maps is then introduced, facilitating the formulation of the estimation-aware trajectory generation problem. Specifically, it is demonstrated that for output-regular maps, one can utilize a set-valued observability measure that is concave with respect to the finite horizon state trajectories. By maximizing this measure, estimation-aware trajectories can then be synthesized for a broad class of systems. Trajectory planning routines are also examined in this work, by which the observability measure is optimized for systems with locally linearized dynamics. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, representative examples in the context of trajectory planning with vision-based estimation are presented. Moreover, the paper presents estimation-aware planning for an uncooperative Target-Rendezvous problem, where an Ego-satellite employs an onboard machine learning (ML)-based estimation module to realize the rendezvous trajectory.</p></details> | 40 pages, 9 figures |

This paper addresses the optimization of the dynamic time-splitting ratio and flight trajectory for a communication system linking a ground base station to the UAV equipped with backscatter devices (referred to as UB), and from UB to an end user. Given the inherent non-convexity of the problem, we develop two meta-heuristic-based approaches inspired by genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization to enhance the total achievable rate while reducing computational complexity. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of these meta-heuristic solutions, showcasing significant improvements in the achievable rate and computation time compared to existing benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 5 figures.

Specifically, we use the Fr\'{e}chet mean, and metrics based on the optimal sub-pattern assignment (OSPA) construct, to extend the notion of average from vectors to trajectories and multi-object trajectories. Further, we develop efficient algorithms to compute these means using greedy search and Gibbs sampling. Using distributed multi-object tracking as an application, we demonstrate that the Fr\'{e}chet mean approach to multi-object trajectory consensus significantly outperforms state-of-the-art distributed multi-object tracking methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving trajectory continuity in drone-based crowd monitoring using a set of minimal-cost techniques and deep discriminative correlation filters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20234v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Drone-based crowd monitoring is the key technology for applications in surveillance, public safety, and event management. However, maintaining tracking continuity and consistency remains a significant challenge. Traditional detection-assignment tracking methods struggle with false positives, false negatives, and frequent identity switches, leading to degraded counting accuracy and making in-depth analysis impossible. This paper introduces a point-oriented online tracking algorithm that improves trajectory continuity and counting reliability in drone-based crowd monitoring. Our method builds on the Simple Online and Real-time Tracking (SORT) framework, replacing the original bounding-box assignment with a point-distance metric. The algorithm is enhanced with three cost-effective techniques: camera motion compensation, altitude-aware assignment, and classification-based trajectory validation. Further, Deep Discriminative Correlation Filters (DDCF) that re-use spatial feature maps from localisation algorithms for increased computational efficiency through neural network resource sharing are integrated to refine object tracking by reducing noise and handling missed detections. The proposed method is evaluated on the DroneCrowd and newly shared UP-COUNT-TRACK datasets, demonstrating substantial improvements in tracking metrics, reducing counting errors to 23% and 15%, respectively. The results also indicate a significant reduction of identity switches while maintaining high tracking accuracy, outperforming baseline online trackers and even an offline greedy optimisation method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint submitted to the Expert Systems with Applications journal</p></details> |
| **[Kinodynamic Trajectory Following with STELA: Simultaneous Trajectory Estimation & Local Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20009v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State estimation and control are often addressed separately, leading to unsafe execution due to sensing noise, execution errors, and discrepancies between the planning model and reality. Simultaneous control and trajectory estimation using probabilistic graphical models has been proposed as a unified solution to these challenges. Previous work, however, relies heavily on appropriate Gaussian priors and is limited to holonomic robots with linear time-varying models. The current research extends graphical optimization methods to vehicles with arbitrary dynamical models via Simultaneous Trajectory Estimation and Local Adaptation (STELA). The overall approach initializes feasible trajectories using a kinodynamic, sampling-based motion planner. Then, it simultaneously: (i) estimates the past trajectory based on noisy observations, and (ii) adapts the controls to be executed to minimize deviations from the planned, feasible trajectory, while avoiding collisions. The proposed factor graph representation of trajectories in STELA can be applied for any dynamical system given access to first or second-order state update equations, and introduces the duration of execution between two states in the trajectory discretization as an optimization variable. These features provide both generalization and flexibility in trajectory following. In addition to targeting computational efficiency, the proposed strategy performs incremental updates of the factor graph using the iSAM algorithm and introduces a time-window mechanism. This mechanism allows the factor graph to be dynamically updated to operate over a limited history and forward horizon of the planned trajectory. This enables online updates of controls at a minimum of 10Hz. Experiments demonstrate that STELA achieves at least comparable performance to previous frameworks on idealized vehicles with linear dynamics.[...]</p></details> | [Accepted] RSS 2025 |
| **[Towards Ball Spin and Trajectory Analysis in Table Tennis Broadcast Videos via Physically Grounded Synthetic-to-Real Transfer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19863v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Analyzing a player's technique in table tennis requires knowledge of the ball's 3D trajectory and spin. While, the spin is not directly observable in standard broadcasting videos, we show that it can be inferred from the ball's trajectory in the video. We present a novel method to infer the initial spin and 3D trajectory from the corresponding 2D trajectory in a video. Without ground truth labels for broadcast videos, we train a neural network solely on synthetic data. Due to the choice of our input data representation, physically correct synthetic training data, and using targeted augmentations, the network naturally generalizes to real data. Notably, these simple techniques are sufficient to achieve generalization. No real data at all is required for training. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to present a method for spin and trajectory prediction in simple monocular broadcast videos, achieving an accuracy of 92.0% in spin classification and a 2D reprojection error of 0.19% of the image diagonal.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in 2025 IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (CVPRW)</p></details> |

However, existing methods face robotic hardware dependency and control frequency mismatches between teleoperation devices and robotic platforms. Our approach automatically extracts kinematic parameters from unified robot description format (URDF) files, and enables pluggable deployment across diverse robots through uniform interfaces. The proposed interpolation algorithm bridges the frequency gap between low-rate human inputs and high-frequency robotic control commands through online continuous trajectory generation, \n{while requiring no access to the closed, bottom-level control loop}. To enhance trajectory smoothness, we introduce a minimum-stretch spline that optimizes the motion quality. The system further provides precision and rapid modes to accommodate different task requirements. Experiments across various robotic platforms including dual-arm ones demonstrate generality and smooth operation performance of our methods. The code is developed in C++ with python interface, and available at https://github.com/IRMV-Manipulation-Group/UTTG.</p></details> |  |

Existing deep generative models learn from real trajectories to generate synthetic ones. Despite the progress, most of them suffer from training stability issues and scale poorly with increasing data size. More importantly, they often lack control mechanisms to guide the generated trajectories under constraints such as enforcing specific visits. To address these limitations, we formally define the controlled trajectory generation problem for effectively handling multiple spatiotemporal constraints. We introduce Geo-Llama, a novel LLM finetuning framework that can enforce multiple explicit visit constraints while maintaining contextual coherence of the generated trajectories. In this approach, pre-trained LLMs are fine-tuned on trajectory data with a visit-wise permutation strategy where each visit corresponds to a specific time and location. This strategy enables the model to capture spatiotemporal patterns regardless of visit orders while maintaining flexible and in-context constraint integration through prompts during generation. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets validate the effectiveness of Geo-Llama, demonstrating its versatility and robustness in handling a broad range of constraints to generate more realistic trajectories compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |

Traditional modular methods suffer from error propagation, while existing end-to-end models typically employ static one-shot inference paradigms that inadequately capture the dynamic changes of the environment. ARTEMIS takes a different method by generating trajectory waypoints sequentially, preserves critical temporal dependencies while dynamically routing scene-specific queries to specialized expert networks. It effectively relieves trajectory quality degradation issues encountered when guidance information is ambiguous, and overcomes the inherent representational limitations of singular network architectures when processing diverse driving scenarios. Additionally, we use a lightweight batch reallocation strategy that significantly improves the training speed of the Mixture-of-Experts model. Through experiments on the NAVSIM dataset, ARTEMIS exhibits superior competitive performance, achieving 87.0 PDMS and 83.1 EPDMS with ResNet-34 backbone, demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on multiple metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[An End-to-End Framework for Optimizing Foot Trajectory and Force in Dry Adhesion Legged Wall-Climbing Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19448v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foot trajectory planning for dry adhesion legged climbing robots presents challenges, as the phases of foot detachment, swing, and adhesion significantly influence the adhesion and detachment forces essential for stable climbing. To tackle this, an end-to-end foot trajectory and force optimization framework (FTFOF) is proposed, which optimizes foot adhesion and detachment forces through trajectory adjustments. This framework accepts general foot trajectory constraints and user-defined parameters as input, ultimately producing an optimal single foot trajectory. It integrates three-segment $C^2$ continuous Bezier curves, tailored to various foot structures, enabling the generation of effective climbing trajectories. A dilate-based GRU predictive model establishes the relationship between foot trajectories and the corresponding foot forces. Multi-objective optimization algorithms, combined with a redundancy hierarchical strategy, identify the most suitable foot trajectory for specific tasks, thereby ensuring optimal performance across detachment force, adhesion force and vibration amplitude. Experimental validation on the quadruped climbing robot MST-M3F showed that, compared to commonly used trajectories in existing legged climbing robots, the proposed framework achieved reductions in maximum detachment force by 28 \%, vibration amplitude by 82 \%, which ensures the stable climbing of dry adhesion legged climbing robots.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Planning with Model Predictive Control for Obstacle Avoidance Considering Prediction Uncertainty](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19193v1)** | 2025-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a novel trajectory planner for autonomous robots, specifically designed to enhance navigation by incorporating dynamic obstacle avoidance within the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS2) and Navigation 2 (Nav2) framework. The proposed method utilizes Model Predictive Control (MPC) with a focus on handling the uncertainties associated with the movement prediction of dynamic obstacles. Unlike existing Nav2 trajectory planners which primarily deal with static obstacles or react to the current position of dynamic obstacles, this planner predicts future obstacle positions using a stochastic Vector Auto-Regressive Model (VAR). The obstacles' future positions are represented by probability distributions, and collision avoidance is achieved through constraints based on the Mahalanobis distance, ensuring the robot avoids regions where obstacles are likely to be. This approach considers the robot's kinodynamic constraints, enabling it to track a reference path while adapting to real-time changes in the environment. The paper details the implementation, including obstacle prediction, tracking, and the construction of feasible sets for MPC. Simulation results in a Gazebo environment demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in scenarios where robots must navigate around each other, showing improved collision avoidance capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted to IFAC for publication under a Creative Commons Licence CC-BY-NC-ND</p></details> |

Therefore, fin-driven autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) can achieve high maneuverability with a smaller number of actuators, but their control is challenging. This study proposes an analytic control allocation method for underactuated Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs). By integrating an adaptive hybrid feedback controller, we enable an AUV with 4 actuators to move in 6 degrees of freedom (DOF) in simulation and up to 5-DOF in real-world experiments. The proposed method outperformed state-of-the-art control allocation techniques in 6-DOF trajectory tracking simulations, exhibiting centimeter-scale accuracy and higher energy and computational efficiency. Real-world pool experiments confirmed the method's robustness and efficacy in tracking complex 3D trajectories, with significant computational efficiency gains 0.007 (ms) vs. 22.28 (ms). Our method offers a balance between performance, energy efficiency, and computational efficiency, showcasing a potential avenue for more effective tracking of a large number of DOF for under-actuated underwater robots.</p></details> |  |

These seek to answer a fundamental question: What can we learn from time series measurements of a complex dynamical system? For small systems interacting with external environments, the effective dynamics are inherently stochastic, making it crucial to properly manage noise in data. Here, we explore this for systems obeying Langevin dynamics and, using currents, we construct a learning framework for stochastic modeling. Currents have recently gained increased attention for their role in bounding entropy production (EP) from thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs). We introduce a fundamental relationship between the cumulant currents there and standard machine-learning loss functions. Using this, we derive loss functions for several key thermodynamic functions directly from the system dynamics without the (common) intermediate step of deriving a TUR. These loss functions reproduce results derived both from TURs and other methods. More significantly, they open a path to discover new loss functions for previously inaccessible quantities. Notably, this includes access to per-trajectory entropy production, even if the observed system is driven far from its steady-state. We also consider higher order estimation. Our method is straightforward and unifies dynamic inference with recent approaches to entropy production estimation. Taken altogether, this reveals a deep connection between diffusion models in machine learning and entropy production estimation in stochastic thermodynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 appendices (10 pages), 4 figures; https://csc.ucdavis.edu/~cmg/compmech/pubs/currents.htm</p></details> |
| **[DDAT: Diffusion Policies Enforcing Dynamically Admissible Robot Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15043v2)** | 2025-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models excel at creating images and videos thanks to their multimodal generative capabilities. These same capabilities have made diffusion models increasingly popular in robotics research, where they are used for generating robot motion. However, the stochastic nature of diffusion models is fundamentally at odds with the precise dynamical equations describing the feasible motion of robots. Hence, generating dynamically admissible robot trajectories is a challenge for diffusion models. To alleviate this issue, we introduce DDAT: Diffusion policies for Dynamically Admissible Trajectories to generate provably admissible trajectories of black-box robotic systems using diffusion models. A sequence of states is a dynamically admissible trajectory if each state of the sequence belongs to the reachable set of its predecessor by the robot's equations of motion. To generate such trajectories, our diffusion policies project their predictions onto a dynamically admissible manifold during both training and inference to align the objective of the denoiser neural network with the dynamical admissibility constraint. The auto-regressive nature of these projections along with the black-box nature of robot dynamics render these projections immensely challenging. We thus enforce admissibility by iteratively sampling a polytopic under-approximation of the reachable set of a state onto which we project its predicted successor, before iterating this process with the projected successor. By producing accurate trajectories, this projection eliminates the need for diffusion models to continually replan, enabling one-shot long-horizon trajectory planning. We demonstrate that our framework generates higher quality dynamically admissible robot trajectories through extensive simulations on a quadcopter and various MuJoCo environments, along with real-world experiments on a Unitree GO1 and GO2.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Unified Longitudinal Trajectory Dataset for Automated Vehicle](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00009v2)** | 2025-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated Vehicles (AVs) promise significant advances in transportation. Critical to these improvements is understanding AVs' longitudinal behavior, relying heavily on real-world trajectory data. Existing open-source trajectory datasets of AV, however, often fall short in refinement, reliability, and completeness, hindering effective performance metrics analysis and model development. This study addresses these challenges by creating a Unified Longitudinal TRAjectory dataset for AVs (Ultra-AV) to analyze their microscopic longitudinal driving behaviors. This dataset compiles data from 13 distinct sources, encompassing various AV types, test sites, and experiment scenarios. We established a three-step data processing: 1. extraction of longitudinal trajectory data, 2. general data cleaning, and 3. data-specific cleaning to obtain the longitudinal trajectory data and car-following trajectory data. The validity of the processed data is affirmed through performance evaluations across safety, mobility, stability, and sustainability, along with an analysis of the relationships between variables in car-following models. Our work not only furnishes researchers with standardized data and metrics for longitudinal AV behavior studies but also sets guidelines for data collection and model development.</p></details> | NA |
| **[Enhancing System Self-Awareness and Trust of AI: A Case Study in Trajectory Prediction and Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18421v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the trajectory planning of automated driving, data-driven statistical artificial intelligence (AI) methods are increasingly established for predicting the emergent behavior of other road users. While these methods achieve exceptional performance in defined datasets, they usually rely on the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) assumption and thus tend to be vulnerable to distribution shifts that occur in the real world. In addition, these methods lack explainability due to their black box nature, which poses further challenges in terms of the approval process and social trustworthiness. Therefore, in order to use the capabilities of data-driven statistical AI methods in a reliable and trustworthy manner, the concept of TrustMHE is introduced and investigated in this paper.

While many data-driven approaches aim to learn system dynamics, jointly predicting internal loads and system trajectories remains a key challenge. This dual prediction is especially important for fault detection and predictive maintenance, where internal loads-such as contact forces-act as early indicators of faults, reflecting wear or misalignment before affecting motion. These forces also serve as inputs to degradation models (e.g., crack growth), enabling damage prediction and remaining useful life estimation. We propose Equi-Euler GraphNet, a physics-informed graph neural network (GNN) that simultaneously predicts internal forces and global trajectories in multi-body systems. In this mesh-free framework, nodes represent system components and edges encode interactions. Equi-Euler GraphNet introduces two inductive biases: (1) an equivariant message-passing scheme, interpreting edge messages as interaction forces consistent under Euclidean transformations; and (2) a temporal-aware iterative node update mechanism, based on Euler integration, to capture influence of distant interactions over time. Tailored for cylindrical roller bearings, it decouples ring dynamics from constrained motion of rolling elements. Trained on high-fidelity multiphysics simulations, Equi-Euler GraphNet generalizes beyond the training distribution, accurately predicting loads and trajectories under unseen speeds, loads, and configurations. It outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs focused on trajectory prediction, delivering stable rollouts over thousands of time steps with minimal error accumulation. Achieving up to a 200x speedup over conventional solvers while maintaining comparable accuracy, it serves as an efficient reduced-order model for digital twins, design, and maintenance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Reupl...</summary><p>Reuploaded with new version-- equation 16 was incorrect</p></details> |

However, due to localization errors/uncertainties, trajectory deconfliction can fail even if trajectories are perfectly shared between agents. To address this issue, we first present PARM and PARM*, perception-aware, decentralized, asynchronous multiagent trajectory planners that enable a team of agents to navigate uncertain environments while deconflicting trajectories and avoiding obstacles using perception information. PARM* differs from PARM as it is less conservative, using more computation to find closer-to-optimal solutions. While these methods achieve state-of-the-art performance, they suffer from high computational costs as they need to solve large optimization problems onboard, making it difficult for agents to replan at high rates. To overcome this challenge, we present our second key contribution, PRIMER, a learning-based planner trained with imitation learning (IL) using PARM* as the expert demonstrator. PRIMER leverages the low computational requirements at deployment of neural networks and achieves a computation speed up to 5500 times faster than optimization-based approaches.</p></details> | 7 pages, 3 figures |

However, they have seen limited application in real-world robotics tasks such as trajectory optimization. This is due to the difficulty in reasoning about collisions in radiance models and the computational complexity associated with operating in dense models. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing SPLANNING, a risk-aware trajectory optimizer operating in a Gaussian Splatting model. This paper first derives a method to rigorously upper-bound the probability of collision between a robot and a radiance field. Then, this paper introduces a normalized reformulation of Gaussian Splatting that enables efficient computation of this collision bound. Finally, this paper presents a method to optimize trajectories that avoid collisions in a Gaussian Splat. Experiments show that SPLANNING outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generating collision-free trajectories in cluttered environments. The proposed system is also tested on a real-world robot manipulator.

While these systems offer unprecedented efficiency in transporting people and goods, they rely heavily on computation capability, safety-critical operations such as real-time navigation, environmental sensing, and trajectory tracking--necessitating robust offboard computational support. A widely adopted solution involves offloading these tasks to terrestrial base stations (BSs) along the flight path. However, air-to-ground connectivity is often constrained by spectrum conflicts with terrestrial users, which poses a significant challenge to maintaining reliable task execution. Cognitive radio (CR) techniques offer promising capabilities for dynamic spectrum access, making them a natural fit for addressing this issue. Existing studies often overlook the time-varying nature of BS resources, such as spectrum availability and CPU cycles, which leads to inaccurate trajectory planning, suboptimal offloading success rates, excessive energy consumption, and operational delays. To address these challenges, we propose a trajectory optimization framework for eVTOL swarms that maximizes task offloading success probability while minimizing both energy consumption and resource competition (e.g., spectrum and CPU cycles) with primary terrestrial users. The proposed algorithm integrates a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) model to dynamically estimate BS resource availability and a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to determine optimal offloading decisions, selecting both the BSs and access time windows that align with energy and temporal constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mixed Bernstein-Fourier Approximants for Optimal Trajectory Generation with Periodic Behavior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17969v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient trajectory generation is critical for autonomous systems, yet current numerical methods often struggle to handle periodic behaviors effectively, especially when equidistant time nodes are required. This paper introduces a novel mixed Bernstein-Fourier approximation framework tailored explicitly for optimal motion planning. Our proposed methodology leverages the uniform convergence properties of Bernstein polynomials for nonperiodic behaviors while effectively capturing periodic dynamics through Fourier series. Theoretical results are established, including uniform convergence proofs for approximations of functions, derivatives, and integrals, as well as detailed error bound analyses. We further introduce a regulated least squares approach for determining approximation coefficients, enhancing numerical stability and practical applicability. Within an optimal control context, we establish feasibility and consistency of approximated solutions to their continuous counterparts. We also extend the covector mapping theorem, providing theoretical guarantees for approximating dual variables crucial in verifying the necessary optimality conditions from Pontryagin's Maximum Principle. Comprehensive numerical examples illustrate the method's superior performance, demonstrating substantial improvements in computational efficiency and precision in scenarios with complex periodic constraints and dynamics. Our mixed Bernstein-Fourier methodology thus presents a robust, theoretically grounded, and computationally efficient approach for advanced optimal trajectory planning in autonomous systems.</p></details> | 49 pages, 9 figures |

However, predictive modeling of such data remains challenging due to high dimensionality, irregular sampling, and data sparsity. To address these issues, we propose ImageFlowNet, a novel model designed to forecast disease trajectories from initial images while preserving spatial details. ImageFlowNet first learns multiscale joint representation spaces across patients and time points, then optimizes deterministic or stochastic flow fields within these spaces using a position-parameterized neural ODE/SDE framework. The model leverages a UNet architecture to create robust multiscale representations and mitigates data scarcity by combining knowledge from all patients. We provide theoretical insights that support our formulation of ODEs, and motivate our regularizations involving high-level visual features, latent space organization, and trajectory smoothness. We validate ImageFlowNet on three longitudinal medical image datasets depicting progression in geographic atrophy, multiple sclerosis, and glioblastoma, demonstrating its ability to effectively forecast disease progression and outperform existing methods. Our contributions include the development of ImageFlowNet, its theoretical underpinnings, and empirical validation on real-world datasets. The official implementation is available at https://github.com/KrishnaswamyLab/ImageFlowNet.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICASS...</summary><p>ICASSP 2025, Oral Presentation</p></details> |

Operating in such settings presents many challenges -- most notably, because the agent cannot predict the ground-truth future paths of obstacles, a previously planned trajectory can become unsafe at any moment, requiring rapid replanning to avoid collisions. Recently developed planners have used soft-constraint approaches to achieve the necessary fast computation times; however, these methods do not guarantee collision-free paths even with static obstacles. In contrast, hard-constraint methods ensure collision-free safety, but typically have longer computation times. To address these issues, we propose three key contributions. First, the DYNUS Global Planner (DGP) and Temporal Safe Corridor Generation operate in spatio-temporal space and handle both static and dynamic obstacles in the 3D environment. Second, the Safe Planning Framework leverages a combination of exploratory, safe, and contingency trajectories to flexibly re-route when potential future collisions with dynamic obstacles are detected. Finally, the Fast Hard-Constraint Local Trajectory Formulation uses a variable elimination approach to reduce the problem size and enable faster computation by pre-computing dependencies between free and dependent variables while still ensuring collision-free trajectories. We evaluated DYNUS in a variety of simulations, including dense forests, confined office spaces, cave systems, and dynamic environments. Our experiments show that DYNUS achieves a success rate of 100% and travel times that are approximately 25.0% faster than state-of-the-art methods. We also evaluated DYNUS on multiple platforms -- a quadrotor, a wheeled robot, and a quadruped -- in both simulation and hardware experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 30 figures, Under review at IEEE Transactions on Robotics</p></details> |

There is a urgent need to minimize the data size in LLM training. Compared with data selection method, the data distillation method aims to synthesize a small number of data samples to achieve the training effect of the full data set and has better flexibility. Despite its successes in computer vision, the discreteness of text data has hitherto stymied its exploration in natural language processing (NLP). In this work, we proposed a method that involves learning pseudo prompt data based on trajectory matching and finding its nearest neighbor ID to achieve cross-architecture transfer. During the distillation process, we introduce a regularization loss to improve the robustness of our distilled data. To our best knowledge, this is the first data distillation work suitable for text generation tasks such as instruction tuning. Evaluations on two benchmarks, including ARC-Easy and MMLU instruction tuning datasets, established the superiority of our distillation approach over the SOTA data selection method LESS. Furthermore, our method demonstrates a good transferability over LLM structures (i.e., OPT to Llama).</p></details> |  |

Our framework begins by generating panoptic occupancy local semantic maps and accurate localization information from data aligned between a monocular camera, IMU, and GPS. This information is combined with input terrain point clouds or preloaded terrain information to initialize the planning process. We propose the Radiant Field-Informed Coverage Planning algorithm, which utilizes a diffusion field model to dynamically adjust the robot's coverage trajectory and speed based on environmental attributes such as dirtiness and dryness. By modeling the spatial influence of the robot's actions using a Gaussian field, ensures a speed-optimized, uniform coverage trajectory while adapting to varying environmental conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Building Real-time Awareness of Out-of-distribution in Trajectory Prediction for Autonomous Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17277v2)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate trajectory prediction is essential for the safe operation of autonomous vehicles in real-world environments. Even well-trained machine learning models may produce unreliable predictions due to discrepancies between training data and real-world conditions encountered during inference. In particular, the training dataset tends to overrepresent common scenes (e.g., straight lanes) while underrepresenting less frequent ones (e.g., traffic circles). In addition, it often overlooks unpredictable real-world events such as sudden braking or falling objects. To ensure safety, it is critical to detect in real-time when a model's predictions become unreliable. Leveraging the intuition that in-distribution (ID) scenes exhibit error patterns similar to training data, while out-of-distribution (OOD) scenes do not, we introduce a principled, real-time approach for OOD detection by framing it as a change-point detection problem. We address the challenging settings where the OOD scenes are deceptive, meaning that they are not easily detectable by human intuitions. Our lightweight solutions can handle the occurrence of OOD at any time during trajectory prediction inference. Experimental results on multiple real-world datasets using a benchmark trajectory prediction model demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[TraCeS: Trajectory Based Credit Assignment From Sparse Safety Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12557v2)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In safe reinforcement learning (RL), auxiliary safety costs are used to align the agent to safe decision making. In practice, safety constraints, including cost functions and budgets, are unknown or hard to specify, as it requires anticipation of all possible unsafe behaviors. We therefore address a general setting where the true safety definition is unknown, and has to be learned from sparsely labeled data. Our key contributions are: first, we design a safety model that performs credit assignment to estimate each decision step's impact on the overall safety using a dataset of diverse trajectories and their corresponding binary safety labels (i.e., whether the corresponding trajectory is safe/unsafe). Second, we illustrate the architecture of our safety model to demonstrate its ability to learn a separate safety score for each timestep. Third, we reformulate the safe RL problem using the proposed safety model and derive an effective algorithm to optimize a safe yet rewarding policy. Finally, our empirical results corroborate our findings and show that this approach is effective in satisfying unknown safety definition, and scalable to various continuous control tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[SILM: A Subjective Intent Based Low-Latency Framework for Multiple Traffic Participants Joint Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16377v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is a fundamental technology for advanced autonomous driving systems and represents one of the most challenging problems in the field of cognitive intelligence. Accurately predicting the future trajectories of each traffic participant is a prerequisite for building high safety and high reliability decision-making, planning, and control capabilities in autonomous driving. However, existing methods often focus solely on the motion of other traffic participants without considering the underlying intent behind that motion, which increases the uncertainty in trajectory prediction. Autonomous vehicles operate in real-time environments, meaning that trajectory prediction algorithms must be able to process data and generate predictions in real-time. While many existing methods achieve high accuracy, they often struggle to effectively handle heterogeneous traffic scenarios. In this paper, we propose a Subjective Intent-based Low-latency framework for Multiple traffic participants joint trajectory prediction. Our method explicitly incorporates the subjective intent of traffic participants based on their key points, and predicts the future trajectories jointly without map, which ensures promising performance while significantly reducing the prediction latency. Additionally, we introduce a novel dataset designed specifically for trajectory prediction. Related code and dataset will be available soon.</p></details> |  |

As this is a novel task, there is currently no relevant dataset available in the community. To address this gap, we first devised a new visualization language called Trajectory Visualization Language (TVL) to facilitate querying trajectory data and generating visualizations. Building on this foundation, we further proposed a dataset construction method that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with human efforts to create high-quality data. Specifically, we first generate TVLs using a comprehensive and systematic process, and then label each TVL with corresponding natural language questions using LLMs. This process results in the creation of the first large-scale Text-to-TrajVis dataset, named TrajVL, which contains 18,140 (question, TVL) pairs. Based on this dataset, we systematically evaluated the performance of multiple LLMs (GPT, Qwen, Llama, etc.) on this task. The experimental results demonstrate that this task is both feasible and highly challenging and merits further exploration within the research community.</p></details> |  |
| **[DriVerse: Navigation World Model for Driving Simulation via Multimodal Trajectory Prompting and Motion Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18576v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents DriVerse, a generative model for simulating navigation-driven driving scenes from a single image and a future trajectory. Previous autonomous driving world models either directly feed the trajectory or discrete control signals into the generation pipeline, leading to poor alignment between the control inputs and the implicit features of the 2D base generative model, which results in low-fidelity video outputs. Some methods use coarse textual commands or discrete vehicle control signals, which lack the precision to guide fine-grained, trajectory-specific video generation, making them unsuitable for evaluating actual autonomous driving algorithms. DriVerse introduces explicit trajectory guidance in two complementary forms: it tokenizes trajectories into textual prompts using a predefined trend vocabulary for seamless language integration, and converts 3D trajectories into 2D spatial motion priors to enhance control over static content within the driving scene. To better handle dynamic objects, we further introduce a lightweight motion alignment module, which focuses on the inter-frame consistency of dynamic pixels, significantly enhancing the temporal coherence of moving elements over long sequences. With minimal training and no need for additional data, DriVerse outperforms specialized models on future video generation tasks across both the nuScenes and Waymo datasets. The code and models will be released to the public.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Dynamic Intent Queries for Motion Transformer-based Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15766v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In autonomous driving, accurately predicting the movements of other traffic participants is crucial, as it significantly influences a vehicle's planning processes. Modern trajectory prediction models strive to interpret complex patterns and dependencies from agent and map data. The Motion Transformer (MTR) architecture and subsequent work define the most accurate methods in common benchmarks such as the Waymo Open Motion Benchmark. The MTR model employs pre-generated static intention points as initial goal points for trajectory prediction. However, the static nature of these points frequently leads to misalignment with map data in specific traffic scenarios, resulting in unfeasible or unrealistic goal points. Our research addresses this limitation by integrating scene-specific dynamic intention points into the MTR model. This adaptation of the MTR model was trained and evaluated on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset. Our findings demonstrate that incorporating dynamic intention points has a significant positive impact on trajectory prediction accuracy, especially for predictions over long time horizons. Furthermore, we analyze the impact on ground truth trajectories which are not compliant with the map data or are illegal maneuvers.</p></details> |  |
| **[SocialMOIF: Multi-Order Intention Fusion for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15616v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The analysis and prediction of agent trajectories are crucial for decision-making processes in intelligent systems, with precise short-term trajectory forecasting being highly significant across a range of applications. Agents and their social interactions have been quantified and modeled by researchers from various perspectives; however, substantial limitations exist in the current work due to the inherent high uncertainty of agent intentions and the complex higher-order influences among neighboring groups. SocialMOIF is proposed to tackle these challenges, concentrating on the higher-order intention interactions among neighboring groups while reinforcing the primary role of first-order intention interactions between neighbors and the target agent. This method develops a multi-order intention fusion model to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of both direct and indirect intention information. Within SocialMOIF, a trajectory distribution approximator is designed to guide the trajectories toward values that align more closely with the actual data, thereby enhancing model interpretability. Furthermore, a global trajectory optimizer is introduced to enable more accurate and efficient parallel predictions. By incorporating a novel loss function that accounts for distance and direction during training, experimental results demonstrate that the model outperforms previous state-of-the-art baselines across multiple metrics in both dynamic and static datasets.</p></details> | 11 pages,6 figures |
| **[Offline Safe Reinforcement Learning Using Trajectory Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15429v5)** | 2025-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline safe reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach for learning safe behaviors without engaging in risky online interactions with the environment. Most existing methods in offline safe RL rely on cost constraints at each time step (derived from global cost constraints) and this can result in either overly conservative policies or violation of safety constraints. In this paper, we propose to learn a policy that generates desirable trajectories and avoids undesirable trajectories. To be specific, we first partition the pre-collected dataset of state-action trajectories into desirable and undesirable subsets. Intuitively, the desirable set contains high reward and safe trajectories, and undesirable set contains unsafe trajectories and low-reward safe trajectories. Second, we learn a policy that generates desirable trajectories and avoids undesirable trajectories, where (un)desirability scores are provided by a classifier learnt from the dataset of desirable and undesirable trajectories. This approach bypasses the computational complexity and stability issues of a min-max objective that is employed in existing methods. Theoretically, we also show our approach's strong connections to existing learning paradigms involving human feedback. Finally, we extensively evaluate our method using the DSRL benchmark for offline safe RL. Empirically, our method outperforms competitive baselines, achieving higher rewards and better constraint satisfaction across a wide variety of benchmark tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 2025.

Directly mapping camera data to actions via neural networks can result in jerky motions and difficulties in meeting critical constraints, compromising safety and robustness in real-world deployment. For tasks that require high robustness or strict adherence to constraints, ensuring trajectory quality is crucial. However, the lack of interpretability in neural networks makes it challenging to generate constraint-compliant actions in a controlled manner. This paper introduces differentiable policy trajectory optimization with generalizability (DiffOG), a learning-based trajectory optimization framework designed to enhance visuomotor policies. By leveraging the proposed differentiable formulation of trajectory optimization with transformer, DiffOG seamlessly integrates policies with a generalizable optimization layer. Visuomotor policies enhanced by DiffOG generate smoother, constraint-compliant action trajectories in a more interpretable way. DiffOG exhibits strong generalization capabilities and high flexibility. We evaluated DiffOG across 11 simulated tasks and 2 real-world tasks. The results demonstrate that DiffOG significantly enhances the trajectory quality of visuomotor policies while having minimal impact on policy performance, outperforming trajectory processing baselines such as greedy constraint clipping and penalty-based trajectory optimization. Furthermore, DiffOG achieves superior performance compared to existing constrained visuomotor policy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Through Retrospection: Improving Trajectory Prediction for Automated Driving with Error Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13785v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In automated driving, predicting trajectories of surrounding vehicles supports reasoning about scene dynamics and enables safe planning for the ego vehicle. However, existing models handle predictions as an instantaneous task of forecasting future trajectories based on observed information. As time proceeds, the next prediction is made independently of the previous one, which means that the model cannot correct its errors during inference and will repeat them. To alleviate this problem and better leverage temporal data, we propose a novel retrospection technique. Through training on closed-loop rollouts the model learns to use aggregated feedback. Given new observations it reflects on previous predictions and analyzes its errors to improve the quality of subsequent predictions. Thus, the model can learn to correct systematic errors during inference. Comprehensive experiments on nuScenes and Argoverse demonstrate a considerable decrease in minimum Average Displacement Error of up to 31.9% compared to the state-of-the-art baseline without retrospection. We further showcase the robustness of our technique by demonstrating a better handling of out-of-distribution scenarios with undetected road-users.</p></details> |  |

So we present a lightweight multi-modal framework for 3D object detection and trajectory prediction. Our system synergistically integrates LiDAR and camera inputs to achieve real-time perception of pedestrians, vehicles, and riders in 3D space. The framework proposes two novel modules: 1) a Cross-Modal Deformable Transformer (CMDT) for object detection with high accuracy and acceptable amount of computation, and 2) a Reference Trajectory-based Multi-Class Transformer (RTMCT) for efficient and diverse trajectory prediction of mult-class objects with flexible trajectory lengths. Evaluations on the CODa benchmark demonstrate superior performance over existing methods across detection (+2.03% in mAP) and trajectory prediction (-0.408m in minADE5 of pedestrians) metrics. Remarkably, the system exhibits exceptional deployability - when implemented on a wheelchair robot with an entry-level NVIDIA 3060 GPU, it achieves real-time inference at 13.2 fps. To facilitate reproducibility and practical deployment, we release the related code of the method at https://github.com/TossherO/3D_Perception and its ROS inference version at https://github.com/TossherO/ros_packages.</p></details> |  |

However, when given suboptimal task trajectory demonstrations with shape characteristics reflecting human preferences but subpar dynamic attributes such as slow motion, robots not only need to mimic the behaviors but also optimize the dynamic performance. In this work, we leverage optimization-based methods to search for a superior-performing trajectory whose shape is similar to that of the demonstrated trajectory. Specifically, we use Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to quantify the difference between two trajectories and combine it with additional performance metrics, such as collision cost, to construct the cost function. Moreover, we develop a multi-policy version of the Stochastic Trajectory Optimization for Motion Planning (STOMP), called MSTOMP, which is more stable and robust to parameter changes. To deal with the jitter in the demonstrated trajectory, we further utilize the gain-controlling method in the frequency domain to denoise the demonstration and propose a computationally more efficient metric, called Mean Square Error in the Spectrum (MSES), that measures the trajectories' differences in the frequency domain. We also theoretically highlight the connections between the time domain and the frequency domain methods. Finally, we verify our method in both simulation experiments and real-world experiments, showcasing its improved optimization performance and stability compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Estimation of Battery State of Health Using Reference Voltage Trajectory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13324v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate estimation of state of health (SOH) is critical for battery applications. Current model-based SOH estimation methods typically rely on low C-rate constant current tests to extract health parameters like solid phase volume fraction and lithium-ion stoichiometry, which are often impractical in real-world scenarios due to time and operational constraints. Additionally, these methods are susceptible to modeling uncertainties that can significantly degrade the estimation accuracy, especially when jointly estimating multiple parameters. In this paper, we present a novel reference voltage-based method for robust battery SOH estimation. This method utilizes the voltage response of a battery under a predefined current excitation at the beginning of life (BOL) as a reference to compensate for modeling uncertainty. As the battery degrades, the same excitation is applied to generate the voltage response, which is compared with the BOL trajectory to estimate the key health parameters accurately. The current excitation is optimally designed using the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm to maximize the information content of the target parameters. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly improves parameter estimation accuracy under different degradation levels, compared to conventional methods relying only on direct voltage measurements. Furthermore, our method jointly estimates four key SOH parameters in only 10 minutes, making it practical for real-world battery health diagnostics, e.g., fast testing to enable battery repurposing.</p></details> |  |

However, their out-of-distribution generalization remains a significant challenge, particularly due to unbalanced data and a lack of enough data and diversity to ensure robustness and calibration. To address this, we propose SHIFT (Spectral Heteroscedastic Informed Forecasting for Trajectories), a novel framework that uniquely combines well-calibrated uncertainty modeling with informative priors derived through automated rule extraction. SHIFT reformulates trajectory prediction as a classification task and employs heteroscedastic spectral-normalized Gaussian processes to effectively disentangle epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. We learn informative priors from training labels, which are automatically generated from natural language driving rules, such as stop rules and drivability constraints, using a retrieval-augmented generation framework powered by a large language model. Extensive evaluations over the nuScenes dataset, including challenging low-data and cross-location scenarios, demonstrate that SHIFT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving substantial gains in uncertainty calibration and displacement metrics. In particular, our model excels in complex scenarios, such as intersections, where uncertainty is inherently higher.

While concept erasure methods offer a promising solution, existing finetuning-based approaches suffer from notable limitations. Anchor-free methods risk disrupting sampling trajectories, leading to visual artifacts, while anchor-based methods rely on the heuristic selection of anchor concepts. To overcome these shortcomings, we introduce a finetuning framework, dubbed ANT, which Automatically guides deNoising Trajectories to avoid unwanted concepts. ANT is built on a key insight: reversing the condition direction of classifier-free guidance during mid-to-late denoising stages enables precise content modification without sacrificing early-stage structural integrity. This inspires a trajectory-aware objective that preserves the integrity of the early-stage score function field, which steers samples toward the natural image manifold, without relying on heuristic anchor concept selection. For single-concept erasure, we propose an augmentation-enhanced weight saliency map to precisely identify the critical parameters that most significantly contribute to the unwanted concept, enabling more thorough and efficient erasure. For multi-concept erasure, our objective function offers a versatile plug-and-play solution that significantly boosts performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ANT achieves state-of-the-art results in both single and multi-concept erasure, delivering high-quality, safe outputs without compromising the generative fidelity.

This work proposes a flexible language-based framework to adapt generic robotic trajectories produced by off-the-shelf motion planners like RRT, A-star, etc, or learned from human demonstrations. We utilize pre-trained LLMs to adapt trajectory waypoints by generating code as a policy for dense robot manipulation, enabling more complex and flexible instructions than current methods. This approach allows us to incorporate a broader range of commands, including numerical inputs. Compared to state-of-the-art feature-based sequence-to-sequence models which require training, our method does not require task-specific training and offers greater interpretability and more effective feedback mechanisms. We validate our approach through simulation experiments on the robotic manipulator, aerial vehicle, and ground robot in the Pybullet and Gazebo simulation environments, demonstrating that LLMs can successfully adapt trajectories to complex human instructions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CoRL LangRob workshop 2024</p></details> |

Recent score distillation methods distill a heavy teacher model into a student generator to achieve one-step generation, which is optimized by calculating the difference between the two score functions on the samples generated by the student model. However, there is a score mismatch issue in the early stage of the distillation process, because existing methods mainly focus on using the endpoint of pre-trained diffusion models as teacher models, overlooking the importance of the convergence trajectory between the student generator and the teacher model. To address this issue, we extend the score distillation process by introducing the entire convergence trajectory of teacher models and propose Distribution Backtracking Distillation (DisBack). DisBask is composed of two stages: Degradation Recording and Distribution Backtracking. Degradation Recording is designed to obtain the convergence trajectory of the teacher model, which records the degradation path from the trained teacher model to the untrained initial student generator. The degradation path implicitly represents the teacher model's intermediate distributions, and its reverse can be viewed as the convergence trajectory from the student generator to the teacher model. Then Distribution Backtracking trains a student generator to backtrack the intermediate distributions along the path to approximate the convergence trajectory of teacher models. Extensive experiments show that DisBack achieves faster and better convergence than the existing distillation method and accomplishes comparable generation performance, with FID score of 1.38 on ImageNet 64x64 dataset. Notably, DisBack is easy to implement and can be generalized to existing distillation methods to boost performance. Our code is publicly available on https://github.com/SYZhang0805/DisBack.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our c...</summary><p>Our code is publicly available on https://github.com/SYZhang0805/DisBack</p></details> |

In complex environments, like modern 3D video games, distribution shift and stochasticity necessitate robust approaches beyond simple action replay. In this study, we apply Inverse Dynamics Models (IDM) with different encoders and policy heads to trajectory following in a modern 3D video game -- Bleeding Edge. Additionally, we investigate several future alignment strategies that address the distribution shift caused by the aleatoric uncertainty and imperfections of the agent. We measure both the trajectory deviation distance and the first significant deviation point between the reference and the agent's trajectory and show that the optimal configuration depends on the chosen setting. Our results show that in a diverse data setting, a GPT-style policy head with an encoder trained from scratch performs the best, DINOv2 encoder with the GPT-style policy head gives the best results in the low data regime, and both GPT-style and MLP-style policy heads had comparable results when pre-trained on a diverse setting and fine-tuned for a specific behaviour setting.</p></details> |  |
| **[GripMap: An Efficient, Spatially Resolved Constraint Framework for Offline and Online Trajectory Planning in Autonomous Racing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12115v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional trajectory planning approaches for autonomous vehicles often assume a fixed vehicle model that remains constant regardless of the vehicle's location. This overlooks the critical fact that the tires and the surface are the two force-transmitting partners in vehicle dynamics; while the tires stay with the vehicle, surface conditions vary with location. Recognizing these challenges, this paper presents a novel framework for spatially resolving dynamic constraints in both offline and online planning algorithms applied to autonomous racing. We introduce the GripMap concept, which provides a spatial resolution of vehicle dynamic constraints in the Frenet frame, allowing adaptation to locally varying grip conditions. This enables compensation for location-specific effects, more efficient vehicle behavior, and increased safety, unattainable with spatially invariant vehicle models. The focus is on low storage demand and quick access through perfect hashing. This framework proved advantageous in real-world applications in the presented form. Experiments inspired by autonomous racing demonstrate its effectiveness. In future work, this framework can serve as a foundational layer for developing future interpretable learning algorithms that adjust to varying grip conditions in real-time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory-guided Motion Perception for Facial Expression Quality Assessment in Neurological Disorders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09530v2)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated facial expression quality assessment (FEQA) in neurological disorders is critical for enhancing diagnostic accuracy and improving patient care, yet effectively capturing the subtle motions and nuances of facial muscle movements remains a challenge. We propose to analyse facial landmark trajectories, a compact yet informative representation, that encodes these subtle motions from a high-level structural perspective. Hence, we introduce Trajectory-guided Motion Perception Transformer (TraMP-Former), a novel FEQA framework that fuses landmark trajectory features for fine-grained motion capture with visual semantic cues from RGB frames, ultimately regressing the combined features into a quality score. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TraMP-Former achieves new state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets with neurological disorders, including PFED5 (up by 6.51%) and an augmented Toronto NeuroFace (up by 7.62%). Our ablation studies further validate the efficiency and effectiveness of landmark trajectories in FEQA.

| **[Trajectory Encoding Temporal Graph Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11386v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal Graph Networks (TGNs) have demonstrated significant success in dynamic graph tasks such as link prediction and node classification. Both tasks comprise transductive settings, where the model predicts links among known nodes, and in inductive settings, where it generalises learned patterns to previously unseen nodes. Existing TGN designs face a dilemma under these dual scenarios. Anonymous TGNs, which rely solely on temporal and structural information, offer strong inductive generalisation but struggle to distinguish known nodes. In contrast, non-anonymous TGNs leverage node features to excel in transductive tasks yet fail to adapt to new nodes. To address this challenge, we propose Trajectory Encoding TGN (TETGN). Our approach introduces automatically expandable node identifiers (IDs) as learnable temporal positional features and performs message passing over these IDs to capture each node's historical context. By integrating this trajectory-aware module with a standard TGN using multi-head attention, TETGN effectively balances transductive accuracy with inductive generalisation. Experimental results on three real-world datasets show that TETGN significantly outperforms strong baselines on both link prediction and node classification tasks, demonstrating its ability to unify the advantages of anonymous and non-anonymous models for dynamic graph learning.</p></details> |  |

The context itself can be static (lanes, regulatory elements, etc) or dynamic (traffic participants). This paper presents a lane graph-based motion prediction model that first predicts graph-based goal proposals and later fuses them with cross attention over multiple contextual elements. We follow the famous encoder-interactor-decoder architecture where the encoder encodes scene context using lightweight Gated Recurrent Units, the interactor applies cross-context attention over encoded scene features and graph goal proposals, and the decoder regresses multimodal trajectories via Laplacian Mixture Density Network from the aggregated encodings. Using cross-attention over graph-based goal proposals gives robust trajectory estimates since the model learns to attend to future goal-relevant scene elements for the intended agent. We evaluate our work on nuScenes motion prediction dataset, achieving state-of-the-art results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Robust Trajectory Embedding for Similarity Computation: When Triangle Inequality Violations in Distance Metrics Matter](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10933v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory similarity is a cornerstone of trajectory data management and analysis. Traditional similarity functions often suffer from high computational complexity and a reliance on specific distance metrics, prompting a shift towards deep representation learning in Euclidean space. However, existing Euclidean-based trajectory embeddings often face challenges due to the triangle inequality constraints that do not universally hold for trajectory data. To address this issue, this paper introduces a novel approach by incorporating non-Euclidean geometry, specifically hyperbolic space, into trajectory representation learning. We present the first-ever integration of hyperbolic space to resolve the inherent limitations of the triangle inequality in Euclidean embeddings. In particular, we achieve it by designing a Lorentz distance measure, which is proven to overcome triangle inequality constraints. Additionally, we design a model-agnostic framework LH-plugin to seamlessly integrate hyperbolic embeddings into existing representation learning pipelines. This includes a novel projection method optimized with the Cosh function to prevent the diminishment of distances, supported by a theoretical foundation. Furthermore, we propose a dynamic fusion distance that intelligently adapts to variations in triangle inequality constraints across different trajectory pairs, blending Lorentzian and Euclidean distances for more robust similarity calculations. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that our approach effectively enhances the accuracy of trajectory similarity measures in state-of-the-art models across multiple real-world datasets. The LH-plugin not only addresses the triangle inequality issues but also significantly refines the precision of trajectory similarity computations, marking a substantial advancement in the field of trajectory representation learning.</p></details> | 14 pages, 8 figures |

Although predicting the ego-vehicle's path is valuable for driver-assistance systems, existing methods mainly focus on external factors like other vehicles' motions, often neglecting the driver's attention and intent. To address this gap, we infer the ego-trajectory by integrating the driver's gaze and the surrounding scene. We introduce RouteFormer, a novel multimodal ego-trajectory prediction network combining GPS data, environmental context, and the driver's field-of-view, comprising first-person video and gaze fixations. We also present the Path Complexity Index (PCI), a new metric for trajectory complexity that enables a more nuanced evaluation of challenging scenarios. To tackle data scarcity and enhance diversity, we introduce GEM, a comprehensive dataset of urban driving scenarios enriched with synchronized driver field-of-view and gaze data. Extensive evaluations on GEM and DR(eye)VE demonstrate that RouteFormer significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving notable improvements in prediction accuracy across diverse conditions. Ablation studies reveal that incorporating driver field-of-view data yields significantly better average displacement error, especially in challenging scenarios with high PCI scores, underscoring the importance of modeling driver attention.

This paper presents RINGO: Real-time Navigation with a Guiding Trajectory, a novel planning framework that enables aerial manipulators to navigate unknown environments in real time. The proposed method simultaneously considers the positions of both the multi-rotor and the end-effector. A pre-obtained multi-rotor trajectory serves as a guiding reference, allowing the end-effector to generate a smooth, collision-free, and workspace-compatible trajectory. Leveraging the convex hull property of B-spline curves, we theoretically guarantee that the trajectory remains within the reachable workspace. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that enables real-time navigation of aerial manipulators in unknown environments. The simulation and experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method. The proposed method generates less conservative trajectories than approaches that consider only the multi-rotor.</p></details> | 9 pages, 15 figures |
| **[Enhancing Offline Reinforcement Learning with Curriculum Learning-Based Trajectory Valuation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00601v2)** | 2025-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The success of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) relies on the availability and quality of training data, often requiring extensive interactions with specific environments. In many real-world scenarios, where data collection is costly and risky, offline reinforcement learning (RL) offers a solution by utilizing data collected by domain experts and searching for a batch-constrained optimal policy. This approach is further augmented by incorporating external data sources, expanding the range and diversity of data collection possibilities. However, existing offline RL methods often struggle with challenges posed by non-matching data from these external sources. In this work, we specifically address the problem of source-target domain mismatch in scenarios involving mixed datasets, characterized by a predominance of source data generated from random or suboptimal policies and a limited amount of target data generated from higher-quality policies. To tackle this problem, we introduce Transition Scoring (TS), a novel method that assigns scores to transitions based on their similarity to the target domain, and propose Curriculum Learning-Based Trajectory Valuation (CLTV), which effectively leverages these transition scores to identify and prioritize high-quality trajectories through a curriculum learning approach. Our extensive experiments across various offline RL methods and MuJoCo environments, complemented by rigorous theoretical analysis, demonstrate that CLTV enhances the overall performance and transferability of policies learned by offline RL algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAMAS 2025</p></details> |

Traditional assessment tools often fail to fully cover course content, leading to imprecise evaluations of student mastery. To tackle this problem, the study proposes a knowledge graph construction method based on large language models (LLMs), which transforms learning materials into structured data and generates personalized learning trajectory graphs by analyzing students' test data. Experimental results demonstrate that the model effectively alerts teachers to potential biases in their exam questions and tracks individual student progress. This system not only enhances the accuracy of learning assessments but also helps teachers provide timely guidance to students who are falling behind, thereby improving overall teaching strategies.</p></details> |  |

This approach, an upgrade from traditional methods, extends the original algorithm to effectively address 3D perforated surface milling. Unlike conventional algorithms, the method embeds a continuous spiral trajectory within perforated surfaces without requiring cellular decomposition or additional boundaries. The proposed method addresses three primary challenges, including modifying conformal slit mapping for mesh surfaces, maintaining uniform scallop height between adjacent spiral trajectories, and optimizing the mapped origin point to ensure uniform scallop height distribution. To overcome these challenges, surface flattening techniques are incorporated into the original approach to accommodate mesh surfaces effectively. Tool path spacing is then optimized using a binary search strategy to regulate scallop height. A functional energy metric associated with scallop height uniformity is introduced for rapid evaluation of points mapped to the origin, with the minimum functional energy determined through perturbation techniques. The optimal placement of this point is identified using a modified gradient descent approach applied to the energy function. Validation on intricate surfaces, including low-quality and high-genus meshes, verifies the robustness of the algorithm. Surface milling experiments comparing this method with conventional techniques indicate a 15.63% improvement in scallop height uniformity while reducing machining time, average spindle impact, and spindle impact variance by up to 7.36%, 27.79%, and 55.98%, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>The r...</summary><p>The revised manuscript has improved the quality of the figures</p></details> |
| **[IMPACT: Behavioral Intention-aware Multimodal Trajectory Prediction with Adaptive Context Trimming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09103v1)** | 2025-04-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While most prior research has focused on improving the precision of multimodal trajectory predictions, the explicit modeling of multimodal behavioral intentions (e.g., yielding, overtaking) remains relatively underexplored. This paper proposes a unified framework that jointly predicts both behavioral intentions and trajectories to enhance prediction accuracy, interpretability, and efficiency. Specifically, we employ a shared context encoder for both intention and trajectory predictions, thereby reducing structural redundancy and information loss. Moreover, we address the lack of ground-truth behavioral intention labels in mainstream datasets (Waymo, Argoverse) by auto-labeling these datasets, thus advancing the community's efforts in this direction. We further introduce a vectorized occupancy prediction module that infers the probability of each map polyline being occupied by the target vehicle's future trajectory. By leveraging these intention and occupancy prediction priors, our method conducts dynamic, modality-dependent pruning of irrelevant agents and map polylines in the decoding stage, effectively reducing computational overhead and mitigating noise from non-critical elements. Our approach ranks first among LiDAR-free methods on the Waymo Motion Dataset and achieves first place on the Waymo Interactive Prediction Dataset. Remarkably, even without model ensembling, our single-model framework improves the soft mean average precision (softmAP) by 10 percent compared to the second-best method in the Waymo Interactive Prediction Leaderboard. Furthermore, the proposed framework has been successfully deployed on real vehicles, demonstrating its practical effectiveness in real-world applications.</p></details> | under review |

In this paper, we propose a novel method for trajectory synthesis by adapting the Time-Based Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (TimeVQVAE). Our approach leverages time-frequency domain processing, vector quantization, and transformer-based priors to capture both global and local dynamics in flight data. By discretizing the latent space and integrating transformer priors, the model learns long-range spatiotemporal dependencies and preserves coherence across entire flight paths. We evaluate the adapted TimeVQVAE using an extensive suite of quality, statistical, and distributional metrics, as well as a flyability assessment conducted in an open-source air traffic simulator. Results indicate that TimeVQVAE outperforms a temporal convolutional VAE baseline, generating synthetic trajectories that mirror real flight data in terms of spatial accuracy, temporal consistency, and statistical properties. Furthermore, the simulator-based assessment shows that most generated trajectories maintain operational feasibility, although occasional outliers underscore the potential need for additional domain-specific constraints. Overall, our findings underscore the importance of multi-scale representation learning for capturing complex flight behaviors and demonstrate the promise of TimeVQVAE in producing representative synthetic trajectories for downstream tasks such as model training, airspace design, and air traffic forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was presented at the 25th Integrated Communications, Navigation and Surveillance Conference (ICNS 2025), April 8--10, 2025, Brussels, Belgium</p></details> |

Evaluating web agents trajectories is an important problem, since it helps us determine whether the agent successfully completed the tasks. Rule-based methods are widely used for this purpose, but they are challenging to extend to new tasks and may not always recognize successful trajectories. We may achieve higher accuracy through human evaluation, but the process would be substantially slower and more expensive. Automatic evaluations with LLMs may avoid the challenges of designing new rules and manually annotating trajectories, enabling faster and cost-effective evaluation. However, it is unclear how effective they are at evaluating web agents. To this end, we propose AgentRewardBench, the first benchmark to assess the effectiveness of LLM judges for evaluating web agents. AgentRewardBench contains 1302 trajectories across 5 benchmarks and 4 LLMs. Each trajectory in AgentRewardBench is reviewed by an expert, who answers questions pertaining to the success, side effects, and repetitiveness of the agent. Using our benchmark, we evaluate 12 LLM judges and find that no single LLM excels across all benchmarks. We also find that the rule-based evaluation used by common benchmarks tends to underreport the success rate of web agents, highlighting a key weakness of rule-based evaluation and the need to develop more flexible automatic evaluations. We release the benchmark at: https://agent-reward-bench.github.io</p></details> |  |

In This paper, an adaptive transpose Jacobian approach is proposed to deal with the dynamic model complexity, which utilizes an adaptive PI-algorithm to adjust the control gains. The performance of the proposed control algorithm is compared with the conventional transpose Jacobian and sliding mode control algorithms and evaluated by the root mean square of the errors and control input energy criteria. In order to appraise the effectiveness of the proposed control system, simulations are carried out in MATLAB/Simulink software for a quadruped robot leg for semi-elliptical path tracking. The obtained results show that the proposed adaptive transpose Jacobian reduces the overshoot and root mean square of the errors and at the same time, decreases the control input energy. Moreover, transpose Jacobin and adaptive transpose Jacobian are more robust to changes in initial conditions compared to the conventional sliding mode control. Furthermore, sliding mode control performs well up to 20% uncertainties in the parameters due to its model-based nature, whereas the transpose Jacobin and the proposed adaptive transpose Jacobian algorithms show promising results even in higher mass uncertainties.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE Xplore</p></details> |

Thereby, kinematic constraints with respect to velocity, acceleration and jerk are taken into account. The trajectories are composed of several motion primitives, the most crucial of which is termed jerk segment. Within this contribution, the focus is put on the composition of the overall trajectories, assuming the required motion primitives to be readily available. Since the scheme considered is not time-optimal, even decreasing particular constraints can reduce the overall transition time, which is analysed in detail. This observation implies that replanning of the underlying jerk segments is required as an integral part of the motion planning scheme, further insight into which has been analysed in a complementary contribution. Although the proposed scheme is not time-optimal, it allows for significantly shorter transition times than established methods, such as zero-vibration shaping, while requiring significantly lower computational power than a fully time-optimal scheme.</p></details> |  |

The proposed filter, the trajectory measurement PMBM (TM-PMBM) filter, propagates a PMBM density on the set of target states. In prediction, the filter obtains the PMBM density on the set of trajectories over the last two time steps. This density is then updated with the set of trajectory measurements. After the update step, the PMBM posterior on the set of two-step trajectories is marginalised to obtain a PMBM density on the set of target states. The filter provides a closed-form solution for multi-target filtering based on sets of trajectory measurements, estimating the set of target states at the end of each time window. Additionally, the paper proposes computationally lighter alternatives to the TM-PMBM filter by deriving a Poisson multi-Bernoulli (PMB) density through Kullback-Leibler divergence minimisation in an augmented space with auxiliary variables. The performance of the proposed filters are evaluated in a simulation study.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 7 figures, journal paper</p></details> |

Moreover, incorporating prior information input into such perception model represents an effective approach to ensure the robustness and accuracy. However, utilizing diverse sources of prior information still faces three key challenges: the acquisition of high-quality prior information, alignment between prior and online perception, efficient integration. To address these issues, we investigate prior augmentation from a novel perspective of trajectory priors. In this paper, we initially extract crowdsourcing trajectory data from Argoverse2 motion forecasting dataset and encode trajectory data into rasterized heatmap and vectorized instance tokens, then we incorporate such prior information into the online mapping model through different ways. Besides, with the purpose of mitigating the misalignment between prior and online perception, we design a confidence-based fusion module that takes alignment into account during the fusion process. We conduct extensive experiments on OpenLane-V2 dataset. The results indicate that our method's performance significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods.

However, estimating trajectories of brain biomarkers is challenging due to biological variability, inconsistencies in measurement protocols (e.g., differences in MRI scanners), scarcity, and irregularity in longitudinal measurements. Herein, we introduce a novel personalized deep kernel regression framework for forecasting brain biomarkers, with application to regional volumetric measurements. Our approach integrates two key components: a population model that captures brain trajectories from a large and diverse cohort, and a subject-specific model that captures individual trajectories. To optimally combine these, we propose Adaptive Shrinkage Estimation, which effectively balances population and subject-specific models. We assess our model's performance through predictive accuracy metrics, uncertainty quantification, and validation against external clinical studies. Benchmarking against state-of-the-art statistical and machine learning models -- including linear mixed effects models, generalized additive models, and deep learning methods -- demonstrates the superior predictive performance of our approach. Additionally, we apply our method to predict trajectories of composite neuroimaging biomarkers, which highlights the versatility of our approach in modeling the progression of longitudinal neuroimaging biomarkers. Furthermore, validation on three external neuroimaging studies confirms the robustness of our method across different clinical contexts. We make the code available at https://github.com/vatass/AdaptiveShrinkageDKGP.</p></details> |  |

In cinematography, Directors of Photography meticulously craft camera movements to achieve expressive and intentional framing. However, existing methods for camera trajectory generation remain limited: Traditional approaches rely on geometric optimization or handcrafted procedural systems, while recent learning-based methods often inherit structural biases or lack textual alignment, constraining creative synthesis. In this work, we introduce an auto-regressive model inspired by the expertise of Directors of Photography to generate artistic and expressive camera trajectories. We first introduce DataDoP, a large-scale multi-modal dataset containing 29K real-world shots with free-moving camera trajectories, depth maps, and detailed captions in specific movements, interaction with the scene, and directorial intent. Thanks to the comprehensive and diverse database, we further train an auto-regressive, decoder-only Transformer for high-quality, context-aware camera movement generation based on text guidance and RGBD inputs, named GenDoP. Extensive experiments demonstrate that compared to existing methods, GenDoP offers better controllability, finer-grained trajectory adjustments, and higher motion stability. We believe our approach establishes a new standard for learning-based cinematography, paving the way for future advancements in camera control and filmmaking.

Traditional approaches often rely on static snapshots of network states, which can obscure the underlying dynamics of opinion evolution. In this study, we introduce a dynamic framework that quantifies the unpredictability of opinion trajectories using the normalized Lempel-Ziv (nLZ) complexity. Our approach leverages an adaptive social network model where each node is characterized by three behavioral parameters - homophily, neophily, and social conformity - and where opinions evolve continuously according to a system of ordinary differential equations. The results reveal distinct nLZ complexity signatures for each node type: homophilic nodes exhibit consistently rising complexity, reflecting increasingly unpredictable opinion shifts that are counterintuitive given their tendency for similarity; neophilic nodes maintain low and stable complexity, suggesting that openness to novelty can, surprisingly, lead to stable opinion dynamics; and conformic nodes display a U-shaped complexity trend, transitioning from early opinion stagnation to later unpredictability. In fully heterogeneous networks, modest interaction effects emerge, with slight shifts in the unpredictability of each faction's trajectories. These findings underscore the importance of temporal analysis in uncovering hidden dynamical patterns, offering novel insights into the mechanisms underlying social adaptation and polarization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Optimization Under Stochastic Dynamics Leveraging Maximum Mean Discrepancy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19045v2)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses sampling-based trajectory optimization for risk-aware navigation under stochastic dynamics. Typically such approaches operate by computing $\tilde{N}$ perturbed rollouts around the nominal dynamics to estimate the collision risk associated with a sequence of control commands. We consider a setting where it is expensive to estimate risk using perturbed rollouts, for example, due to expensive collision-checks. We put forward two key contributions. First, we develop an algorithm that distills the statistical information from a larger set of rollouts to a reduced-set with sample size $N<<\tilde{N}$. Consequently, we estimate collision risk using just $N$ rollouts instead of $\tilde{N}$. Second, we formulate a novel surrogate for the collision risk that can leverage the distilled statistical information contained in the reduced-set. We formalize both algorithmic contributions using distribution embedding in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). We perform extensive benchmarking to demonstrate that our MMD-based approach leads to safer trajectories at low sample regime than existing baselines using Conditional Value-at Risk (CVaR) based collision risk estimate.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/Basant1861/MPC-MMD</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Swept Volume-Based Trajectory Generation for Arbitrary-Shaped Ground Robot Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07554v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Navigating an arbitrary-shaped ground robot safely in cluttered environments remains a challenging problem. The existing trajectory planners that account for the robot's physical geometry severely suffer from the intractable runtime. To achieve both computational efficiency and Continuous Collision Avoidance (CCA) of arbitrary-shaped ground robot planning, we proposed a novel coarse-to-fine navigation framework that significantly accelerates planning. In the first stage, a sampling-based method selectively generates distinct topological paths that guarantee a minimum inflated margin. In the second stage, a geometry-aware front-end strategy is designed to discretize these topologies into full-state robot motion sequences while concurrently partitioning the paths into SE(2) sub-problems and simpler R2 sub-problems for back-end optimization. In the final stage, an SVSDF-based optimizer generates trajectories tailored to these sub-problems and seamlessly splices them into a continuous final motion plan. Extensive benchmark comparisons show that the proposed method is one to several orders of magnitude faster than the cutting-edge methods in runtime while maintaining a high planning success rate and ensuring CCA.</p></details> |  |
| **[Novel Diffusion Models for Multimodal 3D Hand Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07375v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting hand motion is critical for understanding human intentions and bridging the action space between human movements and robot manipulations. Existing hand trajectory prediction (HTP) methods forecast the future hand waypoints in 3D space conditioned on past egocentric observations. However, such models are only designed to accommodate 2D egocentric video inputs. There is a lack of awareness of multimodal environmental information from both 2D and 3D observations, hindering the further improvement of 3D HTP performance. In addition, these models overlook the synergy between hand movements and headset camera egomotion, either predicting hand trajectories in isolation or encoding egomotion only from past frames. To address these limitations, we propose novel diffusion models (MMTwin) for multimodal 3D hand trajectory prediction. MMTwin is designed to absorb multimodal information as input encompassing 2D RGB images, 3D point clouds, past hand waypoints, and text prompt. Besides, two latent diffusion models, the egomotion diffusion and the HTP diffusion as twins, are integrated into MMTwin to predict camera egomotion and future hand trajectories concurrently. We propose a novel hybrid Mamba-Transformer module as the denoising model of the HTP diffusion to better fuse multimodal features. The experimental results on three publicly available datasets and our self-recorded data demonstrate that our proposed MMTwin can predict plausible future 3D hand trajectories compared to the state-of-the-art baselines, and generalizes well to unseen environments. The code and pretrained models will be released at https://github.com/IRMVLab/MMTwin.</p></details> |  |

A Study on Water Level Forecasting in Everglades](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01415v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Everglades play a crucial role in flood and drought regulation, water resource planning, and ecosystem management in the surrounding regions. However, traditional physics-based and statistical methods for predicting water levels often face significant challenges, including high computational costs and limited adaptability to diverse or unforeseen conditions. Recent advancements in large time series models have demonstrated the potential to address these limitations, with state-of-the-art deep learning and foundation models achieving remarkable success in time series forecasting across various domains. Despite this progress, their application to critical environmental systems, such as the Everglades, remains underexplored. In this study, we fill the gap by investigating twelve task-specific models and five time series foundation models across six categories for a real-world application focused on water level prediction in the Everglades. Our primary results show that the foundation model, Chronos, significantly outperforms all other models while the remaining foundation models exhibit relatively poor performance. Moreover, the performance of task-specific models varies with the model architectures. Lastly, we discuss the possible reasons for the varying performance of models.</p></details> |  |

Despite various efforts to improve LLM reasoning, high-quality long-chain reasoning data and optimized training pipelines still remain inadequately explored in vision-language tasks. In this paper, we present Insight-V, an early effort to 1) scalably produce long and robust reasoning data for complex multi-modal tasks, and 2) an effective training pipeline to enhance the reasoning capabilities of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). Specifically, to create long and structured reasoning data without human labor, we design a two-step pipeline with a progressive strategy to generate sufficiently long and diverse reasoning paths and a multi-granularity assessment method to ensure data quality. We observe that directly supervising MLLMs with such long and complex reasoning data will not yield ideal reasoning ability. To tackle this problem, we design a multi-agent system consisting of a reasoning agent dedicated to performing long-chain reasoning and a summary agent trained to judge and summarize reasoning results. We further incorporate an iterative DPO algorithm to enhance the reasoning agent's generation stability and quality. Based on the popular LLaVA-NeXT model and our stronger base MLLM, we demonstrate significant performance gains across challenging multi-modal benchmarks requiring visual reasoning. Benefiting from our multi-agent system, Insight-V can also easily maintain or improve performance on perception-focused multi-modal tasks.</p></details> |  |

We introduce FlexLLM, the first system to co-serve LLM inference and PEFT-based finetuning on shared GPUs by fusing computation at the token level. The static compilation optimizations in FlexLLM -- dependent parallelization and graph pruning significantly shrink activation memory, leading to end-to-end GPU memory savings by up to 80%. At runtime, a novel token-level finetuning mechanism paired with a hybrid token scheduler dynamically interleaves inference and training tokens within each co-serving iteration, meeting strict latency SLOs while maximizing utilization. In end-to-end benchmarks on LLaMA-3.1-8B, Qwen-2.5-14B, and Qwen-2.5-32B, FlexLLM sustains the inference SLO requirements up to 20 req/s, and improves finetuning throughput by 1.9-4.8x under heavy inference workloads and 2.5-6.8x under light loads, preserving over 76% of peak finetuning progress even at peak demand. The source code of FlexLLM is publicly available at https://github.com/flexflow/FlexFlow/.</p></details> |  |
| **[MoDeGPT: Modular Decomposition for Large Language Model Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09632v5)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have reshaped the landscape of artificial intelligence by demonstrating exceptional performance across various tasks. However, substantial computational requirements make their deployment challenging on devices with limited resources. Recently, compression methods using low-rank matrix techniques have shown promise, yet these often lead to degraded accuracy or introduce significant overhead in parameters and inference latency. This paper introduces \textbf{Mo}dular \textbf{De}composition (MoDeGPT), a novel structured compression framework that does not need recovery fine-tuning while resolving the above drawbacks. MoDeGPT partitions the Transformer block into modules comprised of matrix pairs and reduces the hidden dimensions via reconstructing the module-level outputs. MoDeGPT is developed based on a theoretical framework that utilizes three well-established matrix decomposition algorithms -- Nystr\"om approximation, CR decomposition, and SVD -- and applies them to our redefined transformer modules. Our comprehensive experiments show MoDeGPT, without backward propagation, matches or surpasses previous structured compression methods that rely on gradient information, and saves 98% of compute costs on compressing a 13B model. On \textsc{Llama}-2/3 and OPT models, MoDeGPT maintains 90-95% zero-shot performance with 25-30% compression rates. Moreover, the compression can be done on a single GPU within a few hours and increases the inference throughput by up to 46%.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 Oral |
| **[Modeling Large Nonstationary Spatial Data with the Full-Scale Basis Graphical Lasso](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01318v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a new approach for the modeling large datasets of nonstationary spatial processes that combines a latent low rank process and a sparse covariance model. The low rank component coefficients are endowed with a flexible graphical Gaussian Markov random field model. The utilization of a low rank and compactly-supported covariance structure combines the full-scale approximation and the basis graphical lasso; we term this new approach the full-scale basis graphical lasso (FSBGL). Estimation employs a graphical lasso-penalized likelihood, which is optimized using a difference-of-convex scheme. We illustrate the proposed approach with a challenging high-resolution simulation dataset of the thermosphere. In a comparison against state-of-the-art spatial models, the FSBGL performs better at capturing salient features of the thermospheric temperature fields, even with limited available training data.</p></details> | 37 pages, 6 figures |
| **[ViSA-Flow: Accelerating Robot Skill Learning via Large-Scale Video Semantic Action Flow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01288v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the central challenges preventing robots from acquiring complex manipulation skills is the prohibitive cost of collecting large-scale robot demonstrations. In contrast, humans are able to learn efficiently by watching others interact with their environment. To bridge this gap, we introduce semantic action flow as a core intermediate representation capturing the essential spatio-temporal manipulator-object interactions, invariant to superficial visual differences. We present ViSA-Flow, a framework that learns this representation self-supervised from unlabeled large-scale video data. First, a generative model is pre-trained on semantic action flows automatically extracted from large-scale human-object interaction video data, learning a robust prior over manipulation structure. Second, this prior is efficiently adapted to a target robot by fine-tuning on a small set of robot demonstrations processed through the same semantic abstraction pipeline. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on the CALVIN benchmark and real-world tasks that ViSA-Flow achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in low-data regimes, outperforming prior methods by effectively transferring knowledge from human video observation to robotic execution. Videos are available at https://visaflow-web.github.io/ViSAFLOW.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reward Guidance for Reinforcement Learning Tasks Based on Large Language Models: The LMGT Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04744v2)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The inherent uncertainty in the environmental transition model of Reinforcement Learning (RL) necessitates a delicate balance between exploration and exploitation. This balance is crucial for optimizing computational resources to accurately estimate expected rewards for the agent. In scenarios with sparse rewards, such as robotic control systems, achieving this balance is particularly challenging. However, given that many environments possess extensive prior knowledge, learning from the ground up in such contexts may be redundant. To address this issue, we propose Language Model Guided reward Tuning (LMGT), a novel, sample-efficient framework. LMGT leverages the comprehensive prior knowledge embedded in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their proficiency in processing non-standard data forms, such as wiki tutorials. By utilizing LLM-guided reward shifts, LMGT adeptly balances exploration and exploitation, thereby guiding the agent's exploratory behavior and enhancing sample efficiency. We have rigorously evaluated LMGT across various RL tasks and evaluated it in the embodied robotic environment Housekeep. Our results demonstrate that LMGT consistently outperforms baseline methods. Furthermore, the findings suggest that our framework can substantially reduce the computational resources required during the RL training phase.</p></details> |  |

In this methodology, a database of likely operating conditions is generated via weather data, a market model and a model of operators' preventive actions. System states are sampled from this database and contingencies are applied to them to perform the security assessment. Rigorous statistical indicators are proposed to decide how many biased and unbiased samples to simulate to reach a target accuracy on the statistical error on the estimated risk from individual contingencies. Optionally, a screening of contingencies can be performed to limit the computational burden of the analysis. Finally, interpretable machine learning techniques are used to identify the root causes of the risk from critical contingencies, to ease the interpretation of the results, and to help with security enhancement. The method is demonstrated on the 73-bus reliability test system, and the scalability to large power systems (with thousands of buses) is also discussed.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |

However, research on detecting and analysing joint attention remains limited, particularly for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). This study evaluates MLLMs' ability to comprehend joint attention by analysing 26 parent-child interaction videos annotated by two speech-language pathologists. These annotations identify strong and poor joint attention segments, serving as benchmarks for evaluating the models' interpretive capabilities. Our findings reveal that current MLLMs struggle to accurately interpret joint attention due to a lack of nuanced understanding of child-initiated eye contact, a crucial component of joint attention dynamics. This study highlights the importance of incorporating detailed eye contact to enhance MLLMs' multimodal reasoning. Addressing these gaps is essential for future research to advance the use of MLLMs in analysing and supporting parent-child interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CHI 2025 Late Breaking Work</p></details> |

However, the fixed position length constraints in pre-trained models limit the number of demonstration examples. Recent efforts to extend context suffer from attention dispersion as the number of demonstrations increases. In this paper, we introduce Mitigating Attention Dispersion in large-scale ICL (MateICL) that enables LLMs to maintain effective self-attention as the context size grows. We first split the context into multiple windows, each filled to the model's context capacity, which are processed separately. Then, we introduce an additional layer to recalibrate the attention weights, prioritizing the query tokens as the number of demonstrations increases. Our empirical results show that MateICL can effectively leverage larger contexts to improve ICL performance. Compared to retrieval-based baselines, MateICL consistently achieves better performance without requiring an externally trained retrieval model. Despite recent advances in inference strategies (e.g., 32k token contexts), our results demonstrate that MateICL remains beneficial in computationally resource-constrained settings. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/amurtadha/MateICL.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present Retrial-Augmented Learning (RAL), a reward-free self-supervised learning framework for LLMs that operates without model training. By developing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) into a module for organizing intermediate data, we realized a three-stage autonomous knowledge generation of proposing a hypothesis, validating the hypothesis, and generating the knowledge. The method is evaluated in the LLM-PySC2 environment, a representative decision-making platform that combines sufficient complexity with domain-specific knowledge requirements. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method effectively reduces hallucination by generating and utilizing validated knowledge, and increases decision-making performance at an extremely low cost. Meanwhile, the approach exhibits potential in out-of-distribution(OOD) tasks, robustness, and transferability, making it a cost-friendly but effective solution for decision-making problems and autonomous knowledge generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-PySC2: Starcraft II learning environment for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05348v2)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The tremendous potential has been demonstrated by large language models (LLMs) in intelligent decision-making problems, with unprecedented capabilities shown across diverse applications ranging from gaming AI systems to complex strategic planning frameworks. However, the StarCraft II platform, which has been widely adopted for validating decision-making algorithms in the past decade, has not yet provided substantial support for this emerging domain. To address issues that LLMs cannot interface with the hundreds of actions of the pysc2 backend and the lack of native support for multi-agent (MA) collaboration, we propose the LLM-PySC2 environment. This is the first environment that offers LLMs the complete pysc2 action space with sufficient multi-modal information and game Wiki knowledge. With an asynchronous query architecture, the environment efficiently interacts with LLMs that maintain a constant latency regardless of the scale of the agents' population. In the experiments, we evaluated LLMs' decision-making performance in both the macro-decision and micro-operation scenarios, with traditional StarCraft II Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC) tasks and a series of new proposed. Results indicate that LLMs possess the potential to achieve victories in complex scenarios but cannot constantly generate correct decisions, especially in the recovered pysc2 action space and MA settings. Without task-relevant instructions, the pre-trained models suffer from issues such as hallucinations and inefficient collaboration. Our findings suggest that StarCraft II still challenges in the era of large models, revealing that there is a lot to do to develop an advanced LLM decision-making system, and the proposed LLM-PySC2 environment will support future development of LLM-based decision-making solutions.</p></details> |  |

Evaluating Large Language Models for Automated Exploit Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01065v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code-related tasks, raising concerns about their potential for automated exploit generation (AEG). This paper presents the first systematic study on LLMs' effectiveness in AEG, evaluating both their cooperativeness and technical proficiency. To mitigate dataset bias, we introduce a benchmark with refactored versions of five software security labs. Additionally, we design an LLM-based attacker to systematically prompt LLMs for exploit generation. Our experiments reveal that GPT-4 and GPT-4o exhibit high cooperativeness, comparable to uncensored models, while Llama3 is the most resistant. However, no model successfully generates exploits for refactored labs, though GPT-4o's minimal errors highlight the potential for LLM-driven AEG advancements.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompt Inversion Attack against Collaborative Inference of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09022v3)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have been widely applied for their remarkable capability of content generation. However, the practical use of open-source LLMs is hindered by high resource requirements, making deployment expensive and limiting widespread development. The collaborative inference is a promising solution for this problem, in which users collaborate by each hosting a subset of layers and transmitting intermediate activation. Many companies are building collaborative inference platforms to reduce LLM serving costs, leveraging users' underutilized GPUs. Despite widespread interest in collaborative inference within academia and industry, the privacy risks associated with LLM collaborative inference have not been well studied. This is largely because of the challenge posed by inverting LLM activation due to its strong non-linearity. In this paper, to validate the severity of privacy threats in LLM collaborative inference, we introduce the concept of prompt inversion attack (PIA), where a malicious participant intends to recover the input prompt through the activation transmitted by its previous participant. Extensive experiments show that our PIA method substantially outperforms existing baselines. For example, our method achieves an 88.4\% token accuracy on the Skytrax dataset with the Llama-65B model when inverting the maximum number of transformer layers, while the best baseline method only achieves 22.8\% accuracy. The results verify the effectiveness of our PIA attack and highlights its practical threat to LLM collaborative inference systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy 2025</p></details> |

However, the substantial hardware resources required for their training present a significant barrier to efficiency and scalability. To mitigate this challenge, low-precision training techniques have been widely adopted, leading to notable advancements in training efficiency. Despite these gains, low-precision training involves several components$\unicode{x2013}$such as weights, activations, and gradients$\unicode{x2013}$each of which can be represented in different numerical formats. The resulting diversity has created a fragmented landscape in low-precision training research, making it difficult for researchers to gain a unified overview of the field. This survey provides a comprehensive review of existing low-precision training methods. To systematically organize these approaches, we categorize them into three primary groups based on their underlying numerical formats, which is a key factor influencing hardware compatibility, computational efficiency, and ease of reference for readers. The categories are: (1) fixed-point and integer-based methods, (2) floating-point-based methods, and (3) customized format-based methods. Additionally, we discuss quantization-aware training approaches, which share key similarities with low-precision training during forward propagation. Finally, we highlight several promising research directions to advance this field.

While using rubrics are standard in LLM-based AES, creating detailed rubrics requires substantial ef-fort and increases token usage. We examined how different levels of rubric detail affect scoring accuracy across multiple LLMs using the TOEFL11 dataset. Our experiments compared three conditions: a full rubric, a simplified rubric, and no rubric, using four different LLMs (Claude 3.5 Haiku, Gemini 1.5 Flash, GPT-4o-mini, and Llama 3 70B Instruct). Results showed that three out of four models maintained similar scoring accuracy with the simplified rubric compared to the detailed one, while significantly reducing token usage. However, one model (Gemini 1.5 Flash) showed decreased performance with more detailed rubrics. The findings suggest that simplified rubrics may be sufficient for most LLM-based AES applications, offering a more efficient alternative without compromis-ing scoring accuracy. However, model-specific evaluation remains crucial as per-formance patterns vary across different LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in AIED 2025.

| **[Improving Large Language Model Planning with Action Sequence Similarity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01009v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Planning is essential for artificial intelligence systems to look ahead and proactively determine a course of actions to reach objectives in the virtual and real world. Recent work on large language models (LLMs) sheds light on their planning capability in various tasks. However, it remains unclear what signals in the context influence the model performance. In this work, we explore how to improve the model planning capability through in-context learning (ICL), specifically, what signals can help select the exemplars. Through extensive experiments, we observe that commonly used problem similarity may result in false positives with drastically different plans, which can mislead the model. In response, we propose to sample and filter exemplars leveraging plan side action sequence similarity (AS). We propose GRASE-DC: a two-stage pipeline that first re-samples high AS exemplars and then curates the selected exemplars with dynamic clustering on AS to achieve a balance of relevance and diversity. Our experimental result confirms that GRASE-DC achieves significant performance improvement on various planning tasks (up to ~11-40 point absolute accuracy improvement with 27.3% fewer exemplars needed on average). With GRASE-DC* + VAL, where we iteratively apply GRASE-DC with a validator, we are able to even boost the performance by 18.9% more. Extensive analysis validates the consistent performance improvement of GRASE-DC with various backbone LLMs and on both classical planning and natural language planning benchmarks. GRASE-DC can further boost the planning accuracy by ~24 absolute points on harder problems using simpler problems as exemplars over a random baseline. This demonstrates its ability to generalize to out-of-distribution problems.</p></details> | 25 pages, 11 figures |

Existing synthetic data generation methods for continue pre-training focus on intra-document content and overlook cross-document knowledge associations, limiting content diversity and depth. We propose Synthetic-on-Graph (SoG), a synthetic data generation framework that incorporates cross-document knowledge associations for efficient corpus expansion. SoG constructs a context graph by extracting entities and concepts from the original corpus, representing cross-document associations, and employing a graph walk strategy for knowledge-associated sampling. This enhances synthetic data diversity and coherence, enabling models to learn complex knowledge structures and handle rare knowledge. To further improve synthetic data quality, we integrate Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Contrastive Clarifying (CC) synthetic, enhancing reasoning processes and discriminative power. Experiments show that SoG outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) method in a multi-hop document Q&A dataset while performing comparably to the SOTA method on the reading comprehension task datasets, which also underscores the better generalization capability of SoG. Our work advances synthetic data generation and provides practical solutions for efficient knowledge acquisition in LLMs, especially in domains with limited data availability.</p></details> |  |

Consequently, we analyze defense strategies, including prevention-based and detection-based defense methods. Although advances have been made, challenges remain to adapt to the dynamic threat landscape, balance usability with robustness, and address resource constraints in defense implementation. We highlight open problems, including the need for adaptive scalable defenses, explainable security techniques, and standardized evaluation frameworks. This survey provides actionable insights and directions for developing secure and resilient LLMs, emphasizing the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and ethical considerations to mitigate risks in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce an online, retrieval-augmented large language model (LLM) framework for generating safety-critical driving scenarios. Our method first employs an LLM-based behavior analyzer to infer the most dangerous intent of the background vehicle from the observed state, then queries additional LLM agents to synthesize feasible adversarial trajectories. To mitigate catastrophic forgetting and accelerate adaptation, we augment the framework with a dynamic memorization and retrieval bank of intent-planner pairs, automatically expanding its behavioral library when novel intents arise. Evaluations using the Waymo Open Motion Dataset demonstrate that our model reduces the mean minimum time-to-collision from 1.62 to 1.08 s and incurs a 75% collision rate, substantially outperforming baselines.</p></details> |  |

The above illegal or trust-breaking activities are collectively called discreditable activities, and firms with discreditable activities are named as discreditable firms. Identification of discreditable firms is of great significance for investment attraction, bank lending, equity investment, supplier selection, job seeking, and so on. In this paper, we collect registration records of about 113 million Chinese firms and construct an ownership network with about 6 million nodes, where each node is a firm who has invested at least one firm or has been invested by at least one firm. Analysis of publicly available records of discreditable activities show strong network effect, namely the probability of a firm to be discreditable is remarkably higher than the average probability given the fact that one of its investors or investees is discreditable. In comparison, for the risk of being a discreditable firm, an investee has higher impact than an investor in average. The impact of a firm on surrounding firms decays along with the increasing topological distance, analogous to the well-known "three degrees of separation" phenomenon. The uncovered correlation of discreditable activities can be considered as a representative example of network effect, in addition to the propagation of diseases, opinions and human behaviors. Lastly, we show that the utilization of the network effect largely improves the accuracy of the algorithm to identify discreditable firms.</p></details> | <details><summary>We wi...</summary><p>We will large improve this work by more data and new method</p></details> |

To facilitate such an investigation, we first developed DynaWrite-a modular, microservices-based grammatical tutoring application which supports multiple LLMs to generate dynamic feedback to learners of English. Initial testing of 21 LLMs, revealed GPT-4o and neural chat to have the most potential to scale-up DA in the language learning classroom. Further testing of these two candidates found both models performed similarly in their ability to accurately identify grammatical errors in user sentences. However, GPT-4o consistently outperformed neural chat in the quality of its DA by generating clear, consistent, and progressively explicit hints. Real-time responsiveness and system stability were also confirmed through detailed performance testing, with GPT-4o exhibiting sufficient speed and stability. This study shows that LLMs can be used to scale-up dynamic assessment and thus enable dynamic assessment to be delivered to larger groups than possible in traditional teacher-learner settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 8 Figures.

Bug reports typically contain these inputs, which developers extract to facilitate debugging. Since bug reports are written in natural language, prior research has leveraged various Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for automated input extraction. With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), an important research question arises: how effectively can generative LLMs extract failure-inducing inputs from bug reports? In this paper, we propose LLPut, a technique to empirically evaluate the performance of three open-source generative LLMs -- LLaMA, Qwen, and Qwen-Coder -- in extracting relevant inputs from bug reports. We conduct an experimental evaluation on a dataset of 206 bug reports to assess the accuracy and effectiveness of these models. Our findings provide insights into the capabilities and limitations of generative LLMs in automated bug diagnosis.</p></details> |  |

This task has long been challenging for robotics due to the large variations in the geometry, size, and articulation types of such objects. Our system, Articubot, consists of three parts: generating a large number of demonstrations in physics-based simulation, distilling all generated demonstrations into a point cloud-based neural policy via imitation learning, and performing zero-shot sim2real transfer to real robotics systems. Utilizing sampling-based grasping and motion planning, our demonstration generalization pipeline is fast and effective, generating a total of 42.3k demonstrations over 322 training articulated objects. For policy learning, we propose a novel hierarchical policy representation, in which the high-level policy learns the sub-goal for the end-effector, and the low-level policy learns how to move the end-effector conditioned on the predicted goal. We demonstrate that this hierarchical approach achieves much better object-level generalization compared to the non-hierarchical version. We further propose a novel weighted displacement model for the high-level policy that grounds the prediction into the existing 3D structure of the scene, outperforming alternative policy representations. We show that our learned policy can zero-shot transfer to three different real robot settings: a fixed table-top Franka arm across two different labs, and an X-Arm on a mobile base, opening multiple unseen articulated objects across two labs, real lounges, and kitchens.

| **[LLM Ethics Benchmark: A Three-Dimensional Assessment System for Evaluating Moral Reasoning in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00853v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study establishes a novel framework for systematically evaluating the moral reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) as they increasingly integrate into critical societal domains. Current assessment methodologies lack the precision needed to evaluate nuanced ethical decision-making in AI systems, creating significant accountability gaps. Our framework addresses this challenge by quantifying alignment with human ethical standards through three dimensions: foundational moral principles, reasoning robustness, and value consistency across diverse scenarios. This approach enables precise identification of ethical strengths and weaknesses in LLMs, facilitating targeted improvements and stronger alignment with societal values. To promote transparency and collaborative advancement in ethical AI development, we are publicly releasing both our benchmark datasets and evaluation codebase at https://github.com/ The-Responsible-AI-Initiative/LLM_Ethics_Benchmark.git.</p></details> |  |
| **[CITER: Collaborative Inference for Efficient Large Language Model Decoding with Token-Level Routing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01976v5)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models have achieved remarkable success in various tasks but suffer from high computational costs during inference, limiting their deployment in resource-constrained applications. To address this issue, we propose a novel Collaborative Inference with Token-lEvel Routing (CITER) framework that enables efficient collaboration between small and large language models (SLMs \& LLMs) through a token-level routing strategy. Specifically, CITER routes non-critical tokens to an SLM for efficiency and routes critical tokens to an LLM for generalization quality. We formulate router training as a policy optimization, where the router receives rewards based on both the quality of predictions and the inference costs of generation. This allows the router to learn to predict token-level routing scores and make routing decisions based on both the current token and the future impact of its decisions. To further accelerate the reward evaluation process, we introduce a shortcut which significantly reduces the costs of the reward estimation and improving the practicality of our approach. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that CITER reduces the inference costs while preserving high-quality generation, offering a promising solution for real-time and resource-constrained applications. Our data and code are available at https://github.com/aiming-lab/CITER.</p></details> |  |

However, multi-robot systems (MRSs) face challenges in generalization, heterogeneity, and safety, especially when scaling to large-scale deployments like disaster response. Traditional approaches often lack generalization, requiring extensive engineering for new tasks and scenarios, and struggle with managing diverse robots. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Human-in-the-loop Multi-Robot Collaboration Framework (HMCF) powered by large language models (LLMs). LLMs enhance adaptability by reasoning over diverse tasks and robot capabilities, while human oversight ensures safety and reliability, intervening only when necessary. Our framework seamlessly integrates human oversight, LLM agents, and heterogeneous robots to optimize task allocation and execution. Each robot is equipped with an LLM agent capable of understanding its capabilities, converting tasks into executable instructions, and reducing hallucinations through task verification and human supervision. Simulation results show that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art task planning methods, achieving higher task success rates with an improvement of 4.76%. Real-world tests demonstrate its robust zero-shot generalization feature and ability to handle diverse tasks and environments with minimal human intervention.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spill The Beans: Exploiting CPU Cache Side-Channels to Leak Tokens from Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00817v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Side-channel attacks on shared hardware resources increasingly threaten confidentiality, especially with the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs). In this work, we introduce Spill The Beans, a novel application of cache side-channels to leak tokens generated by an LLM. By co-locating an attack process on the same hardware as the victim model, we flush and reload embedding vectors from the embedding layer, where each token corresponds to a unique embedding vector. When accessed during token generation, it results in a cache hit detectable by our attack on shared lower-level caches. A significant challenge is the massive size of LLMs, which, by nature of their compute intensive operation, quickly evicts embedding vectors from the cache. We address this by balancing the number of tokens monitored against the amount of information leaked. Monitoring more tokens increases potential vocabulary leakage but raises the chance of missing cache hits due to eviction; monitoring fewer tokens improves detection reliability but limits vocabulary coverage. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate the feasibility of leaking tokens from LLMs via cache side-channels. Our findings reveal a new vulnerability in LLM deployments, highlighting that even sophisticated models are susceptible to traditional side-channel attacks. We discuss the implications for privacy and security in LLM-serving infrastructures and suggest considerations for mitigating such threats. For proof of concept we consider two concrete attack scenarios: Our experiments show that an attacker can recover as much as 80%-90% of a high entropy API key with single shot monitoring. As for English text we can reach a 40% recovery rate with a single shot. We should note that the rate highly depends on the monitored token set and these rates can be improved by targeting more specialized output domains.</p></details> |  |

However, such data -- sometimes referred to as citizen science data -- are opportunistic and lack a structured sampling strategy. This volunteer-collected biodiversity data contains geographic, temporal, taxonomic, observers, and sociopolitical biases that can have significant effects on biodiversity model performance, but whose impacts are unclear for fine-grained species recognition performance. Here we introduce Diversity Shift (DivShift), a framework for quantifying the effects of domain-specific distribution shifts on machine learning model performance. To diagnose the performance effects of biases specific to volunteer-collected biodiversity data, we also introduce DivShift - North American West Coast (DivShift-NAWC), a curated dataset of almost 7.5 million iNaturalist images across the western coast of North America partitioned across five types of expert-verified bias. We compare species recognition performance across these bias partitions using a diverse variety of species- and ecosystem-focused accuracy metrics. We observe that these biases confound model performance less than expected from the underlying label distribution shift, and that more data leads to better model performance but the magnitude of these improvements are bias-specific. These findings imply that while the structure within natural world images provides generalization improvements for biodiversity monitoring tasks, the biases present in volunteer-collected biodiversity data can also affect model performance; thus these models should be used with caution in downstream biodiversity monitoring tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at AAAI-25 AI for Social Impact Track (https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/35060) Presented at NeurIPS 2024 Workshop on Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning (https://www.climatechange.ai/papers/neurips2024/43)</p></details> |

Current large multimodal models (LMMs), however, lack of this capability of 3D spatial reasoning. This limitation stems from the scarcity of 3D training data and the bias in current model designs toward 2D data. In this paper, we systematically study the impact of 3D-informed data, architecture, and training setups, introducing SpatialLLM, a large multi-modal model with advanced 3D spatial reasoning abilities. To address data limitations, we develop two types of 3D-informed training datasets: (1) 3D-informed probing data focused on object's 3D location and orientation, and (2) 3D-informed conversation data for complex spatial relationships. Notably, we are the first to curate VQA data that incorporate 3D orientation relationships on real images. Furthermore, we systematically integrate these two types of training data with the architectural and training designs of LMMs, providing a roadmap for optimal design aimed at achieving superior 3D reasoning capabilities. Our SpatialLLM advances machines toward highly capable 3D-informed reasoning, surpassing GPT-4o performance by 8.7%. Our systematic empirical design and the resulting findings offer valuable insights for future research in this direction.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025 highlight, camera ready version</p></details> |

In this work, we aim to provide a comprehensive analysis of LLMs' reasoning competence, specifically focusing on their prompt dependency. In particular, we introduce a new benchmark dataset with a series of simple reasoning questions demanding shallow logical reasoning. Aligned with cognitive psychology standards, the questions are confined to a basic domain revolving around geometric figures, ensuring that responses are independent of any pre-existing intuition about the world and rely solely on deduction. An empirical analysis involving zero-shot and few-shot prompting across 24 LLMs of different sizes reveals that, while LLMs with over 70 billion parameters perform better in the zero-shot setting, there is still a large room for improvement. An additional test with chain-of-thought prompting over 22 LLMs shows that this additional prompt can aid or damage the performance of models, depending on whether the rationale is required before or after the answer.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the Proceedings of the 23rd IEEE/WIC International Conference on Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology (WI-IAT 2024)</p></details> |

However, effectively leveraging this ability for example-based arbitrary style transfer, where an input text is rewritten to match the style of a given exemplar, remains an open challenge. A key question is how to describe the style of the exemplar to guide LLMs toward high-quality rewrites. In this work, we propose a prompting method based on register analysis to guide LLMs to perform this task. Empirical evaluations across multiple style transfer tasks show that our prompting approach enhances style transfer strength while preserving meaning more effectively than existing prompting strategies.</p></details> |  |

Leveraging LLMs as critique models to achieve automated supervision is a promising solution. In this work, we focus on studying and enhancing the math critique ability of LLMs. Current LLM critics provide critiques that are too shallow and superficial on each step, leading to low judgment accuracy and struggling to offer sufficient feedback for the LLM generator to correct mistakes. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel and effective two-stage framework to develop LLM critics that are capable of deliberately critiquing on each reasoning step of math solutions. In the first stage, we utilize Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct to generate 4.5K long-form critiques as seed data for supervised fine-tuning. Each seed critique consists of deliberate step-wise critiques that includes multi-perspective verifications as well as in-depth critiques of initial critiques for each reasoning step. Then, we perform reinforcement learning on the fine-tuned model with either existing human-labeled data from PRM800K or our automatically annotated data obtained via Monte Carlo sampling-based correctness estimation, to further incentivize its critique ability. Our developed critique model built on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct not only significantly outperforms existing LLM critics (including the same-sized DeepSeek-R1-distill models and GPT-4o) on various error identification benchmarks, but also more effectively helps the LLM generator refine erroneous steps through more detailed feedback.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work in progress.

Various representation learning methods have been developed, including graph-based approaches for relationships among entities, sequence-based methods for capturing the temporal evolution of user activities, and content-based models for leveraging text and visual content. However, the development of a unifying framework that integrates these diverse techniques to support multiple applications remains a significant challenge. This paper presents OmniSage, a large-scale representation framework that learns universal representations for a variety of applications at Pinterest. OmniSage integrates graph neural networks with content-based models and user sequence models by employing multiple contrastive learning tasks to effectively process graph data, user sequence data, and content signals. To support the training and inference of OmniSage, we developed an efficient infrastructure capable of supporting Pinterest graphs with billions of nodes. The universal representations generated by OmniSage have significantly enhanced user experiences on Pinterest, leading to an approximate 2.5% increase in sitewide repins (saves) across five applications. This paper highlights the impact of unifying representation learning methods, and we will open source the OmniSage code by the time of publication.</p></details> |  |

Medium-sized models such as LLaMA, llama} have served as starting points for domain-specific adaptation, but they often suffer from accuracy degradation when tested on specialized datasets. We introduce FineScope, a framework for deriving compact, domain-optimized LLMs from larger pretrained models. FineScope leverages the Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) framework, inspired by its ability to produce interpretable feature representations, to extract domain-specific subsets from large datasets. We apply structured pruning with domain-specific constraints, ensuring that the resulting pruned models retain essential knowledge for the target domain. To further enhance performance, these pruned models undergo self-data distillation, leveraging SAE-curated datasets to restore key domain-specific information lost during pruning. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that FineScope achieves highly competitive performance, outperforming several large-scale state-of-the-art LLMs in domain-specific tasks. Additionally, our results show that FineScope enables pruned models to regain a substantial portion of their original performance when fine-tuned with SAE-curated datasets. Furthermore, applying these datasets to fine-tune pretrained LLMs without pruning also improves their domain-specific accuracy, highlighting the robustness of our approach. The code will be released.</p></details> |  |

One approach to this question is to compare the cognitive dynamics of humans and large language models (LLMs). However, such a comparison requires a method to quantitatively analyze AI cognitive behavior under controlled conditions. While anecdotal observations suggest that certain prompts can dramatically change LLM behavior, these observations have remained largely qualitative. Here, we propose a two-part framework to investigate this phenomenon: a Transition-Inducing Prompt (TIP) that triggers a rapid shift in LLM responsiveness, and a Transition Quantifying Prompt (TQP) that evaluates this change using a separate LLM. Through controlled experiments, we examined how LLMs react to prompts embedding two semantically distant concepts (e.g., mathematical aperiodicity and traditional crafts)-either fused together or presented separately-by changing their linguistic quality and affective tone. Whereas humans tend to experience heightened engagement when such concepts are meaningfully blended producing a novel concept-a form of conceptual fusion-current LLMs showed no significant difference in responsiveness between semantically fused and non-fused prompts. This suggests that LLMs may not yet replicate the conceptual integration processes seen in human intuition. Our method enables fine-grained, reproducible measurement of cognitive responsiveness, and may help illuminate key differences in how intuition and conceptual leaps emerge in artificial versus human minds.</p></details> |  |

Despite advances in alignment and instruction tuning, LLMs can still generate outputs that are fluent yet fundamentally untrue. Understanding the cognitive dynamics that underlie these hallucinations remains an open problem. In this study, we propose a prompt-based framework to systematically trigger and quantify hallucination: a Hallucination-Inducing Prompt (HIP), which synthetically fuses semantically distant concepts (e.g., periodic table of elements and tarot divination) in a misleading way, and a Hallucination Quantifying Prompt (HQP), which scores the plausibility, confidence, and coherence of the output. Controlled experiments across multiple LLMs revealed that HIPs consistently produced less coherent and more hallucinated responses than their null-fusion controls. These effects varied across models, with reasoning-oriented LLMs showing distinct profiles from general-purpose ones. Our framework provides a reproducible testbed for studying hallucination vulnerability, and opens the door to developing safer, more introspective LLMs that can detect and self-regulate the onset of conceptual instability.</p></details> |  |
| **[SQL-Factory: A Multi-Agent Framework for High-Quality and Large-Scale SQL Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14837v4)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High quality SQL corpus is essential for intelligent database. For example, Text-to-SQL requires SQL queries and correspond natural language questions as training samples. However, collecting such query corpus remains challenging in practice due to the high cost of manual annotation, which highlights the importance of automatic SQL generation. Despite recent advances, existing generation methods still face limitations in achieving both diversity and cost-effectiveness. Besides, many methods also treat all tables equally, which overlooks schema complexity and leads to under-utilization of structurally rich tables. To address these issues, this paper proposes a multi-agent framework for high-quality and large-scale SQL generation, dubbed SQL-Factory. It decomposes the generation process into three collaborative teams: the Generation Team explores diverse query structures using a powerful language model, the Expansion Team scales promising patterns via a lightweight language model, and the Management Team adaptively schedules the workflow and evaluates the quality of synthesized queries. This modular framework ensures a balanced trade-off between diversity, scalability, and generation cost. We apply SQL-Factory to four widely used benchmarks and generate over 300,000 SQL queries with less than $200 API cost. Our generated queries achieve higher diversity compared to other methods, and extensive experiments demonstrate that the generated queries significantly improve the model performance in various downstream tasks.</p></details> |  |

This context often includes tacit knowledge about data provenance, quality, and intended use, which is rarely explicit in the dataset itself.

This presents an issue as soon as constraints on runtime and memory availability become essential considerations for a particular usecase. Relevant research areas where such limitations arise include interactive tools and databases for exploratory analysis of biomedical data. To address this problem, we present the Python package NApy, which relies on a Numba and C++ backend with OpenMP parallelization to enable scalable statistical testing for mixed-type datasets in the presence of missing values. Both with respect to runtime and memory consumption, NApy outperforms competitor tools and baseline implementations with naive Python-based parallelization by orders of magnitude, thereby enabling on-the-fly analyses in interactive applications. NApy is publicly available at https://github.com/DyHealthNet/NApy.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |

In contrast to previous studies, we demonstrate that inference-time activation interventions can bypass safety alignments and effectively steer model generations towards harmful AI coordination for Llama 2. Our method applies fine-grained interventions at specific model subcomponents, particularly attention heads, using a simple binary choice probing strategy. These interventions then generalise to the open-ended generation setting effectively circumventing safety guardrails. We show that probing single attention heads is more effective than intervening on full layers and intervening on only four attention heads is comparable to supervised fine-tuning. We further show that only a few example completions are needed to compute effective steering directions, which is an advantage over classical fine-tuning. Our findings highlight the shortcomings of current alignment techniques. In addition, our results suggest that, at the attention head level, activations encode fine-grained linearly separable behaviors. Practically, the approach offers a straightforward methodology to steer large language model behaviour, which could be extended to diverse domains beyond safety requiring fine-grained control over the model output. The code and datasets for this study can be found on https://github.com/PaulDrm/targeted_intervention.</p></details> | <details><summary>Large...</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs), Interference-time activation shifting, Steerability, Explainability, AI alignment, Interpretability</p></details> |
| **[Fitness Landscape of Large Language Model-Assisted Automated Algorithm Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19636v2)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in algorithm design. However, when integrated into search frameworks for iterative algorithm search, the underlying fitness landscape--critical for understanding search behaviou--remains underexplored. In this paper, we illustrate and analyze the fitness landscape of LLM-assisted Algorithm Search (LAS) using a graph-based approach, where nodes represent algorithms and edges denote transitions between them. We conduct extensive evaluations across six algorithm design tasks and six commonly used LLMs. Our findings reveal that LAS landscapes are highly multimodal and rugged, particularly in combinatorial optimization tasks, with distinct structural variations across tasks and LLMs. For instance, heuristic design tasks exhibit dense clusters of high-performing algorithms, while symbolic regression tasks show sparse, scattered distributions. Additionally, we demonstrate how population size influences exploration-exploitation trade-offs and the evolving trajectory of elite algorithms. These insights not only advance our understanding of LAS landscapes but also provide practical guidance for designing more effective LAS methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey on Large Language Model based Human-Agent Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00753v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have sparked growing interest in building fully autonomous agents. However, fully autonomous LLM-based agents still face significant challenges, including limited reliability due to hallucinations, difficulty in handling complex tasks, and substantial safety and ethical risks, all of which limit their feasibility and trustworthiness in real-world applications. To overcome these limitations, LLM-based human-agent systems (LLM-HAS) incorporate human-provided information, feedback, or control into the agent system to enhance system performance, reliability and safety. This paper provides the first comprehensive and structured survey of LLM-HAS. It clarifies fundamental concepts, systematically presents core components shaping these systems, including environment & profiling, human feedback, interaction types, orchestration and communication, explores emerging applications, and discusses unique challenges and opportunities. By consolidating current knowledge and offering a structured overview, we aim to foster further research and innovation in this rapidly evolving interdisciplinary field.

Our experiments focus on the medical domain and cover four language directions with varied resource availability: English-to-French, English-to-Portuguese, English-to-Swahili, and Swahili-to-English. Despite recent advancements, LLMs demonstrate a significant quality gap in specialized translation compared to multilingual encoder-decoder MT models such as NLLB-200. Our results indicate that NLLB-200 3.3B outperforms all evaluated LLMs in the 7-8B parameter range across three out of the four language directions. While fine-tuning improves the performance of LLMs such as Mistral and Llama, these models still underperform compared to fine-tuned NLLB-200 3.3B models. Our findings highlight the ongoing need for specialized MT models to achieve high-quality domain-specific translation, especially in medium-resource and low-resource settings. Moreover, the superior performance of larger LLMs over their 8B variants suggests potential value in pre-training domain-specific medium-sized language models, employing targeted data selection and knowledge distillation approaches to enhance both quality and efficiency in specialized translation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Communication-Efficient Wireless Federated Fine-Tuning for Large-Scale AI Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00333v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across various tasks. Yet, fine-tuning such massive models in federated learning (FL) settings poses significant challenges due to resource constraints and communication overhead. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) addresses these issues by training compact, low-rank matrices instead of fully fine-tuning large models. This paper introduces a wireless federated LoRA fine-tuning framework that optimizes both learning performance and communication efficiency. We provide a novel convergence analysis, revealing how LoRA rank and covariance effects influence FL training dynamics. Leveraging these insights, we propose Sparsified Orthogonal Fine-Tuning (\textbf{SOFT}), an adaptive sparsification method that streamlines parameter updates without expensive matrix multiplications and singular value decomposition (SVD) operations. Additionally, we present a Two Stage Federated Algorithm (\textbf{TSFA}) algorithm that pre-determines key parameters offline and dynamically adjusts bandwidth and sparsification online, ensuring efficient training under latency constraints. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our approach achieves accuracy comparable to ideal scenario models while significantly reducing communication overhead. Our framework thus enables scalable, resource-efficient deployment of large models in real-world wireless FL scenarios.</p></details> |  |

By leveraging the communication and computation capabilities of geographically dispersed edge devices, edge LAM emerges as an enabling technology to empower the delivery of various real-time intelligent services in 6G. Unlike traditional edge artificial intelligence (AI) that primarily supports a single task using small models, edge LAM is featured by the need of the decomposition and distributed deployment of large models, and the ability to support highly generalized and diverse tasks. However, due to limited communication, computation, and storage resources over wireless networks, the vast number of trainable neurons and the substantial communication overhead pose a formidable hurdle to the practical deployment of edge LAMs. In this paper, we investigate the opportunities and challenges of edge LAMs from the perspectives of model decomposition and resource management. Specifically, we propose collaborative fine-tuning and full-parameter training frameworks, alongside a microservice-assisted inference architecture, to enhance the deployment of edge LAM over wireless networks. Additionally, we investigate the application of edge LAM in air-interface designs, focusing on channel prediction and beamforming. These innovative frameworks and applications offer valuable insights and solutions for advancing 6G technology.</p></details> |  |

Problems that PDCS currently supports include linear programs, second-order cone programs, convex quadratic programs, and exponential cone programs. PDCS achieves scalability to large-scale problems by leveraging sparse matrix-vector multiplication as its core computational operation, which is both memory-efficient and well-suited for GPU acceleration. The solver is based on the restarted primal-dual hybrid gradient method but further incorporates several enhancements, including adaptive reflected Halpern restarts, adaptive step-size selection, adaptive weight adjustment, and diagonal rescaling. Additionally, PDCS employs a bijection-based method to compute projections onto rescaled cones. Furthermore, cuPDCS is a GPU implementation of PDCS and it implements customized computational schemes that utilize different levels of GPU architecture to handle cones of different types and sizes. Numerical experiments demonstrate that cuPDCS is generally more efficient than state-of-the-art commercial solvers and other first-order methods on large-scale conic program applications, including Fisher market equilibrium problems, Lasso regression, and multi-period portfolio optimization. Furthermore, cuPDCS also exhibits better scalability, efficiency, and robustness compared to other first-order methods on the conic program benchmark dataset CBLIB. These advantages are more pronounced in large-scale, lower-accuracy settings.</p></details> | 42 pages, 6 figures |

Existing benchmarks such as BrowseComp concentrate on English and overlook the linguistic, infrastructural, and censorship-related complexities of other major information ecosystems -- most notably Chinese. To address this gap, we introduce BrowseComp-ZH, a high-difficulty benchmark purpose-built to comprehensively evaluate LLM agents on the Chinese web. BrowseComp-ZH consists of 289 multi-hop questions spanning 11 diverse domains. Each question is reverse-engineered from a short, objective, and easily verifiable answer (e.g., a date, number, or proper noun). A two-stage quality control protocol is applied to strive for high question difficulty and answer uniqueness. We benchmark over 20 state-of-the-art language models and agentic search systems on our proposed BrowseComp-ZH. Despite their strong conversational and retrieval capabilities, most models struggle severely: a large number achieve accuracy rates below 10%, and only a handful exceed 20%. Even the best-performing system, OpenAI's DeepResearch, reaches just 42.9%. These results demonstrate the considerable difficulty of BrowseComp-ZH, where success demands not only effective retrieval strategies, but also sophisticated reasoning and information reconciliation -- capabilities that current models still struggle to master. Our dataset, construction guidelines, and benchmark results have been publicly released at https://github.com/PALIN2018/BrowseComp-ZH.</p></details> | Under Review |

Adherence is frequently undermined by factors including patient behavior, caregiver support, elevated medical costs, and insufficient healthcare infrastructure. We propose AdCare-VLM, a specialized Video-LLaVA-based multimodal large vision language model (LVLM) aimed at visual question answering (VQA) concerning medication adherence through patient videos. We employ a private dataset comprising 806 custom-annotated tuberculosis (TB) medication monitoring videos, which have been labeled by clinical experts, to fine-tune the model for adherence pattern detection. We present LLM-TB-VQA, a detailed medical adherence VQA dataset that encompasses positive, negative, and ambiguous adherence cases. Our method identifies correlations between visual features, such as the clear visibility of the patient's face, medication, water intake, and the act of ingestion, and their associated medical concepts in captions. This facilitates the integration of aligned visual-linguistic representations and improves multimodal interactions. Experimental results indicate that our method surpasses parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) enabled VLM models, such as LLaVA-V1.5 and Chat-UniVi, with absolute improvements ranging from 3.1% to 3.54% across pre-trained, regular, and low-rank adaptation (LoRA) configurations. Comprehensive ablation studies and attention map visualizations substantiate our approach, enhancing interpretability.</p></details> |  |

This article surveys the relationship between LLMs and knowledge bases, looks at how they can be applied in practice, and discusses related technical, operational, and ethical challenges. Utilizing a comprehensive examination of the literature, the study both identifies important issues and assesses existing solutions. It demonstrates the merits of incorporating generative AI into structured knowledge-base systems concerning data contextualization, model accuracy, and utilization of knowledge resources. The findings give a full list of the current situation of research, point out the main gaps, and propose helpful paths to take.

| **[From Effectiveness to Efficiency: Uncovering Linguistic Bias in Large Language Model-based Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00602v2)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising capabilities for code generation. While existing benchmarks evaluate the correctness and efficiency of LLM-generated code, the potential linguistic bias - where code quality varies based on the natural language used to describe programming tasks - remains underexplored. In this paper, we aim to investigate this linguistic bias through the lens of English and Chinese. To facilitate our investigation, we present a unified evaluation framework comprising a curated dataset of 52 Python programming questions with parallel bilingual task descriptions, automated correctness verification, and efficiency quantification tools based on runtime complexity estimation. Based on this framework, we conduct the first empirical study towards the linguistic bias in LLM-generated code on eight popular LCGMs, as well as GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4. We observe that these LCGM-generated code show different correctness on an average of 12% bilingual programming tasks, where 39% also exhibits diverse efficiency. Our findings indicate that LLMs commonly exhibit linguistic bias for code generation.</p></details> |  |

However, current evaluations of LLMs in clinical contexts remain limited. Most existing benchmarks rely on medical exam-style questions or PubMed-derived text, failing to capture the complexity of real-world electronic health record (EHR) data. Others focus narrowly on specific application scenarios, limiting their generalizability across broader clinical use. To address this gap, we present BRIDGE, a comprehensive multilingual benchmark comprising 87 tasks sourced from real-world clinical data sources across nine languages. We systematically evaluated 52 state-of-the-art LLMs (including DeepSeek-R1, GPT-4o, Gemini, and Llama 4) under various inference strategies. With a total of 13,572 experiments, our results reveal substantial performance variation across model sizes, languages, natural language processing tasks, and clinical specialties. Notably, we demonstrate that open-source LLMs can achieve performance comparable to proprietary models, while medically fine-tuned LLMs based on older architectures often underperform versus updated general-purpose models. The BRIDGE and its corresponding leaderboard serve as a foundational resource and a unique reference for the development and evaluation of new LLMs in real-world clinical text understanding.

ML Drift enables on-device execution of generative AI workloads which contain 10 to 100x more parameters than existing on-device generative AI models. ML Drift addresses intricate engineering challenges associated with cross-GPU API development, and ensures broad compatibility across mobile and desktop/laptop platforms, thereby facilitating the deployment of significantly more complex models on resource-constrained devices.

Inspired by peer-to-peer networks that leverage decentralized overlay nodes to increase throughput and availability, we propose GenTorrent, an LLM serving overlay that harnesses computing resources from decentralized contributors. We identify four key research problems inherent to enabling such a decentralized infrastructure: 1) overlay network organization; 2) LLM communication privacy; 3) overlay forwarding for resource efficiency; and 4) verification of serving quality. This work presents the first systematic study of these fundamental problems in the context of decentralized LLM serving. Evaluation results from a prototype implemented on a set of decentralized nodes demonstrate that GenTorrent achieves a latency reduction of over 50% compared to the baseline design without overlay forwarding. Furthermore, the security features introduce minimal overhead to serving latency and throughput. We believe this work pioneers a new direction for democratizing and scaling future AI serving capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient and robust 3D blind harmonization for large domain gaps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00133v1)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Blind harmonization has emerged as a promising technique for MR image harmonization to achieve scale-invariant representations, requiring only target domain data (i.e., no source domain data necessary). However, existing methods face limitations such as inter-slice heterogeneity in 3D, moderate image quality, and limited performance for a large domain gap. To address these challenges, we introduce BlindHarmonyDiff, a novel blind 3D harmonization framework that leverages an edge-to-image model tailored specifically to harmonization. Our framework employs a 3D rectified flow trained on target domain images to reconstruct the original image from an edge map, then yielding a harmonized image from the edge of a source domain image. We propose multi-stride patch training for efficient 3D training and a refinement module for robust inference by suppressing hallucination. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BlindHarmonyDiff outperforms prior arts by harmonizing diverse source domain images to the target domain, achieving higher correspondence to the target domain characteristics. Downstream task-based quality assessments such as tissue segmentation and age prediction on diverse MR scanners further confirm the effectiveness of our approach and demonstrate the capability of our robust and generalizable blind harmonization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Model Agent as a Mechanical Designer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17525v3)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional mechanical design follows an iterative process in which initial concepts are refined through cycles of expert assessment and resource-intensive Finite Element Method (FEM) analysis to meet performance goals. While machine learning models have been developed to assist in parts of this process, they typically require large datasets, extensive training, and are often tailored to specific tasks, limiting their generalizability. To address these limitations, we propose a framework that leverages a pretrained Large Language Model (LLM) in conjunction with an FEM module to autonomously generate, evaluate, and refine structural designs based on performance specifications and numerical feedback. The LLM operates without domain-specific fine-tuning, using general reasoning to propose design candidates, interpret FEM-derived performance metrics, and apply structurally sound modifications. Using 2D truss structures as a testbed, we show that the LLM can effectively navigate highly discrete and multi-faceted design spaces, balance competing objectives, and identify convergence when further optimization yields diminishing returns. Compared to Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II), our method achieves faster convergence and fewer FEM evaluations. Experiments with varying temperature settings (0.5, 1.0, 1.2) and model sizes (GPT-4.1 and GPT-4.1-mini) indicate that smaller models yield higher constraint satisfaction with fewer steps, while lower temperatures enhance design consistency. These results establish LLMs as a promising new class of reasoning-based, natural language-driven optimizers for autonomous design and iterative structural refinement.</p></details> |  |

Given a reference image, this requires adapting the appearance of a generated 3D asset to reflect the visual style of the reference while maintaining visual consistency from multiple viewpoints. To tackle this problem, we draw inspiration from the success of 2D stylization methods that leverage the attention mechanisms in large image generation models to capture and transfer visual style. In particular, we probe if large reconstruction models, commonly used in the context of 3D generation, has a similar capability. We discover that the certain attention blocks in these models capture the appearance specific features. By injecting features from a visual style image to such blocks, we develop a simple yet effective 3D appearance stylization method. Our method does not require training or test time optimization. Through both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we demonstrate that our approach achieves superior results in terms of 3D appearance stylization, significantly improving efficiency while maintaining high-quality visual outcomes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to SIGGRAPH 2025</p></details> |

Such models condition generated text on both an input image and a text prompt, enabling a variety of use cases such as visual question answering and multimodal chat. While prior studies have examined the social biases contained in text generated by LLMs, this topic has been relatively unexplored in LVLMs. Examining social biases in LVLMs is particularly challenging due to the confounding contributions of bias induced by information contained across the text and visual modalities. To address this challenging problem, we conduct a large-scale study of text generated by different LVLMs under counterfactual changes to input images, producing over 57 million responses from popular models. Our multi-dimensional bias evaluation framework reveals that social attributes such as perceived race, gender, and physical characteristics depicted in images can significantly influence the generation of toxic content, competency-associated words, harmful stereotypes, and numerical ratings of individuals.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NAACL 2025 main track (oral)</p></details> |

Although traditional reverse tools can convert binary code into C-like pseudo code, the lack of code comments and symbolic information such as function names still makes code understanding difficult. In recent years, two groups of techniques have shown promising prospects: (1) Deep learning-based techniques have demonstrated competitive results in tasks related to binary code understanding, furthermore, (2) Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively pre-trained at the source-code level for tasks such as code understanding and generation. This has left participants wondering about the capabilities of LLMs in binary code understanding. To this end, this work proposes a benchmark to evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs in real-world reverse engineering scenarios, which covers two key binary code understanding tasks, i.e., function name recovery and binary code summarization. To more comprehensively evaluate, we include binaries with multiple target architectures as well as different optimization options. We gain valuable insights into the capabilities and limitations through extensive empirical studies of popular LLMs using our benchmark. Our evaluations reveal that existing LLMs can understand binary code to a certain extent, thereby improving the efficiency of binary code analysis. Our results highlight the great potential of the LLMs in advancing the field of binary code understanding, and provide new directions for binary code analysis techniques.</p></details> | 38 pages, 9 figures |

However, their reliance on static internal knowledge limits their performance on complex, knowledge-intensive tasks and hinders their ability to produce comprehensive research reports requiring synthesis of diverse web information. To address this, we propose \textbf{WebThinker}, a deep research agent that empowers LRMs to autonomously search the web, navigate web pages, and draft research reports during the reasoning process. WebThinker integrates a \textbf{Deep Web Explorer} module, enabling LRMs to dynamically search, navigate, and extract information from the web when encountering knowledge gaps. It also employs an \textbf{Autonomous Think-Search-and-Draft strategy}, allowing the model to seamlessly interleave reasoning, information gathering, and report writing in real time. To further enhance research tool utilization, we introduce an \textbf{RL-based training strategy} via iterative online Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Extensive experiments on complex reasoning benchmarks (GPQA, GAIA, WebWalkerQA, HLE) and scientific report generation tasks (Glaive) demonstrate that WebThinker significantly outperforms existing methods and strong proprietary systems. Our approach enhances LRM reliability and applicability in complex scenarios, paving the way for more capable and versatile deep research systems.

By applying the use of fine-tuned large language models, this study aims to investigate which motifs exactly that the texts in this corpus have in common, and in which ways they differ from each other. The results show that while some motifs persist throughout the corpus, others fluctuate in frequency, indicating certain trends or external influences. Conclusively, the method proves to adequately extract literary motifs according to a set definition, providing data for both quantitative and qualitative analyses.</p></details> |  |

Existing work highly relies on training with the multi-lingual ability-related data, which may be not available for low-resource languages. To solve it, we propose a Multi-lingual Ability Extraction and Transfer approach, named as MAET. Our key idea is to decompose and extract language-agnostic ability-related weights from LLMs, and transfer them across different languages by simple addition and subtraction operations without training. Specially, our MAET consists of the extraction and transfer stages. In the extraction stage, we firstly locate key neurons that are highly related to specific abilities, and then employ them to extract the transferable ability-specific weights. In the transfer stage, we further select the ability-related parameter tensors, and design the merging strategy based on the linguistic and ability specific weights, to build the multi-lingual ability-enhanced LLM. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, we conduct extensive experiments on mathematical and scientific tasks in both high-resource lingual and low-resource lingual scenarios. Experiment results have shown that MAET can effectively and efficiently extract and transfer the advanced abilities, and outperform training-based baseline methods.

Yet, the extravagant 6G communication speed requirement raises a major open question for revolutionary new ideas of data compression. We have previously shown all understanding or learning are compression, under reasonable assumptions. Large language models (LLMs) understand data better than ever before. Can they help us to compress data? The LLMs may be seen to approximate the uncomputable Solomonoff induction. Therefore, under this new uncomputable paradigm, we present LMCompress. LMCompress shatters all previous lossless compression algorithms, doubling the lossless compression ratios of JPEG-XL for images, FLAC for audios, and H.264 for videos, and quadrupling the compression ratio of bz2 for texts. The better a large model understands the data, the better LMCompress compresses.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published by Nature Machine Intelligence at https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-025-01033-7</p></details> |
| **[Adsorb-Agent: Autonomous Identification of Stable Adsorption Configurations via Large Language Model Agent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16658v3)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adsorption energy is a key reactivity descriptor in catalysis, enabling efficient screening for optimal catalysts. However, determining adsorption energy typically requires evaluating numerous adsorbate-catalyst configurations. Current algorithmic approaches rely on exhaustive enumeration of adsorption sites and configurations, which makes the process computationally intensive and does not inherently guarantee the identification of the global minimum energy. In this work, we introduce Adsorb-Agent, a Large Language Model (LLM) agent designed to efficiently identify system-specific stable adsorption configurations corresponding to the global minimum adsorption energy. Adsorb-Agent leverages its built-in knowledge and emergent reasoning capabilities to strategically explore adsorption configurations likely to hold adsorption energy. By reducing the reliance on exhaustive sampling, it significantly decreases the number of initial configurations required while improving the accuracy of adsorption energy predictions. We evaluate Adsorb-Agent's performance across twenty representative systems encompassing a range of complexities. The Adsorb-Agent successfully identifies comparable adsorption energies for 83.7% of the systems and achieves lower energies, closer to the actual global minimum, for 35% of the systems, while requiring significantly fewer initial configurations than conventional methods. Its capability is particularly evident in complex systems, where it identifies lower adsorption energies for 46.7% of systems involving intermetallic surfaces and 66.7% of systems with large adsorbate molecules. These results demonstrate the potential of Adsorb-Agent to accelerate catalyst discovery by reducing computational costs and improving the reliability of adsorption energy predictions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mapping Trustworthiness in Large Language Models: A Bibliometric Analysis Bridging Theory to Practice](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04785v2)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has raised pressing concerns regarding their trustworthiness, spanning issues of reliability, transparency, fairness, and ethical alignment. Despite the increasing adoption of LLMs across various domains, there remains a lack of consensus on how to operationalize trustworthiness in practice. This study bridges the gap between theoretical discussions and implementation by conducting a bibliometric mapping analysis of 2,006 publications from 2019 to 2025. Through co-authorship networks, keyword co-occurrence analysis, and thematic evolution tracking, we identify key research trends, influential authors, and prevailing definitions of LLM trustworthiness. Additionally, a systematic review of 68 core papers is conducted to examine conceptualizations of trust and their practical implications. Our findings reveal that trustworthiness in LLMs is often framed through existing organizational trust frameworks, emphasizing dimensions such as ability, benevolence, and integrity. However, a significant gap exists in translating these principles into concrete development strategies. To address this, we propose a structured mapping of 20 trust-enhancing techniques across the LLM lifecycle, including retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), explainability techniques, and post-training audits. By synthesizing bibliometric insights with practical strategies, this study contributes towards fostering more transparent, accountable, and ethically aligned LLMs, ensuring their responsible deployment in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Pre-trained Large Language Models with Refined Prompting for Online Task and Motion Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21596v1)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence, there is an increasing demand for intelligent robots capable of assisting humans in daily tasks and performing complex operations. Such robots not only require task planning capabilities but must also execute tasks with stability and robustness. In this paper, we present a closed-loop task planning and acting system, LLM-PAS, which is assisted by a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM). While LLM-PAS plans long-horizon tasks in a manner similar to traditional task and motion planners, it also emphasizes the execution phase of the task. By transferring part of the constraint-checking process from the planning phase to the execution phase, LLM-PAS enables exploration of the constraint space and delivers more accurate feedback on environmental anomalies during execution. The reasoning capabilities of the LLM allow it to handle anomalies that cannot be addressed by the robust executor. To further enhance the system's ability to assist the planner during replanning, we propose the First Look Prompting (FLP) method, which induces LLM to generate effective PDDL goals. Through comparative prompting experiments and systematic experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of LLM-PAS in handling anomalous conditions during task execution.</p></details> |  |

While large language models (LLMs) show promise for social simulation, existing approaches often exhibit deviations from real-world data. To address this gap, we propose the Mean-Field LLM (MF-LLM) framework, which explicitly models the feedback loop between micro-level decisions and macro-level population. MF-LLM alternates between two models: a policy model that generates individual actions based on personal states and group-level information, and a mean field model that updates the population distribution from the latest individual decisions. Together, they produce rollouts that simulate the evolving trajectories of collective decision-making. To better match real-world data, we introduce IB-Tune, a fine-tuning method for LLMs grounded in the information bottleneck principle, which maximizes the relevance of population distributions to future actions while minimizing redundancy with historical data. We evaluate MF-LLM on a real-world social dataset, where it reduces KL divergence to human population distributions by 47 percent over non-mean-field baselines, and enables accurate trend forecasting and intervention planning. It generalizes across seven domains and four LLM backbones, providing a scalable foundation for high-fidelity social simulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 8 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Surprisingly, we find that simple object-based visual prompting -- overlaying visual cues (e.g., bounding box, circle) on images -- can significantly mitigate such hallucination; however, different visual prompts (VPs) vary in effectiveness. To address this, we propose Black-Box Visual Prompt Engineering (BBVPE), a framework to identify optimal VPs that enhance LVLM responses without needing access to model internals. Our approach employs a pool of candidate VPs and trains a router model to dynamically select the most effective VP for a given input image. This black-box approach is model-agnostic, making it applicable to both open-source and proprietary LVLMs. Evaluations on benchmarks such as POPE and CHAIR demonstrate that BBVPE effectively reduces object hallucination.</p></details> | NAACL 2025 |
| **[EEmo-Bench: A Benchmark for Multi-modal Large Language Models on Image Evoked Emotion Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16405v2)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The furnishing of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) has led to the emergence of numerous benchmark studies, particularly those evaluating their perception and understanding capabilities. Among these, understanding image-evoked emotions aims to enhance MLLMs' empathy, with significant applications such as human-machine interaction and advertising recommendations. However, current evaluations of this MLLM capability remain coarse-grained, and a systematic and comprehensive assessment is still lacking. To this end, we introduce EEmo-Bench, a novel benchmark dedicated to the analysis of the evoked emotions in images across diverse content categories. Our core contributions include: 1) Regarding the diversity of the evoked emotions, we adopt an emotion ranking strategy and employ the Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) as emotional attributes for emotional assessment. In line with this methodology, 1,960 images are collected and manually annotated. 2) We design four tasks to evaluate MLLMs' ability to capture the evoked emotions by single images and their associated attributes: Perception, Ranking, Description, and Assessment. Additionally, image-pairwise analysis is introduced to investigate the model's proficiency in performing joint and comparative analysis. In total, we collect 6,773 question-answer pairs and perform a thorough assessment on 19 commonly-used MLLMs. The results indicate that while some proprietary and large-scale open-source MLLMs achieve promising overall performance, the analytical capabilities in certain evaluation dimensions remain suboptimal. Our EEmo-Bench paves the path for further research aimed at enhancing the comprehensive perceiving and understanding capabilities of MLLMs concerning image-evoked emotions, which is crucial for machine-centric emotion perception and understanding.</p></details> |  |

| **[Identifying Critical Dependencies in Large-Scale Continuous Software Engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21437v1)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continuous Software Engineering (CSE) is widely adopted in the industry, integrating practices such as Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD). Beyond technical aspects, CSE also encompasses business activities like continuous planning, budgeting, and operational processes. Coordinating these activities in large-scale product development involves multiple stakeholders, increasing complexity. This study aims to address this complexity by identifying and analyzing critical dependencies in large-scale CSE. Based on 17 semi-structured interviews conducted at two Nordic fintech companies, our preliminary findings indicate that dependencies between software teams and support functions, as well as between software teams and external entities, are the primary sources of delays and bottlenecks. As a next step, we plan to further refine our understanding of critical dependencies in large-scale CSE and explore coordination mechanisms that can better support software development teams in managing these challenges.</p></details> |  |
| **[Does the Prompt-based Large Language Model Recognize Students' Demographics and Introduce Bias in Essay Scoring?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21330v1)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in Automated Essay Scoring (AES) due to their ability to capture semantic meaning. Traditional fine-tuning approaches required technical expertise, limiting accessibility for educators with limited technical backgrounds. However, prompt-based tools like ChatGPT have made AES more accessible, enabling educators to obtain machine-generated scores using natural-language prompts (i.e., the prompt-based paradigm). Despite advancements, prior studies have shown bias in fine-tuned LLMs, particularly against disadvantaged groups. It remains unclear whether such biases persist or are amplified in the prompt-based paradigm with cutting-edge tools. Since such biases are believed to stem from the demographic information embedded in pre-trained models (i.e., the ability of LLMs' text embeddings to predict demographic attributes), this study explores the relationship between the model's predictive power of students' demographic attributes based on their written works and its predictive bias in the scoring task in the prompt-based paradigm. Using a publicly available dataset of over 25,000 students' argumentative essays, we designed prompts to elicit demographic inferences (i.e., gender, first-language background) from GPT-4o and assessed fairness in automated scoring. Then we conducted multivariate regression analysis to explore the impact of the model's ability to predict demographics on its scoring outcomes. Our findings revealed that (i) prompt-based LLMs can somewhat infer students' demographics, particularly their first-language backgrounds, from their essays; (ii) scoring biases are more pronounced when the LLM correctly predicts students' first-language background than when it does not; and (iii) scoring error for non-native English speakers increases when the LLM correctly identifies them as non-native.</p></details> |  |
| **[Round Trip Translation Defence against Large Language Model Jailbreaking Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13517v2)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are susceptible to social-engineered attacks that are human-interpretable but require a high level of comprehension for LLMs to counteract. Existing defensive measures can only mitigate less than half of these attacks at most. To address this issue, we propose the Round Trip Translation (RTT) method, the first algorithm specifically designed to defend against social-engineered attacks on LLMs. RTT paraphrases the adversarial prompt and generalizes the idea conveyed, making it easier for LLMs to detect induced harmful behavior. This method is versatile, lightweight, and transferrable to different LLMs. Our defense successfully mitigated over 70% of Prompt Automatic Iterative Refinement (PAIR) attacks, which is currently the most effective defense to the best of our knowledge. We are also the first to attempt mitigating the MathsAttack and reduced its attack success rate by almost 40%.

| **[Covert Prompt Transmission for Secure Large Language Model Services](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21311v1)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates covert prompt transmission for secure and efficient large language model (LLM) services over wireless networks. We formulate a latency minimization problem under fidelity and detectability constraints to ensure confidential and covert communication by jointly optimizing the transmit power and prompt compression ratio. To solve this problem, we first propose a prompt compression and encryption (PCAE) framework, performing surprisal-guided compression followed by lightweight permutation-based encryption. Specifically, PCAE employs a locally deployed small language model (SLM) to estimate token-level surprisal scores, selectively retaining semantically critical tokens while discarding redundant ones. This significantly reduces computational overhead and transmission duration. To further enhance covert wireless transmission, we then develop a group-based proximal policy optimization (GPPO) method that samples multiple candidate actions for each state, selecting the optimal one within each group and incorporating a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence penalty to improve policy stability and exploration. Simulation results show that PCAE achieves comparable LLM response fidelity to baseline methods while reducing preprocessing latency by over five orders of magnitude, enabling real-time edge deployment. We further validate PCAE effectiveness across diverse LLM backbones, including DeepSeek-32B, Qwen-32B, and their smaller variants. Moreover, GPPO reduces covert transmission latency by up to 38.6\% compared to existing reinforcement learning strategies, with further analysis showing that increased transmit power provides additional latency benefits.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures |

This study introduces a Bayesian approach for LLM capability assessment that integrates prior knowledge through probabilistic inference, addressing limitations under limited-sample regimes. By treating model capabilities as latent variables and leveraging a curated query set to induce discriminative responses, we formalize model ranking as a Bayesian hypothesis testing problem over mutually exclusive capability intervals. Experimental evaluations with GPT-series models demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior discrimination compared to conventional evaluation methods. Results indicate that even with reduced sample sizes, the approach maintains statistical robustness while providing actionable insights, such as probabilistic statements about a model's likelihood of surpassing specific baselines. This work advances LLM evaluation methodologies by bridging Bayesian inference with practical constraints in real-world deployment scenarios.</p></details> |  |

While MLLMs significantly extend Large Language Models (LLMs) to handle diverse modalities such as vision, audio, and video, enabling robust reasoning across multimodal inputs remains a major challenge. This survey systematically reviews recent advances in RL-based reasoning for MLLMs, covering key algorithmic designs, reward mechanism innovations, and practical applications. We highlight two main RL paradigms--value-free and value-based methods--and analyze how RL enhances reasoning abilities by optimizing reasoning trajectories and aligning multimodal information. Furthermore, we provide an extensive overview of benchmark datasets, evaluation protocols, and existing limitations, and propose future research directions to address current bottlenecks such as sparse rewards, inefficient cross-modal reasoning, and real-world deployment constraints. Our goal is to offer a comprehensive and structured guide to researchers interested in advancing RL-based reasoning in the multimodal era.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose the conteXtual referring Map (XeMap) task, which focuses on contextual, fine-grained localization of text-referred regions in large-scale RS scenes. Unlike traditional approaches, XeMap enables precise mapping of mid-scale semantic entities that are often overlooked in image-level or object-level methods. To achieve this, we introduce XeMap-Network, a novel architecture designed to handle the complexities of pixel-level cross-modal contextual referring mapping in RS. The network includes a fusion layer that applies self- and cross-attention mechanisms to enhance the interaction between text and image embeddings. Furthermore, we propose a Hierarchical Multi-Scale Semantic Alignment (HMSA) module that aligns multiscale visual features with the text semantic vector, enabling precise multimodal matching across large-scale RS imagery. To support XeMap task, we provide a novel, annotated dataset, XeMap-set, specifically tailored for this task, overcoming the lack of XeMap datasets in RS imagery. XeMap-Network is evaluated in a zero-shot setting against state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating superior performance. This highlights its effectiveness in accurately mapping referring regions and providing valuable insights for interpreting large-scale RS environments.</p></details> | 14 pages, 8 figures |

We collected a new silent speech dataset of over 120 hours of electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings from 12 subjects, capturing 24 commonly used English words for language model pretraining and decoding. Following the recent success of pretraining large models with self-supervised paradigms to enhance EEG classification performance, we propose Large Brain Language Model (LBLM) pretrained to decode silent speech for active BCI. To pretrain LBLM, we propose Future Spectro-Temporal Prediction (FSTP) pretraining paradigm to learn effective representations from unlabeled EEG data. Unlike existing EEG pretraining methods that mainly follow a masked-reconstruction paradigm, our proposed FSTP method employs autoregressive modeling in temporal and frequency domains to capture both temporal and spectral dependencies from EEG signals. After pretraining, we finetune our LBLM on downstream tasks, including word-level and semantic-level classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant performance gains of the LBLM over fully-supervised and pretrained baseline models. For instance, in the difficult cross-session setting, our model achieves 47.0\% accuracy on semantic-level classification and 39.6\% in word-level classification, outperforming baseline methods by 5.4\% and 7.3\%, respectively. Our research advances silent speech decoding in active BCI systems, offering an innovative solution for EEG language model pretraining and a new dataset for fundamental research.</p></details> |  |

A Benchmarking Odyssey in Lung CT Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01239v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate lung tumor segmentation is crucial for improving diagnosis, treatment planning, and patient outcomes in oncology. However, the complexity of tumor morphology, size, and location poses significant challenges for automated segmentation. This study presents a comprehensive benchmarking analysis of deep learning-based segmentation models, comparing traditional architectures such as U-Net and DeepLabV3, self-configuring models like nnUNet, and foundation models like MedSAM, and MedSAM~2. Evaluating performance across two lung tumor segmentation datasets, we assess segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency under various learning paradigms, including few-shot learning and fine-tuning. The results reveal that while traditional models struggle with tumor delineation, foundation models, particularly MedSAM~2, outperform them in both accuracy and computational efficiency. These findings underscore the potential of foundation models for lung tumor segmentation, highlighting their applicability in improving clinical workflows and patient outcomes.</p></details> |  |

GERM improves upon models like DNABERT-2 by eliminating outliers that hinder low-rank adaptation and post-training quantization, enhancing both efficiency and robustness. We replace the vanilla attention layer with an outlier-free mechanism inspired by associative memory models. By removing outliers during both pre-training and fine-tuning, this approach accelerates adaptation, reduces computational costs, and enhances quantization robustness within acceptable loss margins. Additionally, we propose GERM-T, a strategy that employs small-step continual learning within the outlier-free framework, leveraging original checkpoints to avoid retraining from scratch. Empirically, GERM improves fine-tuning performance by 37.98% and quantization by 64.34% over the baseline model. It also reduces average kurtosis by 92.14% and maximum infinity norm by 82.77%. Compared to leading methods, GERM consistently delivers superior performance, offering a practical solution for genomic modeling in resource-constrained settings.

A key challenge for FedFM, given the versatile nature of foundation models, is addressing out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, where unseen tasks or clients may exhibit distribution shifts leading to suboptimal performance. Although numerous studies have explored OOD generalization in conventional FL, these methods are inadequate for FedFM due to the challenges posed by large parameter scales and increased data heterogeneity. To address these, we propose FedOA, which employs adapter-based parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods for efficacy and introduces personalized adapters with feature distance-based regularization to align distributions and guarantee OOD generalization for each client. Theoretically, we demonstrate that the conventional aggregated global model in FedFM inherently retains OOD generalization capabilities, and our proposed method enhances the personalized model's OOD generalization through regularization informed by the global model, with proven convergence under general non-convex settings. Empirically, the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated on benchmark datasets across various NLP tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional PINN models are typically designed for single PDEs, limiting their generalizability across different physical systems. In this work, we explore the potential of a foundation PINN model capable of solving multiple PDEs within a unified architecture. We investigate the efficacy of a single PINN framework trained on four distinct PDEs-the Simple Harmonic Oscillator (SHO), the 1D Heat Equation, the 1D Wave Equation, and the 2D Laplace Equation, demonstrating its ability to learn diverse physical dynamics. To enhance sample efficiency, we incorporate Active Learning (AL) using Monte Carlo (MC) Dropout-based uncertainty estimation, selecting the most informative training samples iteratively. We evaluate different active learning strategies, comparing models trained on 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, and 50% of the full dataset, and analyze their impact on solution accuracy. Our results indicate that targeted uncertainty sampling significantly improves performance with fewer training samples, leading to efficient learning across multiple PDEs. This work highlights the feasibility of a generalizable PINN-based foundation model, capable of adapting to different physics-based problems without redesigning network architectures. Our findings suggest that multi-PDE PINNs with active learning can serve as an effective approach for reducing computational costs while maintaining high accuracy in physics-based deep learning applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper should be rewritten</p></details> |

Recent advancements in brain foundation models have shown significant promise in addressing a range of brain-related tasks. However, current brain foundation models are limited by task and data homogeneity, restricted generalization beyond segmentation or classification, and inefficient adaptation to diverse clinical tasks. In this work, we propose SAM-Brain3D, a brain-specific foundation model trained on over 66,000 brain image-label pairs across 14 MRI sub-modalities, and Hypergraph Dynamic Adapter (HyDA), a lightweight adapter for efficient and effective downstream adaptation. SAM-Brain3D captures detailed brain-specific anatomical and modality priors for segmenting diverse brain targets and broader downstream tasks. HyDA leverages hypergraphs to fuse complementary multi-modal data and dynamically generate patient-specific convolutional kernels for multi-scale feature fusion and personalized patient-wise adaptation. Together, our framework excels across a broad spectrum of brain disease segmentation and classification tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, offering a new paradigm for brain disease analysis through multi-modal, multi-scale, and dynamic foundation modeling.</p></details> | 35 pages, 4 figures |
| **[PANGAEA: A Global and Inclusive Benchmark for Geospatial Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04204v2)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Geospatial Foundation Models (GFMs) have emerged as powerful tools for extracting representations from Earth observation data, but their evaluation remains inconsistent and narrow. Existing works often evaluate on suboptimal downstream datasets and tasks, that are often too easy or too narrow, limiting the usefulness of the evaluations to assess the real-world applicability of GFMs. Additionally, there is a distinct lack of diversity in current evaluation protocols, which fail to account for the multiplicity of image resolutions, sensor types, and temporalities, which further complicates the assessment of GFM performance. In particular, most existing benchmarks are geographically biased towards North America and Europe, questioning the global applicability of GFMs. To overcome these challenges, we introduce PANGAEA, a standardized evaluation protocol that covers a diverse set of datasets, tasks, resolutions, sensor modalities, and temporalities. It establishes a robust and widely applicable benchmark for GFMs. We evaluate the most popular GFMs openly available on this benchmark and analyze their performance across several domains. In particular, we compare these models to supervised baselines (e.g. UNet and vanilla ViT), and assess their effectiveness when faced with limited labeled data. Our findings highlight the limitations of GFMs, under different scenarios, showing that they do not consistently outperform supervised models. PANGAEA is designed to be highly extensible, allowing for the seamless inclusion of new datasets, models, and tasks in future research. By releasing the evaluation code and benchmark, we aim to enable other researchers to replicate our experiments and build upon our work, fostering a more principled evaluation protocol for large pre-trained geospatial models.

Conventional AI approaches typically rely on disjointed training, i.e., Large Language Models (LLMs) for clinical text generation and segmentation models for target extraction, which results in inflexible real-world deployment and a failure to leverage holistic biomedical information. To this end, we introduce UniBiomed, the first universal foundation model for grounded biomedical image interpretation. UniBiomed is based on a novel integration of Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) and Segment Anything Model (SAM), which effectively unifies the generation of clinical texts and the segmentation of corresponding biomedical objects for grounded interpretation. In this way, UniBiomed is capable of tackling a wide range of biomedical tasks across ten diverse biomedical imaging modalities. To develop UniBiomed, we curate a large-scale dataset comprising over 27 million triplets of images, annotations, and text descriptions across ten imaging modalities. Extensive validation on 84 internal and external datasets demonstrated that UniBiomed achieves state-of-the-art performance in segmentation, disease recognition, region-aware diagnosis, visual question answering, and report generation. Moreover, unlike previous models that rely on clinical experts to pre-diagnose images and manually craft precise textual or visual prompts, UniBiomed can provide automated and end-to-end grounded interpretation for biomedical image analysis. This represents a novel paradigm shift in clinical workflows, which will significantly improve diagnostic efficiency. In summary, UniBiomed represents a novel breakthrough in biomedical AI, unlocking powerful grounded interpretation capabilities for more accurate and efficient biomedical image analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first universal foundation model for grounded biomedical image interpretation</p></details> |

Our approach uses a block causal transformer architecture to model next frame predictions, leveraging previous frames as contextual priors rather than relying solely on sub-frames or pixel-based inputs commonly used in image generation methods. This block causal framework more effectively captures the spatial dependencies inherent in nonlinear spatiotemporal dynamics and physical phenomena. In an ablation study, next frame prediction demonstrated a 3.5x accuracy improvement over next token prediction. BCAT is trained on a diverse range of fluid dynamics datasets, including incompressible and compressible Navier-Stokes equations across various geometries and parameter regimes, as well as the shallow-water equations. The model's performance was evaluated on 6 distinct downstream prediction tasks and tested on about 8K trajectories to measure robustness on a variety of fluid dynamics simulations. BCAT achieved an average relative error of 1.18% across all evaluation tasks, outperforming prior approaches on standard benchmarks. With fine-tuning on a turbulence dataset, we show that the method adapts to new settings with more than 40% better accuracy over prior methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Theoretical Foundations for Semantic Cognition in Artificial Intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21218v1)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This monograph presents a modular cognitive architecture for artificial intelligence grounded in the formal modeling of belief as structured semantic state. Belief states are defined as dynamic ensembles of linguistic expressions embedded within a navigable manifold, where operators enable assimilation, abstraction, nullification, memory, and introspection. Drawing from philosophy, cognitive science, and neuroscience, we develop a layered framework that enables self-regulating epistemic agents capable of reflective, goal-directed thought. At the core of this framework is the epistemic vacuum: a class of semantically inert cognitive states that serves as the conceptual origin of belief space. From this foundation, the Null Tower arises as a generative structure recursively built through internal representational capacities. The theoretical constructs are designed to be implementable in both symbolic and neural systems, including large language models, hybrid agents, and adaptive memory architectures. This work offers a foundational substrate for constructing agents that reason, remember, and regulate their beliefs in structured, interpretable ways.</p></details> |  |
| **[Estimating Wage Disparities Using Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09894v2)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of foundation models marks a paradigm shift in machine learning: instead of training specialized models from scratch, foundation models are first trained on massive datasets before being adapted or fine-tuned to make predictions on smaller datasets. Initially developed for text, foundation models have also excelled at making predictions about social science data. However, while many estimation problems in the social sciences use prediction as an intermediate step, they ultimately require different criteria for success. In this paper, we develop methods for fine-tuning foundation models to perform these estimation problems. We first characterize an omitted variable bias that can arise when a foundation model is only fine-tuned to maximize predictive accuracy. We then provide a novel set of conditions for fine-tuning under which estimates derived from a foundation model are root-n-consistent. Based on this theory, we develop new fine-tuning algorithms that empirically mitigate this omitted variable bias. To demonstrate our ideas, we study gender wage decomposition. This is a statistical estimation problem from econometrics where the goal is to decompose the gender wage gap into components that can and cannot be explained by career histories of workers. Classical methods for decomposing the wage gap employ simple predictive models of wages which condition on coarse summaries of career history that may omit factors that are important for explaining the gap. Instead, we use a custom-built foundation model to decompose the gender wage gap, which captures a richer representation of career history. Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we find that career history explains more of the gender wage gap than standard econometric models can measure, and we identify elements of career history that are omitted by standard models but are important for explaining the wage gap.</p></details> |  |

In the vision and text domains, zero-shot OOD detection - which requires no training on in-distribution (ID) data - has made significant progress through the use of large-scale pretrained models such as vision-language models (VLMs) and large language models (LLMs). However, zero-shot OOD detection in graph-structured data remains largely unexplored, primarily due to the challenges posed by complex relational structures and the absence of powerful, large-scale pretrained models for graphs. In this work, we take the first step toward enabling zero-shot graph OOD detection by leveraging a graph foundation model (GFM). We show that, when provided only with class label names, the GFM can perform OOD detection without any node-level supervision - outperforming existing supervised methods across multiple datasets. To address the more practical setting where OOD label names are unavailable, we introduce GLIP-OOD, a novel framework that employs LLMs to generate semantically informative pseudo-OOD labels from unlabeled data. These labels enable the GFM to capture nuanced semantic boundaries between ID and OOD classes and perform fine-grained OOD detection - without requiring any labeled nodes. Our approach is the first to enable node-level graph OOD detection in a fully zero-shot setting, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmark text-attributed graph datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[MicroScopiQ: Accelerating Foundational Models through Outlier-Aware Microscaling Quantization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05282v4)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantization of foundational models (FMs) is significantly more challenging than traditional DNNs due to the emergence of large magnitude values called outliers. Existing outlier-aware algorithm-architecture co-design techniques either use mixed-precision, retaining outliers at high precision but compromise hardware efficiency, or quantize inliers and outliers at the same precision, improving hardware efficiency at the cost of accuracy. To address this mutual exclusivity, we propose MicroScopiQ, a novel co-design technique that leverages pruning to complement outlier-aware quantization. MicroScopiQ retains outliers at higher precision while pruning a certain fraction of least important weights to distribute the additional outlier bits; ensuring high accuracy, aligned memory and hardware efficiency. We design a high-throughput, low overhead accelerator architecture composed of multi-precision INT processing elements and a network-on-chip called ReCoN that efficiently abstracts the complexity of supporting high-precision outliers. Additionally, unlike prior techniques, MicroScopiQ does not assume any locality of outlier weights, enabling applicability to a broad range of FMs. Extensive experiments across diverse quantization settings demonstrate that MicroScopiQ achieves state-of-the-art quantization accuracy, while delivering up to 3x faster inference and 2x lower energy consumption compared to existing alternatives.

However, adapting these massive models to specific downstream tasks requires fine-tuning, which can be prohibitively expensive in computational resources. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods address this challenge by selectively updating only a small subset of parameters. Meanwhile, Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across distributed clients without sharing raw data, making it ideal for privacy-sensitive applications. This survey provides a comprehensive review of the integration of PEFT techniques within federated learning environments. We systematically categorize existing approaches into three main groups: Additive PEFT (which introduces new trainable parameters), Selective PEFT (which fine-tunes only subsets of existing parameters), and Reparameterized PEFT (which transforms model architectures to enable efficient updates). For each category, we analyze how these methods address the unique challenges of federated settings, including data heterogeneity, communication efficiency, computational constraints, and privacy concerns. We further organize the literature based on application domains, covering both natural language processing and computer vision tasks. Finally, we discuss promising research directions, including scaling to larger foundation models, theoretical analysis of federated PEFT methods, and sustainable approaches for resource-constrained environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>surve...</summary><p>survey paper, under updating</p></details> |
| **[Verified Foundations for Differential Privacy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01671v3)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differential privacy (DP) has become the gold standard for privacy-preserving data analysis, but implementing it correctly has proven challenging. Prior work has focused on verifying DP at a high level, assuming the foundations are correct and a perfect source of randomness is available. However, the underlying theory of differential privacy can be very complex and subtle. Flaws in basic mechanisms and random number generation have been a critical source of vulnerabilities in real-world DP systems. In this paper, we present SampCert, the first comprehensive, mechanized foundation for differential privacy. SampCert is written in Lean with over 12,000 lines of proof. It offers a generic and extensible notion of DP, a framework for constructing and composing DP mechanisms, and formally verified implementations of Laplace and Gaussian sampling algorithms. SampCert provides (1) a mechanized foundation for developing the next generation of differentially private algorithms, and (2) mechanically verified primitives that can be deployed in production systems. Indeed, SampCert's verified algorithms power the DP offerings of Amazon Web Services (AWS), demonstrating its real-world impact. SampCert's key innovations include: (1) A generic DP foundation that can be instantiated for various DP definitions (e.g., pure, concentrated, R\'enyi DP); (2) formally verified discrete Laplace and Gaussian sampling algorithms that avoid the pitfalls of floating-point implementations; and (3) a simple probability monad and novel proof techniques that streamline the formalization. To enable proving complex correctness properties of DP and random number generation, SampCert makes heavy use of Lean's extensive Mathlib library, leveraging theorems in Fourier analysis, measure and probability theory, number theory, and topology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Foundations of Safe Online Reinforcement Learning in the Linear Quadratic Regulator: Generalized Baselines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21081v2)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many practical applications of online reinforcement learning require the satisfaction of safety constraints while learning about the unknown environment. In this work, we establish theoretical foundations for reinforcement learning with safety constraints by studying the canonical problem of Linear Quadratic Regulator learning with unknown dynamics, but with the additional constraint that the position must stay within a safe region for the entire trajectory with high probability. Our primary contribution is a general framework for studying stronger baselines of nonlinear controllers that are better suited for constrained problems than linear controllers. Due to the difficulty of analyzing non-linear controllers in a constrained problem, we focus on 1-dimensional state- and action- spaces, however we also discuss how we expect the high-level takeaways can generalize to higher dimensions. Using our framework, we show that for \emph{any} non-linear baseline satisfying natural assumptions, $\tilde{O}_T(\sqrt{T})$-regret is possible when the noise distribution has sufficiently large support, and $\tilde{O}_T(T^{2/3})$-regret is possible for \emph{any} subgaussian noise distribution. In proving these results, we introduce a new uncertainty estimation bound for nonlinear controls which shows that enforcing safety in the presence of sufficient noise can provide ``free exploration'' that compensates for the added cost of uncertainty in safety-constrained control.</p></details> |  |
| **[If Concept Bottlenecks are the Question, are Foundation Models the Answer?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19774v2)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) are neural networks designed to conjoin high performance with ante-hoc interpretability. CBMs work by first mapping inputs (e.g., images) to high-level concepts (e.g., visible objects and their properties) and then use these to solve a downstream task (e.g., tagging or scoring an image) in an interpretable manner. Their performance and interpretability, however, hinge on the quality of the concepts they learn. The go-to strategy for ensuring good quality concepts is to leverage expert annotations, which are expensive to collect and seldom available in applications. Researchers have recently addressed this issue by introducing "VLM-CBM" architectures that replace manual annotations with weak supervision from foundation models. It is however unclear what is the impact of doing so on the quality of the learned concepts. To answer this question, we put state-of-the-art VLM-CBMs to the test, analyzing their learned concepts empirically using a selection of significant metrics. Our results show that, depending on the task, VLM supervision can sensibly differ from expert annotations, and that concept accuracy and quality are not strongly correlated.

Remote sensing surveys complement field-based approaches, and their reach can be especially great when combined with deep learning and computer vision techniques. However, conventional supervised deep learning methods face challenges in annotating fine-grained archaeological features at scale. While recent vision foundation models have shown remarkable success in learning large-scale remote sensing data with minimal annotations, most off-the-shelf solutions are designed for RGB images rather than multi-spectral satellite imagery, such as the 8-band data used in our study. In this paper, we introduce DeepAndes, a transformer-based vision foundation model trained on three million multi-spectral satellite images, specifically tailored for Andean archaeology. DeepAndes incorporates a customized DINOv2 self-supervised learning algorithm optimized for 8-band multi-spectral imagery, marking the first foundation model designed explicitly for the Andes region. We evaluate its image understanding performance through imbalanced image classification, image instance retrieval, and pixel-level semantic segmentation tasks. Our experiments show that DeepAndes achieves superior F1 scores, mean average precision, and Dice scores in few-shot learning scenarios, significantly outperforming models trained from scratch or pre-trained on smaller datasets. This underscores the effectiveness of large-scale self-supervised pre-training in archaeological remote sensing. Codes will be available on https://github.com/geopacha/DeepAndes.</p></details> |  |

Traditional approaches convert sensor data into text prompts, but this process is prone to errors, computationally expensive, and requires domain expertise. These challenges are particularly acute when processing extended time series data. While time series foundation models (TFMs) have recently emerged as powerful tools for learning representations from temporal data, bridging TFMs and LLMs remains challenging. Here, we present Time2Lang, a framework that directly maps TFM outputs to LLM representations without intermediate text conversion. Our approach first trains on synthetic data using periodicity prediction as a pretext task, followed by evaluation on mental health classification tasks. We validate Time2Lang on two longitudinal wearable and mobile sensing datasets: daily depression prediction using step count data (17,251 days from 256 participants) and flourishing classification based on conversation duration (46 participants over 10 weeks). Time2Lang maintains near constant inference times regardless of input length, unlike traditional prompting methods. The generated embeddings preserve essential time-series characteristics such as auto-correlation. Our results demonstrate that TFMs and LLMs can be effectively integrated while minimizing information loss and enabling performance transfer across these distinct modeling paradigms. To our knowledge, we are the first to integrate a TFM and an LLM for health, thus establishing a foundation for future research combining general-purpose large models for complex healthcare tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CHIL 2025.

Our approach enhances HOI detection by not only predicting the standard triplets but also introducing quadruplets, which extend HOI triplets by including segmentation masks for human-object pairs. More specifically, Seg2HOI inherits the properties of the vision foundation model (e.g., promptable and interactive mechanisms) and incorporates a decoder that applies these attributes to HOI task. Despite training only for HOI, without additional training mechanisms for these properties, the framework demonstrates that such features still operate efficiently. Extensive experiments on two public benchmark datasets demonstrate that Seg2HOI achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods, even in zero-shot scenarios. Lastly, we propose that Seg2HOI can generate HOI quadruplets and interactive HOI segmentation from novel text and visual prompts that were not used during training, making it versatile for a wide range of applications by leveraging this flexibility.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semantic Foundations of Reductive Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14758v3)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of logic has largely been through the 'deductive' paradigm: conclusions are inferred from established premisses. However, the use of logic in the context of both human and machine reasoning is typically through the dual 'reductive' perspective: collections of sufficient premisses are generated from putative conclusions. We call this paradigm, 'reductive logic'. This expression of logic encompass as diverse reasoning activities as proving a formula in a formal system to seeking to meet a friend before noon on Saturday. This paper is a semantical analysis of reductive logic. In particular, we provide mathematical foundations for representing and reasoning about 'reduction operators'. Heuristically, reduction operators may be thought of as `backwards' inference rules. In this paper, we address their mathematical representation, how they are used in the context of reductive reasoning, and, crucially, what makes them 'valid'.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Robust Multimodal Physiological Foundation Models: Handling Arbitrary Missing Modalities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19596v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal physiological signals, such as EEG, ECG, EOG, and EMG, are crucial for healthcare and brain-computer interfaces. While existing methods rely on specialized architectures and dataset-specific fusion strategies, they struggle to learn universal representations that generalize across datasets and handle missing modalities at inference time. To address these issues, we propose PhysioOmni, a foundation model for multimodal physiological signal analysis that models both homogeneous and heterogeneous features to decouple multimodal signals and extract generic representations while maintaining compatibility with arbitrary missing modalities. PhysioOmni trains a decoupled multimodal tokenizer, enabling masked signal pre-training via modality-invariant and modality-specific objectives. To ensure adaptability to diverse and incomplete modality combinations, the pre-trained encoders undergo resilient fine-tuning with prototype alignment on downstream datasets. Extensive experiments on four downstream tasks, emotion recognition, sleep stage classification, motor prediction, and mental workload detection, demonstrate that PhysioOmni achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining strong robustness to missing modalities. Our code and model weights will be released.</p></details> | 19 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Towards Faster and More Compact Foundation Models for Molecular Property Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19538v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advancements in machine learning for molecular property prediction have improved accuracy but at the expense of higher computational cost and longer training times. Recently, the Joint Multi-domain Pre-training (JMP) foundation model has demonstrated strong performance across various downstream tasks with reduced training time over previous models. Despite JMP's advantages, fine-tuning it on molecular datasets ranging from small-scale to large-scale requires considerable time and computational resources. In this work, we investigate strategies to enhance efficiency by reducing model size while preserving performance. To better understand the model's efficiency, we analyze the layer contributions of JMP and find that later interaction blocks provide diminishing returns, suggesting an opportunity for model compression. We explore block reduction strategies by pruning the pre-trained model and evaluating its impact on efficiency and accuracy during fine-tuning. Our analysis reveals that removing two interaction blocks results in a minimal performance drop, reducing the model size by 32% while increasing inference throughput by 1.3x. These results suggest that JMP-L is over-parameterized and that a smaller, more efficient variant can achieve comparable performance with lower computational cost. Our study provides insights for developing lighter, faster, and more scalable foundation models for molecular and materials discovery.

However, their widespread adoption raises critical concerns regarding trustworthiness across dimensions. This paper presents a comprehensive framework to address these challenges through three key contributions. First, we systematically review global AI governance laws and policies from governments and regulatory bodies, as well as industry practices and standards. Based on this analysis, we propose a set of guiding principles for GenFMs, developed through extensive multidisciplinary collaboration that integrates technical, ethical, legal, and societal perspectives. Second, we introduce TrustGen, the first dynamic benchmarking platform designed to evaluate trustworthiness across multiple dimensions and model types, including text-to-image, large language, and vision-language models. TrustGen leverages modular components--metadata curation, test case generation, and contextual variation--to enable adaptive and iterative assessments, overcoming the limitations of static evaluation methods. Using TrustGen, we reveal significant progress in trustworthiness while identifying persistent challenges. Finally, we provide an in-depth discussion of the challenges and future directions for trustworthy GenFMs, which reveals the complex, evolving nature of trustworthiness, highlighting the nuanced trade-offs between utility and trustworthiness, and consideration for various downstream applications, identifying persistent challenges and providing a strategic roadmap for future research. This work establishes a holistic framework for advancing trustworthiness in GenAI, paving the way for safer and more responsible integration of GenFMs into critical applications.

Existing approaches for adapting foundation models to new applications often rely on Federated Learning (FL) and disclose the foundation model weights to clients when using it to initialize the global model. While these methods ensure client data privacy, they compromise model and information security. In this paper, we introduce Federated Learning Aggregation Biased by a Foundation Model (FedBaF), a novel method for dynamically integrating pre-trained foundation model weights during the FL aggregation phase. Unlike conventional methods, FedBaF preserves the confidentiality of the foundation model while still leveraging its power to train more accurate models, especially in non-IID and adversarial scenarios. Our comprehensive experiments use Pre-ResNet and foundation models like Vision Transformer to demonstrate that FedBaF not only matches, but often surpasses the test accuracy of traditional weight initialization methods by up to 11.4% in IID and up to 15.8% in non-IID settings. Additionally, FedBaF applied to a Transformer-based language model significantly reduced perplexity by up to 39.2%.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published at The 28th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS 2025)</p></details> |

Analyzing Moral Foundation Priorities in Large Language Models with a Multi-Framework Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19255v1)** | 2025-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in consequential decision-making contexts, systematically assessing their ethical reasoning capabilities becomes a critical imperative. This paper introduces the Priorities in Reasoning and Intrinsic Moral Evaluation (PRIME) framework--a comprehensive methodology for analyzing moral priorities across foundational ethical dimensions including consequentialist-deontological reasoning, moral foundations theory, and Kohlberg's developmental stages. We apply this framework to six leading LLMs through a dual-protocol approach combining direct questioning and response analysis to established ethical dilemmas. Our analysis reveals striking patterns of convergence: all evaluated models demonstrate strong prioritization of care/harm and fairness/cheating foundations while consistently underweighting authority, loyalty, and sanctity dimensions. Through detailed examination of confidence metrics, response reluctance patterns, and reasoning consistency, we establish that contemporary LLMs (1) produce decisive ethical judgments, (2) demonstrate notable cross-model alignment in moral decision-making, and (3) generally correspond with empirically established human moral preferences. This research contributes a scalable, extensible methodology for ethical benchmarking while highlighting both the promising capabilities and systematic limitations in current AI moral reasoning architectures--insights critical for responsible development as these systems assume increasingly significant societal roles.</p></details> | 25 pages, 8 figures |

However, recently, language and multi-modal foundational models have been used to replace and scale-up human annotator's efforts. This study explores the similarity between human-generated and ML-generated annotations of images across diverse socio-economic contexts (RQ1) and their impact on ML model performance and bias (RQ2). We aim to understand differences in perception and identify potential biases in content interpretation. Our dataset comprises images of people from various geographical regions and income levels, covering various daily activities and home environments. ML captions and human labels show highest similarity at a low-level, i.e., types of words that appear and sentence structures, but all annotations are consistent in how they perceive images across regions. ML Captions resulted in best overall region classification performance, while ML Objects and ML Captions performed best overall for income regression. ML annotations worked best for action categories, while human input was more effective for non-action categories. These findings highlight the notion that both human and machine annotations are important, and that human-generated annotations are yet to be replaceable.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages (including references), 5 figures, 5 tables, and a paper/ethics checklist.

Specifically, we evaluate the MOMENT family of models, a set of transformer-based, pre-trained architectures for multivariate time series tasks such as: imputation, prediction, classification, and anomaly detection. We evaluate the capacity of these models on five datasets to capture the underlying structures in time series data within their latent space projection and validate whether fine tuning improves the clarity of the resulting embedding spaces. Notable performance improvements in terms of loss reduction were observed after fine tuning. Visual analysis shows limited improvement in the interpretability of the embeddings, requiring further work. Results suggest that, although Time Series Foundation Models such as MOMENT are robust, their latent spaces may require additional methodological refinements to be adequately interpreted, such as alternative projection techniques, loss functions, or data preprocessing strategies. Despite the limitations of MOMENT, foundation models supose a big reduction in execution time and so a great advance for interactive visual analytics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Curre...</summary><p>Currently under review at the International Journal of Interactive Multimedia and Artificial Intelligence (IJIMAI)</p></details> |

While current multimodal biomedical foundation models prioritize performance, their black-box nature hinders explaining the decision-making process in clinically meaningful concepts. Here, we present ConceptCLIP, the first explainable biomedical foundation model that achieves state-of-the-art diagnostic accuracy while delivering human-interpretable explanations across diverse imaging modalities. We curate MedConcept-23M, the largest pre-training dataset comprising 23 million image-text-concept triplets across diverse medical modalities, where clinical concepts are derived from the Unified Medical Language System. Leveraging this dataset, we develop ConceptCLIP through a novel dual-alignment approach that simultaneously learns global image-text representations and fine-grained region-concept associations for precise and interpretable medical image analysis. We curate the most extensive evaluation benchmark for multimodal biomedical foundation models, covering 52 clinical tasks spanning 10 imaging modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConceptCLIP outperforms existing state-of-the-art multimodal biomedical foundation models. Importantly, ConceptCLIP demonstrates superior diagnostic performance while providing human-understandable explanations validated by clinical experts. As the first precise and interpretable biomedical foundation model, ConceptCLIP represents a critical milestone toward the widespread clinical adoption of AI, thereby advancing trustworthy AI in medicine.</p></details> |  |

| **[Toward Foundation Models for Online Complex Event Detection in CPS-IoT: A Case Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12282v2)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Complex events (CEs) play a crucial role in CPS-IoT applications, enabling high-level decision-making in domains such as smart monitoring and autonomous systems. However, most existing models focus on short-span perception tasks, lacking the long-term reasoning required for CE detection. CEs consist of sequences of short-time atomic events (AEs) governed by spatiotemporal dependencies. Detecting them is difficult due to long, noisy sensor data and the challenge of filtering out irrelevant AEs while capturing meaningful patterns. This work explores CE detection as a case study for CPS-IoT foundation models capable of long-term reasoning. We evaluate three approaches: (1) leveraging large language models (LLMs), (2) employing various neural architectures that learn CE rules from data, and (3) adopting a neurosymbolic approach that integrates neural models with symbolic engines embedding human knowledge. Our results show that the state-space model, Mamba, which belongs to the second category, outperforms all methods in accuracy and generalization to longer, unseen sensor traces. These findings suggest that state-space models could be a strong backbone for CPS-IoT foundation models for long-span reasoning tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Foundations of Safe Online Reinforcement Learning in the Linear Quadratic Regulator: $\sqrt{T}$-Regret](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18657v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding how to efficiently learn while adhering to safety constraints is essential for using online reinforcement learning in practical applications. However, proving rigorous regret bounds for safety-constrained reinforcement learning is difficult due to the complex interaction between safety, exploration, and exploitation. In this work, we seek to establish foundations for safety-constrained reinforcement learning by studying the canonical problem of controlling a one-dimensional linear dynamical system with unknown dynamics. We study the safety-constrained version of this problem, where the state must with high probability stay within a safe region, and we provide the first safe algorithm that achieves regret of $\tilde{O}_T(\sqrt{T})$. Furthermore, the regret is with respect to the baseline of truncated linear controllers, a natural baseline of non-linear controllers that are well-suited for safety-constrained linear systems. In addition to introducing this new baseline, we also prove several desirable continuity properties of the optimal controller in this baseline. In showing our main result, we prove that whenever the constraints impact the optimal controller, the non-linearity of our controller class leads to a faster rate of learning than in the unconstrained setting.</p></details> |  |

In the field of geophysics, although the application of foundation models is gradually expanding, there is currently a lack of comprehensive reviews discussing the full workflow of integrating foundation models with geophysical data. To address this gap, this paper presents a complete framework that systematically explores the entire process of developing foundation models in conjunction with geophysical data. From data collection and preprocessing to model architecture selection, pre-training strategies, and model deployment, we provide a detailed analysis of the key techniques and methodologies at each stage. In particular, considering the diversity, complexity, and physical consistency constraints of geophysical data, we discuss targeted solutions to address these challenges. Furthermore, we discuss how to leverage the transfer learning capabilities of foundation models to reduce reliance on labeled data, enhance computational efficiency, and incorporate physical constraints into model training, thereby improving physical consistency and interpretability. Through a comprehensive summary and analysis of the current technological landscape, this paper not only fills the gap in the geophysics domain regarding a full-process review of foundation models but also offers valuable practical guidance for their application in geophysical data analysis, driving innovation and advancement in the field.</p></details> |  |

This trend has extended to respiratory and heart sound models, which have demonstrated effectiveness as off-the-shelf feature extractors. However, their evaluation benchmarking has been limited, resulting in incompatibility with state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, thus hindering proof of their effectiveness. This study investigates the practical effectiveness of off-the-shelf audio foundation models by comparing their performance across four respiratory and heart sound tasks with SOTA fine-tuning results. Experiments show that models struggled on two tasks with noisy data but achieved SOTA performance on the other tasks with clean data. Moreover, general-purpose audio models outperformed a respiratory sound model, highlighting their broader applicability. With gained insights and the released code, we contribute to future research on developing and leveraging foundation models for respiratory and heart sounds.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 1 figure, and 4 tables.

A key goal for SBI is to achieve accurate inference with as few simulations as possible, especially for expensive simulators. In this work, we address this challenge by repurposing recent probabilistic foundation models for tabular data: We show how tabular foundation models -- specifically TabPFN -- can be used as pre-trained autoregressive conditional density estimators for SBI. We propose Neural Posterior Estimation with Prior-data Fitted Networks (NPE-PF) and show that it is competitive with current SBI approaches in terms of accuracy for both benchmark tasks and two complex scientific inverse problems. Crucially, it often substantially outperforms them in terms of simulation efficiency, sometimes requiring orders of magnitude fewer simulations. NPE-PF eliminates the need for inference network selection, training, and hyperparameter tuning. We also show that it exhibits superior robustness to model misspecification and can be scaled to simulation budgets that exceed the context size limit of TabPFN. NPE-PF provides a new direction for SBI, where training-free, general-purpose inference models offer efficient, easy-to-use, and flexible solutions for a wide range of stochastic inverse problems.</p></details> |  |

| **[Transfer Learning with Foundational Models for Time Series Forecasting using Low-Rank Adaptations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11539v2)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundational Models are an emerging widely used technique of GenAI. These models are distinguished by their scalability and the ease with which they can be adapted through the exploitation of Transfer Learning. The availability of high computational power and large datasets have supported their development, achieving a high generalization capacity due to the enormous and heterogeneous amounts of data used in their initial training. These characteristics contribute to a solid base that can be adapted or adjusted to a wide range of tasks, increasing their applicability. This study proposes the methodology LLIAM, a straightforward adaptation of a kind of FM, Large Language Models, for the Time Series Forecasting task. An adequate time-series prompting schema and Low-Rank Adaptations are used to enhance the knowledge of the model with diverse time series datasets, known as the fine-tuning phase. A study divided in two stages has been performed for evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. Initially, a comparison was made between the performance of LLIAM and different state-of-the-art DL algorithms, including Recurrent Neural Networks and Temporal Convolutional Networks, as well as a LLM-based method, TimeLLM. Following this, a zero-shot study is presented in order to evaluate the generalization capacity of the proposed methodology with time series datasets from unknown domains not considered in the model training. The outcomes of this investigation demonstrate the efficacy of LLIAM, highlighting that this straightforward and general approach can attain competent results without the necessity for applying complex modifications. This work also encourages the use of available resources (such as these pre-trained models) and efficient fine-tuning techniques to avoid unnecessary and costly training, narrowing the gap between the goals of traditional AI and Green AI.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods are constrained to basic material types with limited predictable parameters, making them insufficient to represent the complexity of real-world materials. We introduce PhysFlow, a novel approach that leverages multi-modal foundation models and video diffusion to achieve enhanced 4D dynamic scene simulation. Our method utilizes multi-modal models to identify material types and initialize material parameters through image queries, while simultaneously inferring 3D Gaussian splats for detailed scene representation. We further refine these material parameters using video diffusion with a differentiable Material Point Method (MPM) and optical flow guidance rather than render loss or Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) loss. This integrated framework enables accurate prediction and realistic simulation of dynamic interactions in real-world scenarios, advancing both accuracy and flexibility in physics-based simulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

In this context, foundation models facilitate remote sensing image analysis to retrieve relevant geoinformation accurately and efficiently. However, as these models grow in size, fine-tuning becomes increasingly challenging due to the associated computational resources and costs, limiting their accessibility and scalability. Furthermore, full fine-tuning can lead to forgetting pre-trained features and even degrade model generalization. To address this, Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques offer a promising solution. In this paper, we conduct extensive experiments with various foundation model architectures and PEFT techniques to evaluate their effectiveness on five different EO datasets. Our results provide a comprehensive comparison, offering insights into when and how PEFT methods support the adaptation of pre-trained geospatial models. We demonstrate that PEFT techniques match or even exceed full fine-tuning performance and enhance model generalisation to unseen geographic regions, while reducing training time and memory requirements. Additional experiments investigate the effect of architecture choices such as the decoder type or the use of metadata, suggesting UNet decoders and fine-tuning without metadata as the recommended configuration. We have integrated all evaluated foundation models and techniques into the open-source package TerraTorch to support quick, scalable, and cost-effective model adaptation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/IBM/peft-geofm</p></details> |
| **[On the Generalizability of Foundation Models for Crop Type Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09451v3)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models pre-trained using self-supervised learning have shown powerful transfer learning capabilities on various downstream tasks, including language understanding, text generation, and image recognition. The Earth observation (EO) field has produced several foundation models pre-trained directly on multispectral satellite imagery for applications like precision agriculture, wildfire and drought monitoring, and natural disaster response. However, few studies have investigated the ability of these models to generalize to new geographic locations, and potential concerns of geospatial bias -- models trained on data-rich developed nations not transferring well to data-scarce developing nations -- remain. We investigate the ability of popular EO foundation models to transfer to new geographic regions in the agricultural domain, where differences in farming practices and class imbalance make transfer learning particularly challenging. We first select five crop classification datasets across five continents, normalizing for dataset size and harmonizing classes to focus on four major cereal grains: maize, soybean, rice, and wheat. We then compare three popular foundation models, pre-trained on SSL4EO-S12, SatlasPretrain, and ImageNet, using in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) evaluation. Experiments show that pre-trained weights designed explicitly for Sentinel-2, such as SSL4EO-S12, outperform general pre-trained weights like ImageNet. Furthermore, while only 100 labeled images are sufficient for achieving high overall accuracy, 900 images are required to achieve high average accuracy due to class imbalance. All harmonized datasets and experimental code are open-source and available for download.</p></details> |  |

However, the development and application of foundation models in this field are still burgeoning, as there are a variety of competing approaches that each come with significant benefits and drawbacks. This paper examines these approaches along with their roots in the computer vision field in order to characterize potential advantages and pitfalls while outlining future directions to further improve remote sensing-specific foundation models. We discuss the quality of the learned representations and methods to alleviate the need for massive compute resources. We place emphasis on the multi-sensor aspect of Earth observations, and the extent to which existing approaches leverage multiple sensors in training foundation models in relation to multi-modal foundation models. Finally, we identify opportunities for further harnessing the vast amounts of unlabeled, seasonal, and multi-sensor remote sensing observations.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, submitted to ACM SigSpatial, currently under peer review</p></details> |

Real-world challenges like occlusion and non-texture hinder accurate disparity estimation from binocular matching cues. Recently, monocular relative depth estimation has shown remarkable generalization using vision foundation models. Thus, to facilitate robust stereo matching with monocular depth cues, we incorporate a robust monocular relative depth model into the recurrent stereo-matching framework, building a new framework for depth foundation model-based stereo-matching, DEFOM-Stereo. In the feature extraction stage, we construct the combined context and matching feature encoder by integrating features from conventional CNNs and DEFOM. In the update stage, we use the depth predicted by DEFOM to initialize the recurrent disparity and introduce a scale update module to refine the disparity at the correct scale. DEFOM-Stereo is verified to have much stronger zero-shot generalization compared with SOTA methods. Moreover, DEFOM-Stereo achieves top performance on the KITTI 2012, KITTI 2015, Middlebury, and ETH3D benchmarks, ranking $1^{st}$ on many metrics. In the joint evaluation under the robust vision challenge, our model simultaneously outperforms previous models on the individual benchmarks, further demonstrating its outstanding capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://insta360-research-team.github.io/DEFOM-Stereo/</p></details> |

Our approach leverages a state-of-the-art Vision Foundation Model (VFM) within an encoder-decoder architecture, incorporating cross-attention mechanisms to enhance feature integration. This design captures detailed global representations and preserves essential spectral characteristics, treating RGB-to-NIR translation as more than a simple domain transfer problem. A multi-scale PatchGAN discriminator ensures realistic image generation at various detail levels, while carefully designed loss functions couple global context understanding with local feature preservation. We performed experiments on the RANUS dataset to demonstrate Pix2Next's advantages in quantitative metrics and visual quality, improving the FID score by 34.81% compared to existing methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate the practical utility of Pix2Next by showing improved performance on a downstream object detection task using generated NIR data to augment limited real NIR datasets. The proposed approach enables the scaling up of NIR datasets without additional data acquisition or annotation efforts, potentially accelerating advancements in NIR-based computer vision applications.</p></details> | 19 pages,12 figures |

Recent studies indicate that scaling-up and advanced design of the recommendation model can bring significant performance improvement. However, with a larger model scale, such prior studies have a significantly increasing gap from industry as they often neglect two fundamental challenges in industrial-scale applications. First, training and inference budgets are restricted for the model to be served, exceeding which may incur latency and impair user experience. Second, large-volume data arrive in a streaming mode with data distributions dynamically shifting, as new users/ads join and existing users/ads leave the system. We propose the External Large Foundation Model (ExFM) framework to address the overlooked challenges. Specifically, we develop external distillation and a data augmentation system (DAS) to control the computational cost of training/inference while maintaining high performance. We design the teacher in a way like a foundation model (FM) that can serve multiple students as vertical models (VMs) to amortize its building cost. We propose Auxiliary Head and Student Adapter to mitigate the data distribution gap between FM and VMs caused by the streaming data issue. Comprehensive experiments on internal industrial-scale applications and public datasets demonstrate significant performance gain by ExFM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the ACM Web Conference (WWW) 2025 Industrial Track as Oral Presentation</p></details> |

RS techniques have traditionally relied on modeling interactions between users and items as well as the features of content using models specific to each task. The emergence of foundation models (FMs), large scale models trained on vast amounts of data such as GPT, LLaMA and CLIP, is reshaping the recommendation paradigm. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the Foundation Models for Recommender Systems (FM4RecSys), covering their integration in three paradigms: (1) Feature-Based augmentation of representations, (2) Generative recommendation approaches, and (3) Agentic interactive systems. We first review the data foundations of RS, from traditional explicit or implicit feedback to multimodal content sources. We then introduce FMs and their capabilities for representation learning, natural language understanding, and multi-modal reasoning in RS contexts. The core of the survey discusses how FMs enhance RS under different paradigms. Afterward, we examine FM applications in various recommendation tasks. Through an analysis of recent research, we highlight key opportunities that have been realized as well as challenges encountered. Finally, we outline open research directions and technical challenges for next-generation FM4RecSys. This survey not only reviews the state-of-the-art methods but also provides a critical analysis of the trade-offs among the feature-based, the generative, and the agentic paradigms, outlining key open issues and future research directions.</p></details> |  |
| **[DP2FL: Dual Prompt Personalized Federated Learning in Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16357v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Personalized federated learning (PFL) has garnered significant attention for its ability to address heterogeneous client data distributions while preserving data privacy. However, when local client data is limited, deep learning models often suffer from insufficient training, leading to suboptimal performance. Foundation models, such as CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining), exhibit strong feature extraction capabilities and can alleviate this issue by fine-tuning on limited local data. Despite their potential, foundation models are rarely utilized in federated learning scenarios, and challenges related to integrating new clients remain largely unresolved. To address these challenges, we propose the Dual Prompt Personalized Federated Learning (DP2FL) framework, which introduces dual prompts and an adaptive aggregation strategy. DP2FL combines global task awareness with local data-driven insights, enabling local models to achieve effective generalization while remaining adaptable to specific data distributions. Moreover, DP2FL introduces a global model that enables prediction on new data sources and seamlessly integrates newly added clients without requiring retraining. Experimental results in highly heterogeneous environments validate the effectiveness of DP2FL's prompt design and aggregation strategy, underscoring the advantages of prediction on novel data sources and demonstrating the seamless integration of new clients into the federated learning framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[SignX: The Foundation Model for Sign Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16315v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The complexity of sign language data processing brings many challenges. The current approach to recognition of ASL signs aims to translate RGB sign language videos through pose information into English-based ID glosses, which serve to uniquely identify ASL signs. Note that there is no shared convention for assigning such glosses to ASL signs, so it is essential that the same glossing conventions are used for all of the data in the datasets that are employed. This paper proposes SignX, a foundation model framework for sign recognition. It is a concise yet powerful framework applicable to multiple human activity recognition scenarios. First, we developed a Pose2Gloss component based on an inverse diffusion model, which contains a multi-track pose fusion layer that unifies five of the most powerful pose information sources--SMPLer-X, DWPose, Mediapipe, PrimeDepth, and Sapiens Segmentation--into a single latent pose representation. Second, we trained a Video2Pose module based on ViT that can directly convert raw video into signer pose representation. Through this 2-stage training framework, we enable sign language recognition models to be compatible with existing pose formats, laying the foundation for the common pose estimation necessary for sign recognition. Experimental results show that SignX can recognize signs from sign language video, producing predicted gloss representations with greater accuracy than has been reported in prior work.</p></details> |  |

While this emerging field shows tremendous promise in applications, it faces significant challenges in motion consistency, computational efficiency, and ethical considerations. This survey provides a comprehensive review of diffusion-based video generation, examining its evolution, technical foundations, and practical applications. We present a systematic taxonomy of current methodologies, analyze architectural innovations and optimization strategies, and investigate applications across low-level vision tasks such as denoising and super-resolution. Additionally, we explore the synergies between diffusionbased video generation and related domains, including video representation learning, question answering, and retrieval. Compared to the existing surveys (Lei et al., 2024a;b; Melnik et al., 2024; Cao et al., 2023; Xing et al., 2024c) which focus on specific aspects of video generation, such as human video synthesis (Lei et al., 2024a) or long-form content generation (Lei et al., 2024b), our work provides a broader, more updated, and more fine-grained perspective on diffusion-based approaches with a special section for evaluation metrics, industry solutions, and training engineering techniques in video generation. This survey serves as a foundational resource for researchers and practitioners working at the intersection of diffusion models and video generation, providing insights into both the theoretical frameworks and practical implementations that drive this rapidly evolving field.

This is a practical and applicable problem in clinics and hospitals, as WSIs are large, require storage, processing, and transfer time. Training new models whenever new tasks are defined is time-consuming. Recent work has applied regularization- and rehearsal-based methods to this setting. However, the rise of vision-language foundation models that align diagnostic text with pathology images raises the question: are these models alone sufficient for lifelong WSI learning using zero-shot classification, or is further investigation into continual learning strategies needed to improve performance? To our knowledge, this is the first study to compare conventional continual-learning approaches with vision-language zero-shot classification for WSIs.

As we grapple with explaining these systems, a fundamental question emerges: Are the difficulties we face merely temporary hurdles, awaiting more sophisticated analytical techniques, or do they stem from \emph{intrinsic barriers} deeply rooted in the nature of these large-scale models themselves? This paper delves into this critical question by examining the fundamental characteristics of DFMs and scrutinizing the limitations encountered by current explainability methods when confronted with this inherent challenge. We probe the feasibility of achieving satisfactory explanations and consider the implications for how we must approach the verification and governance of these powerful technologies.</p></details> |  |
| **[WhisperFlow: speech foundation models in real time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11272v2)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speech foundation models, such as OpenAI's Whisper, become the state of the art in speech understanding due to their strong accuracy and generalizability. Yet, their applications are mostly limited to processing pre-recorded speech, whereas processing of streaming speech, in particular doing it efficiently, remains rudimentary. Behind this inefficiency are multiple fundamental reasons: (1) speech foundation models are trained to process long, fixed-length voice inputs (often 30 seconds); (2) encoding each voice input requires encoding as many as 1,500 tokens with tens of transformer layers; (3) decoding each output entails an irregular, complex beam search. As such, streaming speech processing on resource-constrained client devices is more expensive than other AI tasks, e.g., text generation. To this end, we present a novel framework, WhisperFlow, which embodies both model and system optimizations. (1) Hush word as a short, learnable audio segment; appended to a voice input, a hush word gracefully stops the speech model from processing more input without hallucination; (2) Beam pruning, which aligns streaming audio buffers over time and reuses results from earlier decoding rounds, therefore significantly accelerating decoding; and (3) CPU/GPU pipelining, which not only maps to the encoding/decoding stages dynamically, but also tunes to an optimal resource ratio, respecting the encoding/decoding speed that varies across voice inputs, models, and hardware. We test WhisperFlow on commodity ARM platforms with 4-12 CPU cores and 10-30 GPU cores. It reduces per-word latency by 1.6x-4.7x to as low as 0.5 second, while seeing negligible accuracy degradation. On an entry-level MacBook Air, WhisperFlow can keep the per-word latency around 1 second, with the whole device drawing only 7 Watts in total.</p></details> |  |
| **[StableQuant: Layer Adaptive Post-Training Quantization for Speech Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14915v1)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose StableQuant, a novel adaptive post-training quantization (PTQ) algorithm for widely used speech foundation models (SFMs). While PTQ has been successfully employed for compressing large language models (LLMs) due to its ability to bypass additional fine-tuning, directly applying these techniques to SFMs may not yield optimal results, as SFMs utilize distinct network architecture for feature extraction. StableQuant demonstrates optimal quantization performance regardless of the network architecture type, as it adaptively determines the quantization range for each layer by analyzing both the scale distributions and overall performance. We evaluate our algorithm on two SFMs, HuBERT and wav2vec2.0, for an automatic speech recognition (ASR) task, and achieve superior performance compared to traditional PTQ methods. StableQuant successfully reduces the sizes of SFM models to a quarter and doubles the inference speed while limiting the word error rate (WER) performance drop to less than 0.3% with 8-bit quantization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICASSP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Satellite Federated Fine-Tuning for Foundation Models in Space Computing Power Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10403v2)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and low-earth orbit (LEO) satellites have promoted the application of large remote sensing foundation models for various downstream tasks. However, direct downloading of these models for fine-tuning on the ground is impeded by privacy concerns and limited bandwidth. Satellite federated learning (FL) offers a solution by enabling model fine-tuning directly on-board satellites and aggregating model updates without data downloading. Nevertheless, for large foundation models, the computational capacity of satellites is insufficient to support effective on-board fine-tuning in traditional satellite FL frameworks. To address these challenges, we propose a satellite-ground collaborative federated fine-tuning framework. The key of the framework lies in how to reasonably decompose and allocate model components to alleviate insufficient on-board computation capabilities. During fine-tuning, satellites exchange intermediate results with ground stations or other satellites for forward propagation and back propagation, which brings communication challenges due to the special communication topology of space transmission networks, such as intermittent satellite-ground communication, short duration of satellite-ground communication windows, and unstable inter-orbit inter-satellite links (ISLs). To reduce transmission delays, we further introduce tailored communication strategies that integrate both communication and computing resources. Specifically, we propose a parallel intra-orbit communication strategy, a topology-aware satellite-ground communication strategy, and a latency-minimalization inter-orbit communication strategy to reduce space communication costs. Simulation results demonstrate significant reductions in training time with improvements of approximately 33%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating Temporal Plasticity in Foundation Time Series Models for Incremental Fine-tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14677v1)** | 2025-04-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series foundation models excel at diverse time series forecasting tasks, but their capacity for continuous improvement through incremental learning remains unexplored. We present the first comprehensive study investigating these models' temporal plasticity - their ability to progressively enhance performance through continual learning while maintaining existing capabilities. Through experiments on real-world datasets exhibiting distribution shifts, we evaluate both conventional deep learning models and foundation models using a novel continual learning framework. Our findings reveal that while traditional models struggle with performance deterioration during incremental fine-tuning, foundation models like Time-MoE and Chronos demonstrate sustained improvement in predictive accuracy. This suggests that optimizing foundation model fine-tuning strategies may be more valuable than developing domain-specific small models. Our research introduces new evaluation methodologies and insights for developing foundation time series models with robust continuous learning capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IJCNN 2025</p></details> |

To address these issues, this paper introduces communication-efficient federated LoRA adaption (CE-LoRA), a method that employs a tri-factorization low-rank adaptation approach with personalized model parameter aggregation. We first presents a novel LoRA parameter factorization by introducing a small-size dense matrix, which can significantly reduce the communication cost and achieve comparable empirical performance than transferring the low-rank parameter matrix used by existing methods. Without violating data privacy, the server considers the client similarity in both training dataset and model parameter space, and learns personalized weights for model aggregation. Our experiments on various LLM and VLM fine-tuning tasks demonstrate that CE-LoRA not only significantly reduces communication overhead but also improves performance under not independently and identically distributed data conditions. In addition, CE-LoRA improves data privacy protection, effectively mitigating gradient-based data reconstruction attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[SeaMo: A Season-Aware Multimodal Foundation Model for Remote Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19237v2)** | 2025-04-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote Sensing (RS) data encapsulates rich multi-dimensional information essential for Earth observation. Its vast volume, diverse sources, and temporal continuity make it particularly well-suited for developing large Visual Foundation Models (VFMs). These models serve as powerful feature extractors, leveraging extensive RS data for pretraining and subsequent fine-tuning in various geoscientific applications. However, existing VFMs in the RS domain often concentrate on specific image characteristics, neglecting the full season-aware potential of RS data. To bridge this gap, we introduce SeaMo, a novel VFM that effectively integrates multimodal and multi-seasonal RS information. SeaMo leverages a masked image modeling framework to fully exploit the spatial, spectral, and seasonal dimensions of RS data. Specifically, we employ unaligned spatial region selection to capture spatial heterogeneity, incorporate multi-source inputs for enhanced multimodal integration, and introduce temporal-multimodal fusion blocks to assimilate seasonal variations effectively. By explicitly modeling the complex, season-dependent attributes of RS data, SeaMo enhances generalization, robustness, and adaptability across geoscientific tasks. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate its superior performance, underscoring its potential as a foundational model for Earth observation.</p></details> |  |

| **[Foundation Models in Federated Learning: Assessing Backdoor Vulnerabilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10375v3)** | 2025-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Learning (FL), a privacy-preserving machine learning framework, faces significant data-related challenges. For example, the lack of suitable public datasets leads to ineffective information exchange, especially in heterogeneous environments with uneven data distribution. Foundation Models (FMs) offer a promising solution by generating synthetic datasets that mimic client data distributions, aiding model initialization and knowledge sharing among clients. However, the interaction between FMs and FL introduces new attack vectors that remain largely unexplored. This work therefore assesses the backdoor vulnerabilities exploiting FMs, where attackers exploit safety issues in FMs and poison synthetic datasets to compromise the entire system. Unlike traditional attacks, these new threats are characterized by their one-time, external nature, requiring minimal involvement in FL training. Given these uniqueness, current FL defense strategies provide limited robustness against this novel attack approach. Extensive experiments across image and text domains reveal the high susceptibility of FL to these novel threats, emphasizing the urgent need for enhanced security measures in FL in the era of FMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Xi Li...</summary><p>Xi Li and Chen Wu are equal contribution.

While post-disaster aerial imagery is readily available, robust debris segmentation solutions applicable across multiple disaster regions remain limited. Developing a generalized solution is challenging due to varying environmental and imaging conditions that alter debris' visual signatures across different regions, further compounded by the scarcity of training data. This study addresses these challenges by fine-tuning pre-trained foundational vision models, achieving robust performance with a relatively small, high-quality dataset. Specifically, this work introduces an open-source dataset comprising approximately 1,200 manually annotated aerial RGB images from Hurricanes Ian, Ida, and Ike. To mitigate human biases and enhance data quality, labels from multiple annotators are strategically aggregated and visual prompt engineering is employed. The resulting fine-tuned model, named fCLIPSeg, achieves a Dice score of 0.70 on data from Hurricane Ida -- a disaster event entirely excluded during training -- with virtually no false positives in debris-free areas. This work presents the first event-agnostic debris segmentation model requiring only standard RGB imagery during deployment, making it well-suited for rapid, large-scale post-disaster impact assessments and recovery planning.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |
| **[6G WavesFM: A Foundation Model for Sensing, Communication, and Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14100v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces WavesFM, a novel Wireless Foundation Model (WFM) framework, capable of supporting a wide array of communication, sensing, and localization tasks. Our proposed architecture combines a shared Vision Transformer (ViT) backbone with task-specific multi-layer perceptron (MLP) heads and incorporates Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for parameter-efficient fine-tuning. This design promotes full parameter sharing across tasks, significantly reducing the computational and memory footprint without sacrificing performance. The model processes both image-like wireless modalities, such as spectrograms and channel state information (CSI), and in-phase and quadrature (IQ) signals arranged as orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) resource grids. We demonstrate the strong generalization capabilities of WavesFM through extensive experiments on four downstream tasks: Fifth Generation New Radio (5G NR) positioning; multiple-input multiple-output OFDM (MIMO-OFDM) channel estimation; human activity sensing; and radio-frequency (RF) signal classification. Compared to supervised baselines trained individually, our approach achieves superior performance while sharing 80% of its parameters across tasks. Furthermore, we show that pretraining on domain-relevant data not only boosts performance but also accelerates convergence, reducing training time by up to 5x. These results demonstrate that our unified WFM can support diverse tasks and deliver significant gains in both performance and efficiency, highlighting the transformative potential of foundation models to drive AI-native paradigms in future sixth-generation (6G) networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[LoftUp: Learning a Coordinate-Based Feature Upsampler for Vision Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14032v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision foundation models (VFMs) such as DINOv2 and CLIP have achieved impressive results on various downstream tasks, but their limited feature resolution hampers performance in applications requiring pixel-level understanding. Feature upsampling offers a promising direction to address this challenge. In this work, we identify two critical factors for enhancing feature upsampling: the upsampler architecture and the training objective. For the upsampler architecture, we introduce a coordinate-based cross-attention transformer that integrates the high-resolution images with coordinates and low-resolution VFM features to generate sharp, high-quality features. For the training objective, we propose constructing high-resolution pseudo-groundtruth features by leveraging class-agnostic masks and self-distillation. Our approach effectively captures fine-grained details and adapts flexibly to various input and feature resolutions. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing feature upsampling techniques across various downstream tasks.

However, such solutions are not yet available for Tetun, making it challenging to find relevant documents for text-based search queries in this language. To address these challenges, we investigate Tetun text retrieval with a focus on the ad-hoc retrieval task. The study begins by developing essential language resources -- including a list of stopwords, a stemmer, and a test collection -- which serve as foundational components for solutions tailored to Tetun text retrieval. Various strategies are investigated using both document titles and content to evaluate retrieval effectiveness. The results demonstrate that retrieving document titles, after removing hyphens and apostrophes without applying stemming, significantly improves retrieval performance compared to the baseline. Efficiency increases by 31.37%, while effectiveness achieves an average relative gain of +9.40% in MAP@10 and +30.35% in NDCG@10 with DFR BM25. Beyond the top-10 cutoff point, Hiemstra LM shows strong performance across various retrieval strategies and evaluation metrics. Contributions of this work include the development of Labadain-Stopwords (a list of 160 Tetun stopwords), Labadain-Stemmer (a Tetun stemmer with three variants), and Labadain-Avaliad\'or (a Tetun test collection containing 59 topics, 33,550 documents, and 5,900 qrels). We make all resources publicly accessible to facilitate future research in Tetun information retrieval.</p></details> | Version 3 |
| **[Towards Cardiac MRI Foundation Models: Comprehensive Visual-Tabular Representations for Whole-Heart Assessment and Beyond](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13037v2)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is the gold standard for non-invasive cardiac assessment, offering rich spatio-temporal views of the cardiac anatomy and physiology. Patient-level health factors, such as demographics, metabolic, and lifestyle, are known to substantially influence cardiovascular health and disease risk, yet remain uncaptured by CMR alone. To holistically understand cardiac health and to enable the best possible interpretation of an individual's disease risk, CMR and patient-level factors must be jointly exploited within an integrated framework. Recent multi-modal approaches have begun to bridge this gap, yet they often rely on limited spatio-temporal data and focus on isolated clinical tasks, thereby hindering the development of a comprehensive representation for cardiac health evaluation. To overcome these limitations, we introduce ViTa, a step toward foundation models that delivers a comprehensive representation of the heart and a precise interpretation of individual disease risk. Leveraging data from 42,000 UK Biobank participants, ViTa integrates 3D+T cine stacks from short-axis and long-axis views, enabling a complete capture of the cardiac cycle. These imaging data are then fused with detailed tabular patient-level factors, enabling context-aware insights. This multi-modal paradigm supports a wide spectrum of downstream tasks, including cardiac phenotype and physiological feature prediction, segmentation, and classification of cardiac and metabolic diseases within a single unified framework. By learning a shared latent representation that bridges rich imaging features and patient context, ViTa moves beyond traditional, task-specific models toward a universal, patient-specific understanding of cardiac health, highlighting its potential to advance clinical utility and scalability in cardiac analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Designing a reliable lateral movement detector using a graph foundation model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13527v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have recently emerged as a new paradigm in machine learning (ML). These models are pre-trained on large and diverse datasets and can subsequently be applied to various downstream tasks with little or no retraining. This allows people without advanced ML expertise to build ML applications, accelerating innovation across many fields. However, the adoption of foundation models in cybersecurity is hindered by their inability to efficiently process data such as network traffic captures or binary executables. The recent introduction of graph foundation models (GFMs) could make a significant difference, as graphs are well-suited to representing these types of data. We study the usability of GFMs in cybersecurity through the lens of one specific use case, namely lateral movement detection. Using a pre-trained GFM, we build a detector that reaches state-of-the-art performance without requiring any training on domain-specific data. This case study thus provides compelling evidence of the potential of GFMs for cybersecurity.</p></details> |  |

Although vision foundation models have achieved remarkable progress in classification and segmentation tasks, their application to physically interpretable regression remains largely unexplored. Furthermore, the multi-spectral nature and geospatial heterogeneity of remote sensing data pose significant challenges for generalization and transferability. To address these issues, we introduce SatelliteCalculator, the first vision foundation model tailored for quantitative remote sensing inversion. By leveraging physically defined index formulas, we automatically construct a large-scale dataset of over one million paired samples across eight core ecological indicators. The model integrates a frozen Swin Transformer backbone with a prompt-guided architecture, featuring cross-attentive adapters and lightweight task-specific MLP decoders. Experiments on the Open-Canopy benchmark demonstrate that SatelliteCalculator achieves competitive accuracy across all tasks while significantly reducing inference cost. Our results validate the feasibility of applying foundation models to quantitative inversion, and provide a scalable framework for task-adaptive remote sensing estimation.</p></details> |  |

However, the development of robust deep learning models for digital cytology is challenging due to the heterogeneity in staining and preparation methods of samples, differences across organs, and the limited availability of large, diverse, annotated datasets. Developing a task-specific model for every cytology application is impractical and non-cytology-specific foundation models struggle to generalize to tasks in this domain where the emphasis is on cell morphology. To address these challenges, we introduce CytoFM, the first cytology self-supervised foundation model. Using iBOT, a self-supervised Vision Transformer (ViT) training framework incorporating masked image modeling and self-distillation, we pretrain CytoFM on a diverse collection of cytology datasets to learn robust, transferable representations. We evaluate CytoFM on multiple downstream cytology tasks, including breast cancer classification and cell type identification, using an attention-based multiple instance learning framework. Our results demonstrate that CytoFM performs better on two out of three downstream tasks than existing foundation models pretrained on histopathology (UNI) or natural images (iBOT-Imagenet). Visualizations of learned representations demonstrate our model is able to attend to cytologically relevant features. Despite a small pre-training dataset, CytoFM's promising results highlight the ability of task-agnostic pre-training approaches to learn robust and generalizable features from cytology data.</p></details> |  |

However, AI security (i.e., the safeguarding of data, models, and pipelines from adversarial manipulation) underpins all of these efforts. This manuscript posits that AI security must be prioritized as a foundational layer. We present a hierarchical view of AI challenges, distinguishing security from safety, and argue for a security-first approach to enable trustworthy and resilient AI systems. We discuss core threat models, key attack vectors, and emerging defense mechanisms, concluding that a metric-driven approach to AI security is essential for robust AI safety, transparency, and accountability.</p></details> |  |

At present, the curse of dimensionality remains one of the major bottlenecks in high-dimensional multi-label learning, which can be effectively addressed through multi-label feature selection methods. However, existing multi-label feature selection methods mostly focus on identifying global features shared across all labels, which overlooks personalized characteristics and specific requirements of individual labels. This global-only perspective may limit the ability to capture label-specific discriminative information, thereby affecting overall performance. In this paper, we propose a novel method called GPMFS (Global Foundation and Personalized Optimization for Multi-Label Feature Selection). GPMFS firstly identifies global features by exploiting label correlations, then adaptively supplements each label with a personalized subset of discriminative features using a threshold-controlled strategy. Experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that GPMFS achieves superior performance while maintaining strong interpretability and robustness. Furthermore, GPMFS provides insights into the label-specific strength across different multi-label datasets, thereby demonstrating the necessity and potential applicability of personalized feature selection approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Post-pre-training for Modality Alignment in Vision-Language Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12717v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive language image pre-training (CLIP) is an essential component of building modern vision-language foundation models. While CLIP demonstrates remarkable zero-shot performance on downstream tasks, the multi-modal feature spaces still suffer from a modality gap, which is a gap between image and text feature clusters and limits downstream task performance. Although existing works attempt to address the modality gap by modifying pre-training or fine-tuning, they struggle with heavy training costs with large datasets or degradations of zero-shot performance. This paper presents CLIP-Refine, a post-pre-training method for CLIP models at a phase between pre-training and fine-tuning. CLIP-Refine aims to align the feature space with 1 epoch training on small image-text datasets without zero-shot performance degradations. To this end, we introduce two techniques: random feature alignment (RaFA) and hybrid contrastive-distillation (HyCD). RaFA aligns the image and text features to follow a shared prior distribution by minimizing the distance to random reference vectors sampled from the prior. HyCD updates the model with hybrid soft labels generated by combining ground-truth image-text pair labels and outputs from the pre-trained CLIP model. This contributes to achieving both maintaining the past knowledge and learning new knowledge to align features. Our extensive experiments with multiple classification and retrieval tasks show that CLIP-Refine succeeds in mitigating the modality gap and improving the zero-shot performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025; Code: https://github.com/yshinya6/clip-refine</p></details> |

These can be used within data processing pipelines for machine learning tasks and numerical methods. We show how our GNPs can be trained to learn robust latent representations for the differential geometry of point-clouds to provide estimates of metric, curvature, and other shape-related features. We demonstrate how our pre-trained GNPs can be used (i) to estimate the geometric properties of surfaces of arbitrary shape and topologies with robustness in the presence of noise, (ii) to approximate solutions of geometric partial differential equations (PDEs) on manifolds, and (iii) to solve equations for shape deformations such as curvature driven flows. We release codes and weights for using GNPs in the package geo_neural_op. This allows for incorporating our pre-trained GNPs as components for reuse within existing and new data processing pipelines. The GNPs also can be used as part of numerical solvers involving geometry or as part of methods for performing inference and other geometric tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, addressing uncertainty in both perception (sensory interpretation) and decision-making (plan generation) remains a critical challenge for ensuring task reliability. We present a comprehensive framework to disentangle, quantify, and mitigate these two forms of uncertainty. We first introduce a framework for uncertainty disentanglement, isolating perception uncertainty arising from limitations in visual understanding and decision uncertainty relating to the robustness of generated plans. To quantify each type of uncertainty, we propose methods tailored to the unique properties of perception and decision-making: we use conformal prediction to calibrate perception uncertainty and introduce Formal-Methods-Driven Prediction (FMDP) to quantify decision uncertainty, leveraging formal verification techniques for theoretical guarantees. Building on this quantification, we implement two targeted intervention mechanisms: an active sensing process that dynamically re-observes high-uncertainty scenes to enhance visual input quality and an automated refinement procedure that fine-tunes the model on high-certainty data, improving its capability to meet task specifications. Empirical validation in real-world and simulated robotic tasks demonstrates that our uncertainty disentanglement framework reduces variability by up to 40% and enhances task success rates by 5% compared to baselines. These improvements are attributed to the combined effect of both interventions and highlight the importance of uncertainty disentanglement, which facilitates targeted interventions that enhance the robustness and reliability of autonomous systems.

We identify three key challenges for transceiver design: "hard to compute," "hard to model," and "hard to measure," and argue that AI can provide promising solutions. We propose three research roadmaps for AI algorithms tailored to THz UM-MIMO systems. The first, model-driven deep learning (DL), emphasizes leveraging domain knowledge and using AI to enhance bottleneck modules in established signal processing or optimization frameworks. We discuss four steps: algorithmic frameworks, basis algorithms, loss function design, and neural architecture design. The second roadmap presents channel station information (CSI) foundation models to unify transceiver module design by focusing on the wireless channel. We propose a compact foundation model to estimate wireless channel score functions, serving as a prior for designing transceiver modules.

However, the rapidly increasing size of foundation models poses a daunting challenge for accommodating foundation model fine-tuning in most commercial devices, which often have limited memory bandwidth. Techniques like model sharding and tensor parallelism address this issue by distributing computation across multiple devices to meet memory requirements. Nevertheless, these methods do not fully leverage their foundation nature in facilitating the fine-tuning process, resulting in high computational costs and imbalanced workloads. We introduce a novel Distributed Dynamic Fine-Tuning (D2FT) framework that strategically orchestrates operations across attention modules based on our observation that not all attention modules are necessary for forward and backward propagation in fine-tuning foundation models. Through three innovative selection strategies, D2FT significantly reduces the computational workload required for fine-tuning foundation models. Furthermore, D2FT addresses workload imbalances in distributed computing environments by optimizing these selection strategies via multiple knapsack optimization. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed D2FT framework reduces the training computational costs by 40% and training communication costs by 50% with only 1% to 2% accuracy drops on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Stanford Cars datasets. Moreover, the results show that D2FT can be effectively extended to recent LoRA, a state-of-the-art parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique. By reducing 40% computational cost or 50% communication cost, D2FT LoRA top-1 accuracy only drops 4% to 6% on Stanford Cars dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[A foundation for the distance sampling methodology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12439v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The population size ("abundance") of wildlife species has central interest in ecological research and management. Distance sampling is a dominant approach to the estimation of wildlife abundance for many vertebrate animal species. One perceived advantage of distance sampling over the well-known alternative approach of capture-recapture is that distance sampling is thought to be robust to unmodelled heterogeneity in animal detection probability, via a conjecture known as "pooling robustness". Although distance sampling has been successfully applied and developed for decades, its statistical foundation is not complete: there are published proofs and arguments highlighting deficiency of the methodology. This work provides a design-based statistical foundation for distance sampling that has attainable assumptions. In addition, because identification and consistency of the developed distance sampling abundance estimator is unaffected by detection heterogeneity, the pooling robustness conjecture is resolved.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Complex-valued SAR Foundation Model Based on Physically Inspired Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11999v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision foundation models in remote sensing have been extensively studied due to their superior generalization on various downstream tasks. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) offers all-day, all-weather imaging capabilities, providing significant advantages for Earth observation. However, establishing a foundation model for SAR image interpretation inevitably encounters the challenges of insufficient information utilization and poor interpretability. In this paper, we propose a remote sensing foundation model based on complex-valued SAR data, which simulates the polarimetric decomposition process for pre-training, i.e., characterizing pixel scattering intensity as a weighted combination of scattering bases and scattering coefficients, thereby endowing the foundation model with physical interpretability. Specifically, we construct a series of scattering queries, each representing an independent and meaningful scattering basis, which interact with SAR features in the scattering query decoder and output the corresponding scattering coefficient. To guide the pre-training process, polarimetric decomposition loss and power self-supervision loss are constructed. The former aligns the predicted coefficients with Yamaguchi coefficients, while the latter reconstructs power from the predicted coefficients and compares it to the input image's power. The performance of our foundation model is validated on six typical downstream tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results. Notably, the foundation model can extract stable feature representations and exhibits strong generalization, even in data-scarce conditions.</p></details> |  |

Systems like Circom simplify ZK development by combining witness computation and circuit constraints in one program. However, even small errors can compromise security of ZK programs --under-constrained circuits may accept invalid witnesses, while over-constrained ones may reject valid ones. Static analyzers are often imprecise with high false positives, and formal tools struggle with real-world circuit scale. Additionally, existing tools overlook several critical behaviors, such as intermediate computations and program aborts, and thus miss many vulnerabilities. Our theoretical contribution is the Trace-Constraint Consistency Test (TCCT), a foundational language-independent formulation of ZK circuit bugs that defines bugs as discrepancies between the execution traces of the computation and the circuit constraints. TCCT captures both intermediate computations and program aborts, detecting bugs that elude prior tools. Our systems contribution is zkFuzz, a novel program mutation-based fuzzing framework for detecting TCCT violations. zkFuzz systematically mutates the computational logic of Zk programs guided by a novel fitness function, and injects carefully crafted inputs using tailored heuristics to expose bugs. We evaluated zkFuzz on 354 real-world ZK circuits written in Circom, a leading programming system for ZK development. zkFuzz successfully identified 66 bugs, including 38 zero-days --18 of which were confirmed by developers and 6 fixed, earning bug bounties.</p></details> |  |

However, how to effectively train the network without using real-world labels remains a challenging problem. In this paper, driven by the recent advancements of vision foundation models, a novel method termed DFM-MVS, is proposed to leverage the depth foundation model to generate the effective depth prior, so as to boost MVS in the absence of real-world labels. Specifically, a depth prior-based pseudo-supervised training mechanism is developed to simulate realistic stereo correspondences using the generated depth prior, thereby constructing effective supervision for the MVS network. Besides, a depth prior-guided error correction strategy is presented to leverage the depth prior as guidance to mitigate the error propagation problem inherent in the widely-used coarse-to-fine network structure. Experimental results on DTU and Tanks & Temples datasets demonstrate that the proposed DFM-MVS significantly outperforms existing MVS methods without using real-world labels.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Forceful Robotic Foundation Models: a Literature Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11827v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This article reviews contemporary methods for integrating force, including both proprioception and tactile sensing, in robot manipulation policy learning. We conduct a comparative analysis on various approaches for sensing force, data collection, behavior cloning, tactile representation learning, and low-level robot control. From our analysis, we articulate when and why forces are needed, and highlight opportunities to improve learning of contact-rich, generalist robot policies on the path toward highly capable touch-based robot foundation models. We generally find that while there are few tasks such as pouring, peg-in-hole insertion, and handling delicate objects, the performance of imitation learning models is not at a level of dynamics where force truly matters. Also, force and touch are abstract quantities that can be inferred through a wide range of modalities and are often measured and controlled implicitly. We hope that juxtaposing the different approaches currently in use will help the reader to gain a systemic understanding and help inspire the next generation of robot foundation models.</p></details> | 20 pages, 9 figures |

While DUSt3R and its successors have achieved breakthroughs in 3D reconstruction from unposed images, these methods exhibit significant limitations when scaling to multi-view scenarios, including high computational cost and cumulative error induced by global alignment. To address these challenges, we propose Regist3R, a novel stereo foundation model tailored for efficient and scalable incremental reconstruction. Regist3R leverages an incremental reconstruction paradigm, enabling large-scale 3D reconstructions from unordered and many-view image collections. We evaluate Regist3R on public datasets for camera pose estimation and 3D reconstruction. Our experiments demonstrate that Regist3R achieves comparable performance with optimization-based methods while significantly improving computational efficiency, and outperforms existing multi-view reconstruction models. Furthermore, to assess its performance in real-world applications, we introduce a challenging oblique aerial dataset which has long spatial spans and hundreds of views. The results highlight the effectiveness of Regist3R. We also demonstrate the first attempt to reconstruct large-scale scenes encompassing over thousands of views through pointmap-based foundation models, showcasing its potential for practical applications in large-scale 3D reconstruction tasks, including urban modeling, aerial mapping, and beyond.</p></details> | 19 pages |
| **[Prototype-Guided Diffusion for Digital Pathology: Achieving Foundation Model Performance with Minimal Clinical Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12351v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models in digital pathology use massive datasets to learn useful compact feature representations of complex histology images. However, there is limited transparency into what drives the correlation between dataset size and performance, raising the question of whether simply adding more data to increase performance is always necessary. In this study, we propose a prototype-guided diffusion model to generate high-fidelity synthetic pathology data at scale, enabling large-scale self-supervised learning and reducing reliance on real patient samples while preserving downstream performance. Using guidance from histological prototypes during sampling, our approach ensures biologically and diagnostically meaningful variations in the generated data. We demonstrate that self-supervised features trained on our synthetic dataset achieve competitive performance despite using ~60x-760x less data than models trained on large real-world datasets. Notably, models trained using our synthetic data showed statistically comparable or better performance across multiple evaluation metrics and tasks, even when compared to models trained on orders of magnitude larger datasets. Our hybrid approach, combining synthetic and real data, further enhanced performance, achieving top results in several evaluations. These findings underscore the potential of generative AI to create compelling training data for digital pathology, significantly reducing the reliance on extensive clinical datasets and highlighting the efficiency of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[FACT: Foundation Model for Assessing Cancer Tissue Margins with Mass Spectrometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11519v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Purpose: Accurately classifying tissue margins during cancer surgeries is crucial for ensuring complete tumor removal. Rapid Evaporative Ionization Mass Spectrometry (REIMS), a tool for real-time intraoperative margin assessment, generates spectra that require machine learning models to support clinical decision-making. However, the scarcity of labeled data in surgical contexts presents a significant challenge. This study is the first to develop a foundation model tailored specifically for REIMS data, addressing this limitation and advancing real-time surgical margin assessment. Methods: We propose FACT, a Foundation model for Assessing Cancer Tissue margins. FACT is an adaptation of a foundation model originally designed for text-audio association, pretrained using our proposed supervised contrastive approach based on triplet loss. An ablation study is performed to compare our proposed model against other models and pretraining methods. Results: Our proposed model significantly improves the classification performance, achieving state-of-the-art performance with an AUROC of $82.4\% \pm 0.8$. The results demonstrate the advantage of our proposed pretraining method and selected backbone over the self-supervised and semi-supervised baselines and alternative models. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that foundation models, adapted and pretrained using our novel approach, can effectively classify REIMS data even with limited labeled examples. This highlights the viability of foundation models for enhancing real-time surgical margin assessment, particularly in data-scarce clinical environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Zero-Shot Whole-Body Humanoid Control via Behavioral Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11054v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised reinforcement learning (RL) aims at pre-training agents that can solve a wide range of downstream tasks in complex environments. Despite recent advancements, existing approaches suffer from several limitations: they may require running an RL process on each downstream task to achieve a satisfactory performance, they may need access to datasets with good coverage or well-curated task-specific samples, or they may pre-train policies with unsupervised losses that are poorly correlated with the downstream tasks of interest. In this paper, we introduce a novel algorithm regularizing unsupervised RL towards imitating trajectories from unlabeled behavior datasets. The key technical novelty of our method, called Forward-Backward Representations with Conditional-Policy Regularization, is to train forward-backward representations to embed the unlabeled trajectories to the same latent space used to represent states, rewards, and policies, and use a latent-conditional discriminator to encourage policies to ``cover'' the states in the unlabeled behavior dataset. As a result, we can learn policies that are well aligned with the behaviors in the dataset, while retaining zero-shot generalization capabilities for reward-based and imitation tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this new approach in a challenging humanoid control problem: leveraging observation-only motion capture datasets, we train Meta Motivo, the first humanoid behavioral foundation model that can be prompted to solve a variety of whole-body tasks, including motion tracking, goal reaching, and reward optimization. The resulting model is capable of expressing human-like behaviors and it achieves competitive performance with task-specific methods while outperforming state-of-the-art unsupervised RL and model-based baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Bridging Distribution Gaps in Time Series Foundation Model Pretraining with Prototype-Guided Normalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10900v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have achieved remarkable success across diverse machine-learning domains through large-scale pretraining on large, diverse datasets. However, pretraining on such datasets introduces significant challenges due to substantial mismatches in data distributions, a problem particularly pronounced with time series data. In this paper, we tackle this issue by proposing a domain-aware adaptive normalization strategy within the Transformer architecture. Specifically, we replace the traditional LayerNorm with a prototype-guided dynamic normalization mechanism (ProtoNorm), where learned prototypes encapsulate distinct data distributions, and sample-to-prototype affinity determines the appropriate normalization layer. This mechanism effectively captures the heterogeneity of time series characteristics, aligning pretrained representations with downstream tasks. Through comprehensive empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms conventional pretraining techniques across both classification and forecasting tasks, while effectively mitigating the adverse effects of distribution shifts during pretraining. Incorporating ProtoNorm is as simple as replacing a single line of code. Extensive experiments on diverse real-world time series benchmarks validate the robustness and generalizability of our approach, advancing the development of more versatile time series foundation models.</p></details> |  |

Despite these advances, existing evaluation frameworks are insufficient for assessing model performance in iterative, context-rich workflows characteristic of SE activities. To address this limitation, we introduce SE Arena, an interactive platform designed to evaluate SE-focused chatbots. SE Arena provides a transparent, open-source leaderboard, supports multi-round conversational workflows, and enables end-to-end model comparisons. The platform introduces novel metrics, including the consistency score that measures model consistency through self-play matches. Moreover, SE Arena incorporates a new feature called RepoChat, which automatically injects repository-related context (e.g., issues, commits, pull requests) into the conversation, further aligning evaluations with real-world development processes. This paper outlines the design and capabilities of SE Arena, emphasizing its potential to advance the evaluation and practical application of FMs in software engineering.</p></details> | <details><summary>Check...</summary><p>Check the arena at https://huggingface.co/spaces/SE-Arena/Software-Engineering-Arena</p></details> |

However, existing DGSS methods often rely exclusively on either VFMs or VLMs, overlooking their complementary strengths. VFMs (e.g., DINOv2) excel at capturing fine-grained features, while VLMs (e.g., CLIP) provide robust text alignment but struggle with coarse granularity. Despite their complementary strengths, effectively integrating VFMs and VLMs with attention mechanisms is challenging, as the increased patch tokens complicate long-sequence modeling. To address this, we propose MFuser, a novel Mamba-based fusion framework that efficiently combines the strengths of VFMs and VLMs while maintaining linear scalability in sequence length. MFuser consists of two key components: MVFuser, which acts as a co-adapter to jointly fine-tune the two models by capturing both sequential and spatial dynamics; and MTEnhancer, a hybrid attention-Mamba module that refines text embeddings by incorporating image priors. Our approach achieves precise feature locality and strong text alignment without incurring significant computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MFuser significantly outperforms state-of-the-art DGSS methods, achieving 68.20 mIoU on synthetic-to-real and 71.87 mIoU on real-to-real benchmarks.

However, due to the high computation complexity of adversarial training, it is not feasible to fine-tune the foundation model to improve its robustness on the downstream task. Observing the above challenge, we want to improve the downstream robustness without updating/accessing the weights in the foundation model. Inspired from existing literature in robustness inheritance (Kim et al., 2020), through theoretical investigation, we identify a close relationship between robust contrastive learning with the adversarial robustness of supervised learning. To further validate and utilize this theoretical insight, we design a simple-yet-effective robust auto-encoder as a data pre-processing method before feeding the data into the foundation model. The proposed approach has zero access to the foundation model when training the robust auto-encoder. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in improving the robustness of downstream tasks, verifying the connection between the feature robustness (implied by small adversarial contrastive loss) and the robustness of the downstream task.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 2 figures, 12 tables.

This is primarily due to the inherent data variability and diversity of downstream tasks. In this paper, we introduce a novel universal 3D pre-training framework designed to facilitate the acquisition of efficient 3D representation, thereby establishing a pathway to 3D foundational models. Considering that informative 3D features should encode rich geometry and appearance cues that can be utilized to render realistic images, we propose to learn 3D representations by differentiable neural rendering. We train a 3D backbone with a devised volumetric neural renderer by comparing the rendered with the real images. Notably, our approach seamlessly integrates the learned 3D encoder into various downstream tasks. These tasks encompass not only high-level challenges such as 3D detection and segmentation but also low-level objectives like 3D reconstruction and image synthesis, spanning both indoor and outdoor scenarios. Besides, we also illustrate the capability of pre-training a 2D backbone using the proposed methodology, surpassing conventional pre-training methods by a large margin. For the first time, PonderV2 achieves state-of-the-art performance on 11 indoor and outdoor benchmarks, implying its effectiveness.

Video datasets, however, are often released as extracted features (i.e., tabular data) rather than raw footage due to privacy and ethical concerns. Prior research on such tabular datasets established tree-based classical machine learning approaches as the best-performing models. Motivated by the recent success of textual foundation models (i.e., large language models), we explore the use of tabular foundation models in empathy detection from tabular visual features. We experiment with two recent tabular foundation models $-$ TabPFN v2 and TabICL $-$ through in-context learning and fine-tuning setups. Our experiments on a public human-robot interaction benchmark demonstrate a significant boost in cross-subject empathy detection accuracy over several strong baselines (accuracy: $0.590 \rightarrow 0.730$; AUC: $0.564 \rightarrow 0.669$). In addition to performance improvement, we contribute novel insights and an evaluation setup to ensure generalisation on unseen subjects in this public benchmark. As the practice of releasing video features as tabular datasets is likely to persist due to privacy constraints, our findings will be widely applicable to future empathy detection video datasets as well.</p></details> |  |

These models facilitate the understanding of matter and the discovery of new molecules and materials. In contrast to GNNs operating on a large homogeneous graphs, GNNs used by CFMs process a large number of geometric graphs of varying sizes, requiring different optimization strategies than those developed for large homogeneous GNNs. This paper presents optimizations for two critical phases of CFM training: data distribution and model training, targeting MACE - a state-of-the-art CFM. We address the challenge of load balancing in data distribution by formulating it as a multi-objective bin packing problem. We propose an iterative algorithm that provides a highly effective, fast, and practical solution, ensuring efficient data distribution. For the training phase, we identify symmetric tensor contraction as the key computational kernel in MACE and optimize this kernel to improve the overall performance. Our combined approach of balanced data distribution and kernel optimization significantly enhances the training process of MACE. Experimental results demonstrate a substantial speedup, reducing per-epoch execution time for training from 12 to 2 minutes on 740 GPUs with a 2.6M sample dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at The 34th ACM International Symposium on High-Performance Parallel and Distributed Computing (HPDC 2025)</p></details> |

The success of these models can be attributed to their ability to effectively learn latent representations of atomic structures directly from the training data. Conversely, this also results in high data requirements for these models, hindering their application to problems which are data sparse which are common in this domain. To address this limitation, there is a growing development in the area of pre-trained machine learning models which have learned general, fundamental, geometric relationships in atomistic data, and which can then be fine-tuned to much smaller application-specific datasets. In particular, models which are pre-trained on diverse, large-scale atomistic datasets have shown impressive generalizability and flexibility to downstream applications, and are increasingly referred to as atomistic foundation models. To leverage the untapped potential of these foundation models, we introduce MatterTune, a modular and extensible framework that provides advanced fine-tuning capabilities and seamless integration of atomistic foundation models into downstream materials informatics and simulation workflows, thereby lowering the barriers to adoption and facilitating diverse applications in materials science. In its current state, MatterTune supports a number of state-of-the-art foundation models such as ORB, MatterSim, JMP, and EquformerV2, and hosts a wide range of features including a modular and flexible design, distributed and customizable fine-tuning, broad support for downstream informatics tasks, and more.</p></details> |  |
