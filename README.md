| **[3DLLM-Mem: Long-Term Spatial-Temporal Memory for Embodied 3D Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22657v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans excel at performing complex tasks by leveraging long-term memory across temporal and spatial experiences. In contrast, current Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to effectively plan and act in dynamic, multi-room 3D environments. We posit that part of this limitation is due to the lack of proper 3D spatial-temporal memory modeling in LLMs. To address this, we first introduce 3DMem-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark comprising over 26,000 trajectories and 2,892 embodied tasks, question-answering and captioning, designed to evaluate an agent's ability to reason over long-term memory in 3D environments. Second, we propose 3DLLM-Mem, a novel dynamic memory management and fusion model for embodied spatial-temporal reasoning and actions in LLMs. Our model uses working memory tokens, which represents current observations, as queries to selectively attend to and fuse the most useful spatial and temporal features from episodic memory, which stores past observations and interactions. Our approach allows the agent to focus on task-relevant information while maintaining memory efficiency in complex, long-horizon environments. Experimental results demonstrate that 3DLLM-Mem achieves state-of-the-art performance across various tasks, outperforming the strongest baselines by 16.5% in success rate on 3DMem-Bench's most challenging in-the-wild embodied tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>demos...</summary><p>demos at: https://3dllm-mem.github.io</p></details> |
| **[Spatial Knowledge Graph-Guided Multimodal Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22633v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have significantly enhanced their capabilities; however, their spatial perception abilities remain a notable limitation. To address this challenge, multimodal data synthesis offers a promising solution. Yet, ensuring that synthesized data adhere to spatial common sense is a non-trivial task. In this work, we introduce SKG2Data, a novel multimodal synthesis approach guided by spatial knowledge graphs, grounded in the concept of knowledge-to-data generation. SKG2Data automatically constructs a Spatial Knowledge Graph (SKG) to emulate human-like perception of spatial directions and distances, which is subsequently utilized to guide multimodal data synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that data synthesized from diverse types of spatial knowledge, including direction and distance, not only enhance the spatial perception and reasoning abilities of MLLMs but also exhibit strong generalization capabilities. We hope that the idea of knowledge-based data synthesis can advance the development of spatial intelligence.</p></details> | Ongoing work |
| **[Using spatial extreme-value theory with machine learning to model and understand spatially compounding weather extremes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12195v5)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When extreme weather events affect large areas, their regional to sub-continental spatial scale is important for their impacts. We propose a novel machine learning (ML) framework that integrates spatial extreme-value theory to model weather extremes and to quantify probabilities associated with the occurrence, intensity, and spatial extent of these events. Our approach employs new loss functions adapted to extreme values, enabling our model to prioritize the tail rather than the bulk of the data distribution. Applied to a case study of Western European summertime heat extremes, we use daily 500-hPa geopotential height fields and local soil moisture as predictors to capture the complex interplay between local and remote physical processes. Our generative model reveals that different facets of heat extremes are influenced by individual circulation features, such as the relative position of upper-level ridges and troughs that are part of a large-scale wave pattern. This enriches our process understanding from a data-driven perspective. Our approach can extrapolate beyond the range of the data to make risk-related probabilistic statements. It applies more generally to other weather extremes and offers an alternative to traditional physical and ML-based techniques that focus less on the extremal aspects of weather data.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Meeseeks Mesh: Spatially Consistent 3D Adversarial Objects for BEV Detector](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22499v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D object detection is a critical component in autonomous driving systems. It allows real-time recognition and detection of vehicles, pedestrians and obstacles under varying environmental conditions. Among existing methods, 3D object detection in the Bird's Eye View (BEV) has emerged as the mainstream framework. To guarantee a safe, robust and trustworthy 3D object detection, 3D adversarial attacks are investigated, where attacks are placed in 3D environments to evaluate the model performance, e.g., putting a film on a car, clothing a pedestrian. The vulnerability of 3D object detection models to 3D adversarial attacks serves as an important indicator to evaluate the robustness of the model against perturbations. To investigate this vulnerability, we generate non-invasive 3D adversarial objects tailored for real-world attack scenarios. Our method verifies the existence of universal adversarial objects that are spatially consistent across time and camera views. Specifically, we employ differentiable rendering techniques to accurately model the spatial relationship between adversarial objects and the target vehicle. Furthermore, we introduce an occlusion-aware module to enhance visual consistency and realism under different viewpoints. To maintain attack effectiveness across multiple frames, we design a BEV spatial feature-guided optimization strategy. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can reliably suppress vehicle predictions from state-of-the-art 3D object detectors, serving as an important tool to test robustness of 3D object detection models before deployment. Moreover, the generated adversarial objects exhibit strong generalization capabilities, retaining its effectiveness at various positions and distances in the scene.</p></details> |  |
| **[COSMOS: A Data-Driven Probabilistic Time Series simulator for Chemical Plumes across Spatial Scales](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22436v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of robust odor navigation strategies for automated environmental monitoring applications requires realistic simulations of odor time series for agents moving across large spatial scales. Traditional approaches that rely on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods can capture the spatiotemporal dynamics of odor plumes, but are impractical for large-scale simulations due to their computational expense. On the other hand, puff-based simulations, although computationally tractable for large scales and capable of capturing the stochastic nature of plumes, fail to reproduce naturalistic odor statistics. Here, we present COSMOS (Configurable Odor Simulation Model over Scalable Spaces), a data-driven probabilistic framework that synthesizes realistic odor time series from spatial and temporal features of real datasets. COSMOS generates similar distributions of key statistical features such as whiff frequency, duration, and concentration as observed in real data, while dramatically reducing computational overhead. By reproducing critical statistical properties across a variety of flow regimes and scales, COSMOS enables the development and evaluation of agent-based navigation strategies with naturalistic odor experiences. To demonstrate its utility, we compare odor-tracking agents exposed to CFD-generated plumes versus COSMOS simulations, showing that both their odor experiences and resulting behaviors are quite similar.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 4 primary figures</p></details> |
| **[Smooth Sailing: Lipschitz-Driven Uncertainty Quantification for Spatial Association](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06067v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating associations between spatial covariates and responses - rather than merely predicting responses - is central to environmental science, epidemiology, and economics. For instance, public health officials might be interested in whether air pollution has a strictly positive association with a health outcome, and the magnitude of any effect. Standard machine learning methods often provide accurate predictions but offer limited insight into covariate-response relationships. And we show that existing methods for constructing confidence (or credible) intervals for associations fail to provide nominal coverage in the face of model misspecification and distribution shift - despite both being essentially always present in spatial problems. We introduce a method that constructs valid frequentist confidence intervals for associations in spatial settings. Our method requires minimal assumptions beyond a form of spatial smoothness. In particular, we do not require model correctness or covariate overlap between training and target locations. Our approach is the first to guarantee nominal coverage in this setting and outperforms existing techniques in both real and simulated experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contributed equally; 36 pages, 14 figures</p></details> |
| **[Post-processing of wind gusts from COSMO-REA6 with a spatial Bayesian hierarchical extreme value model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22182v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The aim of this study is to provide a probabilistic gust analysis for the region of Germany that is calibrated with station observations and with an interpolation to unobserved locations. To this end, we develop a spatial Bayesian hierarchical model (BHM) for the post-processing of surface maximum wind gusts from the COSMO-REA6 reanalysis. Our approach uses a non-stationary extreme value distribution for the gust observations, with parameters that vary according to a linear model using COSMO-REA6 predictor variables. To capture spatial patterns in surface wind gust behavior, the regression coefficients are modeled as 2-dimensional Gaussian random fields with a constant mean and an isotropic covariance function that depends on the distance between locations. In addition, we include an elevation offset in the distance metric for the covariance function to account for the topography. This allows us to include data from mountaintop stations in the training process. The training of the BHM is carried out with an independent data set from which the data at the station to be predicted are excluded. We evaluate the spatial prediction performance at the withheld station using Brier score and quantile score, including their decomposition, and compare the performance of our BHM to climatological forecasts and a non-hierarchical, spatially constant baseline model. This is done for 109 weather stations in Germany. Compared to the spatially constant baseline model, the spatial BHM significantly improves the estimation of local gust parameters. It shows up to 5 % higher skill for prediction quantiles and provides a particularly improved skill for extreme wind gusts. In addition, the BHM improves the prediction of threshold levels at most of the stations. Although a spatially constant approach already provides high skill, our BHM further improves predictions and improves spatial consistency.</p></details> | <details><summary>41 Pa...</summary><p>41 Pages, 17 figures.

| **[FireFly-S: Exploiting Dual-Side Sparsity for Spiking Neural Networks Acceleration with Reconfigurable Spatial Architecture](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15578v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), with their brain-inspired structure using discrete spikes instead of continuous activations, are gaining attention for their potential of efficient processing on neuromorphic chips. While current SNN hardware accelerators often prioritize temporal spike sparsity, exploiting sparse synaptic weights offers significant untapped potential for even greater efficiency. To address this, we propose FireFly-S, a Sparse extension of the FireFly series. This co-optimized software-hardware design focusing on leveraging dual-side sparsity for acceleration. On the software side, we propose a novel algorithmic optimization framework that combines gradient rewiring for pruning and modified Learned Step Size Quantization (LSQ) tailored for SNNs, which achieves remarkable weight sparsity exceeding 85\% and enables efficient 4-bit quantization with negligible accuracy loss. On the hardware side, we present an efficient dual-side sparsity detector employing a Bitmap-based sparse decoding logic to pinpoint the positions of non-zero weights and input spikes. The logic allows for the direct bypassing of redundant computations, thereby enhancing computational efficiency. Different from the overlay architecture adopted by previous FireFly series, we adopt a spatial architecture with inter-layer pipelining that can fully exploit the nature of Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). A spatial-temporal dataflow is also proposed to support such inter-layer pipelining and avoid long-term temporal dependencies. In experiments conducted on the MNIST, DVS-Gesture and CIFAR-10 datasets, the FireFly-S model achieves 85-95\% sparsity with 4-bit quantization and the hardware accelerator effectively leverages the dual-side sparsity, delivering outstanding performance metrics of 10,047 FPS/W on MNIST, 3,683 FPS/W on DVS-Gesture, and 2,327 FPS/W on CIFAR-10.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Block-Based Change-Point Detection for Sparse Spatially Clustered Data with Applications in Remote Sensing Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21814v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a non-parametric change-point detection approach to detect potentially sparse changes in a time series of high-dimensional observations or non-Euclidean data objects. We target a change in distribution that occurs in a small, unknown subset of dimensions, where these dimensions may be correlated. Our work is motivated by a remote sensing application, where changes occur in small, spatially clustered regions over time. An adaptive block-based change-point detection framework is proposed that accounts for spatial dependencies across dimensions and leverages these dependencies to boost detection power and improve estimation accuracy. Through simulation studies, we demonstrate that our approach has superior performance in detecting sparse changes in datasets with spatial or local group structures. An application of the proposed method to detect activity, such as new construction, in remote sensing imagery of the Natanz Nuclear facility in Iran is presented to demonstrate the method's efficacy.</p></details> |  |
| **[ViewSpatial-Bench: Evaluating Multi-perspective Spatial Localization in Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21500v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding and reasoning about visual content, but significant challenges persist in tasks requiring cross-viewpoint understanding and spatial reasoning. We identify a critical limitation: current VLMs excel primarily at egocentric spatial reasoning (from the camera's perspective) but fail to generalize to allocentric viewpoints when required to adopt another entity's spatial frame of reference. We introduce ViewSpatial-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed specifically for multi-viewpoint spatial localization recognition evaluation across five distinct task types, supported by an automated 3D annotation pipeline that generates precise directional labels. Comprehensive evaluation of diverse VLMs on ViewSpatial-Bench reveals a significant performance disparity: models demonstrate reasonable performance on camera-perspective tasks but exhibit reduced accuracy when reasoning from a human viewpoint. By fine-tuning VLMs on our multi-perspective spatial dataset, we achieve an overall performance improvement of 46.24% across tasks, highlighting the efficacy of our approach. Our work establishes a crucial benchmark for spatial intelligence in embodied AI systems and provides empirical evidence that modeling 3D spatial relationships enhances VLMs' corresponding spatial comprehension capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project: https://zju-real.github.io/ViewSpatial-Page/</p></details> |
| **[ZigzagPointMamba: Spatial-Semantic Mamba for Point Cloud Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21381v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State Space models (SSMs) such as PointMamba enable efficient feature extraction for point cloud self-supervised learning with linear complexity, outperforming Transformers in computational efficiency. However, existing PointMamba-based methods depend on complex token ordering and random masking, which disrupt spatial continuity and local semantic correlations. We propose ZigzagPointMamba to tackle these challenges. The core of our approach is a simple zigzag scan path that globally sequences point cloud tokens, enhancing spatial continuity by preserving the proximity of spatially adjacent point tokens. Nevertheless, random masking undermines local semantic modeling in self-supervised learning. To address this, we introduce a Semantic-Siamese Masking Strategy (SMS), which masks semantically similar tokens to facilitate reconstruction by integrating local features of original and similar tokens. This overcomes the dependence on isolated local features and enables robust global semantic modeling. Our pre-trained ZigzagPointMamba weights significantly improve downstream tasks, achieving a 1.59% mIoU gain on ShapeNetPart for part segmentation, a 0.4% higher accuracy on ModelNet40 for classification, and 0.19%, 1.22%, and 0.72% higher accuracies respectively for the classification tasks on the OBJ-BG, OBJ-ONLY, and PB-T50-RS subsets of ScanObjectNN. The code is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ZigzagPointMamba-1800/</p></details> |  |
| **[SURDS: Benchmarking Spatial Understanding and Reasoning in Driving Scenarios with Vision Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13112v3)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate spatial reasoning in outdoor environments - covering geometry, object pose, and inter-object relationships - is fundamental to downstream tasks such as mapping, motion forecasting, and high-level planning in autonomous driving. We introduce SURDS, a large-scale benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the spatial reasoning capabilities of vision language models (VLMs). Built on the nuScenes dataset, SURDS comprises 41,080 vision-question-answer training instances and 9,250 evaluation samples, spanning six spatial categories: orientation, depth estimation, pixel-level localization, pairwise distance, lateral ordering, and front-behind relations. We benchmark leading general-purpose VLMs, including GPT, Gemini, and Qwen, revealing persistent limitations in fine-grained spatial understanding. To address these deficiencies, we go beyond static evaluation and explore whether alignment techniques can improve spatial reasoning performance. Specifically, we propose a reinforcement learning-based alignment scheme leveraging spatially grounded reward signals - capturing both perception-level accuracy (location) and reasoning consistency (logic). We further incorporate final-answer correctness and output-format rewards to guide fine-grained policy adaptation. Our GRPO-aligned variant achieves an overall score of 40.80 in the SURDS benchmark. Notably, it outperforms proprietary systems such as GPT-4o (13.30) and Gemini-2.0-flash (35.71). To our best knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that reinforcement learning-based alignment can significantly and consistently enhance the spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs in real-world driving contexts. We release the SURDS benchmark, evaluation toolkit, and GRPO alignment code through: https://github.com/XiandaGuo/Drive-MLLM.</p></details> |  |

However, existing multimodal mathematics benchmarks mainly focus on plane geometry and largely ignore solid geometry, which requires spatial reasoning and is more challenging than plane geometry. To address this critical gap, we introduce SolidGeo, the first large-scale benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the performance of MLLMs on mathematical reasoning tasks in solid geometry. SolidGeo consists of 3,113 real-world K-12 and competition-level problems, each paired with visual context and annotated with difficulty levels and fine-grained solid geometry categories. Our benchmark covers a wide range of 3D reasoning subjects such as projection, unfolding, spatial measurement, and spatial vector, offering a rigorous testbed for assessing solid geometry. Through extensive experiments, we observe that MLLMs encounter substantial challenges in solid geometry math tasks, with a considerable performance gap relative to human capabilities on SolidGeo. Moreover, we analyze the performance, inference efficiency and error patterns of various models, offering insights into the solid geometric mathematical reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. We hope SolidGeo serves as a catalyst for advancing MLLMs toward deeper geometric reasoning and spatial intelligence.</p></details> |  |

AI agents with the spatial planning ability can better adapt to various real-world applications, including robotic manipulation, automatic assembly, urban planning etc. Recent works have attempted to construct benchmarks for evaluating the spatial intelligence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Nevertheless, these benchmarks primarily focus on spatial reasoning based on typical Visual Question-Answering (VQA) forms, which suffers from the gap between abstract spatial understanding and concrete task execution. In this work, we take a step further to build a comprehensive benchmark called MineAnyBuild, aiming to evaluate the spatial planning ability of open-world AI agents in the Minecraft game. Specifically, MineAnyBuild requires an agent to generate executable architecture building plans based on the given multi-modal human instructions. It involves 4,000 curated spatial planning tasks and also provides a paradigm for infinitely expandable data collection by utilizing rich player-generated content. MineAnyBuild evaluates spatial planning through four core supporting dimensions: spatial understanding, spatial reasoning, creativity, and spatial commonsense. Based on MineAnyBuild, we perform a comprehensive evaluation for existing MLLM-based agents, revealing the severe limitations but enormous potential in their spatial planning abilities. We believe our MineAnyBuild will open new avenues for the evaluation of spatial intelligence and help promote further development for open-world AI agents capable of spatial planning.</p></details> |  |
| **[SPhyR: Spatial-Physical Reasoning Benchmark on Material Distribution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16048v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel dataset designed to benchmark the physical and spatial reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLM) based on topology optimization, a method for computing optimal material distributions within a design space under prescribed loads and supports. In this dataset, LLMs are provided with conditions such as 2D boundary, applied forces and supports, and must reason about the resulting optimal material distribution. The dataset includes a variety of tasks, ranging from filling in masked regions within partial structures to predicting complete material distributions. Solving these tasks requires understanding the flow of forces and the required material distribution under given constraints, without access to simulation tools or explicit physical models, challenging models to reason about structural stability and spatial organization. Our dataset targets the evaluation of spatial and physical reasoning abilities in 2D settings, offering a complementary perspective to traditional language and logic benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[FeatInv: Spatially resolved mapping from feature space to input space using conditional diffusion models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21032v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Internal representations are crucial for understanding deep neural networks, such as their properties and reasoning patterns, but remain difficult to interpret. While mapping from feature space to input space aids in interpreting the former, existing approaches often rely on crude approximations. We propose using a conditional diffusion model - a pretrained high-fidelity diffusion model conditioned on spatially resolved feature maps - to learn such a mapping in a probabilistic manner. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach across various pretrained image classifiers from CNNs to ViTs, showing excellent reconstruction capabilities. Through qualitative comparisons and robustness analysis, we validate our method and showcase possible applications, such as the visualization of concept steering in input space or investigations of the composite nature of the feature space. This approach has broad potential for improving feature space understanding in computer vision models.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 10 figures, code is available at https://github.com/AI4HealthUOL/FeatInv</p></details> |
| **[Spatial RoboGrasp: Generalized Robotic Grasping Control Policy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20814v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving generalizable and precise robotic manipulation across diverse environments remains a critical challenge, largely due to limitations in spatial perception. While prior imitation-learning approaches have made progress, their reliance on raw RGB inputs and handcrafted features often leads to overfitting and poor 3D reasoning under varied lighting, occlusion, and object conditions. In this paper, we propose a unified framework that couples robust multimodal perception with reliable grasp prediction. Our architecture fuses domain-randomized augmentation, monocular depth estimation, and a depth-aware 6-DoF Grasp Prompt into a single spatial representation for downstream action planning. Conditioned on this encoding and a high-level task prompt, our diffusion-based policy yields precise action sequences, achieving up to 40% improvement in grasp success and 45% higher task success rates under environmental variation. These results demonstrate that spatially grounded perception, paired with diffusion-based imitation learning, offers a scalable and robust solution for general-purpose robotic grasping.</p></details> |  |
| **[Byzantine-Resilient Distributed P2P Energy Trading via Spatial-Temporal Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20567v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distributed peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading mandates an escalating coupling between the physical power network and communication network, necessitating high-frequency sharing of real-time data among prosumers. However, this data-sharing scheme renders the system vulnerable to various malicious behaviors, as Byzantine agents can initiate cyberattacks by injecting sophisticated false data. To better investigate the impacts of malicious Byzantine faults, this paper develops a fully distributed P2P energy trading model by accounting for the high-fidelity physical network constraints. To further detect Byzantine faults and mitigate their impacts on distributed P2P energy trading problem, we propose an online spatial-temporal anomaly detection approach by leveraging the tensor learning method, which is informed by the domain knowledge to enable awesome detection performance. Moreover, to enhance its computational efficiency, we further develop closed-form solutions for the proposed detection approach. Subsequently, we derive theoretical conditions for guaranteeing optimality and convergence of the distributed P2P energy trading problem with anomaly detection mechanisms. Results from numerical simulations validate the effectiveness, optimality, and scalability of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Direct3D-S2: Gigascale 3D Generation Made Easy with Spatial Sparse Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17412v2)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating high-resolution 3D shapes using volumetric representations such as Signed Distance Functions (SDFs) presents substantial computational and memory challenges. We introduce Direct3D-S2, a scalable 3D generation framework based on sparse volumes that achieves superior output quality with dramatically reduced training costs. Our key innovation is the Spatial Sparse Attention (SSA) mechanism, which greatly enhances the efficiency of Diffusion Transformer (DiT) computations on sparse volumetric data. SSA allows the model to effectively process large token sets within sparse volumes, substantially reducing computational overhead and achieving a 3.9x speedup in the forward pass and a 9.6x speedup in the backward pass. Our framework also includes a variational autoencoder (VAE) that maintains a consistent sparse volumetric format across input, latent, and output stages. Compared to previous methods with heterogeneous representations in 3D VAE, this unified design significantly improves training efficiency and stability. Our model is trained on public available datasets, and experiments demonstrate that Direct3D-S2 not only surpasses state-of-the-art methods in generation quality and efficiency, but also enables training at 1024 resolution using only 8 GPUs, a task typically requiring at least 32 GPUs for volumetric representations at 256 resolution, thus making gigascale 3D generation both practical and accessible.

| **[STAR-R1: Spatial TrAnsformation Reasoning by Reinforcing Multimodal LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15804v2)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse tasks, yet they lag significantly behind humans in spatial reasoning. We investigate this gap through Transformation-Driven Visual Reasoning (TVR), a challenging task requiring identification of object transformations across images under varying viewpoints. While traditional Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) fails to generate coherent reasoning paths in cross-view settings, sparse-reward Reinforcement Learning (RL) suffers from inefficient exploration and slow convergence. To address these limitations, we propose STAR-R1, a novel framework that integrates a single-stage RL paradigm with a fine-grained reward mechanism tailored for TVR. Specifically, STAR-R1 rewards partial correctness while penalizing excessive enumeration and passive inaction, enabling efficient exploration and precise reasoning. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that STAR-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance across all 11 metrics, outperforming SFT by 23% in cross-view scenarios. Further analysis reveals STAR-R1's anthropomorphic behavior and highlights its unique ability to compare all objects for improving spatial reasoning. Our work provides critical insights in advancing the research of MLLMs and reasoning models. The codes, model weights, and data will be publicly available at https://github.com/zongzhao23/STAR-R1.</p></details> |  |
| **[Balancing Interference and Correlation in Spatial Experimental Designs: A Causal Graph Cut Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20130v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper focuses on the design of spatial experiments to optimize the amount of information derived from the experimental data and enhance the accuracy of the resulting causal effect estimator. We propose a surrogate function for the mean squared error (MSE) of the estimator, which facilitates the use of classical graph cut algorithms to learn the optimal design. Our proposal offers three key advances: (1) it accommodates moderate to large spatial interference effects; (2) it adapts to different spatial covariance functions; (3) it is computationally efficient. Theoretical results and numerical experiments based on synthetic environments and a dispatch simulator that models a city-scale ridesharing market, further validate the effectiveness of our design. A python implementation of our method is available at https://github.com/Mamba413/CausalGraphCut.</p></details> | Accepted by ICML2025 |
| **[Agentic 3D Scene Generation with Spatially Contextualized VLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20129v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent advances in multimodal content generation enabled by vision-language models (VLMs), their ability to reason about and generate structured 3D scenes remains largely underexplored. This limitation constrains their utility in spatially grounded tasks such as embodied AI, immersive simulations, and interactive 3D applications. We introduce a new paradigm that enables VLMs to generate, understand, and edit complex 3D environments by injecting a continually evolving spatial context. Constructed from multimodal input, this context consists of three components: a scene portrait that provides a high-level semantic blueprint, a semantically labeled point cloud capturing object-level geometry, and a scene hypergraph that encodes rich spatial relationships, including unary, binary, and higher-order constraints. Together, these components provide the VLM with a structured, geometry-aware working memory that integrates its inherent multimodal reasoning capabilities with structured 3D understanding for effective spatial reasoning. Building on this foundation, we develop an agentic 3D scene generation pipeline in which the VLM iteratively reads from and updates the spatial context. The pipeline features high-quality asset generation with geometric restoration, environment setup with automatic verification, and ergonomic adjustment guided by the scene hypergraph. Experiments show that our framework can handle diverse and challenging inputs, achieving a level of generalization not observed in prior work. Further results demonstrate that injecting spatial context enables VLMs to perform downstream tasks such as interactive scene editing and path planning, suggesting strong potential for spatially intelligent systems in computer graphics, 3D vision, and embodied applications.</p></details> |  |

Given the limitations of conventional signal processing and the scarcity of deep learning approaches to spatial aliasing mitigation, we propose a novel approach using a U-Net architecture to predict a signal-dependent de-aliasing filter, which reduces aliasing in conventional beamforming for spatial capture. Two types of multichannel filters are considered, one which treats the channels independently and a second one that models cross-channel dependencies. The proposed approach is evaluated in two common spatial capture scenarios: stereo and first-order Ambisonics.

Achieving successful VSR requires producing realistic HR details and ensuring both spatial and temporal consistency. To restore realistic details, diffusion-based VSR approaches have recently been proposed. However, the inherent randomness of diffusion, combined with their tile-based approach, often leads to spatio-temporal inconsistencies. In this paper, we propose DC-VSR, a novel VSR approach to produce spatially and temporally consistent VSR results with realistic textures. To achieve spatial and temporal consistency, DC-VSR adopts a novel Spatial Attention Propagation (SAP) scheme and a Temporal Attention Propagation (TAP) scheme that propagate information across spatio-temporal tiles based on the self-attention mechanism. To enhance high-frequency details, we also introduce Detail-Suppression Self-Attention Guidance (DSSAG), a novel diffusion guidance scheme. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that DC-VSR achieves spatially and temporally consistent, high-quality VSR results, outperforming previous approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Equal...</summary><p>Equal contributions from first two authors</p></details> |

However, most existing dimension reduction techniques do not account for the spatial correlation between observations and do not take the downstream modeling task into consideration when finding the lower-dimensional representation. We formalize the closeness of approximation to the original data and the utility of lower-dimensional scores for downstream modeling as two complementary, sometimes conflicting, metrics for dimension reduction. We illustrate how existing methodologies fall into this framework and propose a flexible dimension reduction algorithm that achieves the optimal trade-off. We derive a computationally simple form for our algorithm and illustrate its performance through simulation studies, as well as two applications in air pollution modeling and spatial transcriptomics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Task Memory Engine: Spatial Memory for Robust Multi-Step LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19436v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) falter in multi-step interactions -- often hallucinating, repeating actions, or misinterpreting user corrections -- due to reliance on linear, unstructured context. This fragility stems from the lack of persistent memory to track evolving goals and task dependencies, undermining trust in autonomous agents. We introduce the Task Memory Engine (TME), a modular memory controller that transforms existing LLMs into robust, revision-aware agents without fine-tuning. TME implements a spatial memory framework that replaces flat context with graph-based structures to support consistent, multi-turn reasoning. Departing from linear concatenation and ReAct-style prompting, TME builds a dynamic task graph -- either a tree or directed acyclic graph (DAG) -- to map user inputs to subtasks, align them with prior context, and enable dependency-tracked revisions. Its Task Representation and Intent Management (TRIM) component models task semantics and user intent to ensure accurate interpretation. Across four multi-turn scenarios-trip planning, cooking, meeting scheduling, and shopping cart editing -- TME eliminates 100% of hallucinations and misinterpretations in three tasks, and reduces hallucinations by 66.7% and misinterpretations by 83.3% across 27 user turns, outperforming ReAct. TME's modular design supports plug-and-play deployment and domain-specific customization, adaptable to both personal assistants and enterprise automation. We release TME's codebase, benchmarks, and components as open-source resources, enabling researchers to develop reliable LLM agents. TME's scalable architecture addresses a critical gap in agent performance across complex, interactive settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review. 9 pages main content, 15 pages appendix, 5 figures</p></details> |

To address this limitation, we develop a scalable Bayesian framework for spatially varying coefficient (SVC) models, implemented in the \pkg{svc} R package (available at https://github.com/jdta95/svc), which allows regression coefficients to vary smoothly over space. Our approach combines three key computational innovations: (1) a subset Gaussian process approximation that reduces the computational burden from $O(n^3)$ to $O(m^3)$ with $m<n$, while maintaining predictive accuracy; (2) a robust adaptive Metropolis (RAM) algorithm that automatically tunes proposal distributions for efficient MCMC sampling of spatial range parameters; and (3) optimized linear algebra operations leveraging precomputed distance matrices and Cholesky decompositions to accelerate covariance calculations. We present the model's theoretical foundation, prior specification, and Gibbs sampling algorithm, with a focus on practical implementation for large spatial datasets. Simulation studies demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in computational efficiency while maintaining competitive estimation accuracy. We illustrate its application in an analysis of land surface temperature (LST) data, revealing spatially varying effects of vegetation and emissivity that would be obscured by traditional regression techniques. The \pkg{svc} package provides researchers with a flexible, efficient tool for uncovering and quantifying nonstationary spatial relationships across diverse scientific domains.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present CMoS, a super-lightweight time series forecasting model. Instead of learning the embedding of the shapes, CMoS directly models the spatial correlations between different time series chunks. Additionally, we introduce a Correlation Mixing technique that enables the model to capture diverse spatial correlations with minimal parameters, and an optional Periodicity Injection technique to ensure faster convergence. Despite utilizing as low as 1% of the lightweight model DLinear's parameters count, experimental results demonstrate that CMoS outperforms existing state-of-the-art models across multiple datasets. Furthermore, the learned weights of CMoS exhibit great interpretability, providing practitioners with valuable insights into temporal structures within specific application scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Forty-second International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML'25)</p></details> |
| **[Can Multimodal Large Language Models Understand Spatial Relations?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19015v1)** | 2025-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial relation reasoning is a crucial task for multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to understand the objective world. However, current benchmarks have issues like relying on bounding boxes, ignoring perspective substitutions, or allowing questions to be answered using only the model's prior knowledge without image understanding. To address these issues, we introduce SpatialMQA, a human-annotated spatial relation reasoning benchmark based on COCO2017, which enables MLLMs to focus more on understanding images in the objective world. To ensure data quality, we design a well-tailored annotation procedure, resulting in SpatialMQA consisting of 5,392 samples. Based on this benchmark, a series of closed- and open-source MLLMs are implemented and the results indicate that the current state-of-the-art MLLM achieves only 48.14% accuracy, far below the human-level accuracy of 98.40%. Extensive experimental analyses are also conducted, suggesting the future research directions. The benchmark and codes are available at https://github.com/ziyan-xiaoyu/SpatialMQA.git.</p></details> | 13 pages, 19 figures |

However, existing training methods treat heterogeneous nodes with a fully averaged perspective, resulting in inherently biased prediction targets. Balancing accuracy and consistency is particularly challenging due to the multi-objective nature of spatial-temporal forecasting. To address this issue, we propose a novel Heterogeneity-Informed Mixture-of-Experts (HiMoE) framework that delivers both uniform and precise spatial-temporal predictions. From a model architecture perspective, we design the Heterogeneity-Informed Graph Convolutional Network (HiGCN) to address trend heterogeneity, and we introduce the Node-wise Mixture-of-Experts (NMoE) module to handle cardinality heterogeneity across nodes. From an evaluation perspective, we propose STFairBench, a benchmark that handles fairness in spatial-temporal prediction from both training and evaluation stages. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that HiMoE achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the best baseline by at least 9.22% across all evaluation metrics.</p></details> |  |

However, this remains significantly challenging, leading prior works to rely on large-scale web datasets to improve the grounding accuracy. In this work, we propose Reasoning Graphical User Interface Grounding for Data Efficiency (ReGUIDE), a novel and effective framework for web grounding that enables MLLMs to learn data efficiently through self-generated reasoning and spatial-aware criticism. More specifically, ReGUIDE learns to (i) self-generate a language reasoning process for the localization via online reinforcement learning, and (ii) criticize the prediction using spatial priors that enforce equivariance under input transformations. At inference time, ReGUIDE further boosts performance through a test-time scaling strategy, which combines spatial search with coordinate aggregation. Our experiments demonstrate that ReGUIDE significantly advances web grounding performance across multiple benchmarks, outperforming baselines with substantially fewer training data points (e.g., only 0.2% samples compared to the best open-sourced baselines).</p></details> |  |
| **[TrajMoE: Spatially-Aware Mixture of Experts for Unified Human Mobility Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18670v1)** | 2025-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling human mobility across diverse cities is essential for applications such as urban planning, transportation optimization, and personalized services. However, generalization remains challenging due to heterogeneous spatial representations and mobility patterns across cities. Existing methods typically rely on numerical coordinates or require training city-specific models, limiting their scalability and transferability. We propose TrajMoE, a unified and scalable model for cross-city human mobility modeling. TrajMoE addresses two key challenges: (1) inconsistent spatial semantics across cities, and (2) diverse urban mobility patterns. To tackle these, we begin by designing a spatial semantic encoder that learns transferable location representations from POI-based functional semantics and visit patterns. Furthermore, we design a Spatially-Aware Mixture-of-Experts (SAMoE) Transformer that injects structured priors into experts specialized in distinct mobility semantics, along with a shared expert to capture city-invariant patterns and enable adaptive cross-city generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TrajMoE achieves up to 27% relative improvement over competitive mobility foundation models after only one epoch of fine-tuning, and consistently outperforms full-data baselines using merely 5% of target city data. These results establish TrajMoE as a significant step toward realizing a truly generalizable, transferable, and pretrainable foundation model for human mobility.</p></details> |  |

Geo-spatial datasets pose distinct challenges due to their dense numerical values, strong spatial and temporal dependencies, and unique multimodal representations including tabular data, heatmaps, and geographic visualizations. To assess how foundation models can support scientific research in this domain, GeoGrid-Bench features large-scale, real-world data covering 16 climate variables across 150 locations and extended time frames. The benchmark includes approximately 3,200 question-answer pairs, systematically generated from 8 domain expert-curated templates to reflect practical tasks encountered by human scientists. These range from basic queries at a single location and time to complex spatiotemporal comparisons across regions and periods. Our evaluation reveals that vision-language models perform best overall, and we provide a fine-grained analysis of the strengths and limitations of different foundation models in different geo-spatial tasks. This benchmark offers clearer insights into how foundation models can be effectively applied to geo-spatial data analysis and used to support scientific research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial Hyperspheric Models for Compositional Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03648v3)** | 2025-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Compositional observations are an increasingly prevalent data source in spatial statistics. Analysis of such data is typically done on log-ratio transformations or via Dirichlet regression. However, these approaches often make unnecessarily strong assumptions (e.g., strictly positive components, exclusively negative correlations). An alternative approach uses square-root transformed compositions and directional distributions. Such distributions naturally allow for zero-valued components and positive correlations, yet they may include support outside the non-negative orthant and are not generative for compositional data. To overcome this challenge, we truncate the elliptically symmetric angular Gaussian (ESAG) distribution to the non-negative orthant. Additionally, we propose a spatial hyperspheric regression model that contains fixed and random multivariate spatial effects. The proposed model also contains a term that can be used to propagate uncertainty that may arise from precursory stochastic models (i.e., machine learning classification). We used our model in a simulation study and for a spatial analysis of classified bioacoustic signals of the Dryobates pubescens (downy woodpecker).</p></details> | <details><summary>46 pa...</summary><p>46 pages, 10 figures, 6 appendices</p></details> |

Advances in nanophotonic fabrication and metasurface-based wavefront engineering have opened new pathways to realize high-capacity DONNs across various spectral regimes. Training such DONN systems to determine the metasurface structures remains challenging. Heuristic methods are fast but oversimplify metasurfaces modulation, often resulting in physically unrealizable designs and significant performance degradation. Simulation-in-the-loop training methods directly optimize a physically implementable metasurface using adjoint methods during end-to-end DONN training, but are inherently computationally prohibitive and unscalable.To address these limitations, we propose SP2RINT, a spatially decoupled, progressive training framework that formulates DONN training as a PDE-constrained learning problem. Metasurface responses are first relaxed into freely trainable transfer matrices with a banded structure. We then progressively enforce physical constraints by alternating between transfer matrix training and adjoint-based inverse design, avoiding per-iteration PDE solves while ensuring final physical realizability. To further reduce runtime, we introduce a physics-inspired, spatially decoupled inverse design strategy based on the natural locality of field interactions. This approach partitions the metasurface into independently solvable patches, enabling scalable and parallel inverse design with system-level calibration. Evaluated across diverse DONN training tasks, SP2RINT achieves digital-comparable accuracy while being 1825 times faster than simulation-in-the-loop approaches. By bridging the gap between abstract DONN models and implementable photonic hardware, SP2RINT enables scalable, high-performance training of physically realizable meta-optical neural systems.</p></details> |  |

In fission-fusion dynamics, where group members come together and split from others often, sharing complementary information about uniquely known foraging areas could allow a group to track a heterogenous foraging environment better than any group member on its own. We analyse the partial overlaps between individual core ranges, which we assume represent the knowledge of an individual during a given season. We identify sets of individuals whose overlap shows a balance between redundantly and uniquely known portions and we use simplicial complexes to represent these higher-order interactions. The structure of the simplicial complexes shows holes in various dimensions, revealing complementarity in the foraging information that is being shared. We propose that the complex spatial networks arising from fission-fusion dynamics allow for adaptive, collective processing of foraging information in dynamic environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 6 figures plus supplementary information with 12 pages, methods, model and 4 figures of results</p></details> |

To create engaging forms of experiencing auditory Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH), we designed a spatial interaction-based segmented-audio (SISA) Virtual Reality system that transforms passive ICH experiences into active ones. We undertook: (1) a co-design workshop with seven stakeholders to establish design requirements, (2) prototyping with five participants to validate design elements, and (3) user testing with 16 participants exploring Peking Opera. We designed transformations of temporal music into spatial interactions by cutting sounds into short audio segments, applying t-SNE algorithm to cluster audio segments spatially. Users navigate through these sounds by their similarity in audio property. Analysis revealed two distinct interaction patterns (Progressive and Adaptive), and demonstrated SISA's efficacy in facilitating active auditory ICH engagement. Our work illuminates the design process for enriching traditional performance artform using spatially-tuned forms of listening.</p></details> |  |
| **[Detecting Spatial Dependence in Transcriptomics Data using Vectorised Persistence Diagrams](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03575v2)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating spatial patterns in data is an integral task across various domains, including geostatistics, astronomy, and spatial tissue biology. The analysis of transcriptomics data in particular relies on methods for detecting spatially-dependent features that exhibit significant spatial patterns for both explanatory analysis and feature selection. However, given the complex and high-dimensional nature of these data, there is a need for robust, stable, and reliable descriptors of spatial dependence. We leverage the stability and multiscale properties of persistent homology to address this task. To this end, we introduce a novel framework using functional topological summaries, such as Betti curves and persistence landscapes, for identifying and describing non-random patterns in spatial data. In particular, we propose a non-parametric one-sample permutation test for spatial dependence and investigate its utility across both simulated and real spatial omics data. Our vectorised approach outperforms baseline methods at accurately detecting spatial dependence. Further, we find that our method is more robust to outliers than alternative tests using Moran's I.</p></details> |  |

While simplified paradigms have advanced the understanding of spatial hearing, their lack of ecological validity limits their applicability to real-life conditions. This study aims to address this gap by investigating the effects of listener movement, reverberation, and distance on localisation accuracy in a more ecologically valid context. Participants performed active localisation tasks with no specific instructions on listening strategy, in either anechoic or reverberant conditions. The results indicate that the head movements were more frequent in reverberant environments, suggesting an adaptive strategy to mitigate uncertainty in binaural cues due to reverberation. While distance did not affect the listening strategy, it influenced the localisation performance. Our outcomes suggest that listening behaviour is adapted depending on the current acoustic conditions to support an effective perception of the space.</p></details> | 13 pages, 6 figures |

While existing SFDA methods have proven effective in reducing reliance on source data, they struggle to perform well on multivariate time series (MTS) due to their failure to consider the intrinsic spatial correlations inherent in MTS data. These spatial correlations are crucial for accurately representing MTS data and preserving invariant information across domains. To address this challenge, we propose Temporal Restoration and Spatial Rewiring (TERSE), a novel and concise SFDA method tailored for MTS data. Specifically, TERSE comprises a customized spatial-temporal feature encoder designed to capture the underlying spatial-temporal characteristics, coupled with both temporal restoration and spatial rewiring tasks to reinstate latent representations of the temporally masked time series and the spatially masked correlated structures. During the target adaptation phase, the target encoder is guided to produce spatially and temporally consistent features with the source domain by leveraging the source pre-trained temporal restoration and spatial rewiring networks. Therefore, TERSE can effectively model and transfer spatial-temporal dependencies across domains, facilitating implicit feature alignment. In addition, as the first approach to simultaneously consider spatial-temporal consistency in MTS-SFDA, TERSE can also be integrated as a versatile plug-and-play module into established SFDA methods. Extensive experiments on three real-world time series datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of our approach.</p></details> |  |

Existing models of causal responsibility deal with simplified abstractions of scenarios with discrete actions, thus, limiting real-world use when understanding responsibility in spatial interactions. Based on the assumption that spatially interacting agents are embedded in a scene and must follow an action at each instant, Feasible Action-Space Reduction (FeAR) was proposed as a metric for causal responsibility in a grid-world setting with discrete actions. Since real-world interactions involve continuous action spaces, this paper proposes a formulation of the FeAR metric for measuring causal responsibility in space-continuous interactions. We illustrate the utility of the metric in prototypical space-sharing conflicts, and showcase its applications for analysing backward-looking responsibility and in estimating forward-looking responsibility to guide agent decision making. Our results highlight the potential of the FeAR metric for designing and engineering artificial agents, as well as for assessing the responsibility of agents around humans.</p></details> | In review |

Spatial division multiplexing (SDM) using multicore or multimode fibers is a promising solution to overcome the capacity limit of single-mode fibers. However, long-haul SDM transmission faces significant challenges due to modal dispersion, which imposes heavy computational loads on digital signal processing (DSP) for signal equalization. Here, we propose parameterized SDM transmission, where programmable photonic unitary processors are installed at intermediate nodes. Instead of relying on conventional digital equalization only on the receiver side, our approach enables direct optimization of the SDM transmission channel itself by the programmable unitary processor, which reduces digital post-processing loads. We introduce a gradient-based optimization algorithm using a differentiable SDM transmission model to determine the optimal unitary transformation. As a key enabler, we first implemented telecom-grade programmable photonic unitary processor, achieving a low-loss (2.1 dB fiber-to-fiber), wideband (full C-band), polarization-independent, and high-fidelity (R2>96% across the C-band) operation. We experimentally demonstrate 1300-km transmission using a three-mode fiber, achieving strong agreement between simulation and experiment. The optimized photonic processor significantly reduces modal dispersion and post-processing complexity. Our results establish a scalable framework for integrating photonic computation into the optical layer, enabling more efficient, high-capacity optical networks.</p></details> |  |

The control is applied as an additive forcing term to PDEs. Existing methods for closed-form optimal control only apply to homogeneous (zero) boundary conditions, often resulting in series representations. In this paper, we consider general smooth boundary conditions. We use the unified transform, namely the Fourier transform restricted to the bounded spatial domain, to decouple PDEs into a family of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) parameterized by complex spatial frequency variables. Then, optimal control in the frequency domain is derived using LQR theory for ODEs. The inverse Fourier transform leads to non-causal terms in optimal control corresponding to integrals, over the real line, of future values of unspecified boundary conditions. To eliminate this non-causality, we deform the integrals to well-constructed contours in the complex plane along which the contribution of unknowns vanishes. For the reaction-diffusion equation, we show that the integral representation can be reformulated as a series representation, which leads to a state-feedback convolution form for optimal control, with the boundary conditions appearing as an additive term. In numerical experiments, we illustrate the computational advantages of the integral representation in comparison to the series representation and structural properties of the convolution kernel.</p></details> | 22 pages, 9 figures |

One key concept in spatial cognition is the Frame of Reference (FoR), which identifies the perspective of spatial expressions. Despite its significance, FoR has received limited attention in AI models that need spatial intelligence. There is a lack of dedicated benchmarks and in-depth evaluation of large language models (LLMs) in this area. To address this issue, we introduce the Frame of Reference Evaluation in Spatial Reasoning Tasks (FoREST) benchmark, designed to assess FoR comprehension in LLMs. We evaluate LLMs on answering questions that require FoR comprehension and layout generation in text-to-image models using FoREST. Our results reveal a notable performance gap across different FoR classes in various LLMs, affecting their ability to generate accurate layouts for text-to-image generation. This highlights critical shortcomings in FoR comprehension. To improve FoR understanding, we propose Spatial-Guided prompting, which improves LLMs ability to extract essential spatial concepts.

Despite their advancements, existing VLAs tend to spuriously correlate task-irrelevant visual features with actions, limiting their generalization capacity beyond the training data. To tackle this challenge, we propose Intrinsic Spatial Reasoning (InSpire), a simple yet effective approach that mitigates the adverse effects of spurious correlations by boosting the spatial reasoning ability of VLAs. Specifically, InSpire redirects the VLA's attention to task-relevant factors by prepending the question "In which direction is the [object] relative to the robot?" to the language instruction and aligning the answer "right/left/up/down/front/back/grasped" and predicted actions with the ground-truth. Notably, InSpire can be used as a plugin to enhance existing autoregressive VLAs, requiring no extra training data or interaction with other large models. Extensive experimental results in both simulation and real-world environments demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of our approach. Our code, pretrained models and demos are publicly available at: https://Koorye.github.io/proj/Inspire.</p></details> |  |

We introduce SPaRC (Spatial Pathfinding Reasoning Challenge), a dataset of 1,000 2D grid pathfinding puzzles to evaluate spatial and symbolic reasoning, requiring step-by-step planning with arithmetic and geometric rules. Humans achieve near-perfect accuracy (98.0%; 94.5% on hard puzzles), while the best reasoning models, such as o4-mini, struggle (15.8%; 1.1% on hard puzzles). Models often generate invalid paths (>50% of puzzles for o4-mini), and reasoning tokens reveal they make errors in navigation and spatial logic. Unlike humans, who take longer on hard puzzles, models fail to scale test-time compute with difficulty. Allowing models to make multiple solution attempts improves accuracy, suggesting potential for better spatial reasoning with improved training and efficient test-time scaling methods. SPaRC can be used as a window into models' spatial reasoning limitations and drive research toward new methods that excel in abstract, multi-step problem-solving.</p></details> |  |

To bridge this gap, we present GRASSLAND, a novel maze navigation benchmark designed to evaluate dynamic spatial reasoning. Our experiments show that augmenting textual reasoning chains with dynamic visual drafts, overlaid on input images, significantly outperforms conventional approaches, offering new insights into spatial reasoning in evolving environments. To generalize this capability, we propose D2R (Dynamic Draft-Augmented Reasoning), a training-free framework that seamlessly integrates textual CoT with corresponding visual drafts into MLLMs. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that D2R consistently enhances performance across diverse tasks, establishing a robust baseline for dynamic spatial reasoning without requiring model fine-tuning.

| **[Temporal and Spatial Feature Fusion Framework for Dynamic Micro Expression Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16372v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When emotions are repressed, an individual's true feelings may be revealed through micro-expressions. Consequently, micro-expressions are regarded as a genuine source of insight into an individual's authentic emotions. However, the transient and highly localised nature of micro-expressions poses a significant challenge to their accurate recognition, with the accuracy rate of micro-expression recognition being as low as 50%, even for professionals. In order to address these challenges, it is necessary to explore the field of dynamic micro expression recognition (DMER) using multimodal fusion techniques, with special attention to the diverse fusion of temporal and spatial modal features. In this paper, we propose a novel Temporal and Spatial feature Fusion framework for DMER (TSFmicro). This framework integrates a Retention Network (RetNet) and a transformer-based DMER network, with the objective of efficient micro-expression recognition through the capture and fusion of temporal and spatial relations. Meanwhile, we propose a novel parallel time-space fusion method from the perspective of modal fusion, which fuses spatio-temporal information in high-dimensional feature space, resulting in complementary "where-how" relationships at the semantic level and providing richer semantic information for the model. The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the TSFmicro method in comparison to other contemporary state-of-the-art methods. This is evidenced by its effectiveness on three well-recognised micro-expression datasets.</p></details> | 17 pages |

Traditionally, this task relies on experienced clinicians to manually annotate data, a process that is both time-consuming and labor-intensive. In recent years, deep learning methods have shown promise in automating this task. However, three major challenges remain: (1) deep learning models typically require large-scale labeled datasets, making them less effective in real-world settings where annotated data is limited; (2) significant inter-individual variability in bio-signals often results in inconsistent model performance when applied to new subjects, limiting generalization; and (3) existing approaches often overlook the high-order relationships among bio-signals, failing to simultaneously capture signal heterogeneity and spatial-temporal dependencies. To address these issues, we propose MetaSTH-Sleep, a few-shot sleep stage classification framework based on spatial-temporal hypergraph enhanced meta-learning. Our approach enables rapid adaptation to new subjects using only a few labeled samples, while the hypergraph structure effectively models complex spatial interconnections and temporal dynamics simultaneously in EEG signals. Experimental results demonstrate that MetaSTH-Sleep achieves substantial performance improvements across diverse subjects, offering valuable insights to support clinicians in sleep stage annotation.</p></details> |  |

To address these issues, we investigate the extent to which a well-known-text (WKT) representation of geometries and their spatial relations (e.g., topological predicates) are preserved during spatial reasoning when the geospatial vector data are passed to large language models (LLMs) including GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, and DeepSeek-R1-14B. Our workflow employs three distinct approaches to complete the spatial reasoning tasks for comparison, i.e., geometry embedding-based, prompt engineering-based, and everyday language-based evaluation. Our experiment results demonstrate that both the embedding-based and prompt engineering-based approaches to geospatial question-answering tasks with GPT models can achieve an accuracy of over 0.6 on average for the identification of topological spatial relations between two geometries. Among the evaluated models, GPT-4 with few-shot prompting achieved the highest performance with over 0.66 accuracy on topological spatial relation inference. Additionally, GPT-based reasoner is capable of properly comprehending inverse topological spatial relations and including an LLM-generated geometry can enhance the effectiveness for geographic entity retrieval. GPT-4 also exhibits the ability to translate certain vernacular descriptions about places into formal topological relations, and adding the geometry-type or place-type context in prompts may improve inference accuracy, but it varies by instance. The performance of these spatial reasoning tasks offers valuable insights for the refinement of LLMs with geographical knowledge towards the development of geo-foundation models capable of geospatial reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 13 figures, IJGIS GeoFM Special Issue</p></details> |
| **[UrbanMind: Urban Dynamics Prediction with Multifaceted Spatial-Temporal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11654v3)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding and predicting urban dynamics is crucial for managing transportation systems, optimizing urban planning, and enhancing public services. While neural network-based approaches have achieved success, they often rely on task-specific architectures and large volumes of data, limiting their ability to generalize across diverse urban scenarios. Meanwhile, Large Language Models (LLMs) offer strong reasoning and generalization capabilities, yet their application to spatial-temporal urban dynamics remains underexplored. Existing LLM-based methods struggle to effectively integrate multifaceted spatial-temporal data and fail to address distributional shifts between training and testing data, limiting their predictive reliability in real-world applications. To bridge this gap, we propose UrbanMind, a novel spatial-temporal LLM framework for multifaceted urban dynamics prediction that ensures both accurate forecasting and robust generalization. At its core, UrbanMind introduces Muffin-MAE, a multifaceted fusion masked autoencoder with specialized masking strategies that capture intricate spatial-temporal dependencies and intercorrelations among multifaceted urban dynamics. Additionally, we design a semantic-aware prompting and fine-tuning strategy that encodes spatial-temporal contextual details into prompts, enhancing LLMs' ability to reason over spatial-temporal patterns. To further improve generalization, we introduce a test time adaptation mechanism with a test data reconstructor, enabling UrbanMind to dynamically adjust to unseen test data by reconstructing LLM-generated embeddings. Extensive experiments on real-world urban datasets across multiple cities demonstrate that UrbanMind consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving high accuracy and robust generalization, even in zero-shot settings.</p></details> | KDD 2025 accepted |
| **[SEM: Enhancing Spatial Understanding for Robust Robot Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16196v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A key challenge in robot manipulation lies in developing policy models with strong spatial understanding, the ability to reason about 3D geometry, object relations, and robot embodiment. Existing methods often fall short: 3D point cloud models lack semantic abstraction, while 2D image encoders struggle with spatial reasoning. To address this, we propose SEM (Spatial Enhanced Manipulation model), a novel diffusion-based policy framework that explicitly enhances spatial understanding from two complementary perspectives. A spatial enhancer augments visual representations with 3D geometric context, while a robot state encoder captures embodiment-aware structure through graphbased modeling of joint dependencies. By integrating these modules, SEM significantly improves spatial understanding, leading to robust and generalizable manipulation across diverse tasks that outperform existing baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatially scalable recursive estimation of Gaussian process terrain maps using local basis functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09168v3)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When an agent, person, vehicle or robot is moving through an unknown environment without GNSS signals, online mapping of nonlinear terrains can be used to improve position estimates when the agent returns to a previously mapped area. Mapping algorithms using online Gaussian process (GP) regression are commonly integrated in algorithms for simultaneous localisation and mapping (SLAM). However, GP mapping algorithms have increasing computational demands as the mapped area expands relative to spatial field variations. This is due to the need for estimating an increasing amount of map parameters as the area of the map grows. Contrary to this, we propose a recursive GP mapping estimation algorithm which uses local basis functions in an information filter to achieve spatial scalability. Our proposed approximation employs a global grid of finite support basis functions but restricts computations to a localized subset around each prediction point. As our proposed algorithm is recursive, it can naturally be incorporated into existing algorithms that uses Gaussian process maps for SLAM. Incorporating our proposed algorithm into an extended Kalman filter (EKF) for magnetic field SLAM reduces the overall computational complexity of the algorithm. We show experimentally that our algorithm is faster than existing methods when the mapped area is large and the map is based on many measurements, both for recursive mapping tasks and for magnetic field SLAM.</p></details> |  |
| **[SpaceR: Reinforcing MLLMs in Video Spatial Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01805v2)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video spatial reasoning, which involves inferring the underlying spatial structure from observed video frames, poses a significant challenge for existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). This limitation stems primarily from 1) the absence of high-quality datasets for this task, and 2) the lack of effective training strategies to develop spatial reasoning capabilities. Motivated by the success of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) in unlocking LLM reasoning abilities, this work aims to improve MLLMs in video spatial reasoning through the RLVR paradigm. To this end, we introduce the $\textbf{SpaceR}$ framework. First, we present $\textbf{SpaceR-151k}$, a dataset with 91k questions spanning diverse spatial reasoning scenarios with verifiable answers, and 60k samples for maintaining general multimodal understanding. Second, we propose $\textbf{Spatially-Guided RLVR (SG-RLVR)}$, a novel reinforcement learning approach that extends Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a novel map imagination mechanism, which encourages the model to infer spatial layouts in the thinking process, thereby facilitating more effective spatial reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SpaceR achieves state-of-the-art performance on spatial reasoning benchmarks (e.g., VSI-Bench, STI-Bench, and SPAR-Bench), while maintaining competitive results on video understanding benchmarks (e.g., Video-MME, TempCompass, and LongVideoBench). Remarkably, SpaceR surpasses the advanced GPT-4o by 11.6\% accuracy on VSI-Bench and is on par with the leading proprietary model Gemini-2.0-Flash, highlighting the effectiveness of our SpaceR-151k dataset and SG-RLVR in reinforcing spatial reasoning ability of MLLMs. Code, model, and dataset are available at https://github.com/OuyangKun10/SpaceR.</p></details> |  |

However, whereas latent space modeling paradigms have transformed image and video generation, similar approaches are more difficult for most dynamical systems. Such systems -- from chemical molecule structures to collective human behavior -- are described by interactions of entities, making them inherently linked to connectivity patterns, entity conservation, and the traceability of entities over time. Our approach, LaM-SLidE (Latent Space Modeling of Spatial Dynamical Systems via Linked Entities), bridges the gap between: (1) keeping the traceability of individual entities in a latent system representation, and (2) leveraging the efficiency and scalability of recent advances in image and video generation, where pre-trained encoder and decoder enable generative modeling directly in latent space. The core idea of LaM-SLidE is the introduction of identifier representations (IDs) that enable the retrieval of entity properties and entity composition from latent system representations, thus fostering traceability. Experimentally, across different domains, we show that LaM-SLidE performs favorably in terms of speed, accuracy, and generalizability.

| **[Accelerating Diffusion-based Super-Resolution with Dynamic Time-Spatial Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12048v2)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have gained attention for their success in modeling complex distributions, achieving impressive perceptual quality in SR tasks. However, existing diffusion-based SR methods often suffer from high computational costs, requiring numerous iterative steps for training and inference. Existing acceleration techniques, such as distillation and solver optimization, are generally task-agnostic and do not fully leverage the specific characteristics of low-level tasks like super-resolution (SR). In this study, we analyze the frequency- and spatial-domain properties of diffusion-based SR methods, revealing key insights into the temporal and spatial dependencies of high-frequency signal recovery. Specifically, high-frequency details benefit from concentrated optimization during early and late diffusion iterations, while spatially textured regions demand adaptive denoising strategies. Building on these observations, we propose the Time-Spatial-aware Sampling strategy (TSS) for the acceleration of Diffusion SR without any extra training cost. TSS combines Time Dynamic Sampling (TDS), which allocates more iterations to refining textures, and Spatial Dynamic Sampling (SDS), which dynamically adjusts strategies based on image content. Extensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that TSS achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with significantly fewer iterations, improving MUSIQ scores by 0.2 - 3.0 and outperforming the current acceleration methods with only half the number of steps.</p></details> |  |
| **[Performance Analysis of Fluid Antenna System under Spatially-Correlated Rician Fading Channels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15200v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fluid antenna systems (FAS) are among the most promising technologies for the sixth generation (6G) mobile communication networks. Unlike traditional fixed-position multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, a FAS possesses position reconfigurability to switch on-demand among $N$ predefined ports over a prescribed space. This paper explores the performance of a single-input single-output (SISO) model with a fixed-position antenna transmitter and a single-antenna FAS receiver, referred to as the Rx-SISO-FAS model, under spatially-correlated Rician fading channels. Our contributions include exact expressions and closed-form bounds for the outage probability of the Rx-SISO-FAS model, as well as exact and closed-form lower bounds for the ergodic rate. Importantly, we also analyze the performance considering both uniform linear array (ULA) and uniform planar array (UPA) configurations for the ports of the FAS. To gain insights, we evaluate the diversity order of the proposed model and our analytical results indicate that with a fixed overall system size, increasing the number of ports, $N$, significantly decreases the outage performance of FAS under different Rician fading factors. Our numerical results further demonstrate that: $i)$ the Rx-SISO-FAS model can enhance performance under spatially-correlated Rician fading channels over the fixed-position antenna counterpart; $ii)$ the Rician factor negatively impacts performance in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime; $iii$) FAS can outperform an $L$ branches maximum ratio combining (MRC) system under Rician fading channels; and $iv)$ when the number of ports is identical, UPA outperforms ULA.</p></details> |  |
| **[SSR: Enhancing Depth Perception in Vision-Language Models via Rationale-Guided Spatial Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12448v2)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite impressive advancements in Visual-Language Models (VLMs) for multi-modal tasks, their reliance on RGB inputs limits precise spatial understanding. Existing methods for integrating spatial cues, such as point clouds or depth, either require specialized sensors or fail to effectively exploit depth information for higher-order reasoning. To this end, we propose a novel Spatial Sense and Reasoning method, dubbed SSR, a novel framework that transforms raw depth data into structured, interpretable textual rationales. These textual rationales serve as meaningful intermediate representations to significantly enhance spatial reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we leverage knowledge distillation to compress the generated rationales into compact latent embeddings, which facilitate resource-efficient and plug-and-play integration into existing VLMs without retraining. To enable comprehensive evaluation, we introduce a new dataset named SSR-CoT, a million-scale visual-language reasoning dataset enriched with intermediate spatial reasoning annotations, and present SSRBench, a comprehensive multi-task benchmark. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate SSR substantially improves depth utilization and enhances spatial reasoning, thereby advancing VLMs toward more human-like multi-modal understanding.

| **[Mixture of Directed Graphical Models for Discrete Spatial Random Fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15700v4)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current approaches for modeling discrete-valued outcomes associated with spatially-dependent areal units incur computational and theoretical challenges, especially in the Bayesian setting when full posterior inference is desired. As an alternative, we propose a novel statistical modeling framework for this data setting, namely a mixture of directed graphical models (MDGMs). The components of the mixture, directed graphical models, can be represented by directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and are computationally quick to evaluate. The DAGs representing the mixture components are selected to correspond to an undirected graphical representation of an assumed spatial contiguity/dependence structure of the areal units, which underlies the specification of traditional modeling approaches for discrete spatial processes such as Markov random fields (MRFs). Notably, the MDGM is not proposed as an approximation to an MRF, but rather shares the same default, underlying graphical representation of spatial dependence as an MRF. However, in the case that the data generating mechanism of the latent spatial field is known to be an MRF, we find that posterior inferences under an MDGM prior better approximate the posterior of the model with a correctly specified MRF prior. We introduce the concept of compatibility to show how an undirected graph can be used as a template for the dependencies between areal units to create sets of DAGs which, as a collection, preserve the dependencies represented in the template undirected graph. Lastly, we compare highlighted classes of MDGMs to MRFs and a popular Bayesian MRF model approximation used in high-dimensional settings in a series of simulations and an analysis of ecometrics data collected as part of the Adolescent Health and Development in Context Study.</p></details> |  |
| **[Steering Deep Non-Linear Spatially Selective Filters for Weakly Guided Extraction of Moving Speakers in Dynamic Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14517v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent speaker extraction methods using deep non-linear spatial filtering perform exceptionally well when the target direction is known and stationary. However, spatially dynamic scenarios are considerably more challenging due to time-varying spatial features and arising ambiguities, e.g. when moving speakers cross. While in a static scenario it may be easy for a user to point to the target's direction, manually tracking a moving speaker is impractical. Instead of relying on accurate time-dependent directional cues, which we refer to as strong guidance, in this paper we propose a weakly guided extraction method solely depending on the target's initial position to cope with spatial dynamic scenarios. By incorporating our own deep tracking algorithm and developing a joint training strategy on a synthetic dataset, we demonstrate the proficiency of our approach in resolving spatial ambiguities and even outperform a mismatched, but strongly guided extraction method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Interspeech 2025</p></details> |

Self-Supervised learning (SSL) and Few-Shot Learning (FSL) offer promising avenues to address this issue. However, existing methods often struggle to adapt to the spatial geometric diversity of HSIs and lack sufficient spectral prior knowledge. To tackle these challenges, we propose a method, Spectral-Spatial Self-Supervised Learning for Few-Shot Hyperspectral Image Classification (S4L-FSC), aimed at improving the performance of few-shot HSI classification. Specifically, we first leverage heterogeneous datasets to pretrain a spatial feature extractor using a designed Rotation-Mirror Self-Supervised Learning (RM-SSL) method, combined with FSL. This approach enables the model to learn the spatial geometric diversity of HSIs using rotation and mirroring labels as supervisory signals, while acquiring transferable spatial meta-knowledge through few-shot learning. Subsequently, homogeneous datasets are utilized to pretrain a spectral feature extractor via a combination of FSL and Masked Reconstruction Self-Supervised Learning (MR-SSL). The model learns to reconstruct original spectral information from randomly masked spectral vectors, inferring spectral dependencies. In parallel, FSL guides the model to extract pixel-level discriminative features, thereby embedding rich spectral priors into the model. This spectral-spatial pretraining method, along with the integration of knowledge from heterogeneous and homogeneous sources, significantly enhances model performance. Extensive experiments on four HSI datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed S4L-FSC approach for few-shot HSI classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/Wenchen-Chen/S4L-FSC</p></details> |

When managing such data, spatial database systems offer various index options and data formats, e.g., point-based or trajectory-based. Likewise, dataset characteristics such as geographic overlap and skew can vary significantly. All three significantly affect database performance. While this has been studied in existing papers, none of them explore the effects and trade-offs resulting from a combination of all three aspects. In this paper, we evaluate the performance impact of index choice, data format, and dataset characteristics on a popular spatial database system, PostGIS. We focus on two aspects of dataset characteristics, the degree of overlap and the degree of skew, and propose novel approximation methods to determine these features. We design a benchmark that compares a variety of spatial indexing strategies and data formats, while also considering the impact of dataset characteristics on database performance. We include a variety of real-world and synthetic datasets, write operations, and read queries to cover a broad range of scenarios that might occur during application runtime. Our results offer practical guidance for developers looking to optimize spatial storage and querying, while also providing insights into dataset characteristics and their impact on database performance.</p></details> |  |

| **[A Methodological Framework for Measuring Spatial Labeling Similarity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14128v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial labeling assigns labels to specific spatial locations to characterize their spatial properties and relationships, with broad applications in scientific research and practice. Measuring the similarity between two spatial labelings is essential for understanding their differences and the contributing factors, such as changes in location properties or labeling methods. An adequate and unbiased measurement of spatial labeling similarity should consider the number of matched labels (label agreement), the topology of spatial label distribution, and the heterogeneous impacts of mismatched labels. However, existing methods often fail to account for all these aspects. To address this gap, we propose a methodological framework to guide the development of methods that meet these requirements. Given two spatial labelings, the framework transforms them into graphs based on location organization, labels, and attributes (e.g., location significance). The distributions of their graph attributes are then extracted, enabling an efficient computation of distributional discrepancy to reflect the dissimilarity level between the two labelings. We further provide a concrete implementation of this framework, termed Spatial Labeling Analogy Metric (SLAM), along with an analysis of its theoretical foundation, for evaluating spatial labeling results in spatial transcriptomics (ST) \textit{as per} their similarity with ground truth labeling. Through a series of carefully designed experimental cases involving both simulated and real ST data, we demonstrate that SLAM provides a comprehensive and accurate reflection of labeling quality compared to other well-established evaluation metrics. Our code is available at https://github.com/YihDu/SLAM.</p></details> |  |

The significant gap between 3D and language modalities makes it a notable challenge to distinguish multiple similar objects through the described spatial relationships. Current methods attempt to achieve cross-modal understanding in complex scenes via a target-centered learning mechanism, ignoring the perception of referred objects. We propose a novel 2D-assisted 3D visual grounding framework that constructs semantic-spatial scene graphs with referred object discrimination for relationship perception. The framework incorporates a dual-branch visual encoder that utilizes 2D pre-trained attributes to guide the multi-modal object encoding. Furthermore, our cross-modal interaction module uses graph attention to facilitate relationship-oriented information fusion. The enhanced object representation and iterative relational learning enable the model to establish effective alignment between 3D vision and referential descriptions. Experimental results on the popular benchmarks demonstrate our superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, especially in addressing the challenges of multiple similar distractors.</p></details> |  |
| **[CONSIGN: Conformal Segmentation Informed by Spatial Groupings via Decomposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14113v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most machine learning-based image segmentation models produce pixel-wise confidence scores - typically derived from softmax outputs - that represent the model's predicted probability for each class label at every pixel. While this information can be particularly valuable in high-stakes domains such as medical imaging, these (uncalibrated) scores are heuristic in nature and do not constitute rigorous quantitative uncertainty estimates. Conformal prediction (CP) provides a principled framework for transforming heuristic confidence scores into statistically valid uncertainty estimates. However, applying CP directly to image segmentation ignores the spatial correlations between pixels, a fundamental characteristic of image data. This can result in overly conservative and less interpretable uncertainty estimates. To address this, we propose CONSIGN (Conformal Segmentation Informed by Spatial Groupings via Decomposition), a CP-based method that incorporates spatial correlations to improve uncertainty quantification in image segmentation. Our method generates meaningful prediction sets that come with user-specified, high-probability error guarantees. It is compatible with any pre-trained segmentation model capable of generating multiple sample outputs - such as those using dropout, Bayesian modeling, or ensembles. We evaluate CONSIGN against a standard pixel-wise CP approach across three medical imaging datasets and two COCO dataset subsets, using three different pre-trained segmentation models. Results demonstrate that accounting for spatial structure significantly improves performance across multiple metrics and enhances the quality of uncertainty estimates.</p></details> |  |
| **[TimeFilter: Patch-Specific Spatial-Temporal Graph Filtration for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13041v2)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting methods generally fall into two main categories: Channel Independent (CI) and Channel Dependent (CD) strategies. While CI overlooks important covariate relationships, CD captures all dependencies without distinction, introducing noise and reducing generalization. Recent advances in Channel Clustering (CC) aim to refine dependency modeling by grouping channels with similar characteristics and applying tailored modeling techniques. However, coarse-grained clustering struggles to capture complex, time-varying interactions effectively. To address these challenges, we propose TimeFilter, a GNN-based framework for adaptive and fine-grained dependency modeling. After constructing the graph from the input sequence, TimeFilter refines the learned spatial-temporal dependencies by filtering out irrelevant correlations while preserving the most critical ones in a patch-specific manner. Extensive experiments on 13 real-world datasets from diverse application domains demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of TimeFilter.

| **[Quaff: Quantized Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning under Outlier Spatial Stability Hypothesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14742v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have made exciting achievements across various domains, yet their deployment on resource-constrained personal devices remains hindered by the prohibitive computational and memory demands of task-specific fine-tuning. While quantization offers a pathway to efficiency, existing methods struggle to balance performance and overhead, either incurring high computational/memory costs or failing to address activation outliers, a critical bottleneck in quantized fine-tuning. To address these challenges, we propose the Outlier Spatial Stability Hypothesis (OSSH): During fine-tuning, certain activation outlier channels retain stable spatial positions across training iterations. Building on OSSH, we propose Quaff, a Quantized parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework for LLMs, optimizing low-precision activation representations through targeted momentum scaling. Quaff dynamically suppresses outliers exclusively in invariant channels using lightweight operations, eliminating full-precision weight storage and global rescaling while reducing quantization errors. Extensive experiments across ten benchmarks validate OSSH and demonstrate Quaff's efficacy. Specifically, on the GPQA reasoning benchmark, Quaff achieves a 1.73x latency reduction and 30% memory savings over full-precision fine-tuning while improving accuracy by 0.6% on the Phi-3 model, reconciling the triple trade-off between efficiency, performance, and deployability. By enabling consumer-grade GPU fine-tuning (e.g., RTX 2080 Super) without sacrificing model utility, Quaff democratizes personalized LLM deployment. The code is available at https://github.com/Little0o0/Quaff.git.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose a novel benchmark, Open3DVQA, to comprehensively evaluate the spatial reasoning capacities of current state-of-the-art (SOTA) foundation models in open 3D space. Open3DVQA consists of 9k VQA samples, collected using an efficient semi-automated tool in a high-fidelity urban simulator. We evaluate several SOTA MLLMs across various aspects of spatial reasoning, such as relative and absolute spatial relationships, situational reasoning, and object-centric spatial attributes. Our results reveal that: 1) MLLMs perform better at answering questions regarding relative spatial relationships than absolute spatial relationships, 2) MLLMs demonstrate similar spatial reasoning abilities for both egocentric and allocentric perspectives, and 3) Fine-tuning large models significantly improves their performance across different spatial reasoning tasks. We believe that our open-source data collection tools and in-depth analyses will inspire further research on MLLM spatial reasoning capabilities. The benchmark is available at https://github.com/WeichenZh/Open3DVQA.</p></details> |  |

However, existing 3DGS-based methods for dynamic reconstruction often suffer from \textit{spatio-temporal incoherence} during initialization, where canonical Gaussians are constructed by aggregating observations from multiple frames without temporal distinction. This results in spatio-temporally entangled representations, making it difficult to model dynamic motion accurately. To overcome this limitation, we propose \textbf{STDR} (Spatio-Temporal Decoupling for Real-time rendering), a plug-and-play module that learns spatio-temporal probability distributions for each Gaussian. STDR introduces a spatio-temporal mask, a separated deformation field, and a consistency regularization to jointly disentangle spatial and temporal patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that incorporating our module into existing 3DGS-based dynamic scene reconstruction frameworks leads to notable improvements in both reconstruction quality and spatio-temporal consistency across synthetic and real-world benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust and Conjugate Spatio-Temporal Gaussian Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02450v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-space formulations allow for Gaussian process (GP) regression with linear-in-time computational cost in spatio-temporal settings, but performance typically suffers in the presence of outliers. In this paper, we adapt and specialise the robust and conjugate GP (RCGP) framework of Altamirano et al. (2024) to the spatio-temporal setting. In doing so, we obtain an outlier-robust spatio-temporal GP with a computational cost comparable to classical spatio-temporal GPs. We also overcome the three main drawbacks of RCGPs: their unreliable performance when the prior mean is chosen poorly, their lack of reliable uncertainty quantification, and the need to carefully select a hyperparameter by hand. We study our method extensively in finance and weather forecasting applications, demonstrating that it provides a reliable approach to spatio-temporal modelling in the presence of outliers.</p></details> |  |
| **[NRFormer: Nationwide Nuclear Radiation Forecasting with Spatio-Temporal Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11924v3)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nuclear radiation, which refers to the energy emitted from atomic nuclei during decay, poses significant risks to human health and environmental safety. Recently, advancements in monitoring technology have facilitated the effective recording of nuclear radiation levels and related factors, such as weather conditions. The abundance of monitoring data enables the development of accurate and reliable nuclear radiation forecasting models, which play a crucial role in informing decision-making for individuals and governments. However, this task is challenging due to the imbalanced distribution of monitoring stations over a wide spatial range and the non-stationary radiation variation patterns. In this study, we introduce NRFormer, a novel framework tailored for the nationwide prediction of nuclear radiation variations. By integrating a non-stationary temporal attention module, an imbalance-aware spatial attention module, and a radiation propagation prompting module, NRFormer collectively captures complex spatio-temporal dynamics of nuclear radiation. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework against 11 baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by KDD 2025 ADS Track</p></details> |
| **[Online distributed optimization for spatio-temporally constrained real-time peer-to-peer energy trading](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21884v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of distributed renewable energy triggers the peer-to-peer (P2P) energy market formations. To make profits, prosumers equipped with photovoltaic (PV) panels and even the energy storage system (ESS) can actively participate in the real-time P2P energy market and trade energy. However, in real situations, system states such as energy demands and renewable energy power generation are highly uncertain, making it difficult for prosumers to make optimal real-time decisions. Moreover, severe problems with the physical network can arise from the real-time P2P energy trading, such as bus voltage violations and line overload. To handle these problems, this work first formulates the real-time P2P energy trading problem as a spatio-temporally constrained stochastic optimization problem by considering ESS and the spatial physical network constraints. To deal with the uncertainties online, a modified Lyapunov optimization method is innovatively proposed to approximately reformulate the stochastic optimization problem into an online one by relaxing the time-coupling constraints. Compared with the state-of-the-art online methods, the proposed one renders more flexibility and better performance for the real-time P2P energy market operation. Additionally, to protect the prosumers' privacy, an online distributed algorithm based on the consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is developed to solve the reformulated online problem by decoupling the spatial constraints. The theoretical near-optimal performance guarantee of the proposed online distributed algorithm is derived, and its performance can be further improved by minimizing the performance gap. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed online distributed algorithm can guarantee the fast, stable, and safe long-term operation of the real-time P2P energy market.</p></details> |  |
| **[STACI: Spatio-Temporal Aleatoric Conformal Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21658v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fitting Gaussian Processes (GPs) provides interpretable aleatoric uncertainty quantification for estimation of spatio-temporal fields. Spatio-temporal deep learning models, while scalable, typically assume a simplistic independent covariance matrix for the response, failing to capture the underlying correlation structure. However, spatio-temporal GPs suffer from issues of scalability and various forms of approximation bias resulting from restrictive assumptions of the covariance kernel function. We propose STACI, a novel framework consisting of a variational Bayesian neural network approximation of non-stationary spatio-temporal GP along with a novel spatio-temporal conformal inference algorithm. STACI is highly scalable, taking advantage of GPU training capabilities for neural network models, and provides statistically valid prediction intervals for uncertainty quantification. STACI outperforms competing GPs and deep methods in accurately approximating spatio-temporal processes and we show it easily scales to datasets with millions of observations.</p></details> |  |
| **[STRAP: Spatio-Temporal Pattern Retrieval for Out-of-Distribution Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19547v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for modeling dynamic graph-structured data across diverse domains. However, they often fail to generalize in Spatio-Temporal Out-of-Distribution (STOOD) scenarios, where both temporal dynamics and spatial structures evolve beyond the training distribution. To address this problem, we propose an innovative Spatio-Temporal Retrieval-Augmented Pattern Learning framework,STRAP, which enhances model generalization by integrating retrieval-augmented learning into the STGNN continue learning pipeline. The core of STRAP is a compact and expressive pattern library that stores representative spatio-temporal patterns enriched with historical, structural, and semantic information, which is obtained and optimized during the training phase. During inference, STRAP retrieves relevant patterns from this library based on similarity to the current input and injects them into the model via a plug-and-play prompting mechanism. This not only strengthens spatio-temporal representations but also mitigates catastrophic forgetting. Moreover, STRAP introduces a knowledge-balancing objective to harmonize new information with retrieved knowledge. Extensive experiments across multiple real-world streaming graph datasets show that STRAP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art STGNN baselines on STOOD tasks, demonstrating its robustness, adaptability, and strong generalization capability without task-specific fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Decoupling Spatio-Temporal Prediction: When Lightweight Large Models Meet Adaptive Hypergraphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19620v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal prediction is a pivotal task with broad applications in traffic management, climate monitoring, energy scheduling, etc. However, existing methodologies often struggle to balance model expressiveness and computational efficiency, especially when scaling to large real-world datasets. To tackle these challenges, we propose STH-SepNet (Spatio-Temporal Hypergraph Separation Networks), a novel framework that decouples temporal and spatial modeling to enhance both efficiency and precision. Therein, the temporal dimension is modeled using lightweight large language models, which effectively capture low-rank temporal dynamics. Concurrently, the spatial dimension is addressed through an adaptive hypergraph neural network, which dynamically constructs hyperedges to model intricate, higher-order interactions. A carefully designed gating mechanism is integrated to seamlessly fuse temporal and spatial representations. By leveraging the fundamental principles of low-rank temporal dynamics and spatial interactions, STH-SepNet offers a pragmatic and scalable solution for spatio-temporal prediction in real-world applications. Extensive experiments on large-scale real-world datasets across multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of STH-SepNet in boosting predictive performance while maintaining computational efficiency. This work may provide a promising lightweight framework for spatio-temporal prediction, aiming to reduce computational demands and while enhancing predictive performance.

| **[FutureSightDrive: Thinking Visually with Spatio-Temporal CoT for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17685v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual language models (VLMs) have attracted increasing interest in autonomous driving due to their powerful reasoning capabilities. However, existing VLMs typically utilize discrete text Chain-of-Thought (CoT) tailored to the current scenario, which essentially represents highly abstract and symbolic compression of visual information, potentially leading to spatio-temporal relationship ambiguity and fine-grained information loss. Is autonomous driving better modeled on real-world simulation and imagination than on pure symbolic logic? In this paper, we propose a spatio-temporal CoT reasoning method that enables models to think visually. First, VLM serves as a world model to generate unified image frame for predicting future world states: where perception results (e.g., lane divider and 3D detection) represent the future spatial relationships, and ordinary future frame represent the temporal evolution relationships. This spatio-temporal CoT then serves as intermediate reasoning steps, enabling the VLM to function as an inverse dynamics model for trajectory planning based on current observations and future predictions. To implement visual generation in VLMs, we propose a unified pretraining paradigm integrating visual generation and understanding, along with a progressive visual CoT enhancing autoregressive image generation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, advancing autonomous driving towards visual reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal Spatio-Temporal Prediction: An Effective and Efficient Multi-Modal Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17637v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal prediction plays a crucial role in intelligent transportation, weather forecasting, and urban planning. While integrating multi-modal data has shown potential for enhancing prediction accuracy, key challenges persist: (i) inadequate fusion of multi-modal information, (ii) confounding factors that obscure causal relations, and (iii) high computational complexity of prediction models. To address these challenges, we propose E^2-CSTP, an Effective and Efficient Causal multi-modal Spatio-Temporal Prediction framework. E^2-CSTP leverages cross-modal attention and gating mechanisms to effectively integrate multi-modal data. Building on this, we design a dual-branch causal inference approach: the primary branch focuses on spatio-temporal prediction, while the auxiliary branch mitigates bias by modeling additional modalities and applying causal interventions to uncover true causal dependencies. To improve model efficiency, we integrate GCN with the Mamba architecture for accelerated spatio-temporal encoding. Extensive experiments on 4 real-world datasets show that E^2-CSTP significantly outperforms 9 state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 9.66% improvements in accuracy as well as 17.37%-56.11% reductions in computational overhead.</p></details> |  |
| **[FLEX: A Backbone for Diffusion-Based Modeling of Spatio-temporal Physical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17351v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce FLEX (FLow EXpert), a backbone architecture for generative modeling of spatio-temporal physical systems using diffusion models. FLEX operates in the residual space rather than on raw data, a modeling choice that we motivate theoretically, showing that it reduces the variance of the velocity field in the diffusion model, which helps stabilize training. FLEX integrates a latent Transformer into a U-Net with standard convolutional ResNet layers and incorporates a redesigned skip connection scheme. This hybrid design enables the model to capture both local spatial detail and long-range dependencies in latent space. To improve spatio-temporal conditioning, FLEX uses a task-specific encoder that processes auxiliary inputs such as coarse or past snapshots. Weak conditioning is applied to the shared encoder via skip connections to promote generalization, while strong conditioning is applied to the decoder through both skip and bottleneck features to ensure reconstruction fidelity. FLEX achieves accurate predictions for super-resolution and forecasting tasks using as few as two reverse diffusion steps. It also produces calibrated uncertainty estimates through sampling. Evaluations on high-resolution 2D turbulence data show that FLEX outperforms strong baselines and generalizes to out-of-distribution settings, including unseen Reynolds numbers, physical observables (e.g., fluid flow velocity fields), and boundary conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Remote Sensing Spatio-Temporal Vision-Language Models: A Comprehensive Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02573v2)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The interpretation of multi-temporal remote sensing imagery is critical for monitoring Earth's dynamic processes-yet previous change detection methods, which produce binary or semantic masks, fall short of providing human-readable insights into changes. Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have opened a new frontier by fusing visual and linguistic modalities, enabling spatio-temporal vision-language understanding: models that not only capture spatial and temporal dependencies to recognize changes but also provide a richer interactive semantic analysis of temporal images (e.g., generate descriptive captions and answer natural-language queries). In this survey, we present the first comprehensive review of RS-STVLMs. The survey covers the evolution of models from early task-specific models to recent general foundation models that leverage powerful large language models. We discuss progress in representative tasks, such as change captioning, change question answering, and change grounding. Moreover, we systematically dissect the fundamental components and key technologies underlying these models, and review the datasets and evaluation metrics that have driven the field. By synthesizing task-level insights with a deep dive into shared architectural patterns, we aim to illuminate current achievements and chart promising directions for future research in spatio-temporal vision-language understanding for remote sensing. We will keep tracing related works at https://github.com/Chen-Yang-Liu/Awesome-RS-SpatioTemporal-VLMs</p></details> |  |
| **[Semi-decentralized Training of Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks for Traffic Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03188v2)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In smart mobility, large networks of geographically distributed sensors produce vast amounts of high-frequency spatio-temporal data that must be processed in real time to avoid major disruptions. Traditional centralized approaches are increasingly unsuitable to this task, as they struggle to scale with expanding sensor networks, and reliability issues in central components can easily affect the whole deployment. To address these challenges, we explore and adapt semi-decentralized training techniques for Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (ST-GNNs) in smart mobility domain. We implement a simulation framework where sensors are grouped by proximity into multiple cloudlets, each handling a subgraph of the traffic graph, fetching node features from other cloudlets to train its own local ST-GNN model, and exchanging model updates with other cloudlets to ensure consistency, enhancing scalability and removing reliance on a centralized aggregator. We perform extensive comparative evaluation of four different ST-GNN training setups -- centralized, traditional FL, server-free FL, and Gossip Learning -- on large-scale traffic datasets, the METR-LA and PeMS-BAY datasets, for short-, mid-, and long-term vehicle speed predictions. Experimental results show that semi-decentralized setups are comparable to centralized approaches in performance metrics, while offering advantages in terms of scalability and fault tolerance. In addition, we highlight often overlooked issues in existing literature for distributed ST-GNNs, such as the variation in model performance across different geographical areas due to region-specific traffic patterns, and the significant communication overhead and computational costs that arise from the large receptive field of GNNs, leading to substantial data transfers and increased computation of partial embeddings.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables, conference</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Spatio-Temporal Signal Recognition on Edge Devices Using PointLCA-Net](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14585v3)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in machine learning, particularly through deep learning architectures like PointNet, have transformed the processing of three-dimensional (3D) point clouds, significantly improving 3D object classification and segmentation tasks. While 3D point clouds provide detailed spatial information, spatio-temporal signals introduce a dynamic element that accounts for changes over time. However, applying deep learning techniques to spatio-temporal signals and deploying them on edge devices presents challenges, including real-time processing, memory capacity, and power consumption. To address these issues, this paper presents a novel approach that combines PointNet's feature extraction with the in-memory computing capabilities and energy efficiency of neuromorphic systems for spatio-temporal signal recognition. The proposed method consists of a two-stage process: in the first stage, PointNet extracts features from the spatio-temporal signals, which are then stored in non-volatile memristor crossbar arrays. In the second stage, these features are processed by a single-layer spiking neural encoder-decoder that employs the Locally Competitive Algorithm (LCA) for efficient encoding and classification. This work integrates the strengths of both PointNet and LCA, enhancing computational efficiency and energy performance on edge devices. PointLCA-Net achieves high recognition accuracy for spatio-temporal data with substantially lower energy burden during both inference and training than comparable approaches, thus advancing the deployment of advanced neural architectures in energy-constrained environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to International Joint Conference on Neural Networks(IJCNN), 2015</p></details> |
| **[Learning Spatio-Temporal Dynamics for Trajectory Recovery via Time-Aware Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13857v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In real-world applications, GPS trajectories often suffer from low sampling rates, with large and irregular intervals between consecutive GPS points. This sparse characteristic presents challenges for their direct use in GPS-based systems. This paper addresses the task of map-constrained trajectory recovery, aiming to enhance trajectory sampling rates of GPS trajectories. Previous studies commonly adopt a sequence-to-sequence framework, where an encoder captures the trajectory patterns and a decoder reconstructs the target trajectory. Within this framework, effectively representing the road network and extracting relevant trajectory features are crucial for overall performance. Despite advancements in these models, they fail to fully leverage the complex spatio-temporal dynamics present in both the trajectory and the road network. To overcome these limitations, we categorize the spatio-temporal dynamics of trajectory data into two distinct aspects: spatial-temporal traffic dynamics and trajectory dynamics. Furthermore, We propose TedTrajRec, a novel method for trajectory recovery. To capture spatio-temporal traffic dynamics, we introduce PD-GNN, which models periodic patterns and learns topologically aware dynamics concurrently for each road segment. For spatio-temporal trajectory dynamics, we present TedFormer, a time-aware Transformer that incorporates temporal dynamics for each GPS location by integrating closed-form neural ordinary differential equations into the attention mechanism. This allows TedFormer to effectively handle irregularly sampled data. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of TedTrajRec.

Exploring a Differentiable Sparse Soft-Vector Quantization Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03406v4)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal forecasting is crucial in various fields and requires a careful balance between identifying subtle patterns and filtering out noise. Vector quantization (VQ) appears well-suited for this purpose, as it quantizes input vectors into a set of codebook vectors or patterns. Although VQ has shown promise in various computer vision tasks, it surprisingly falls short in enhancing the accuracy of spatio-temporal forecasting. We attribute this to two main issues: inaccurate optimization due to non-differentiability and limited representation power in hard-VQ. To tackle these challenges, we introduce Differentiable Sparse Soft-Vector Quantization (SVQ), the first VQ method to enhance spatio-temporal forecasting. SVQ balances detail preservation with noise reduction, offering full differentiability and a solid foundation in sparse regression. Our approach employs a two-layer MLP and an extensive codebook to streamline the sparse regression process, significantly cutting computational costs while simplifying training and improving performance. Empirical studies on five spatio-temporal benchmark datasets show SVQ achieves state-of-the-art results, including a 7.9% improvement on the WeatherBench-S temperature dataset and an average mean absolute error reduction of 9.4% in video prediction benchmarks (Human3.6M, KTH, and KittiCaltech), along with a 17.3% enhancement in image quality (LPIPS).

| **[AFCL: Analytic Federated Continual Learning for Spatio-Temporal Invariance of Non-IID Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12245v1)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Continual Learning (FCL) enables distributed clients to collaboratively train a global model from online task streams in dynamic real-world scenarios. However, existing FCL methods face challenges of both spatial data heterogeneity among distributed clients and temporal data heterogeneity across online tasks. Such data heterogeneity significantly degrades the model performance with severe spatial-temporal catastrophic forgetting of local and past knowledge. In this paper, we identify that the root cause of this issue lies in the inherent vulnerability and sensitivity of gradients to non-IID data. To fundamentally address this issue, we propose a gradient-free method, named Analytic Federated Continual Learning (AFCL), by deriving analytical (i.e., closed-form) solutions from frozen extracted features. In local training, our AFCL enables single-epoch learning with only a lightweight forward-propagation process for each client. In global aggregation, the server can recursively and efficiently update the global model with single-round aggregation. Theoretical analyses validate that our AFCL achieves spatio-temporal invariance of non-IID data. This ideal property implies that, regardless of how heterogeneous the data are distributed across local clients and online tasks, the aggregated model of our AFCL remains invariant and identical to that of centralized joint learning. Extensive experiments show the consistent superiority of our AFCL over state-of-the-art baselines across various benchmark datasets and settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Recent research on traffic forecasting has mainly focused on combining graph neural networks (GNNs) with other models. However, GNNs only consider short-range spatial information. In this study, we present a novel model termed LSTAN-GERPE (Lightweight Spatio-Temporal Attention Network with Graph Embedding and Rotational Position Encoding). This model leverages both Temporal and Spatial Attention mechanisms to effectively capture long-range traffic dynamics. Additionally, the optimal frequency for rotational position encoding is determined through a grid search approach in both the spatial and temporal attention mechanisms. This systematic optimization enables the model to effectively capture complex traffic patterns. The model also enhances feature representation by incorporating geographical location maps into the spatio-temporal embeddings. Without extensive feature engineering, the proposed method in this paper achieves advanced accuracy on the real-world traffic forecasting datasets PeMS04 and PeMS08.</p></details> |  |
| **[ListenNet: A Lightweight Spatio-Temporal Enhancement Nested Network for Auditory Attention Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10348v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Auditory attention detection (AAD) aims to identify the direction of the attended speaker in multi-speaker environments from brain signals, such as Electroencephalography (EEG) signals. However, existing EEG-based AAD methods overlook the spatio-temporal dependencies of EEG signals, limiting their decoding and generalization abilities. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Lightweight Spatio-Temporal Enhancement Nested Network (ListenNet) for AAD. The ListenNet has three key components: Spatio-temporal Dependency Encoder (STDE), Multi-scale Temporal Enhancement (MSTE), and Cross-Nested Attention (CNA). The STDE reconstructs dependencies between consecutive time windows across channels, improving the robustness of dynamic pattern extraction. The MSTE captures temporal features at multiple scales to represent both fine-grained and long-range temporal patterns. In addition, the CNA integrates hierarchical features more effectively through novel dynamic attention mechanisms to capture deep spatio-temporal correlations. Experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate the superiority of ListenNet over state-of-the-art methods in both subject-dependent and challenging subject-independent settings, while reducing the trainable parameter count by approximately 7 times.

In the human language system, experimental studies have observed clusters for syntactic and semantic categories, but the mechanisms underlying this functional organization remain unclear. Here, building on work from the vision literature, we develop TopoLM, a transformer language model with an explicit two-dimensional spatial representation of model units. By combining a next-token prediction objective with a spatial smoothness loss, representations in this model assemble into clusters that correspond to semantically interpretable groupings of text and closely match the functional organization in the brain's language system. TopoLM successfully predicts the emergence of the spatio-functional organization of a cortical language system as well as the organization of functional clusters selective for fine-grained linguistic features empirically observed in human cortex. Our results suggest that the functional organization of the human language system is driven by a unified spatial objective, and provide a functionally and spatially aligned model of language processing in the brain.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unified theory for joint covariance properties under geometric image transformations for spatio-temporal receptive fields according to the generalized Gaussian derivative model for visual receptive fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10543v9)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The influence of natural image transformations on receptive field responses is crucial for modelling visual operations in computer vision and biological vision. In this regard, covariance properties with respect to geometric image transformations in the earliest layers of the visual hierarchy are essential for expressing robust image operations, and for formulating invariant visual operations at higher levels. This paper defines and proves a set of joint covariance properties for spatio-temporal receptive fields in terms of spatio-temporal derivative operators applied to spatio-temporally smoothed image data under compositions of spatial scaling transformations, spatial affine transformations, Galilean transformations and temporal scaling transformations. Specifically, the derived relations show how the parameters of the receptive fields need to be transformed, in order to match the output from spatio-temporal receptive fields under composed spatio-temporal image transformations. For this purpose, we also fundamentally extend the notion of scale-normalized derivatives to affine-normalized derivatives, that are computed based on spatial smoothing with affine Gaussian kernels, and analyze the covariance properties of the resulting affine-normalized derivatives for the affine group as well as for important subgroups thereof. We conclude with a geometric analysis, showing how the derived joint covariance properties make it possible to relate or match spatio-temporal receptive field responses, when observing, possibly moving, local surface patches from different views, under locally linearized perspective or projective transformations, as well as when observing different instances of spatio-temporal events, that may occur either faster or slower between different views of similar spatio-temporal events.</p></details> | <details><summary>46 pa...</summary><p>46 pages, 19 figures.

| **[Beyond Pixels: Leveraging the Language of Soccer to Improve Spatio-Temporal Action Detection in Broadcast Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09455v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-of-the-art spatio-temporal action detection (STAD) methods show promising results for extracting soccer events from broadcast videos. However, when operated in the high-recall, low-precision regime required for exhaustive event coverage in soccer analytics, their lack of contextual understanding becomes apparent: many false positives could be resolved by considering a broader sequence of actions and game-state information. In this work, we address this limitation by reasoning at the game level and improving STAD through the addition of a denoising sequence transduction task. Sequences of noisy, context-free player-centric predictions are processed alongside clean game state information using a Transformer-based encoder-decoder model. By modeling extended temporal context and reasoning jointly over team-level dynamics, our method leverages the "language of soccer" - its tactical regularities and inter-player dependencies - to generate "denoised" sequences of actions. This approach improves both precision and recall in low-confidence regimes, enabling more reliable event extraction from broadcast video and complementing existing pixel-based methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, submitted to Advanced Concepts for Intelligent Vision Systems 2025</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Monotonic Modeling with Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Awareness in Diverse Marketing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14132v2)** | 2025-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the mobile internet era, the Online Food Ordering Service (OFOS) emerges as an integral component of inclusive finance owing to the convenience it brings to people. OFOS platforms offer dynamic allocation incentives to users and merchants through diverse marketing campaigns to encourage payments while maintaining the platforms' budget efficiency. Despite significant progress, the marketing domain continues to face two primary challenges: (i) how to allocate a limited budget with greater efficiency, demanding precision in predicting users' monotonic response (i.e. sensitivity) to incentives, and (ii) ensuring spatio-temporal adaptability and robustness in diverse marketing campaigns across different times and locations. To address these issues, we propose a Constrained Monotonic Adaptive Network (CoMAN) method for spatio-temporal perception within marketing pricing. Specifically, we capture spatio-temporal preferences within attribute features through two foundational spatio-temporal perception modules. To further enhance catching the user sensitivity differentials to incentives across varied times and locations, we design modules for learning spatio-temporal convexity and concavity as well as for expressing sensitivity functions. CoMAN can achieve a more efficient allocation of incentive investments during pricing, thus increasing the conversion rate and orders while maintaining budget efficiency. Extensive offline and online experimental results within our diverse marketing campaigns demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach while outperforming the monotonic state-of-the-art method.</p></details> | 12 pages |
| **[USTEP: Spatio-Temporal Predictive Learning under A Unified View](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05829v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal predictive learning plays a crucial role in self-supervised learning, with wide-ranging applications across a diverse range of fields. Previous approaches for temporal modeling fall into two categories: recurrent-based and recurrent-free methods. The former, while meticulously processing frames one by one, neglect short-term spatio-temporal information redundancies, leading to inefficiencies. The latter naively stack frames sequentially, overlooking the inherent temporal dependencies. In this paper, we re-examine the two dominant temporal modeling approaches within the realm of spatio-temporal predictive learning, offering a unified perspective. Building upon this analysis, we introduce USTEP (Unified Spatio-TEmporal Predictive learning), an innovative framework that reconciles the recurrent-based and recurrent-free methods by integrating both micro-temporal and macro-temporal scales. Extensive experiments on a wide range of spatio-temporal predictive learning demonstrate that USTEP achieves significant improvements over existing temporal modeling approaches, thereby establishing it as a robust solution for a wide range of spatio-temporal applications.</p></details> | Accepted by TPAMI |

However, most existing learning-based methods for event-based optical flow adopt frame-based techniques, ignoring the spatio-temporal characteristics of events. Additionally, these methods assume linear motion between consecutive events within the loss time window, which increases optical flow errors in long-time sequences. In this work, we observe that rich spatio-temporal information and accurate nonlinear motion between events are crucial for event-based optical flow estimation. Therefore, we propose E-NMSTFlow, a novel unsupervised event-based optical flow network focusing on long-time sequences. We propose a Spatio-Temporal Motion Feature Aware (STMFA) module and an Adaptive Motion Feature Enhancement (AMFE) module, both of which utilize rich spatio-temporal information to learn spatio-temporal data associations. Meanwhile, we propose a nonlinear motion compensation loss that utilizes the accurate nonlinear motion between events to improve the unsupervised learning of our network. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method. Remarkably, our method ranks first among unsupervised learning methods on the MVSEC and DSEC-Flow datasets.

The objective of the presented systematic literature review is hence to provide a comprehensive overview of the various modeling approaches and application domains of GNNs for time series classification and forecasting.

Existing solutions often rely on a pre-alignment strategy to normalize data, which can distort intrinsic patterns and escalate computational and memory demands. Addressing these limitations, we introduce STRGCN, a Spatio-Temporal Relational Graph Convolutional Network that avoids pre-alignment and directly captures the complex interdependencies in IMTS by representing them as a fully connected graph. Each observation is represented as a node, allowing the model to effectively handle misaligned timestamps by mapping all inter-node relationships, thus faithfully preserving the asynchronous nature of the data. Moreover, we enhance this model with a hierarchical ``Sandwich'' structure that strategically aggregates nodes to optimize graph embeddings, reducing computational overhead while maintaining detailed local and global context. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that STRGCN achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, competitive memory usage and training speed.</p></details> |  |

Our approach combines a LiDAR-RGB fusion module for 3D fruit localization with a 4D fruit association method leveraging positional, visual, and topology information for improved data association precision. Evaluated on real orchard data, our method achieves a 96.9% fruit counting accuracy for 1,790 apples across 60 trees, a mean fruit size estimation error of 1.1 cm, and a 23.7% improvement in 4D data association precision over baselines.

Neuromorphic disciplines view the brain as a coevolved system, simultaneously optimizing the hardware and the algorithms running on it. There are clear efficiency gains when bringing the computations into a physical substrate, but we presently lack theories to guide efficient implementations. Here, we present a principled computational model for neuromorphic systems in terms of spatio-temporal receptive fields, based on affine Gaussian kernels over space and leaky-integrator and leaky integrate-and-fire models over time. Our theory is provably covariant to spatial affine and temporal scaling transformations, and with close similarities to the visual processing in mammalian brains. We use these spatio-temporal receptive fields as a prior in an event-based vision task, and show that this improves the training of spiking networks, which otherwise is known as problematic for event-based vision. This work combines efforts within scale-space theory and computational neuroscience to identify theoretically well-founded ways to process spatio-temporal signals in neuromorphic systems. Our contributions are immediately relevant for signal processing and event-based vision, and can be extended to other processing tasks over space and time, such as memory and control.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/jegp/nrf</p></details> |

Accurate predictive models rely on high-resolution spatio-temporal data to capture the complex interplay of environmental and anthropogenic factors. To address the lack of localised and fine-grained datasets in Spain, this work introduces IberFire, a spatio-temporal datacube at 1 km x 1 km x 1-day resolution covering mainland Spain and the Balearic Islands from December 2007 to December 2024. IberFire integrates 260 features across eight main categories: auxiliary features, fire history, geography, topography, meteorology, vegetation indices, human activity, and land cover. All features are derived from open-access sources, ensuring transparency and real-time applicability. The data processing pipeline was implemented entirely using open-source tools, and the codebase has been made publicly available. This work not only enhances spatio-temporal granularity and feature diversity compared to existing European datacubes but also provides a reproducible methodology for constructing similar datasets. IberFire supports advanced wildfire risk modelling through Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques, enables climate pattern analysis and informs strategic planning in fire prevention and land management. The dataset is publicly available on Zenodo to promote open research and collaboration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-temporal data fusion of censored threshold exceedances](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20268v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data fusion models are widely used in air quality monitoring to integrate in situ and remote-sensing data, offering spatially complete and temporally detailed estimates. However, traditional Gaussian-based models often underestimate extreme pollution values, leading to biased risk assessments. To address this, we present a Bayesian hierarchical data fusion framework rooted in extreme value theory, using the Dirac-delta generalised Pareto distribution to jointly account for threshold and non-threshold exceedances while preserving the temporal structure of extreme events. Our model is used to describe and predict censored threshold exceedances of PM2.5 pollution in the Greater London region by using remote sensing observations from the EAC4 dataset, a reanalysis product from the Copernicus Atmospheric Monitoring Service (CAMS), and in situ observation stations from the automatic urban and rural network (AURN) ran by the UK government. Some of our approach's key innovations include combining data with varying spatio-temporal resolutions and fully accounting for parameter uncertainties. Results show that our model outperforms Gaussian-based alternatives and standalone remote-sensing data in predicting threshold exceedances at the majority of observation sites and can even result in improved spatial patterns of PM2.5 pollution than those discernible from the remote-sensing data. Moreover, our approach captures greater variability and spatial patterns, such as higher PM2.5 concentrations near coastal areas, which are not evident in remote-sensing data alone.</p></details> |  |
| **[3DPyranet Features Fusion for Spatio-temporal Feature Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18977v1)** | 2025-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Convolutional neural network (CNN) slides a kernel over the whole image to produce an output map. This kernel scheme reduces the number of parameters with respect to a fully connected neural network (NN). While CNN has proven to be an effective model in recognition of handwritten characters and traffic signal sign boards, etc. recently, its deep variants have proven to be effective in similar as well as more challenging applications like object, scene and action recognition. Deep CNN add more layers and kernels to the classical CNN, increasing the number of parameters, and partly reducing the main advantage of CNN which is less parameters. In this paper, a 3D pyramidal neural network called 3DPyraNet and a discriminative approach for spatio-temporal feature learning based on it, called 3DPyraNet-F, are proposed. 3DPyraNet introduces a new weighting scheme which learns features from both spatial and temporal dimensions analyzing multiple adjacent frames and keeping a biological plausible structure. It keeps the spatial topology of the input image and presents fewer parameters and lower computational and memory costs compared to both fully connected NNs and recent deep CNNs. 3DPyraNet-F extract the features maps of the highest layer of the learned network, fuse them in a single vector, and provide it as input in such a way to a linear-SVM classifier that enhances the recognition of human actions and dynamic scenes from the videos. Encouraging results are reported with 3DPyraNet in real-world environments, especially in the presence of camera induced motion. Further, 3DPyraNet-F clearly outperforms the state-of-the-art on three benchmark datasets and shows comparable result for the fourth.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods often fail to incorporate adequate spatio-temporal modeling and prompt alignment within a unified framework, resulting in temporal inconsistencies, geometric distortions, or low-quality 4D content that deviates from the provided texts. Therefore, we propose STP4D, a novel approach that aims to integrate comprehensive spatio-temporal-prompt consistency modeling for high-quality text-to-4D generation. Specifically, STP4D employs three carefully designed modules: Time-varying Prompt Embedding, Geometric Information Enhancement, and Temporal Extension Deformation, which collaborate to accomplish this goal. Furthermore, STP4D is among the first methods to exploit the Diffusion model to generate 4D Gaussians, combining the fine-grained modeling capabilities and the real-time rendering process of 4DGS with the rapid inference speed of the Diffusion model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STP4D excels in generating high-fidelity 4D content with exceptional efficiency (approximately 4.6s per asset), surpassing existing methods in both quality and speed.</p></details> |  |

Multi-sensor synchronous measurement has proven to be more effective for WHAR than using a single sensor. However, existing WHAR methods use shared convolutional kernels for indiscriminate temporal feature extraction across each sensor variable, which fails to effectively capture spatio-temporal relationships of intra-sensor and inter-sensor variables. We propose the DecomposeWHAR model consisting of a decomposition phase and a fusion phase to better model the relationships between modality variables. The decomposition creates high-dimensional representations of each intra-sensor variable through the improved Depth Separable Convolution to capture local temporal features while preserving their unique characteristics. The fusion phase begins by capturing relationships between intra-sensor variables and fusing their features at both the channel and variable levels. Long-range temporal dependencies are modeled using the State Space Model (SSM), and later cross-sensor interactions are dynamically captured through a self-attention mechanism, highlighting inter-sensor spatial correlations. Our model demonstrates superior performance on three widely used WHAR datasets, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art models while maintaining acceptable computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |

However, existing 3D segmentation models solely focus on spatial information. To address this gap, we propose OmniMamba4D, a novel segmentation model designed for 4D medical images (3D images over time). OmniMamba4D utilizes a spatio-temporal tetra-orientated Mamba block to effectively capture both spatial and temporal features. Unlike traditional 3D models, which analyze single-time points, OmniMamba4D processes 4D CT data, providing comprehensive spatio-temporal information on lesion progression. Evaluated on an internal dataset comprising of 3,252 CT scans, OmniMamba4D achieves a competitive Dice score of 0.682, comparable to state-of-the-arts (SOTA) models, while maintaining computational efficiency and better detecting disappeared lesions.

However, the inherent nonlinearity of the marine dynamic system presents significant challenges. Current forecasting methods mainly include physics-based numerical simulations and data-driven machine learning approaches. The former, while describing SST evolution through differential equations, suffers from high computational complexity and limited applicability, whereas the latter, despite its computational benefits, requires large datasets and faces interpretability challenges. This study presents a prediction framework based solely on data-driven techniques. Using phase space reconstruction, we construct initial-delay attractor pairs with a mathematical homeomorphism and design a Spatio-Temporal Fusion Mapping (STFM) to uncover their intrinsic connections. Unlike conventional models, our method captures SST dynamics efficiently through phase space reconstruction and achieves high prediction accuracy with minimal training data in comparative tests</p></details> | 19 pages, 14 figures |

However, the low resolution of TIR images, along with tracking interference, significantly limits the perfor-mance of TIR trackers. To address these challenges, we introduce STARS, a novel sparse learning-based CF tracker that incorporates spatio-temporal regulari-zation and super-resolution reconstruction. First, we apply adaptive sparse filter-ing and temporal domain filtering to extract key features of the target while reduc-ing interference from background clutter and noise. Next, we introduce an edge-preserving sparse regularization method to stabilize target features and prevent excessive blurring. This regularization integrates multiple terms and employs the alternating direction method of multipliers to optimize the solution. Finally, we propose a gradient-enhanced super-resolution method to extract fine-grained TIR target features and improve the resolution of TIR images, addressing performance degradation in tracking caused by low-resolution sequences. To the best of our knowledge, STARS is the first to integrate super-resolution methods within a sparse learning-based CF framework. Extensive experiments on the LSOTB-TIR, PTB-TIR, VOT-TIR2015, and VOT-TIR2017 benchmarks demonstrate that STARS outperforms state-of-the-art trackers in terms of robustness.</p></details> |  |

Among EEG techniques, the steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) is favored due to its robust signal-to-noise ratio, minimal training demands, and elevated information transmission rate. Frequency detection in SSVEP-based brain-computer interfaces commonly employs canonical correlation analysis (CCA). SSCCA (spatio-spectral canonical correlation analysis) augments CCA by refining spatial filtering. This paper presents a multistage feature fusion methodology for short-duration SSVEP frequency identification, employing SSCCA with template signals derived via leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV). A filterbank generates bandpass filters for stimulus frequencies and their harmonics, whereas SSCCA calculates correlation coefficients between subbands and templates. Two phases of non-linear weighting amalgamate these coefficients to discern the target stimulus. This multistage methodology surpasses traditional techniques, attaining a accuracy of 94.5%.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is presented in the Undergraduate Conference on Intelligent Computing and Systems (UCICS 2025) organised by Varendra University, Rajshahi, Bangladesh, 2025</p></details> |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Fuzzy-oriented Multi-Modal Meta-Learning for Fine-grained Emotion Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13541v3)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-grained emotion recognition (FER) plays a vital role in various fields, such as disease diagnosis, personalized recommendations, and multimedia mining. However, existing FER methods face three key challenges in real-world applications: (i) they rely on large amounts of continuously annotated data to ensure accuracy since emotions are complex and ambiguous in reality, which is costly and time-consuming; (ii) they cannot capture the temporal heterogeneity caused by changing emotion patterns, because they usually assume that the temporal correlation within sampling periods is the same; (iii) they do not consider the spatial heterogeneity of different FER scenarios, that is, the distribution of emotion information in different data may have bias or interference. To address these challenges, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Fuzzy-oriented Multi-modal Meta-learning framework (ST-F2M). Specifically, ST-F2M first divides the multi-modal videos into multiple views, and each view corresponds to one modality of one emotion. Multiple randomly selected views for the same emotion form a meta-training task. Next, ST-F2M uses an integrated module with spatial and temporal convolutions to encode the data of each task, reflecting the spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Then it adds fuzzy semantic information to each task based on generalized fuzzy rules, which helps handle the complexity and ambiguity of emotions. Finally, ST-F2M learns emotion-related general meta-knowledge through meta-recurrent neural networks to achieve fast and robust fine-grained emotion recognition. Extensive experiments show that ST-F2M outperforms various state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and model efficiency. In addition, we construct ablation studies and further analysis to explore why ST-F2M performs well.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

However, similar to most RGBT fusion tasks, it still mainly relies on manually aligned multimodal image pairs. In this paper, we propose a novel Multimodal Spatio-temporal Graph learning Network (MSGNet) for alignment-free RGBT VOD problem by leveraging the robust graph representation learning model. Specifically, we first design an Adaptive Partitioning Layer (APL) to estimate the corresponding regions of the Thermal image within the RGB image (high-resolution), achieving a preliminary inexact alignment. Then, we introduce the Spatial Sparse Graph Learning Module (S-SGLM) which employs a sparse information passing mechanism on the estimated inexact alignment to achieve reliable information interaction between different modalities. Moreover, to fully exploit the temporal cues for RGBT VOD problem, we introduce Hybrid Structured Temporal Modeling (HSTM), which involves a Temporal Sparse Graph Learning Module (T-SGLM) and Temporal Star Block (TSB). T-SGLM aims to filter out some redundant information between adjacent frames by employing the sparse aggregation mechanism on the temporal graph. Meanwhile, TSB is dedicated to achieving the complementary learning of local spatial relationships. Extensive comparative experiments conducted on both the aligned dataset VT-VOD50 and the unaligned dataset UVT-VOD2024 demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method. Our project will be made available on our website for free public access.</p></details> |  |

An effective load consolidation plan relies on carefully chosen consolidation points to ensure alignment with existing transportation management processes, such as driver scheduling, personnel planning, and terminal operations. This complexity represents a significant challenge when searching for optimal consolidation strategies. Traditional optimization-based methods provide exact solutions, but their computational complexity makes them impractical for large-scale instances and they fail to leverage historical data. Machine learning-based approaches address these issues but often ignore operational constraints, leading to infeasible consolidation plans. This work proposes SPOT, an end-to-end approach that integrates the benefits of machine learning (ML) and optimization for load consolidation. The ML component plays a key role in the planning phase by identifying the consolidation points through spatio-temporal clustering and constrained frequent itemset mining, while the optimization selects the most cost-effective feasible consolidation routes for a given operational day. Extensive experiments conducted on industrial load data demonstrate that SPOT significantly reduces travel distance and transportation costs (by about 50% on large terminals) compared to the existing industry-standard load planning strategy and a neighborhood-based heuristic. Moreover, the ML component provides valuable tactical-level insights by identifying frequently recurring consolidation opportunities that guide proactive planning. In addition, SPOT is computationally efficient and can be easily scaled to accommodate large transportation networks.</p></details> |  |

While approaches such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and rule-based reward mechanisms demonstrate promise in text and image domains, their application to video understanding remains limited. This paper presents a systematic exploration of Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) with GRPO for video MLLMs, aiming to enhance spatio-temporal perception while maintaining general capabilities. Our experiments reveal that RFT is highly data-efficient for task-specific improvements. Through multi-task RFT on spatio-temporal perception objectives with limited samples, we develop VideoChat-R1, a powerful video MLLM that achieves state-of-the-art performance on spatio-temporal perception tasks without sacrificing chat ability, while exhibiting emerging spatio-temporal reasoning abilities. Compared to Qwen2.5-VL-7B, VideoChat-R1 boosts performance several-fold in tasks like temporal grounding (+31.8) and object tracking (+31.2). Additionally, it significantly improves on general QA benchmarks such as VideoMME (+0.9), MVBench (+1.0), and Perception Test (+0.9). Our findings underscore the potential of RFT for specialized task enhancement of Video MLLMs. We hope our work offers valuable insights for future RL research in video MLLMs.</p></details> |  |

The key challenge of accurate prediction is how to model the complex spatio-temporal dependencies and adapt to the inherent dynamics in data. Traditional Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) often struggle with static adjacency matrices that introduce domain bias or learnable matrices that may be overfitting to specific patterns. This challenge becomes more complex when considering Multi-Task Learning (MTL). While MTL has the potential to enhance prediction accuracy through task synergies, it can also face significant hurdles due to task interference. To overcome these challenges, this study introduces a novel MTL framework, Dynamic Group-wise Spatio-Temporal Multi-Task Learning (DG-STMTL). DG-STMTL proposes a hybrid adjacency matrix generation module that combines static matrices with dynamic ones through a task-specific gating mechanism. We also introduce a group-wise GCN module to enhance the modelling capability of spatio-temporal dependencies. We conduct extensive experiments on two real-world datasets to evaluate our method. Results show that our method outperforms other state-of-the-arts, indicating its effectiveness and robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-resolution filters via linear projection for large spatio-temporal datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05315v3)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advances in compact sensing devices mounted on satellites have facilitated the collection of large spatio-temporal datasets with coordinates. Since such datasets are often incomplete and noisy, it is useful to create the prediction surface of a spatial field. To this end, we consider an online filtering inference by using the Kalman filter based on linear Gaussian state-space models. However, the Kalman filter is impractically time-consuming when the number of locations in spatio-temporal datasets is large. To address this problem, we propose a multi-resolution filter via linear projection (MRF-lp), a fast computation method for online filtering inference. In the MRF-lp, by carrying out a multi-resolution approximation via linear projection (MRA-lp), the forecast covariance matrix can be approximated while capturing both the large- and small-scale spatial variations. As a result of this approximation, our proposed MRF-lp preserves a block-sparse structure of some matrices appearing in the MRF-lp through time, which leads to the scalability of this algorithm. Additionally, we discuss extensions of the MRF-lp to a nonlinear and non-Gaussian case. Simulation studies and real data analysis for total precipitable water vapor demonstrate that our proposed approach performs well compared with the related methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>44 pa...</summary><p>44 pages, 10 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[SpaceVLLM: Endowing Multimodal Large Language Model with Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding Capability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13983v3)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made remarkable progress in either temporal or spatial localization. However, they struggle to perform spatio-temporal video grounding. This limitation stems from two major challenges. Firstly, it is difficult to extract accurate spatio-temporal information of each frame in the video. Secondly, the substantial number of visual tokens makes it challenging to precisely map visual tokens of each frame to their corresponding spatial coordinates. To address these issues, we introduce SpaceVLLM, a MLLM endowed with spatio-temporal video grounding capability. Specifically, we adopt a set of interleaved Spatio-Temporal Aware Queries to capture temporal perception and dynamic spatial information. Moreover, we propose a Query-Guided Space Decoder to establish a corresponding connection between the queries and spatial coordinates. Additionally, due to the lack of spatio-temporal datasets, we construct the Unified Spatio-Temporal Grounding (Uni-STG) dataset, comprising 480K instances across three tasks. This dataset fully exploits the potential of MLLM to simultaneously facilitate localization in both temporal and spatial dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SpaceVLLM achieves the state-of-the-art performance across 11 benchmarks covering temporal, spatial, spatio-temporal and video understanding tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach. Our code, datasets and model will be released at https://github.com/Jayce1kk/SpaceVLLM.</p></details> |  |

Traditional models often rely on parametric kernels, limiting their ability to capture heterogeneous, nonstationary dynamics. Recent innovations integrate deep neural architectures -- either by modeling the conditional intensity function directly or by learning flexible, data-driven influence kernels, substantially broadening their expressive power. This article reviews the development of the deep influence kernel approach, which enjoys statistical explainability, since the influence kernel remains in the model to capture the spatiotemporal propagation of event influence and its impact on future events, while also possessing strong expressive power, thereby benefiting from both worlds. We explain the main components in developing deep kernel point processes, leveraging tools such as functional basis decomposition and graph neural networks to encode complex spatial or network structures, as well as estimation using both likelihood-based and likelihood-free methods, and address computational scalability for large-scale data. We also discuss the theoretical foundation of kernel identifiability. Simulated and real-data examples highlight applications to crime analysis, earthquake aftershock prediction, and sepsis prediction modeling, and we conclude by discussing promising directions for the field.</p></details> |  |

Among all approaches, Functional Connectome (FC) is the most popular method. Computed by the correlation coefficients between ROI time series, FC is a powerful and computationally efficient way to estimate ROI connectivity. However, it is well known for neglecting structural connections and causality in ROI interactions. Also, FC becomes much more noisy in the short spatio-temporal sliding-window subsequences of fMRI. Effective Connectome (EC) is proposed as a directional alternative, but is difficult to accurately estimate. Furthermore, for optimal GNN performance, usually only a small percentage of the strongest connections are selected as sparse edges, resulting in oversimplification of complex brain connections. To tackle these challenges, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Node Attention Graph Neural Network (STNAGNN) as a data-driven alternative that combines sparse predefined FC with dense data-driven spatio-temporal connections, allowing for flexible and spatio-temporal learning of ROI interaction patterns.</p></details> |  |
| **[STPro: Spatial and Temporal Progressive Learning for Weakly Supervised Spatio-Temporal Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20678v2)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work we study Weakly Supervised Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding (WSTVG), a challenging task of localizing subjects spatio-temporally in videos using only textual queries and no bounding box supervision. Inspired by recent advances in vision-language foundation models, we investigate their utility for WSTVG, leveraging their zero-shot grounding capabilities. However, we find that a simple adaptation lacks essential spatio-temporal grounding abilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce Tubelet Referral Grounding (TRG), which connects textual queries to tubelets to enable spatio-temporal predictions. Despite its promise, TRG struggles with compositional action understanding and dense scene scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose STPro, a novel progressive learning framework with two key modules: (1) Sub-Action Temporal Curriculum Learning (SA-TCL), which incrementally builds compositional action understanding, and (2) Congestion-Guided Spatial Curriculum Learning (CG-SCL), which adapts the model to complex scenes by spatially increasing task difficulty. STPro achieves state-of-the-art results on three benchmark datasets, with improvements of 1.0% on VidSTG-Declarative and 3.0% on HCSTVG-v1.</p></details> | CVPR'25 Conference |

Although spatio-temporal traffic prediction has received extensive research attention, further improvements in prediction accuracy and computational efficiency remain necessary. In particular, existing decomposition-based methods or hybrid architectures often incur heavy overhead when capturing local and global feature correlations, necessitating novel approaches that optimize accuracy and complexity. In this paper, we propose an efficient spatio-temporal network traffic prediction framework, DP-LET, which consists of a data processing module, a local feature enhancement module, and a Transformer-based prediction module. The data processing module is designed for high-efficiency denoising of network data and spatial decoupling. In contrast, the local feature enhancement module leverages multiple Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) to capture fine-grained local features. Meanwhile, the prediction module utilizes a Transformer encoder to model long-term dependencies and assess feature relevance. A case study on real-world cellular traffic prediction demonstrates the practicality of DP-LET, which maintains low computational complexity while achieving state-of-the-art performance, significantly reducing MSE by 31.8% and MAE by 23.1% compared to baseline models.</p></details> | 6 pages |

We would like to verify these systems during runtime when they are deployed. Thus, we propose robust predictive runtime verification (RPRV) algorithms for: (1) general stochastic CPS under signal temporal logic (STL) tasks, and (2) stochastic multi-agent systems (MAS) under spatio-temporal logic tasks. The RPRV problem presents the following challenges: (1) there may not be sufficient data on the behavior of the deployed CPS, (2) predictive models based on design phase system trajectories may encounter distribution shift during real-world deployment, and (3) the algorithms need to scale to the complexity of MAS and be applicable to spatio-temporal logic tasks. To address these challenges, we assume knowledge of an upper bound on the statistical distance (in terms of an f-divergence) between the trajectory distributions of the system at deployment and design time. We are motivated by our prior work [1, 2] where we proposed an accurate and an interpretable RPRV algorithm for general CPS, which we here extend to the MAS setting and spatio-temporal logic tasks. Specifically, we use a learned predictive model to estimate the system behavior at runtime and robust conformal prediction to obtain probabilistic guarantees by accounting for distribution shifts. Building on [1], we perform robust conformal prediction over the robust semantics of spatio-temporal reach and escape logic (STREL) to obtain centralized RPRV algorithms for MAS. We empirically validate our results in a drone swarm simulator, where we show the scalability of our RPRV algorithms to MAS and analyze the impact of different trajectory predictors on the verification result. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first statistically valid algorithms for MAS under distribution shift.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2311.09482</p></details> |
| **[Towards Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning based Traffic Signal Control through Spatio-temporal Hypergraphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11014v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic signal control systems (TSCSs) are integral to intelligent traffic management, fostering efficient vehicle flow. Traditional approaches often simplify road networks into standard graphs, which results in a failure to consider the dynamic nature of traffic data at neighboring intersections, thereby neglecting higher-order interconnections necessary for real-time control. To address this, we propose a novel TSCS framework to realize intelligent traffic control. This framework collaborates with multiple neighboring edge computing servers to collect traffic information across the road network. To elevate the efficiency of traffic signal control, we have crafted a multi-agent soft actor-critic (MA-SAC) reinforcement learning algorithm. Within this algorithm, individual agents are deployed at each intersection with a mandate to optimize traffic flow across the road network collectively. Furthermore, we introduce hypergraph learning into the critic network of MA-SAC to enable the spatio-temporal interactions from multiple intersections in the road network. This method fuses hypergraph and spatio-temporal graph structures to encode traffic data and capture the complex spatio-temporal correlations between multiple intersections. Our empirical evaluation, tested on varied datasets, demonstrates the superiority of our framework in minimizing average vehicle travel times and sustaining high-throughput performance. This work facilitates the development of more intelligent urban traffic management solutions.

Decoding covert speech from electroencephalogram (EEG) is challenging due to a limited understanding of neural pronunciation mapping and the low signal-to-noise ratio of the signal. In this study, we developed a large-scale multi-utterance speech EEG dataset from 57 right-handed native English-speaking subjects, each performing covert and overt speech tasks by repeating the same word in five utterances within a ten-second duration. Given the spatio-temporal nature of the neural activation process during speech pronunciation, we developed a Functional Areas Spatio-temporal Transformer (FAST), an effective framework for converting EEG signals into tokens and utilizing transformer architecture for sequence encoding. Our results reveal distinct and interpretable speech neural features by the visualization of FAST-generated activation maps across frontal and temporal brain regions with each word being covertly spoken, providing new insights into the discriminative features of the neural representation of covert speech. This is the first report of such a study, which provides interpretable evidence for speech decoding from EEG.

| **[DRAN: A Distribution and Relation Adaptive Network for Spatio-temporal Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01531v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate predictions of spatio-temporal systems' states are crucial for tasks such as system management, control, and crisis prevention. However, the inherent time variance of spatio-temporal systems poses challenges to achieving accurate predictions whenever stationarity is not granted. To address non-stationarity frameworks, we propose a Distribution and Relation Adaptive Network (DRAN) capable of dynamically adapting to relation and distribution changes over time. While temporal normalization and de-normalization are frequently used techniques to adapt to distribution shifts, this operation is not suitable for the spatio-temporal context as temporal normalization scales the time series of nodes and possibly disrupts the spatial relations among nodes. In order to address this problem, we develop a Spatial Factor Learner (SFL) module that enables the normalization and de-normalization process in spatio-temporal systems. To adapt to dynamic changes in spatial relationships among sensors, we propose a Dynamic-Static Fusion Learner (DSFL) module that effectively integrates features learned from both dynamic and static relations through an adaptive fusion ratio mechanism. Furthermore, we introduce a Stochastic Learner to capture the noisy components of spatio-temporal representations. Our approach outperforms state of the art methods in weather prediction and traffic flows forecasting tasks. Experimental results show that our SFL efficiently preserves spatial relationships across various temporal normalization operations. Visualizations of the learned dynamic and static relations demonstrate that DSFL can capture both local and distant relationships between nodes. Moreover, ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each component.</p></details> | 15 pages, 9 figures |

Such data occurs widely, ranging from the scientific and medical domains to the industrial and environmental domains. When the properties in time series exhibit spatial variations, we often call the data spatio-temporal. As part of the continued digitalization of processes throughout society, increasingly large volumes of time series and spatio-temporal data are available. In this tutorial, we focus on data-driven decision making with such data, e.g., enabling greener and more efficient transportation based on traffic time series forecasting. The tutorial adopts the holistic paradigm of ``data-governance-analytics-decision.'' We first introduce the data foundation of time series and spatio-temporal data, which is often heterogeneous. Next, we discuss data governance methods that aim to improve data quality. We then cover data analytics, focusing on the ``AGREE'' principles: Automation, Generalization, Robustness, Explainability, and Efficiency. We finally cover data-driven decision making strategies and briefly discuss promising research directions.

However, the inherently sparse and non-deterministic nature of radar data limits the effectiveness of traditional single-frame BEV paradigms. In this paper, we addresses this limitation by introducing AttentiveGRU, a novel attention-based recurrent approach tailored for radar constraints, which extracts individualized spatio-temporal context for objects by dynamically identifying and fusing temporally correlated structures across present and memory states. By leveraging the consistency of object's latent representation over time, our approach exploits temporal relations to enrich feature representations for both stationary and moving objects, thereby enhancing detection performance and eliminating the need for externally providing or estimating any information about ego vehicle motion. Our experimental results on the public nuScenes dataset show a significant increase in mAP for the car category by 21% over the best radar-only submission. Further evaluations on an additional dataset demonstrate notable improvements in object detection capabilities, underscoring the applicability and effectiveness of our method.</p></details> |  |

Additionally, SNN possess a crucial characteristic, namely the ability to process spatio-temporal information. However, this ability is constrained by both internal and external factors in practical applications, thereby affecting the performance of SNN. Firstly, the internal issue of SNN lies in the inherent limitations of their network structure and neuronal model, which result in the network adopting a unified processing approach for information of different temporal dimensions when processing input data containing complex temporal information. Secondly, the external issue of SNN stems from the direct encoding method commonly adopted by directly trained SNN, which uses the same feature map for input at each time step, failing to fully exploit the spatio-temporal characteristics of SNN. To address these issues, this paper proposes an Unconstrained Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (ULIF) neuronal model that allows for learning different membrane potential parameters at different time steps, thereby enhancing SNN' ability to process information of different temporal dimensions. Additionally, this paper presents a hybrid encoding scheme aimed at solving the problem of direct encoding lacking temporal dimension information. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods effectively improve the overall performance of SNN in object detection and object recognition tasks. related code is available at https://github.com/hhx0320/ASNN.</p></details> |  |
| **[EventMamba: Enhancing Spatio-Temporal Locality with State Space Models for Event-Based Video Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19721v3)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging its robust linear global modeling capability, Mamba has notably excelled in computer vision. Despite its success, existing Mamba-based vision models have overlooked the nuances of event-driven tasks, especially in video reconstruction. Event-based video reconstruction (EBVR) demands spatial translation invariance and close attention to local event relationships in the spatio-temporal domain. Unfortunately, conventional Mamba algorithms apply static window partitions and standard reshape scanning methods, leading to significant losses in local connectivity. To overcome these limitations, we introduce EventMamba--a specialized model designed for EBVR tasks. EventMamba innovates by incorporating random window offset (RWO) in the spatial domain, moving away from the restrictive fixed partitioning. Additionally, it features a new consistent traversal serialization approach in the spatio-temporal domain, which maintains the proximity of adjacent events both spatially and temporally. These enhancements enable EventMamba to retain Mamba's robust modeling capabilities while significantly preserving the spatio-temporal locality of event data. Comprehensive testing on multiple datasets shows that EventMamba markedly enhances video reconstruction, drastically improving computation speed while delivering superior visual quality compared to Transformer-based methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[UniFlow: A Foundation Model for Unified Urban Spatio-Temporal Flow Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12972v3)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban spatio-temporal flow prediction, encompassing traffic flows and crowd flows, is crucial for optimizing city infrastructure and managing traffic and emergency responses. Traditional approaches have relied on separate models tailored to either grid-based data, representing cities as uniform cells, or graph-based data, modeling cities as networks of nodes and edges. In this paper, we build UniFlow, a foundational model for general urban flow prediction that unifies both grid-based and graphbased data. We first design a multi-view spatio-temporal patching mechanism to standardize different data into a consistent sequential format and then introduce a spatio-temporal transformer architecture to capture complex correlations and dynamics. To leverage shared spatio-temporal patterns across different data types and facilitate effective cross-learning, we propose SpatioTemporal Memory Retrieval Augmentation (ST-MRA). By creating structured memory modules to store shared spatio-temporal patterns, ST-MRA enhances predictions through adaptive memory retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniFlow outperforms existing models in both grid-based and graph-based flow prediction, excelling particularly in scenarios with limited data availability, showcasing its superior performance and broad applicability.

The hurdles to enhancing this capability include extensive manual labor, the lack of spatio-temporal compositionality in existing data and the absence of explicit reasoning supervision. In this paper, we propose STEP, a novel graph-guided self-training method that enables Video-LLMs to generate reasoning-rich fine-tuning data from any raw videos to improve itself. Specifically, we first induce Spatio-Temporal Scene Graph (STSG) representation of diverse videos to capture fine-grained, multi-granular video semantics. Then, the STSGs guide the derivation of multi-step reasoning Question-Answer (QA) data with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rationales. Both answers and rationales are integrated as training objective, aiming to enhance model's reasoning abilities by supervision over explicit reasoning steps. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of STEP across models of varying scales, with a significant 21.3\% improvement in tasks requiring three or more reasoning steps. Furthermore, it achieves superior performance with a minimal amount of self-generated rationale-enriched training samples in both compositional reasoning and comprehensive understanding benchmarks, highlighting the broad applicability and vast potential.</p></details> |  |

Built upon the powerful Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture, JavisDiT is able to generate high-quality audio and video content simultaneously from open-ended user prompts. To ensure optimal synchronization, we introduce a fine-grained spatio-temporal alignment mechanism through a Hierarchical Spatial-Temporal Synchronized Prior (HiST-Sypo) Estimator. This module extracts both global and fine-grained spatio-temporal priors, guiding the synchronization between the visual and auditory components. Furthermore, we propose a new benchmark, JavisBench, consisting of 10,140 high-quality text-captioned sounding videos spanning diverse scenes and complex real-world scenarios. Further, we specifically devise a robust metric for evaluating the synchronization between generated audio-video pairs in real-world complex content.

However, existing multi-sensor fusion research predominantly integrates complementary context from multiple images rather than videos. This primarily stems from two factors: 1) the scarcity of large-scale multi-sensor video datasets, limiting research in video fusion, and 2) the inherent difficulty of jointly modeling spatial and temporal dependencies in a unified framework. This paper proactively compensates for the dilemmas. First, we construct M3SVD, a benchmark dataset with $220$ temporally synchronized and spatially registered infrared-visible video pairs comprising 153,797 frames, filling the data gap for the video fusion community. Secondly, we propose VideoFusion, a multi-modal video fusion model that fully exploits cross-modal complementarity and temporal dynamics to generate spatio-temporally coherent videos from (potentially degraded) multi-modal inputs. Specifically, 1) a differential reinforcement module is developed for cross-modal information interaction and enhancement, 2) a complete modality-guided fusion strategy is employed to adaptively integrate multi-modal features, and 3) a bi-temporal co-attention mechanism is devised to dynamically aggregate forward-backward temporal contexts to reinforce cross-frame feature representations. Extensive experiments reveal that VideoFusion outperforms existing image-oriented fusion paradigms in sequential scenarios, effectively mitigating temporal inconsistency and interference.</p></details> |  |

VT migration is an effective way that migrates the VT when the locations of physical entities keep changing to maintain seamless immersive VT services. However, an efficient VT migration is challenging due to the rapid movement of vehicles, dynamic workloads of Roadside Units (RSUs), and heterogeneous resources of the RSUs. To achieve efficient migration decisions and a minimum latency for the VT migration, we propose a multi-agent split Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework combined with spatio-temporal trajectory generation. In this framework, multiple split DRL agents utilize split architecture to efficiently determine VT migration decisions. Furthermore, we propose a spatio-temporal trajectory generation algorithm based on trajectory datasets and road network data to simulate vehicle trajectories, enhancing the generalization of the proposed scheme for managing VT migration in dynamic network environments. Finally, experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme not only enhances the Quality of Experience (QoE) by 29% but also reduces the computational parameter count by approximately 25% while maintaining similar performances, enhancing users' immersive experiences in vehicular metaverses.</p></details> |  |

Our approach combines Bayesian Structural Time Series for modeling marginal crop yields, ensuring a more robust quantification of uncertainty given the typically short historical records. To capture dynamic dependencies between regions, we develop a time-varying conditional copula model, where the copula parameter evolves over time as a function of its previous lag and extreme weather covariates. Unlike traditional approaches that treat climatic factors as fixed inputs, we incorporate dynamic Generalized Extreme Value models to characterize extreme weather events, enabling a more accurate reflection of their impact on crop yields. Furthermore, to ensure scalability for large-scale applications, we build on the existing Partitioning Around Medoids clustering algorithm and introduce a novel dissimilarity measure that integrates both spatial and copula-based dependence, enabling an effective reduction of the dimensionality in the dependence structure.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches face a trilemma: diffusion-based methods achieve high visual fidelity but suffer from prohibitive computational costs, while GAN-based solutions sacrifice lip-sync accuracy or dental details for real-time performance. We present MuseTalk, a novel two-stage training framework that resolves this trade-off through latent space optimization and spatio-temporal data sampling strategy. Our key innovations include: (1) During the Facial Abstract Pretraining stage, we propose Informative Frame Sampling to temporally align reference-source pose pairs, eliminating redundant feature interference while preserving identity cues. (2) In the Lip-Sync Adversarial Finetuning stage, we employ Dynamic Margin Sampling to spatially select the most suitable lip-movement-promoting regions, balancing audio-visual synchronization and dental clarity. (3) MuseTalk establishes an effective audio-visual feature fusion framework in the latent space, delivering 30 FPS output at 256*256 resolution on an NVIDIA V100 GPU. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MuseTalk outperforms state-of-the-art methods in visual fidelity while achieving comparable lip-sync accuracy. %The codes and models will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

Recent advances have improved the spatial reasoning ability of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by introducing large-scale data, but these models still struggle to analyze kinematic elements like traveled distance and speed of moving objects. To bridge this gap, we construct a spatio-temporal reasoning dataset and benchmark involving kinematic instruction tuning, referred to as STKit and STKit-Bench. They consist of real-world videos with 3D annotations, detailing object motion dynamics: traveled distance, speed, movement direction, inter-object distance comparisons, and relative movement direction. To further scale such data construction to videos without 3D labels, we propose an automatic pipeline to generate pseudo-labels using 4D reconstruction in real-world scale. With our kinematic instruction tuning data for spatio-temporal reasoning, we present ST-VLM, a VLM enhanced for spatio-temporal reasoning, which exhibits outstanding performance on STKit-Bench. Furthermore, we show that ST-VLM generalizes robustly across diverse domains and tasks, outperforming baselines on other spatio-temporal benchmarks (eg, ActivityNet, TVQA+). Finally, by integrating learned spatio-temporal reasoning with existing abilities, ST-VLM enables complex multi-step reasoning. Project page: https://ikodoh.github.io/ST-VLM.</p></details> |  |

However, real-world visual relationships often exhibit a long-tailed distribution, causing existing methods for tasks like Video Scene Graph Generation (VidSGG) and Scene Graph Anticipation (SGA) to produce biased scene graphs. To this end, we propose ImparTail, a novel training framework that leverages loss masking and curriculum learning to mitigate bias in the generation and anticipation of spatio-temporal scene graphs. Unlike prior methods that add extra architectural components to learn unbiased estimators, we propose an impartial training objective that reduces the dominance of head classes during learning and focuses on underrepresented tail relationships. Our curriculum-driven mask generation strategy further empowers the model to adaptively adjust its bias mitigation strategy over time, enabling more balanced and robust estimations. To thoroughly assess performance under various distribution shifts, we also introduce two new tasks Robust Spatio-Temporal Scene Graph Generation and Robust Scene Graph Anticipation offering a challenging benchmark for evaluating the resilience of STSG models. Extensive experiments on the Action Genome dataset demonstrate the superior unbiased performance and robustness of our method compared to existing baselines.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |

We achieve this by introducing key improvements in multiple aspects: 1) network architecture: eliminating the dependency of reference multi-views and designing blending mechanism for 3D and frame attention, 2) data: enhancing quality and quantity of training data, 3) training strategy: adopting progressive 3D-4D training for better generalization, and 4) 4D optimization: handling 3D inconsistency and large motion via 2-stage refinement and progressive frame sampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant performance gain by SV4D 2.0 both visually and quantitatively, achieving better detail (-14\% LPIPS) and 4D consistency (-44\% FV4D) in novel-view video synthesis and 4D optimization (-12\% LPIPS and -24\% FV4D) compared to SV4D.

However, relation modeling between different image patches exhibits significant variations. For instance, background regions dominated by target-irrelevant information require reduced attention allocation, while foreground, particularly boundary areas, need to be be emphasized. A single model may not effectively handle all kinds of relation modeling simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a novel tracker called SPMTrack based on mixture-of-experts tailored for visual tracking task (TMoE), combining the capability of multiple experts to handle diverse relation modeling more flexibly. Benefiting from TMoE, we extend relation modeling from image pairs to spatio-temporal context, further improving tracking accuracy with minimal increase in model parameters. Moreover, we employ TMoE as a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method, substantially reducing trainable parameters, which enables us to train SPMTrack of varying scales efficiently and preserve the generalization ability of pretrained models to achieve superior performance. We conduct experiments on seven datasets, and experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art trackers.

Despite its importance, conventional LVEF estimation remains time-consuming and operator-dependent. Recent deep learning advancements have enhanced automation, yet many existing models are computationally demanding, hindering their feasibility for real-time clinical applications. Additionally, the interplay between spatial and temporal features is crucial for accurate estimation but is often overlooked. In this work, we propose Echo-E$^3$Net, an efficient Endo-Epi spatio-temporal network tailored for LVEF estimation. Our method introduces the Endo-Epi Cardial Border Detector (E$^2$CBD) module, which enhances feature extraction by leveraging spatial and temporal landmark cues. Complementing this, the Endo-Epi Feature Aggregator (E$^2$FA) distills statistical descriptors from backbone feature maps, refining the final EF prediction. These modules, along with a multi-component loss function tailored to align with the clinical definition of EF, collectively enhance spatial-temporal representation learning, ensuring robust and efficient EF estimation. We evaluate Echo-E$^3$Net on the EchoNet-Dynamic dataset, achieving a RMSE of 5.15 and an R$^2$ score of 0.82, setting a new benchmark in efficiency with 6.8 million parameters and only 8.49G Flops. Our model operates without pre-training, data augmentation, or ensemble methods, making it well-suited for real-time point-of-care ultrasound (PoCUS) applications.

| **[Whenever, Wherever: Towards Orchestrating Crowd Simulations with Spatio-Temporal Spawn Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16639v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Realistic crowd simulations are essential for immersive virtual environments, relying on both individual behaviors (microscopic dynamics) and overall crowd patterns (macroscopic characteristics). While recent data-driven methods like deep reinforcement learning improve microscopic realism, they often overlook critical macroscopic features such as crowd density and flow, which are governed by spatio-temporal spawn dynamics, namely, when and where agents enter a scene. Traditional methods, like random spawn rates, stochastic processes, or fixed schedules, are not guaranteed to capture the underlying complexity or lack diversity and realism. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach called nTPP-GMM that models spatio-temporal spawn dynamics using Neural Temporal Point Processes (nTPPs) that are coupled with a spawn-conditional Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for agent spawn and goal positions. We evaluate our approach by orchestrating crowd simulations of three diverse real-world datasets with nTPP-GMM. Our experiments demonstrate the orchestration with nTPP-GMM leads to realistic simulations that reflect real-world crowd scenarios and allow crowd analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Assessment of Spatio-Temporal Predictors in the Presence of Missing and Heterogeneous Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01701v2)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning approaches achieve outstanding predictive performance in modeling modern data, despite the increasing complexity and scale. However, evaluating the quality of predictive models becomes more challenging, as traditional statistical assumptions often no longer hold. In particular, spatio-temporal data exhibit dependencies across both time and space, often involving nonlinear dynamics, non-stationarities, and missing observations. As a result, advanced predictors such as spatio-temporal graph neural networks require novel evaluation methodologies. This paper introduces a residual correlation analysis framework designed to assess the optimality of spatio-temporal predictive neural models, particularly in scenarios with incomplete and heterogeneous data. By leveraging the principle that residual correlation indicates information not captured by the model, this framework serves as a powerful tool to identify and localize regions in space and time where model performance can be improved. A key advantage of the proposed approach is its ability to operate under minimal assumptions, enabling robust evaluation of deep learning models applied to multivariate time series, even in the presence of missing and heterogeneous data. The methodology employs tailored spatio-temporal graphs to encode sparse spatial and temporal dependencies within the data and utilizes asymptotically distribution-free summary statistics to pinpoint time intervals and spatial regions where the model underperforms. The effectiveness of the proposed residual analysis is demonstrated through validation on both synthetic and real-world scenarios involving state-of-the-art predictive models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Copula-based spatio-temporal modeling of air pollutant data incorporating covariate dependencies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15935v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Elevated levels of PM10 are known to cause severe respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, and, in extreme cases, cancer and mortality. Despite various reduction policies implemented across different sectors, PM10 concentrations in South Korea continue to exceed the annual recommended limits set by the World Health Organization. Spatio-temporal PM10 concentrations may exhibit both spatial and temporal dependencies. Additionally, interactions between PM10 and environmental factors can further influence the variability in PM10. Therefore, this study proposes a method that incorporates the spatio-temporal neighbors of covariates alongside those of PM10 by adopting an approach that explains spatio-temporal interactions through spatio-temporal neighbors. Vine copulas are used to integrate the pairwise dependence structures between a given location and its surrounding spatio-temporal neighbors. We applied the model to weekly average PM10 data from South Korea in 2019, using PM2.5 and CO as covariates. Given that all three variables exhibited skewness, we assumed the Gumbel and Generalized Extreme Value distributions as marginal distributions. The proposed model outperformed a traditional Bayesian spatio-temporal model, a kriging method, and an alternative copula-based approach, particularly in predicting the top 5% of extreme values, by effectively capturing tail dependencies crucial for extreme value analysis. This study highlights the importance of utilizing vine copulas to effectively model diverse dependency structures in spatio-temporal data while simultaneously accommodating spatial and temporal dimensions, including spatio-temporal dependencies among covariates. The results underscore the broader applicability of the proposed approach to other fields where complex dependency structures are present.</p></details> |  |
| **[BlockDance: Reuse Structurally Similar Spatio-Temporal Features to Accelerate Diffusion Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15927v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have demonstrated impressive generation capabilities, particularly with recent advancements leveraging transformer architectures to improve both visual and artistic quality. However, Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) continue to encounter challenges related to low inference speed, primarily due to the iterative denoising process. To address this issue, we propose BlockDance, a training-free approach that explores feature similarities at adjacent time steps to accelerate DiTs. Unlike previous feature-reuse methods that lack tailored reuse strategies for features at different scales, BlockDance prioritizes the identification of the most structurally similar features, referred to as Structurally Similar Spatio-Temporal (STSS) features. These features are primarily located within the structure-focused blocks of the transformer during the later stages of denoising. BlockDance caches and reuses these highly similar features to mitigate redundant computation, thereby accelerating DiTs while maximizing consistency with the generated results of the original model. Furthermore, considering the diversity of generated content and the varying distributions of redundant features, we introduce BlockDance-Ada, a lightweight decision-making network tailored for instance-specific acceleration. BlockDance-Ada dynamically allocates resources and provides superior content quality. Both BlockDance and BlockDance-Ada have proven effective across various generation tasks and models, achieving accelerations between 25% and 50% while maintaining generation quality.</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2025 |
| **[Causal Deciphering and Inpainting in Spatio-Temporal Dynamics via Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19608v3)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal (ST) prediction has garnered a De facto attention in earth sciences, such as meteorological prediction, human mobility perception. However, the scarcity of data coupled with the high expenses involved in sensor deployment results in notable data imbalances. Furthermore, models that are excessively customized and devoid of causal connections further undermine the generalizability and interpretability. To this end, we establish a causal framework for ST predictions, termed CaPaint, which targets to identify causal regions in data and endow model with causal reasoning ability in a two-stage process. Going beyond this process, we utilize the back-door adjustment to specifically address the sub-regions identified as non-causal in the upstream phase. Specifically, we employ a novel image inpainting technique. By using a fine-tuned unconditional Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) as the generative prior, we in-fill the masks defined as environmental parts, offering the possibility of reliable extrapolation for potential data distributions. CaPaint overcomes the high complexity dilemma of optimal ST causal discovery models by reducing the data generation complexity from exponential to quasi-linear levels. Extensive experiments conducted on five real-world ST benchmarks demonstrate that integrating the CaPaint concept allows models to achieve improvements ranging from 4.3% to 77.3%. Moreover, compared to traditional mainstream ST augmenters, CaPaint underscores the potential of diffusion models in ST enhancement, offering a novel paradigm for this field.

| **[Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks for Infant Language Acquisition Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14341v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting the words that a child is going to learn next can be useful for boosting language acquisition, and such predictions have been shown to be possible with both neural network techniques (looking at changes in the vocabulary state over time) and graph model (looking at data pertaining to the relationships between words). However, these models do not fully capture the complexity of the language learning process of an infant when used in isolation. In this paper, we examine how a model of language acquisition for infants and young children can be constructed and adapted for use in a Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (STGCN), taking into account the different types of linguistic relationships that occur during child language learning. We introduce a novel approach for predicting child vocabulary acquisition, and evaluate the efficacy of such a model with respect to the different types of linguistic relationships that occur during language acquisition, resulting in insightful observations on model calibration and norm selection. An evaluation of this model found that the mean accuracy of models for predicting new words when using sensorimotor relationships (0.733) and semantic relationships (0.729) were found to be superior to that observed with a 2-layer Feed-forward neural network. Furthermore, the high recall for some relationships suggested that some relationships (e.g. visual) were superior in identifying a larger proportion of relevant words that a child should subsequently learn than others (such as auditory).</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Distortion Aware Omnidirectional Video Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11506v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Omnidirectional video (ODV) provides an immersive visual experience and is widely utilized in virtual reality and augmented reality. However, restricted capturing devices and transmission bandwidth lead to low-resolution ODVs. Video super-resolution (SR) is proposed to enhance resolution, but practical ODV spatial projection distortions and temporal flickering are not well addressed directly applying existing methods. To achieve better ODV-SR reconstruction, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Distortion Aware Network (STDAN) oriented to ODV characteristics. Specifically, a spatially continuous distortion modulation module is introduced to improve discrete projection distortions. Next, we design an interlaced multi-frame reconstruction mechanism to refine temporal consistency across frames. Furthermore, we incorporate latitude-saliency adaptive weights during training to concentrate on regions with higher texture complexity and human-watching interest. In general, we explore inference-free and real-world viewing matched strategies to provide an application-friendly method on a novel ODV-SR dataset with practical scenarios. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed STDAN over state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Human-Centric Video Anomaly Detection Through Spatio-Temporal Pose Tokenization and Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15185v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) presents a significant challenge in computer vision, particularly due to the unpredictable and infrequent nature of anomalous events, coupled with the diverse and dynamic environments in which they occur. Human-centric VAD, a specialized area within this domain, faces additional complexities, including variations in human behavior, potential biases in data, and substantial privacy concerns related to human subjects. These issues complicate the development of models that are both robust and generalizable. To address these challenges, recent advancements have focused on pose-based VAD, which leverages human pose as a high-level feature to mitigate privacy concerns, reduce appearance biases, and minimize background interference. In this paper, we introduce SPARTA, a novel transformer-based architecture designed specifically for human-centric pose-based VAD. SPARTA introduces an innovative Spatio-Temporal Pose and Relative Pose (ST-PRP) tokenization method that produces an enriched representation of human motion over time. This approach ensures that the transformer's attention mechanism captures both spatial and temporal patterns simultaneously, rather than focusing on only one aspect. The addition of the relative pose further emphasizes subtle deviations from normal human movements. The architecture's core, a novel Unified Encoder Twin Decoders (UETD) transformer, significantly improves the detection of anomalous behaviors in video data. Extensive evaluations across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that SPARTA consistently outperforms existing methods, establishing a new state-of-the-art in pose-based VAD.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches, including spatio-temporal graph convolutional networks (ST-GCNs), often face high memory demands and struggle to capture complex spatio-temporal dependencies, limiting their efficiency in clinical applications. To address these challenges, we introduce DynSTG-Mamba (Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Graph Mamba), a novel framework that combines DF-STGNN and STG-Mamba to enhance motion sequence modeling. The DF-STGNN incorporates a dynamic spatio-temporal filter that adaptively adjusts spatial connections between skeletal joints and temporal interactions across different movement phases. This approach ensures better feature propagation through dynamic graph structures by considering the hierarchical nature and dynamics of skeletal gait data. Meanwhile, STG-Mamba, an extension of Mamba adapted for skeletal motion data, ensures a continuous propagation of states, facilitating the capture of long-term dependencies while reducing computational complexity. To reduce the number of model parameters and computational costs while maintaining consistency, we propose Cross-Graph Relational Knowledge Distillation, a novel knowledge transfer mechanism that aligns relational information between teacher (large architecture) and student models (small architecture) while using shared memory. This ensures that the interactions and movement patterns of the joints are accurately preserved in the motion sequences. We validate our DynSTG-Mamba on KOA-NM, PD-WALK, and ATAXIA datasets, where it outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by achieving in terms of Accuracy, F1-score, and Recall. Our results highlight the efficiency and robustness of our approach, offering a lightweight yet highly accurate solution for automated gait analysis and movement disorder assessment.</p></details> |  |

Our approach applies query-based detection (DETR) to each frame and matches DETR queries to link the same person across frames. We introduce the Query Matching Module (QMM), which uses metric learning to bring queries for the same person closer together across frames compared to queries for different people. Action classes are predicted using the sequence of queries obtained from QMM matching, allowing for variable-length inputs from videos longer than a single clip. Experimental results on JHMDB, UCF101-24, and AVA datasets demonstrate that our method performs well for large position changes of people while offering superior computational efficiency and lower resource requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>exten...</summary><p>extended version of VISAPP2025</p></details> |

Recently, we have witnessed the rise of variational autoencoder-based latent factor models, which learn latent factors self-adaptively. While these models focus on modeling overall market conditions, they often fail to effectively capture the temporal patterns of individual stocks. Additionally, representing multiple factors as single values simplifies the model but limits its ability to capture complex relationships and dependencies. As a result, the learned factors are of low quality and lack diversity, reducing their effectiveness and robustness across different trading periods. To address these issues, we propose a Spatio-Temporal factOR Model based on dual vector quantized variational autoencoders, named STORM, which extracts features of stocks from temporal and spatial perspectives, then fuses and aligns these features at the fine-grained and semantic level, and represents the factors as multi-dimensional embeddings. The discrete codebooks cluster similar factor embeddings, ensuring orthogonality and diversity, which helps distinguish between different factors and enables factor selection in financial trading. To show the performance of the proposed factor model, we apply it to two downstream experiments: portfolio management on two stock datasets and individual trading tasks on six specific stocks. The extensive experiments demonstrate STORM's flexibility in adapting to downstream tasks and superior performance over baseline models.</p></details> |  |

It is a multimodal task aimed at localizing specific subjects spatio-temporally based on textual queries without bounding box supervision. Motivated by recent advancements in multi-modal foundation models for grounding tasks, we first explore the potential of state-of-the-art object detection models for WSTVG. Despite their robust zero-shot capabilities, our adaptation reveals significant limitations, including inconsistent temporal predictions, inadequate understanding of complex queries, and challenges in adapting to difficult scenarios. We propose CoSPaL (Contextual Self-Paced Learning), a novel approach which is designed to overcome these limitations. CoSPaL integrates three core components: (1) Tubelet Phrase Grounding (TPG), which introduces spatio-temporal prediction by linking textual queries to tubelets; (2) Contextual Referral Grounding (CRG), which improves comprehension of complex queries by extracting contextual information to refine object identification over time; and (3) Self-Paced Scene Understanding (SPS), a training paradigm that progressively increases task difficulty, enabling the model to adapt to complex scenarios by transitioning from coarse to fine-grained understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR'...</summary><p>ICLR'25 Main Conference.

The complexity arises from the intricate interactions between scales and the interplay of diverse physical processes. Neural operators have emerged as promising models for predicting such dynamics due to their flexibility and computational efficiency. However, they often fail to effectively capture multi-scale interactions or quantify the uncertainties inherent in the predictions. These limitations lead to rapid error accumulation, particularly in long-term forecasting of systems characterized by complex and coupled dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose a spatio-temporal Fourier transformer (StFT), in which each transformer block is designed to learn dynamics at a specific scale. By leveraging a structured hierarchy of StFT blocks, the model explicitly captures dynamics across both macro- and micro- spatial scales. Furthermore, a generative residual correction mechanism is integrated to estimate and mitigate predictive uncertainties, enhancing both the accuracy and reliability of long-term forecasts. Evaluations conducted on three benchmark datasets (plasma, fluid, and atmospheric dynamics) demonstrate the advantages of our approach over state-of-the-art ML methods.</p></details> | 16 pages, 10 figures |

However, can Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) also "reason through a sequential spatio-temporal logic" in videos? Existing Video-LLM benchmarks primarily focus on assessing object presence, neglecting relational reasoning. Consequently, it is difficult to measure whether a model truly comprehends object interactions (actions/events) in videos or merely relies on pre-trained "memory" of co-occurrences as biases in generating answers. In this work, we introduce a Video Spatio-Temporal Reasoning (V-STaR) benchmark to address these shortcomings. The key idea is to decompose video understanding into a Reverse Spatio-Temporal Reasoning (RSTR) task that simultaneously evaluates what objects are present, when events occur, and where they are located while capturing the underlying Chain-of-thought (CoT) logic. To support this evaluation, we construct a dataset to elicit the spatial-temporal reasoning process of Video-LLMs. It contains coarse-to-fine CoT questions generated by a semi-automated GPT-4-powered pipeline, embedding explicit reasoning chains to mimic human cognition. Experiments from 14 Video-LLMs on our V-STaR reveal significant gaps between current Video-LLMs and the needs for robust and consistent spatio-temporal reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>A ben...</summary><p>A benchmark for Video Spatio-Temporal Reasoning</p></details> |

Nevertheless, conventional Mamba-based models encounter significant challenges in accurately predicting stock time series, as they fail to adequately capture both the overarching market dynamics and the intricate interdependencies among individual stocks. To overcome these constraints, we introduce the Hierarchical Information-Guided Spatio-Temporal Mamba (HIGSTM) framework. HIGSTM introduces Index-Guided Frequency Filtering Decomposition to extract commonality and specificity from time series. The model architecture features a meticulously designed hierarchical framework that systematically captures both temporal dynamic patterns and global static relationships within the stock market. Furthermore, we propose an Information-Guided Mamba that integrates macro informations into the sequence selection process, thereby facilitating more market-conscious decision-making. Comprehensive experimental evaluations conducted on the CSI500, CSI800 and CSI1000 datasets demonstrate that HIGSTM achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

Prior work primarily focuses on single-frame cooperative perception, which fuses agents' information across different spatial locations but ignores temporal cues and temporal tasks (e.g., temporal perception and prediction). In this paper, we focus on the spatio-temporal fusion in V2X scenarios and design one-step and multi-step communication strategies (when to transmit) as well as examine their integration with three fusion strategies - early, late, and intermediate (what to transmit), providing comprehensive benchmarks with 11 fusion models (how to fuse). Furthermore, we propose V2XPnP, a novel intermediate fusion framework within one-step communication for end-to-end perception and prediction. Our framework employs a unified Transformer-based architecture to effectively model complex spatio-temporal relationships across multiple agents, frames, and high-definition map. Moreover, we introduce the V2XPnP Sequential Dataset that supports all V2X collaboration modes and addresses the limitations of existing real-world datasets, which are restricted to single-frame or single-mode cooperation. Extensive experiments demonstrate our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both perception and prediction tasks.

Compared to classic STVG locating only a single target, OmniSTVG enables localization of not only an arbitrary number of text-referred targets but also their interacting counterparts in the query from the video, making it more flexible and practical in real scenarios for comprehensive understanding. In order to facilitate exploration of OmniSTVG, we introduce BOSTVG, a large-scale benchmark dedicated to OmniSTVG. Specifically, our BOSTVG consists of 10,018 videos with 10.2M frames and covers a wide selection of 287 classes from diverse scenarios. Each sequence in BOSTVG, paired with a free-form textual query, encompasses a varying number of targets ranging from 1 to 10. To ensure high quality, each video is manually annotated with meticulous inspection and refinement. To our best knowledge, BOSTVG is to date the first and the largest benchmark for OmniSTVG. To encourage future research, we introduce a simple yet effective approach, named OmniTube, which, drawing inspiration from Transformer-based STVG methods, is specially designed for OmniSTVG and demonstrates promising results. By releasing BOSTVG, we hope to go beyond classic STVG by locating every object appearing in the query for more comprehensive understanding, opening up a new direction for STVG. Our benchmark, model, and results will be released at https://github.com/JellyYao3000/OmniSTVG.</p></details> |  |

Traditional deep learning approaches have significantly advanced this field, particularly in the stage of ST data mining. However, these models remain task-specific and often require extensive labeled data. Inspired by the success of Foundation Models (FM), especially large language models, researchers have begun exploring the concept of Spatio-Temporal Foundation Models (STFMs) to enhance adaptability and generalization across diverse ST tasks. Unlike prior architectures, STFMs empower the entire workflow of ST data science, ranging from data sensing, management, to mining, thereby offering a more holistic and scalable approach. Despite rapid progress, a systematic study of STFMs for ST data science remains lacking. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive review of STFMs, categorizing existing methodologies and identifying key research directions to advance ST general intelligence.</p></details> |  |

Utilizing existing observations, spatio-temporal kriging is a method for estimating air quality at unobserved locations during a specific period. Inductive spatio-temporal kriging with increment training strategy has demonstrated its effectiveness using virtual nodes to simulate unobserved nodes. However, a disparity between virtual and real nodes persists, complicating the application of learning patterns derived from virtual nodes to actual unobserved ones. To address these limitations, this paper presents a Physics-Guided Increment Training Strategy (PGITS). Specifically, we design a dynamic graph generation module to incorporate the advection and diffusion processes of airborne particles as physical knowledge into the graph structure, dynamically adjusting the adjacency matrix to reflect physical interactions between nodes. By using physics principles as a bridge between virtual and real nodes, this strategy ensures the features of virtual nodes and their pseudo labels are closer to actual nodes. Consequently, the learned patterns of virtual nodes can be applied to actual unobserved nodes for effective kriging.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Traffic Prediction Through Spatio-Temporal Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10459v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained considerable attention in recent years for traffic flow prediction due to their ability to learn spatio-temporal pattern representations through a graph-based message-passing framework. Although GNNs have shown great promise in handling traffic datasets, their deployment in real-life applications has been hindered by scalability constraints arising from high-order message passing. Additionally, the over-smoothing problem of GNNs may lead to indistinguishable region representations as the number of layers increases, resulting in performance degradation. To address these challenges, we propose a new knowledge distillation paradigm termed LightST that transfers spatial and temporal knowledge from a high-capacity teacher to a lightweight student. Specifically, we introduce a spatio-temporal knowledge distillation framework that helps student MLPs capture graph-structured global spatio-temporal patterns while alleviating the over-smoothing effect with adaptive knowledge distillation. Extensive experiments verify that LightST significantly speeds up traffic flow predictions by 5X to 40X compared to state-of-the-art spatio-temporal GNNs, all while maintaining superior accuracy.</p></details> | 9 pages |

| **[Network Generating Processes With Self Exciting Arrival Times](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22659v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a novel modeling framework for time-evolving networks allowing for long-term dependence in network features that update in continuous time. Dynamic network growth is functionally parameterized via the conditional intensity of a marked point process. This characterization enables flexible modeling of both the time of updates and the network updates themselves, dependent on the entire left-continuous sample path. We propose a path-dependent nonlinear marked Hawkes process as an expressive platform for modeling such data; its dynamic mark space embeds the time-evolving network. We establish stability conditions, demonstrate simulation and subsequent feasible likelihood-based inference through numerical study, and present an application to conference attendee social network data. The resulting methodology serves as a general framework that can be readily adapted to a wide range of network topologies and point process model specifications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Test-Time Alignment of Discrete Diffusion Models with Sequential Monte Carlo](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22524v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discrete diffusion models have become highly effective across various domains. However, real-world applications often require the generative process to adhere to certain constraints but without task-specific fine-tuning. To this end, we propose a training-free method based on Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) to sample from the reward-aligned target distribution at the test time. Our approach leverages twisted SMC with an approximate locally optimal proposal, obtained via a first-order Taylor expansion of the reward function. To address the challenge of ill-defined gradients in discrete spaces, we incorporate a Gumbel-Softmax relaxation, enabling efficient gradient-based approximation within the discrete generative framework. Empirical results on both synthetic datasets and image modelling validate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Accelerating Optimization via Differentiable Stopping Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22509v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimization is an important module of modern machine learning applications. Tremendous efforts have been made to accelerate optimization algorithms. A common formulation is achieving a lower loss at a given time. This enables a differentiable framework with respect to the algorithm hyperparameters. In contrast, its dual, minimizing the time to reach a target loss, is believed to be non-differentiable, as the time is not differentiable. As a result, it usually serves as a conceptual framework or is optimized using zeroth-order methods. To address this limitation, we propose a differentiable stopping time and theoretically justify it based on differential equations. An efficient algorithm is designed to backpropagate through it. As a result, the proposed differentiable stopping time enables a new differentiable formulation for accelerating algorithms. We further discuss its applications, such as online hyperparameter tuning and learning to optimize. Our proposed methods show superior performance in comprehensive experiments across various problems, which confirms their effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data-Driven Control of Continuous-Time LTI Systems via Non-Minimal Realizations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22505v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This article proposes an approach to design output-feedback controllers for unknown continuous-time linear time-invariant systems using only input-output data from a single experiment. To address the lack of state and derivative measurements, we introduce non-minimal realizations whose states can be observed by filtering the available data. We first apply this concept to the disturbance-free case, formulating linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) from batches of sampled signals to design a dynamic, filter-based stabilizing controller. The framework is then extended to the problem of asymptotic tracking and disturbance rejection - in short, output regulation - by incorporating an internal model based on prior knowledge of the disturbance/reference frequencies. Finally, we discuss tuning strategies for a class of multi-input multi-output systems and illustrate the method via numerical examples.</p></details> |  |
| **[COSMOS: A Data-Driven Probabilistic Time Series simulator for Chemical Plumes across Spatial Scales](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22436v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of robust odor navigation strategies for automated environmental monitoring applications requires realistic simulations of odor time series for agents moving across large spatial scales. Traditional approaches that rely on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods can capture the spatiotemporal dynamics of odor plumes, but are impractical for large-scale simulations due to their computational expense. On the other hand, puff-based simulations, although computationally tractable for large scales and capable of capturing the stochastic nature of plumes, fail to reproduce naturalistic odor statistics. Here, we present COSMOS (Configurable Odor Simulation Model over Scalable Spaces), a data-driven probabilistic framework that synthesizes realistic odor time series from spatial and temporal features of real datasets. COSMOS generates similar distributions of key statistical features such as whiff frequency, duration, and concentration as observed in real data, while dramatically reducing computational overhead. By reproducing critical statistical properties across a variety of flow regimes and scales, COSMOS enables the development and evaluation of agent-based navigation strategies with naturalistic odor experiences. To demonstrate its utility, we compare odor-tracking agents exposed to CFD-generated plumes versus COSMOS simulations, showing that both their odor experiences and resulting behaviors are quite similar.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 4 primary figures</p></details> |
| **[STDR: Spatio-Temporal Decoupling for Real-Time Dynamic Scene Rendering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22400v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although dynamic scene reconstruction has long been a fundamental challenge in 3D vision, the recent emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offers a promising direction by enabling high-quality, real-time rendering through explicit Gaussian primitives. However, existing 3DGS-based methods for dynamic reconstruction often suffer from \textit{spatio-temporal incoherence} during initialization, where canonical Gaussians are constructed by aggregating observations from multiple frames without temporal distinction. This results in spatio-temporally entangled representations, making it difficult to model dynamic motion accurately. To overcome this limitation, we propose \textbf{STDR} (Spatio-Temporal Decoupling for Real-time rendering), a plug-and-play module that learns spatio-temporal probability distributions for each Gaussian. STDR introduces a spatio-temporal mask, a separated deformation field, and a consistency regularization to jointly disentangle spatial and temporal patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that incorporating our module into existing 3DGS-based dynamic scene reconstruction frameworks leads to notable improvements in both reconstruction quality and spatio-temporal consistency across synthetic and real-world benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inference-Time Scaling for Flow Models via Stochastic Generation and Rollover Budget Forcing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19385v4)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose an inference-time scaling approach for pretrained flow models. Recently, inference-time scaling has gained significant attention in LLMs and diffusion models, improving sample quality or better aligning outputs with user preferences by leveraging additional computation. For diffusion models, particle sampling has allowed more efficient scaling due to the stochasticity at intermediate denoising steps. On the contrary, while flow models have gained popularity as an alternative to diffusion models--offering faster generation and high-quality outputs in state-of-the-art image and video generative models--efficient inference-time scaling methods used for diffusion models cannot be directly applied due to their deterministic generative process. To enable efficient inference-time scaling for flow models, we propose three key ideas: 1) SDE-based generation, enabling particle sampling in flow models, 2) Interpolant conversion, broadening the search space and enhancing sample diversity, and 3) Rollover Budget Forcing (RBF), an adaptive allocation of computational resources across timesteps to maximize budget utilization. Our experiments show that SDE-based generation, particularly variance-preserving (VP) interpolant-based generation, improves the performance of particle sampling methods for inference-time scaling in flow models. Additionally, we demonstrate that RBF with VP-SDE achieves the best performance, outperforming all previous inference-time scaling approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://flow-inference-time-scaling.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[A Divide-and-Conquer Approach for Modeling Arrival Times in Business Process Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22381v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Business Process Simulation (BPS) is a critical tool for analyzing and improving organizational processes by estimating the impact of process changes. A key component of BPS is the case-arrival model, which determines the pattern of new case entries into a process. Although accurate case-arrival modeling is essential for reliable simulations, as it influences waiting and overall cycle times, existing approaches often rely on oversimplified static distributions of inter-arrival times. These approaches fail to capture the dynamic and temporal complexities inherent in organizational environments, leading to less accurate and reliable outcomes. To address this limitation, we propose Auto Time Kernel Density Estimation (AT-KDE), a divide-and-conquer approach that models arrival times of processes by incorporating global dynamics, day-of-week variations, and intraday distributional changes, ensuring both precision and scalability. Experiments conducted across 20 diverse processes demonstrate that AT-KDE is far more accurate and robust than existing approaches while maintaining sensible execution time efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking the Unsolvable: When In-Context Search Meets Test-Time Scaling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22290v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research has highlighted that Large Language Models (LLMs), even when trained to generate extended long reasoning steps, still face significant challenges on hard reasoning problems. However, much of the existing literature relies on direct prompting with simple in-context learning examples for evaluation, which largely overlooks advanced techniques to elicit LLMs' deliberate reasoning before drawing conclusions that LLMs hit a performance ceiling. In this paper, we systematically explore the combined potential of in-context search and test-time scaling on super hard reasoning tasks. We find that by employing advanced in-context search prompting to LLMs augmented with internal scaling, one can achieve transformative performance breakthroughs on tasks previously deemed "unsolvable" (e.g., reported success rates below 5%). We provide both empirical results and theoretical analysis of how this combination can unleash LLM reasoning capabilities: i) Empirically, on controlled NP-hard tasks and complex real-world planning benchmarks, our approach achieves up to a 30x improvement in success rates compared to previously reported results without any external mechanisms; ii) Theoretically, we show that in-context search prompting, when combined with internal scaling, significantly extends the complexity class of solvable reasoning problems. These findings challenge prevailing assumptions about the limitations of LLMs on complex tasks, indicating that current evaluation paradigms systematically underestimate their true potential. Our work calls for a critical reassessment of how LLM reasoning is benchmarked and a more robust evaluation strategy that fully captures the true capabilities of contemporary LLMs, which can lead to a better understanding of their operational reasoning boundaries in real-world deployments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Dual Process Theory in Language Agent Framework for Real-time Simultaneous Human-AI Collaboration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11882v5)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agents built on large language models (LLMs) have excelled in turn-by-turn human-AI collaboration but struggle with simultaneous tasks requiring real-time interaction. Latency issues and the challenge of inferring variable human strategies hinder their ability to make autonomous decisions without explicit instructions. Through experiments with current independent System 1 and System 2 methods, we validate the necessity of using Dual Process Theory (DPT) in real-time tasks. We propose DPT-Agent, a novel language agent framework that integrates System 1 and System 2 for efficient real-time simultaneous human-AI collaboration. DPT-Agent's System 1 uses a Finite-state Machine (FSM) and code-as-policy for fast, intuitive, and controllable decision-making. DPT-Agent's System 2 integrates Theory of Mind (ToM) and asynchronous reflection to infer human intentions and perform reasoning-based autonomous decisions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DPT-Agent through further experiments with rule-based agents and human collaborators, showing significant improvements over mainstream LLM-based frameworks. DPT-Agent can effectively help LLMs convert correct slow thinking and reasoning into executable actions, thereby improving performance. To the best of our knowledge, DPT-Agent is the first language agent framework that achieves successful real-time simultaneous human-AI collaboration autonomously. Code of DPT-Agent can be found in https://github.com/sjtu-marl/DPT-Agent.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACL 2025 Main. Camera Ready Version</p></details> |

Various defense methods are proposed to defend against jailbreak attacks, however, they are often tailored to specific types of jailbreak attacks, limiting their effectiveness against diverse adversarial strategies. For instance, rephrasing-based defenses are effective against text adversarial jailbreaks but fail to counteract image-based attacks. To overcome these limitations, we propose a universal defense framework, termed Test-time IMmunization (TIM), which can adaptively defend against various jailbreak attacks in a self-evolving way. Specifically, TIM initially trains a gist token for efficient detection, which it subsequently applies to detect jailbreak activities during inference. When jailbreak attempts are identified, TIM implements safety fine-tuning using the detected jailbreak instructions paired with refusal answers. Furthermore, to mitigate potential performance degradation in the detector caused by parameter updates during safety fine-tuning, we decouple the fine-tuning process from the detection module. Extensive experiments on both LLMs and multimodal LLMs demonstrate the efficacy of TIM.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Two-stage Audio-Visual Target Speaker Extraction System for Real-Time Processing On Edge Device](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22229v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Audio-Visual Target Speaker Extraction (AVTSE) aims to isolate a target speaker's voice in a multi-speaker environment with visual cues as auxiliary. Most of the existing AVTSE methods encode visual and audio features simultaneously, resulting in extremely high computational complexity and making it impractical for real-time processing on edge devices. To tackle this issue, we proposed a two-stage ultra-compact AVTSE system. Specifically, in the first stage, a compact network is employed for voice activity detection (VAD) using visual information. In the second stage, the VAD results are combined with audio inputs to isolate the target speaker's voice. Experiments show that the proposed system effectively suppresses background noise and interfering voices while spending little computational resources.</p></details> |  |
| **[Continuous Self-Improvement of Large Language Models by Test-time Training with Verifier-Driven Sample Selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19475v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning to adapt pretrained language models to unlabeled, out-of-distribution data is a critical challenge, as models often falter on structurally novel reasoning tasks even while excelling within their training distribution. We introduce a new framework called VDS-TTT - Verifier-Driven Sample Selection for Test-Time Training to efficiently address this. We use a learned verifier to score a pool of generated responses and select only from high ranking pseudo-labeled examples for fine-tuned adaptation. Specifically, for each input query our LLM generates N candidate answers; the verifier assigns a reliability score to each, and the response with the highest confidence and above a fixed threshold is paired with its query for test-time training. We fine-tune only low-rank LoRA adapter parameters, ensuring adaptation efficiency and fast convergence. Our proposed self-supervised framework is the first to synthesize verifier driven test-time training data for continuous self-improvement of the model. Experiments across three diverse benchmarks and three state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate that VDS-TTT yields up to a 32.29% relative improvement over the base model and a 6.66% gain compared to verifier-based methods without test-time training, highlighting its effectiveness and efficiency for on-the-fly large language model adaptation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Broadcast in Almost Mixing Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02165v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the problem of broadcasting multiple messages in the CONGEST model. In this problem, a dedicated source node $s$ possesses a set $M$ of messages with every message of size $O(\log n)$ where $n$ is the total number of nodes. The objective is to ensure that every node in the network learns all messages in $M$. The execution of an algorithm progresses in rounds, and we focus on optimizing the round complexity of broadcasting multiple messages. Our primary contribution is a randomized algorithm for networks with expander topology, which are widely used in practice for building scalable and robust distributed systems. The algorithm succeeds with high probability and achieves a round complexity that is optimal up to a factor of the network's mixing time and polylogarithmic terms. It leverages a multi-COBRA primitive, which uses multiple branching random walks running in parallel. To the best of our knowledge, this approach has not been applied in distributed algorithms before. A crucial aspect of our method is the use of these branching random walks to construct an optimal (up to a polylogarithmic factor) tree packing of a random graph, which is then used for efficient broadcasting. This result is of independent interest. We also prove the problem to be NP-hard in a centralized setting and provide insights into why straightforward lower bounds for general graphs, namely graph diameter and $\frac{|M|}{\textit{minCut}}$, cannot be tight.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semantics-aware Test-time Adaptation for 3D Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10724v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work highlights a semantics misalignment in 3D human pose estimation. For the task of test-time adaptation, the misalignment manifests as overly smoothed and unguided predictions. The smoothing settles predictions towards some average pose. Furthermore, when there are occlusions or truncations, the adaptation becomes fully unguided. To this end, we pioneer the integration of a semantics-aware motion prior for the test-time adaptation of 3D pose estimation. We leverage video understanding and a well-structured motion-text space to adapt the model motion prediction to adhere to video semantics during test time. Additionally, we incorporate a missing 2D pose completion based on the motion-text similarity. The pose completion strengthens the motion prior's guidance for occlusions and truncations. Our method significantly improves state-of-the-art 3D human pose estimation TTA techniques, with more than 12% decrease in PA-MPJPE on 3DPW and 3DHP.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Personalized Tree based progressive regression model for watch-time prediction in short video recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22153v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In online video platforms, accurate watch time prediction has become a fundamental and challenging problem in video recommendation. Previous research has revealed that the accuracy of watch time prediction highly depends on both the transformation of watch-time labels and the decomposition of the estimation process. TPM (Tree based Progressive Regression Model) achieves State-of-the-Art performance with a carefully designed and effective decomposition paradigm. TPM discretizes the watch time into several ordinal intervals and organizes them into a binary decision tree, where each node corresponds to a specific interval. At each non-leaf node, a binary classifier is used to determine the specific interval in which the watch time variable most likely falls, based on the prediction outcome at its parent node. The tree structure serves as the core of TPM, as it defines the decomposition of watch time estimation and determines how the ordinal intervals are discretized. However, in TPM, the tree is predefined as a full binary tree, which may be sub-optimal for the following reasons. First, a full binary tree implies an equal partitioning of the watch time space, which may struggle to capture the complexity of real-world watch time distributions. Second, instead of relying on a globally fixed tree structure, we advocate for a personalized, data-driven tree that can be learned in an end-to-end manner. Therefore, we propose PTPM to enable a highly personalized decomposition of watch estimation with better efficacy and efficiency. Moreover, we reveal that TPM is affected by selection bias due to conditional modeling and devise a simple approach to address it. We conduct extensive experiments on both offline datasets and online environments. PTPM has been fully deployed in core traffic scenarios and serves more than 400 million users per day.</p></details> |  |
| **[Conditional Denoising Meets Polynomial Modeling: A Flexible Decoupled Framework for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13253v6)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting models are becoming increasingly prevalent due to their critical role in decision-making across various domains. However, most existing approaches represent the coupled temporal patterns, often neglecting the distinction between their specific components. In particular, fluctuating patterns and smooth trends within time series exhibit distinct characteristics. In this work, to model complicated temporal patterns, we propose a Conditional Denoising Polynomial Modeling (CDPM) framework, where probabilistic diffusion models and deterministic linear models are trained end-to-end. Instead of modeling the coupled time series, CDPM decomposes it into trend and seasonal components for modeling them separately. To capture the fluctuating seasonal component, we employ a probabilistic diffusion model based on statistical properties from the historical window. For the smooth trend component, a module is proposed to enhance linear models by incorporating historical dependencies, thereby preserving underlying trends and mitigating noise distortion. Extensive experiments conducted on six benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, highlighting the potential of combining probabilistic and deterministic models.Our code is available at https://github.com/zjt-gpu/CDPM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Test-time Computation Mitigate Memorization Bias in Neural Symbolic Regression?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22081v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Symbolic regression aims to discover mathematical equations that fit given numerical data. It has been applied in various fields of scientific research, such as producing human-readable expressions that explain physical phenomena. Recently, Neural symbolic regression (NSR) methods that involve Transformers pre-trained on large-scale synthetic datasets have gained attention. While these methods offer advantages such as short inference time, they suffer from low performance, particularly when the number of input variables is large. In this study, we hypothesized that this limitation stems from the memorization bias of Transformers in symbolic regression. We conducted a quantitative evaluation of this bias in Transformers using a synthetic dataset and found that Transformers rarely generate expressions not present in the training data. Additional theoretical analysis reveals that this bias arises from the Transformer's inability to construct expressions compositionally while verifying their numerical validity. We finally examined if tailoring test-time strategies can lead to reduced memorization bias and better performance. We empirically demonstrate that providing additional information to the model at test time can significantly mitigate memorization bias. On the other hand, we also find that reducing memorization bias does not necessarily correlate with improved performance. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the limitations of NSR approaches and offer a foundation for designing more robust, generalizable symbolic regression methods. Code is available at https://github.com/Shun-0922/Mem-Bias-NSR .</p></details> |  |

Key components such as the human preference alignment and classifier-free guidance play a crucial role in ensuring generation quality. However, their independent application in current text-to-image models continues to face significant challenges in achieving strong text-image alignment, high generation quality, and consistency with human aesthetic standards. In this work, we for the first time, explore facilitating the collaboration of human performance alignment and test-time sampling to unlock the potential of text-to-image models. Consequently, we introduce CHATS (Combining Human-Aligned optimization and Test-time Sampling), a novel generative framework that separately models the preferred and dispreferred distributions and employs a proxy-prompt-based sampling strategy to utilize the useful information contained in both distributions. We observe that CHATS exhibits exceptional data efficiency, achieving strong performance with only a small, high-quality funetuning dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CHATS surpasses traditional preference alignment methods, setting new state-of-the-art across various standard benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025.

| **[Inference-time Alignment in Continuous Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20081v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning large language models with human feedback at inference time has received increasing attention due to its flexibility. Existing methods rely on generating multiple responses from the base policy for search using a reward model, which can be considered as searching in a discrete response space. However, these methods struggle to explore informative candidates when the base policy is weak or the candidate set is small, resulting in limited effectiveness. In this paper, to address this problem, we propose Simple Energy Adaptation ($\textbf{SEA}$), a simple yet effective algorithm for inference-time alignment. In contrast to expensive search over the discrete space, SEA directly adapts original responses from the base policy toward the optimal one via gradient-based sampling in continuous latent space. Specifically, SEA formulates inference as an iterative optimization procedure on an energy function over actions in the continuous space defined by the optimal policy, enabling simple and effective alignment. For instance, despite its simplicity, SEA outperforms the second-best baseline with a relative improvement of up to $ \textbf{77.51%}$ on AdvBench and $\textbf{16.36%}$ on MATH.

Direct time-of-flight (dToF) imaging offers high-precision, long-distance depth sensing, yet demands ultra-short pulse light sources and high-resolution time-to-digital converters. In contrast, indirect time-of-flight (iToF) imaging often suffers from phase wrapping and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as the sensing distance increases. In this paper, we introduce a novel ToF imaging paradigm, termed Burst-Encodable Time-of-Flight (BE-ToF), which facilitates high-fidelity, long-distance depth imaging. Specifically, the BE-ToF system emits light pulses in burst mode and estimates the phase delay of the reflected signal over the entire burst period, thereby effectively avoiding the phase wrapping inherent to conventional iToF systems. Moreover, to address the low SNR caused by light attenuation over increasing distances, we propose an end-to-end learnable framework that jointly optimizes the coding functions and the depth reconstruction network. A specialized double well function and first-order difference term are incorporated into the framework to ensure the hardware implementability of the coding functions. The proposed approach is rigorously validated through comprehensive simulations and real-world prototype experiments, demonstrating its effectiveness and practical applicability.</p></details> |  |

However, existing research has overlooked the efficiency of TTS from a latency-sensitive perspective. Through a latency-aware evaluation of representative TTS methods, we demonstrate that a compute-optimal TTS does not always result in the lowest latency in scenarios where latency is critical. To address this gap and achieve latency-optimal TTS, we propose two key approaches by optimizing the concurrency configurations: (1) branch-wise parallelism, which leverages multiple concurrent inference branches, and (2) sequence-wise parallelism, enabled by speculative decoding. By integrating these two approaches and allocating computational resources properly to each, our latency-optimal TTS enables a 32B model to reach 82.3% accuracy on MATH-500 within 1 minute and a smaller 3B model to achieve 72.4% within 10 seconds. Our work emphasizes the importance of latency-aware TTS and demonstrates its ability to deliver both speed and accuracy in latency-sensitive scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Existing distilled T2I models can generate high-fidelity images with fewer sampling steps, but often struggle with diversity and quality, especially in one-step models. From our analysis, we observe redundant computations in the UNet encoders. Our findings suggest that, for T2I diffusion models, decoders are more adept at capturing richer and more explicit semantic information, while encoders can be effectively shared across decoders from diverse time steps. Based on these observations, we introduce the first Time-independent Unified Encoder TiUE for the student model UNet architecture, which is a loop-free image generation approach for distilling T2I diffusion models. Using a one-pass scheme, TiUE shares encoder features across multiple decoder time steps, enabling parallel sampling and significantly reducing inference time complexity. In addition, we incorporate a KL divergence term to regularize noise prediction, which enhances the perceptual realism and diversity of the generated images. Experimental results demonstrate that TiUE outperforms state-of-the-art methods, including LCM, SD-Turbo, and SwiftBrushv2, producing more diverse and realistic results while maintaining the computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR2025, Code: https://github.com/sen-mao/Loopfree</p></details> |

We evaluate this approach using perplexity- and reward-based verifiers on two multilingual benchmarks: the Aya Evaluation Suite and m-ArenaHard. Our results show consistent quality improvements, with gains exceeding 35% in some cases. While perplexity-based scoring is effective for open-ended prompts, only reward-based verifiers improve performance on tasks requiring reasoning (e.g., math, code). Our results demonstrate the broader utility of repeated sampling for multilingual text generation and underscore the importance of selecting right verifiers for the task.</p></details> |  |

To make profits, prosumers equipped with photovoltaic (PV) panels and even the energy storage system (ESS) can actively participate in the real-time P2P energy market and trade energy. However, in real situations, system states such as energy demands and renewable energy power generation are highly uncertain, making it difficult for prosumers to make optimal real-time decisions. Moreover, severe problems with the physical network can arise from the real-time P2P energy trading, such as bus voltage violations and line overload. To handle these problems, this work first formulates the real-time P2P energy trading problem as a spatio-temporally constrained stochastic optimization problem by considering ESS and the spatial physical network constraints. To deal with the uncertainties online, a modified Lyapunov optimization method is innovatively proposed to approximately reformulate the stochastic optimization problem into an online one by relaxing the time-coupling constraints. Compared with the state-of-the-art online methods, the proposed one renders more flexibility and better performance for the real-time P2P energy market operation. Additionally, to protect the prosumers' privacy, an online distributed algorithm based on the consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is developed to solve the reformulated online problem by decoupling the spatial constraints. The theoretical near-optimal performance guarantee of the proposed online distributed algorithm is derived, and its performance can be further improved by minimizing the performance gap. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed online distributed algorithm can guarantee the fast, stable, and safe long-term operation of the real-time P2P energy market.</p></details> |  |

However, to the best of our knowledge, the problem is completely overlooked in dense prediction tasks such as Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (OVSS). In response, we propose a novel TTA method tailored to adapting VLMs for segmentation during test time. Unlike TTA methods for image classification, our Multi-Level and Multi-Prompt (MLMP) entropy minimization integrates features from intermediate vision-encoder layers and is performed with different text-prompt templates at both the global CLS token and local pixel-wise levels. Our approach could be used as plug-and-play for any segmentation network, does not require additional training data or labels, and remains effective even with a single test sample. Furthermore, we introduce a comprehensive OVSS TTA benchmark suite, which integrates a rigorous evaluation protocol, seven segmentation datasets, and 15 common corruptions, with a total of 82 distinct test scenarios, establishing a standardized and comprehensive testbed for future TTA research in open-vocabulary segmentation. Our experiments on this suite demonstrate that our segmentation-tailored method consistently delivers significant gains over direct adoption of TTA classification baselines.</p></details> |  |

In contrast to the state feedback, the optimality of the dynamic output feedback control for solving the LQR problem requires an implicit condition on the convergence of the state observer. Moreover, due to unknown system matrices and the existence of observer error, it is difficult to analyze the convergence and stability of most existing output feedback learning-based control methods. To tackle these issues, we propose a generalized dynamic output feedback learning control approach with guaranteed convergence, stability, and optimality performance for solving the LQR problem of unknown discrete-time linear systems. In particular, a dynamic output feedback controller is designed to be equivalent to a state feedback controller. This equivalence relationship is an inherent property without requiring convergence of the estimated state by the state observer, which plays a key role in establishing the off-policy learning control approaches. By value iteration and policy iteration schemes, the adaptive dynamic programming based learning control approaches are developed to estimate the optimal feedback control gain. In addition, a model-free stability criterion is provided by finding a nonsingular parameterization matrix, which contributes to establishing a switched iteration scheme. Furthermore, the convergence, stability, and optimality analyses of the proposed output feedback learning control approaches are given. Finally, the theoretical results are validated by two numerical examples.</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures |

Such management is enabled by RICs, which facilitate near-real-time and non-real-time network control through xApps and rApps. However, they face limitations, including latency overhead in data exchange between the RAN and RIC, restricting real-time monitoring, and the inability to access user plain data due to privacy and security constraints, hindering use cases like beamforming and spectrum classification. In this paper, we leverage the dApps concept to enable real-time RF spectrum classification with LibIQ, a novel library for RF signals that facilitates efficient spectrum monitoring and signal classification by providing functionalities to read I/Q samples as time-series, create datasets and visualize time-series data through plots and spectrograms. Thanks to LibIQ, I/Q samples can be efficiently processed to detect external RF signals, which are subsequently classified using a CNN inside the library. To achieve accurate spectrum analysis, we created an extensive dataset of time-series-based I/Q samples, representing distinct signal types captured using a custom dApp running on a 5G deployment over the Colosseum network emulator and an OTA testbed. We evaluate our model by deploying LibIQ in heterogeneous scenarios with varying center frequencies, time windows, and external RF signals. In real-time analysis, the model classifies the processed I/Q samples, achieving an average accuracy of approximately 97.8% in identifying signal types across all scenarios. We pledge to release both LibIQ and the dataset created as a publicly available framework upon acceptance.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Explainable Multi-modal Time Series Prediction with LLM-in-the-Loop](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01013v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series analysis provides essential insights for real-world system dynamics and informs downstream decision-making, yet most existing methods often overlook the rich contextual signals present in auxiliary modalities. To bridge this gap, we introduce TimeXL, a multi-modal prediction framework that integrates a prototype-based time series encoder with three collaborating Large Language Models (LLMs) to deliver more accurate predictions and interpretable explanations. First, a multi-modal prototype-based encoder processes both time series and textual inputs to generate preliminary forecasts alongside case-based rationales. These outputs then feed into a prediction LLM, which refines the forecasts by reasoning over the encoder's predictions and explanations. Next, a reflection LLM compares the predicted values against the ground truth, identifying textual inconsistencies or noise. Guided by this feedback, a refinement LLM iteratively enhances text quality and triggers encoder retraining. This closed-loop workflow -- prediction, critique (reflect), and refinement -- continuously boosts the framework's performance and interpretability. Empirical evaluations on four real-world datasets demonstrate that TimeXL achieves up to 8.9\% improvement in AUC and produces human-centric, multi-modal explanations, highlighting the power of LLM-driven reasoning for time series prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[TS-RAG: Retrieval-Augmented Generation based Time Series Foundation Models are Stronger Zero-Shot Forecaster](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07649v3)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) and Foundation Models (FMs) have recently become prevalent for time series forecasting tasks. While fine-tuning LLMs enables domain adaptation, they often struggle to generalize across diverse and unseen datasets. Moreover, existing Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) still face challenges in handling non-stationary dynamics and distribution shifts, largely due to the lack of effective mechanisms for adaptation. To this end, we present TS-RAG, a retrieval-augmented generation framework for time series forecasting that enhances the generalization and interpretability of TSFMs. Specifically, TS-RAG leverages pre-trained time series encoders to retrieve semantically relevant segments from a dedicated knowledge base, enriching the contextual representation of the input query. Furthermore, we propose an Adaptive Retrieval Mixer (ARM) module that dynamically fuses the retrieved patterns with the TSFM's internal representation, improving forecasting accuracy without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. Thorough empirical studies on seven public benchmark datasets demonstrate that TS-RAG achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot forecasting performance, outperforming the existing TSFMs by up to 6.84% across diverse domains while also providing desirable interpretability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bitcoin: A Non-Continuous Time System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11091v6)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a novel framework for understanding Bitcoin as a non-continuous time system shaped by the probabilistic block generation, the emergence of forks, and the non-linear confirmation of transactions. It introduces the concept of entropy collapse to describe how each block represents the irreversible resolution of uncertainty through Proof-of-Work computation, compressing a space of possible futures into a single validated past. In contrast to traditional time systems governed by synchronized clocks, Bitcoin constructs time internally through entropy dissipation and consensus-driven finality. This entropic structure reframes Bitcoin not merely as a ledger but as a decentralized clock that encodes a fundamentally asymmetric view of time in which the past is unique and irreversible while the future remains probabilistic until resolved.</p></details> |  |
| **[SoftCoT++: Test-Time Scaling with Soft Chain-of-Thought Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11484v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test-Time Scaling (TTS) refers to approaches that improve reasoning performance by allocating extra computation during inference, without altering the model's parameters. While existing TTS methods operate in a discrete token space by generating more intermediate steps, recent studies in Coconut and SoftCoT have demonstrated that thinking in the continuous latent space can further enhance the reasoning performance. Such latent thoughts encode informative thinking without the information loss associated with autoregressive token generation, sparking increased interest in continuous-space reasoning. Unlike discrete decoding, where repeated sampling enables exploring diverse reasoning paths, latent representations in continuous space are fixed for a given input, which limits diverse exploration, as all decoded paths originate from the same latent thought. To overcome this limitation, we introduce SoftCoT++ to extend SoftCoT to the Test-Time Scaling paradigm by enabling diverse exploration of thinking paths. Specifically, we perturb latent thoughts via multiple specialized initial tokens and apply contrastive learning to promote diversity among soft thought representations. Experiments across five reasoning benchmarks and two distinct LLM architectures demonstrate that SoftCoT++ significantly boosts SoftCoT and also outperforms SoftCoT with self-consistency scaling. Moreover, it shows strong compatibility with conventional scaling techniques such as self-consistency. Source code is available at https://github.com/xuyige/SoftCoT.</p></details> | 14 pages |
| **[When to Deceive: A Cross-Layer Stackelberg Game Framework for Strategic Timing of Cyber Deception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21244v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cyber deception is an emerging proactive defense strategy to counter increasingly sophisticated attacks such as Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) by misleading and distracting attackers from critical assets. However, since deception techniques incur costs and may lose effectiveness over time, defenders must strategically time and select them to adapt to the dynamic system and the attacker's responses. In this study, we propose a Stackelberg game-based framework to design strategic timing for cyber deception: the lower tactical layer (follower) captures the evolving attacker-defender dynamics under a given deception through a one-sided information Markov game, while the upper strategic layer (leader) employs a stopping-time decision process to optimize the timing and selection of deception techniques. We also introduce a computational algorithm that integrates dynamic programming and belief-state updates to account for the attacker's adaptive behavior and limited deception resources. Numerical experiments validate the framework, showing that strategically timed deceptions can enhance the defender's expected utility and reduce the risk of asset compromise compared to baseline strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[FRIREN: Beyond Trajectories -- A Spectral Lens on Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17370v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-term time-series forecasting (LTSF) models are often presented as general-purpose solutions that can be applied across domains, implicitly assuming that all data is pointwise predictable. Using chaotic systems such as Lorenz-63 as a case study, we argue that geometric structure - not pointwise prediction - is the right abstraction for a dynamic-agnostic foundational model. Minimizing the Wasserstein-2 distance (W2), which captures geometric changes, and providing a spectral view of dynamics are essential for long-horizon forecasting. Our model, FRIREN (Flow-inspired Representations via Interpretable Eigen-networks), implements an augmented normalizing-flow block that embeds data into a normally distributed latent representation. It then generates a W2-efficient optimal path that can be decomposed into rotation, scaling, inverse rotation, and translation. This architecture yields locally generated, geometry-preserving predictions that are independent of the underlying dynamics, and a global spectral representation that functions as a finite Koopman operator with a small modification. This enables practitioners to identify which modes grow, decay, or oscillate, both locally and system-wide. FRIREN achieves an MSE of 11.4, MAE of 1.6, and SWD of 0.96 on Lorenz-63 in a 336-in, 336-out, dt=0.01 setting, surpassing TimeMixer (MSE 27.3, MAE 2.8, SWD 2.1). The model maintains effective prediction for 274 out of 336 steps, approximately 2.5 Lyapunov times. On Rossler (96-in, 336-out), FRIREN achieves an MSE of 0.0349, MAE of 0.0953, and SWD of 0.0170, outperforming TimeMixer's MSE of 4.3988, MAE of 0.886, and SWD of 3.2065. FRIREN is also competitive on standard LTSF datasets such as ETT and Weather. By connecting modern generative flows with classical spectral analysis, FRIREN makes long-term forecasting both accurate and interpretable, setting a new benchmark for LTSF model design.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages, 4 figures.

Objectively comparing these measures on a large scale remains an open challenge. We propose the Synthetic Time series Evaluation Benchmark (STEB) -- the first benchmark framework that enables comprehensive and interpretable automated comparisons of synthetic time series evaluation measures. Using 10 diverse datasets, randomness injection, and 13 configurable data transformations, STEB computes indicators for measure reliability and score consistency. It tracks running time, test errors, and features sequential and parallel modes of operation. In our experiments, we determine a ranking of 41 measures from literature and confirm that the choice of upstream time series embedding heavily impacts the final score.</p></details> |  |

Test-time alignment techniques that do not modify the underlying models, such as prompting and guided decodings, offer a lightweight alternative. However, existing test-time alignment methods primarily improve short responses and fail to ensure coherence over extended contexts due to the myopic nature of token-level alignment. Moreover, these methods often incur a slowdown during inference. To address these challenges, we propose Plan2Align, a test-time alignment framework that formulates text generation as a predictive planning problem. Plan2Align adapts Model Predictive Control (MPC) to iteratively refine output by rolling out multiple complete responses and optimizing each segment. To more rigorously evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency, we focus on the more challenging task of long-text generation. Experiments on the long-form response subset of the HH-RLHF dataset and the WMT'24 Discourse-Level Literary Translation demonstrate that Plan2Align significantly enhances the performance of base LLMs. Compared to existing training-time and test-time alignment methods on LLaMA-3.1 8B, Plan2Align achieves comparable or superior results, while also delivering improved inference efficiency relative to prior test-time alignment approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

| **[One-Time Soft Alignment Enables Resilient Learning without Weight Transport](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20892v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Backpropagation is the cornerstone of deep learning, but its reliance on symmetric weight transport and global synchronization makes it computationally expensive and biologically implausible. Feedback alignment offers a promising alternative by approximating error gradients through fixed random feedback, thereby avoiding symmetric weight transport. However, this approach often struggles with poor learning performance and instability, especially in deep networks. Here, we show that a one-time soft alignment between forward and feedback weights at initialization enables deep networks to achieve performance comparable to backpropagation, without requiring weight transport during learning. This simple initialization condition guides stable error minimization in the loss landscape, improving network trainability. Spectral analyses further reveal that initial alignment promotes smoother gradient flow and convergence to flatter minima, resulting in better generalization and robustness. Notably, we also find that allowing moderate deviations from exact weight symmetry can improve adversarial robustness compared to standard backpropagation. These findings demonstrate that a simple initialization strategy can enable effective learning in deep networks in a biologically plausible and resource-efficient manner.</p></details> | 28 pages |
| **[Effective Fixed-Time Control for Constrained Nonlinear System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20870v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we tackle the state transformation problem in non-strict full state-constrained systems by introducing an adaptive fixed-time control method, utilizing a one-to-one asymmetric nonlinear mapping auxiliary system. Additionally, we develop a class of multi-threshold event-triggered control strategies that facilitate autonomous controller updates, substantially reducing communication resource consumption. Notably, the self-triggered strategy distinguishes itself from other strategies by obviating the need for continuous real-time monitoring of the controller's state variables. By accurately forecasting the subsequent activation instance, this strategy significantly optimizes the efficiency of the control system. Moreover, our theoretical analysis demonstrates that the semi-global practical fixed-time stability (SPFTS) criterion guarantees both tracking accuracy and closed-loop stability under state constraints, with convergence time independent of initial conditions. Finally, simulation results reveal that the proposed method significantly decreases the frequency of control command updates while maintaining tracking accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mixture of Low Rank Adaptation with Partial Parameter Sharing for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17872v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-task forecasting has become the standard approach for time-series forecasting (TSF). However, we show that it suffers from an Expressiveness Bottleneck, where predictions at different time steps share the same representation, leading to unavoidable errors even with optimal representations. To address this issue, we propose a two-stage framework: first, pre-train a foundation model for one-step-ahead prediction; then, adapt it using step-specific LoRA modules.This design enables the foundation model to handle any number of forecast steps while avoiding the expressiveness bottleneck. We further introduce the Mixture-of-LoRA (MoLA) model, which employs adaptively weighted LoRA experts to achieve partial parameter sharing across steps. This approach enhances both efficiency and forecasting performance by exploiting interdependencies between forecast steps. Experiments show that MoLA significantly improves model expressiveness and outperforms state-of-the-art time-series forecasting methods.

Traditional models typically process all variables or time points uniformly, which limits their ability to capture complex variable relationships and obtain non-trivial time representations. To address this issue, we propose TimePro, an innovative Mamba-based model that constructs variate- and time-aware hyper-states. Unlike conventional approaches that merely transfer plain states across variable or time dimensions, TimePro preserves the fine-grained temporal features of each variate token and adaptively selects the focused time points to tune the plain state. The reconstructed hyper-state can perceive both variable relationships and salient temporal information, which helps the model make accurate forecasting. In experiments, TimePro performs competitively on eight real-world long-term forecasting benchmarks with satisfactory linear complexity.

Current mainstream approaches focus on learning normality, on the assumption that all or most of the samples in the training set are normal. However, anomalies in the training set (i.e., anomaly contamination) can be misleading. Recent studies employ data augmentation to generate pseudo-anomalies and learn the boundary separating the training samples from the augmented samples. Although this approach mitigates anomaly contamination if augmented samples mimic unseen real anomalies, it suffers from several limitations. (1) Covering a wide range of time series anomalies is challenging. (2) It disregards augmented samples that resemble normal samples (i.e., false anomalies). (3) It places too much trust in the labels of training and augmented samples. In response, we propose RedLamp, which employs diverse data augmentations to generate multiclass pseudo-anomalies and learns the multiclass boundary. Such multiclass pseudo-anomalies cover a wide variety of time series anomalies. We conduct multiclass classification using soft labels, which prevents the model from being overconfident and ensures its robustness against contaminated/false anomalies. The learned latent space is inherently explainable as it is trained to separate pseudo-anomalies into multiclasses. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of RedLamp in anomaly detection and its robustness against anomaly contamination.</p></details> | Accepted by KDD 2025 |

Such signals are completely unintelligible since the fundamental structures of phonemes and syllables are destroyed. However, they still retain tonal patterns that enable perceptual speaker identification despite losing linguistic content. In this paper, we propose leveraging speaker representations learned from time reversed speech as an augmentation strategy to enhance speaker representation. Notably, speaker and language disentanglement in voice conversion (VC) is essential to accurately preserve a speaker's unique vocal traits while minimizing interference from linguistic content. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated in the context of state-of-the-art diffusion-based VC models. Experimental results indicate that the proposed approach significantly improves speaker similarity-related scores while maintaining high speech quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in INTERSPEECH 2025</p></details> |

To address these challenges and enhance predictive accuracy, this study introduces a hybrid forecasting framework that integrates the Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Inference System (IT2FIS) with the GARCH model. Leveraging the interval-based uncertainty representation of IT2FIS and the volatility-capturing capability of GARCH, the proposed model effectively mitigates the adverse impact of heteroskedasticity on prediction reliability. Specifically, the GARCH component estimates conditional variance, which is subsequently incorporated into the Gaussian membership functions of IT2FIS. This integration transforms IT2FIS into an adaptive variable-parameter system, dynamically aligning with the time-varying volatility of the target series. Through systematic parameter optimization, the framework not only captures intricate volatility patterns but also accounts for heteroskedasticity and epistemic uncertainties during modeling, thereby improving both prediction precision and model robustness. Experimental validation employs diverse datasets, including air quality concentration, urban traffic flow, and energy consumption. Comparative analyses are conducted against models: the GARCH-Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (GARCH-TSK) model, fixed-variance time series models, the GARCH-Gated Recurrent Unit (GARCH-GRU), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The results indicate that the proposed model achieves superior predictive performance across the majority of test scenarios in error metrics. These findings underscore the effectiveness of hybrid approaches in forecasting uncertainty for GARCH-type time series, highlighting their practical utility in real-world time series forecasting applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>40 pa...</summary><p>40 pages, 13 figures, references added</p></details> |

Despite their architectural innovations, most state-of-the-art models report only marginal improvements -- typically just a few thousandths in standard error metrics. These models often incorporate complex data embedding layers to transform raw inputs into higher-dimensional representations to enhance accuracy. But are data embedding techniques actually effective in time series forecasting? Through extensive ablation studies across fifteen state-of-the-art models and four benchmark datasets, we find that removing data embedding layers from many state-of-the-art models does not degrade forecasting performance. In many cases, it improves both accuracy and computational efficiency. The gains from removing embedding layers often exceed the performance differences typically reported between competing models.

The method takes multi-dimensional performance metric sequences as input. We use a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to model the evolution of system states over time. An attention mechanism is then applied to enhance key temporal segments, improving the model's ability to identify potential faults. On this basis, a feedforward neural network is designed to perform the final classification, enabling early warning of system failures. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, comparative experiments and ablation analyses were conducted using data from a large-scale real-world cloud system. The experimental results show that the model outperforms various mainstream time-series models in terms of Accuracy, F1-Score, and AUC. This demonstrates strong prediction capability and stability. Furthermore, the loss function curve confirms the convergence and reliability of the training process. It indicates that the proposed method effectively learns system behavior patterns and achieves efficient fault detection.</p></details> |  |

Previous approaches mainly focused on sample selection strategies, while overlooking the fundamental problem on underlying optimization. Initially, we critically analyze the widely-adopted entropy minimization framework in WTTA and uncover its significant limitations in noisy optimization dynamics that substantially hinder adaptation efficiency. Through our analysis, we identify region confidence as a superior alternative to traditional entropy, however, its direct optimization remains computationally prohibitive for real-time applications. In this paper, we introduce a novel region-integrated method ReCAP that bypasses the lengthy process. Specifically, we propose a probabilistic region modeling scheme that flexibly captures semantic changes in embedding space. Subsequently, we develop a finite-to-infinite asymptotic approximation that transforms the intractable region confidence into a tractable and upper-bounded proxy. These innovations significantly unlock the overlooked potential dynamics in local region in a concise solution.

| **[Generating Hypotheses of Dynamic Causal Graphs in Neuroscience: Leveraging Generative Factor Models of Observed Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20697v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The field of hypothesis generation promises to reduce costs in neuroscience by narrowing the range of interventional studies needed to study various phenomena. Existing machine learning methods can generate scientific hypotheses from complex datasets, but many approaches assume causal relationships are static over time, limiting their applicability to systems with dynamic, state-dependent behavior, such as the brain. While some techniques attempt dynamic causal discovery through factor models, they often restrict relationships to linear patterns or impose other simplifying assumptions. We propose a novel method that models dynamic graphs as a conditionally weighted superposition of static graphs, where each static graph can capture nonlinear relationships. This approach enables the detection of complex, time-varying interactions between variables beyond linear limitations. Our method improves f1-scores of predicted dynamic causal patterns by roughly 22-28% on average over baselines in some of our experiments, with some improvements reaching well over 60%. A case study on real brain data demonstrates our method's ability to uncover relationships linked to specific behavioral states, offering valuable insights into neural dynamics.</p></details> |  |
| **[BLAST: Balanced Sampling Time Series Corpus for Universal Forecasting Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17871v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advent of universal time series forecasting models has revolutionized zero-shot forecasting across diverse domains, yet the critical role of data diversity in training these models remains underexplored. Existing large-scale time series datasets often suffer from inherent biases and imbalanced distributions, leading to suboptimal model performance and generalization. To address this gap, we introduce BLAST, a novel pre-training corpus designed to enhance data diversity through a balanced sampling strategy. First, BLAST incorporates 321 billion observations from publicly available datasets and employs a comprehensive suite of statistical metrics to characterize time series patterns. Then, to facilitate pattern-oriented sampling, the data is implicitly clustered using grid-based partitioning. Furthermore, by integrating grid sampling and grid mixup techniques, BLAST ensures a balanced and representative coverage of diverse patterns. Experimental results demonstrate that models pre-trained on BLAST achieve state-of-the-art performance with a fraction of the computational resources and training tokens required by existing methods.

| **[Enhancing Time Series Forecasting via a Parallel Hybridization of ARIMA and Polynomial Classifiers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06874v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting has attracted significant attention, leading to the de-velopment of a wide range of approaches, from traditional statistical meth-ods to advanced deep learning models. Among them, the Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model remains a widely adopted linear technique due to its effectiveness in modeling temporal dependencies in economic, industrial, and social data. On the other hand, polynomial classifi-ers offer a robust framework for capturing non-linear relationships and have demonstrated competitive performance in domains such as stock price pre-diction. In this study, we propose a hybrid forecasting approach that inte-grates the ARIMA model with a polynomial classifier to leverage the com-plementary strengths of both models. The hybrid method is evaluated on multiple real-world time series datasets spanning diverse domains. Perfor-mance is assessed based on forecasting accuracy and computational effi-ciency. Experimental results reveal that the proposed hybrid model consist-ently outperforms the individual models in terms of prediction accuracy, al-beit with a modest increase in execution time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Test-Time Learning for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20633v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable emergent capabilities through extensive pre-training, they still face critical limitations in generalizing to specialized domains and handling diverse linguistic variations, known as distribution shifts. In this paper, we propose a Test-Time Learning (TTL) paradigm for LLMs, namely TLM, which dynamically adapts LLMs to target domains using only unlabeled test data during testing. Specifically, we first provide empirical evidence and theoretical insights to reveal that more accurate predictions from LLMs can be achieved by minimizing the input perplexity of the unlabeled test data. Based on this insight, we formulate the Test-Time Learning process of LLMs as input perplexity minimization, enabling self-supervised enhancement of LLM performance. Furthermore, we observe that high-perplexity samples tend to be more informative for model optimization. Accordingly, we introduce a Sample Efficient Learning Strategy that actively selects and emphasizes these high-perplexity samples for test-time updates. Lastly, to mitigate catastrophic forgetting and ensure adaptation stability, we adopt Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) instead of full-parameter optimization, which allows lightweight model updates while preserving more original knowledge from the model. We introduce the AdaptEval benchmark for TTL and demonstrate through experiments that TLM improves performance by at least 20% compared to original LLMs on domain knowledge adaptation.</p></details> | Accepted by ICML2025 |

This study evaluated the efficacy of a mobile health (mHealth) intervention, Mental Health Evaluation and Lookout Program (mHELP), which integrates a smartwatch sensor and machine learning (ML) algorithms for real-time stress detection and self-management. In a 12-week randomized controlled trial (n = 117), participants were assigned to a treatment group using mHELP's full suite of interventions or a control group using the app solely for real-time stress logging and weekly psychological assessments. The primary outcome, "Moments of Stress" (MS), was assessed via physiological and self-reported indicators and analyzed using Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM) approaches. Similarly, secondary outcomes of psychological assessments, including the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) for anxiety, the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8) for depression, and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), were also analyzed via GLMM. The finding of the objective measure, MS, indicates a substantial decrease in MS among the treatment group compared to the control group, while no notable between-group differences were observed in subjective scores of anxiety (GAD-7), depression (PHQ-8), or stress (PSS). However, the treatment group exhibited a clinically meaningful decline in GAD-7 and PSS scores. These findings underscore the potential of wearable-enabled mHealth tools to reduce acute stress in college populations and highlight the need for extended interventions and tailored features to address chronic symptoms like depression.</p></details> | 30 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Comparisons between a Large Language Model-based Real-Time Compound Diagnostic Medical AI Interface and Physicians for Common Internal Medicine Cases using Simulated Patients](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20609v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Objective To develop an LLM based realtime compound diagnostic medical AI interface and performed a clinical trial comparing this interface and physicians for common internal medicine cases based on the United States Medical License Exam (USMLE) Step 2 Clinical Skill (CS) style exams. Methods A nonrandomized clinical trial was conducted on August 20, 2024. We recruited one general physician, two internal medicine residents (2nd and 3rd year), and five simulated patients. The clinical vignettes were adapted from the USMLE Step 2 CS style exams. We developed 10 representative internal medicine cases based on actual patients and included information available on initial diagnostic evaluation. Primary outcome was the accuracy of the first differential diagnosis. Repeatability was evaluated based on the proportion of agreement. Results The accuracy of the physicians' first differential diagnosis ranged from 50% to 70%, whereas the realtime compound diagnostic medical AI interface achieved an accuracy of 80%. The proportion of agreement for the first differential diagnosis was 0.7. The accuracy of the first and second differential diagnoses ranged from 70% to 90% for physicians, whereas the AI interface achieved an accuracy rate of 100%. The average time for the AI interface (557 sec) was 44.6% shorter than that of the physicians (1006 sec). The AI interface ($0.08) also reduced costs by 98.1% compared to the physicians' average ($4.2). Patient satisfaction scores ranged from 4.2 to 4.3 for care by physicians and were 3.9 for the AI interface Conclusion An LLM based realtime compound diagnostic medical AI interface demonstrated diagnostic accuracy and patient satisfaction comparable to those of a physician, while requiring less time and lower costs. These findings suggest that AI interfaces may have the potential to assist primary care consultations for common internal medicine cases.</p></details> |  |

Classical time series classification and deep learning techniques have demonstrated limited efficacy in monitoring PD symptoms using wearable accelerometer data due to complex PD movement patterns and the small size of available datasets. We investigate InceptionTime and RandOm Convolutional KErnel Transform (ROCKET) as they are promising for PD symptom monitoring. InceptionTime's high learning capacity is well-suited to modeling complex movement patterns, while ROCKET is suited to small datasets. With random search methodology, we identify the highest-scoring InceptionTime architecture and compare its performance to ROCKET with a ridge classifier and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) on wrist motion data from PD patients. Our findings indicate that all approaches can learn to estimate tremor severity and bradykinesia presence with moderate performance but encounter challenges in detecting dyskinesia. Among the presented approaches, ROCKET demonstrates higher scores in identifying dyskinesia, whereas InceptionTime exhibits slightly better performance in tremor and bradykinesia estimation. Notably, both methods outperform the multi-layer perceptron. In conclusion, InceptionTime can classify complex wrist motion time series and holds potential for continuous symptom monitoring in PD with further development.</p></details> | <details><summary>The s...</summary><p>The source code is available under https://github.com/cedricdonie/tsc-for-wrist-motion-pd-detection</p></details> |

Building upon this, a promising direction is to further scale test-time compute to unlock even greater reasoning capabilities. However, as we push these scaling boundaries, systematically understanding the practical limits and achieving optimal resource allocation becomes a critical challenge. In this paper, we investigate the scaling Pareto of test-time scaling and introduce the Test-Time Scaling Performance Model (TTSPM). We theoretically analyze two fundamental paradigms for such extended scaling, parallel scaling and sequential scaling, from a probabilistic modeling perspective. Our primary contribution is the derivation of the saturation point on the scaling budget for both strategies, identifying thresholds beyond which additional computation yields diminishing returns. Remarkably, despite their distinct mechanisms, both paradigms converge to a unified mathematical structure in their upper bounds. We empirically validate our theoretical findings on challenging reasoning benchmarks, including AIME, MATH-500, and GPQA, demonstrating the practical utility of these bounds for test-time resource allocation. We hope that this work provides insights into the cost-benefit trade-offs of test-time scaling, guiding the development of more resource-efficient inference strategies for large reasoning models.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[Polynomial-Time Algorithms for Black-Box Distributive Expanded Groups](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20497v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Let $\Omega$ be a finite set of finitary operation symbols. An $\Omega$-expanded group is a group (written additively and called the additive group of the $\Omega$-expanded group) with an $\Omega$-algebra structure. We use the black-box model of computation in $\Omega$-expanded groups. In this model, elements of a finite $\Omega$-expanded group $H$ are represented (not necessarily uniquely) by bit strings of the same length, say, $n$. Given representations of elements of $H$, equality testing and the fundamental operations of $H$ are performed by an oracle. Assume that $H$ is distributive, i.e., all its fundamental operations associated with nonnullary operation symbols in $\Omega$ are distributive over addition. Suppose $s=(s_1,\dots,s_m)$ is a generating system of $H$. In this paper, we present probabilistic polynomial-time black-box $\Omega$-expanded group algorithms for the following problems: (i) given $(1^n,s)$, construct a generating system of the additive group of $H$, (ii) given $(1^n,s,(t_1,\dots,t_k))$ with $t_1,\dots,t_k\in H$, find a generating system of the additive group of the ideal in $H$ generated by $\{t_1,\dots,t_k\}$, and (iii) given $(1^n,s)$, decide whether $H\in\mathfrak V$, where $\mathfrak V$ is an arbitrary finitely based variety of distributive $\Omega$-expanded groups with nilpotent additive groups. The error probability of these algorithms is exponentially small in $n$. In particular, this can be applied to groups, rings, $R$-modules, and $R$-algebras, where $R$ is a fixed finitely generated commutative associative ring with $1$. Rings and $R$-algebras may be here with or without $1$, where $1$ is considered as a nullary fundamental operation.</p></details> | 13 pages |

To address these challenges, we propose a novel algorithm that integrates Active Learning (AL) with Deep Gaussian Processes (DGPs) for robust MCP detection. Our method leverages spectral analysis to identify potential changes and employs AL to strategically select new sampling points for improved efficiency. By incorporating the modeling flexibility of DGPs with the change-identification capabilities of spectral methods, our approach adapts to diverse spectral change behaviors and effectively localizes multiple change points. Experiments on both simulated and real-world data demonstrate that our method outperforms existing techniques in terms of detection accuracy and sampling efficiency for non-stationary time series.</p></details> |  |

Despite recent advances in generative modeling, a comprehensive understanding of how state-of-the-art generative models perform under limited supervision remains lacking. In this work, we conduct the first large-scale study evaluating leading generative models in data-scarce settings, revealing a substantial performance gap between full-data and data-scarce regimes. To close this gap, we propose a unified diffusion-based generative framework that can synthesize high-fidelity time series across diverse domains using just a few examples. Our model is pre-trained on a large, heterogeneous collection of time series datasets, enabling it to learn generalizable temporal representations. It further incorporates architectural innovations such as dynamic convolutional layers for flexible channel adaptation and dataset token conditioning for domain-aware generation. Without requiring abundant supervision, our unified model achieves state-of-the-art performance in few-shot settings-outperforming domain-specific baselines across a wide range of subset sizes. Remarkably, it also surpasses all baselines even when tested on full datasets benchmarks, highlighting the strength of pre-training and cross-domain generalization. We hope this work encourages the community to revisit few-shot generative modeling as a key problem in time series research and pursue unified solutions that scale efficiently across domains.

It is based on a variational quantum circuit that can be interpreted as a discretization of the annealing process that quantum annealers follow to find a minimum energy state of a given Hamiltonian. This ensures that QAOA must find an optimal solution for any given optimization problem when the number of layers, $p$, used in the variational quantum circuit tends to infinity. In practice, the number of layers is usually bounded by a small number. This is a must in current quantum computers of the NISQ era, due to the depth limit of the circuits they can run to avoid problems with decoherence and noise. In this paper, we show mathematical evidence that QAOA requires exponential time to solve linear functions when the number of layers is less than the number of different coefficients of the linear function $n$. We conjecture that QAOA needs exponential time to find the global optimum of linear functions for any constant value of $p$, and that the runtime is linear only if $p \geq n$. We conclude that we need new quantum algorithms to reach quantum supremacy in quantum optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This preprint has been accepted in the Quantum Optimization Workshop at the Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference (GECCO 2025).

In contrast, current Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to effectively plan and act in dynamic, multi-room 3D environments. We posit that part of this limitation is due to the lack of proper 3D spatial-temporal memory modeling in LLMs. To address this, we first introduce 3DMem-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark comprising over 26,000 trajectories and 2,892 embodied tasks, question-answering and captioning, designed to evaluate an agent's ability to reason over long-term memory in 3D environments. Second, we propose 3DLLM-Mem, a novel dynamic memory management and fusion model for embodied spatial-temporal reasoning and actions in LLMs. Our model uses working memory tokens, which represents current observations, as queries to selectively attend to and fuse the most useful spatial and temporal features from episodic memory, which stores past observations and interactions. Our approach allows the agent to focus on task-relevant information while maintaining memory efficiency in complex, long-horizon environments. Experimental results demonstrate that 3DLLM-Mem achieves state-of-the-art performance across various tasks, outperforming the strongest baselines by 16.5% in success rate on 3DMem-Bench's most challenging in-the-wild embodied tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>demos...</summary><p>demos at: https://3dllm-mem.github.io</p></details> |

Prior work adapted basic proportional representation concepts -- justified representation (JR), proportional JR (PJR), and extended JR (EJR) -- from the multiwinner setting to the temporal setting. Our work introduces and examines ways of going beyond EJR. Specifically, we consider stronger variants of JR, PJR, and EJR, and introduce temporal adaptations of more demanding multiwinner axioms, such as EJR+, full JR (FJR), full proportional JR (FPJR), and the Core. For each of these concepts, we investigate its existence and study its relationship to existing notions, thereby establishing a rich hierarchy of proportionality concepts. Notably, we show that two of our proposed axioms -- EJR+ and FJR -- strengthen EJR while remaining satisfiable in every temporal election.</p></details> |  |

However, existing 3DGS-based methods for dynamic reconstruction often suffer from \textit{spatio-temporal incoherence} during initialization, where canonical Gaussians are constructed by aggregating observations from multiple frames without temporal distinction. This results in spatio-temporally entangled representations, making it difficult to model dynamic motion accurately. To overcome this limitation, we propose \textbf{STDR} (Spatio-Temporal Decoupling for Real-time rendering), a plug-and-play module that learns spatio-temporal probability distributions for each Gaussian. STDR introduces a spatio-temporal mask, a separated deformation field, and a consistency regularization to jointly disentangle spatial and temporal patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that incorporating our module into existing 3DGS-based dynamic scene reconstruction frameworks leads to notable improvements in both reconstruction quality and spatio-temporal consistency across synthetic and real-world benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we adapt and specialise the robust and conjugate GP (RCGP) framework of Altamirano et al. (2024) to the spatio-temporal setting. In doing so, we obtain an outlier-robust spatio-temporal GP with a computational cost comparable to classical spatio-temporal GPs. We also overcome the three main drawbacks of RCGPs: their unreliable performance when the prior mean is chosen poorly, their lack of reliable uncertainty quantification, and the need to carefully select a hyperparameter by hand. We study our method extensively in finance and weather forecasting applications, demonstrating that it provides a reliable approach to spatio-temporal modelling in the presence of outliers.</p></details> |  |
| **[EventFlow: Forecasting Temporal Point Processes with Flow Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07430v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continuous-time event sequences, in which events occur at irregular intervals, are ubiquitous across a wide range of industrial and scientific domains. The contemporary modeling paradigm is to treat such data as realizations of a temporal point process, and in machine learning it is common to model temporal point processes in an autoregressive fashion using a neural network. While autoregressive models are successful in predicting the time of a single subsequent event, their performance can degrade when forecasting longer horizons due to cascading errors and myopic predictions. We propose EventFlow, a non-autoregressive generative model for temporal point processes. The model builds on the flow matching framework in order to directly learn joint distributions over event times, side-stepping the autoregressive process. EventFlow is simple to implement and achieves a 20%-53% lower error than the nearest baseline on standard TPP benchmarks while simultaneously using fewer model calls at sampling time.</p></details> |  |

Recently, advancements in monitoring technology have facilitated the effective recording of nuclear radiation levels and related factors, such as weather conditions. The abundance of monitoring data enables the development of accurate and reliable nuclear radiation forecasting models, which play a crucial role in informing decision-making for individuals and governments. However, this task is challenging due to the imbalanced distribution of monitoring stations over a wide spatial range and the non-stationary radiation variation patterns. In this study, we introduce NRFormer, a novel framework tailored for the nationwide prediction of nuclear radiation variations. By integrating a non-stationary temporal attention module, an imbalance-aware spatial attention module, and a radiation propagation prompting module, NRFormer collectively captures complex spatio-temporal dynamics of nuclear radiation.

| **[AgriFM: A Multi-source Temporal Remote Sensing Foundation Model for Crop Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21357v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate crop mapping fundamentally relies on modeling multi-scale spatiotemporal patterns, where spatial scales range from individual field textures to landscape-level context, and temporal scales capture both short-term phenological transitions and full growing-season dynamics. Transformer-based remote sensing foundation models (RSFMs) offer promising potential for crop mapping due to their innate ability for unified spatiotemporal processing. However, current RSFMs remain suboptimal for crop mapping: they either employ fixed spatiotemporal windows that ignore the multi-scale nature of crop systems or completely disregard temporal information by focusing solely on spatial patterns. To bridge these gaps, we present AgriFM, a multi-source remote sensing foundation model specifically designed for agricultural crop mapping. Our approach begins by establishing the necessity of simultaneous hierarchical spatiotemporal feature extraction, leading to the development of a modified Video Swin Transformer architecture where temporal down-sampling is synchronized with spatial scaling operations. This modified backbone enables efficient unified processing of long time-series satellite inputs. AgriFM leverages temporally rich data streams from three satellite sources including MODIS, Landsat-8/9 and Sentinel-2, and is pre-trained on a global representative dataset comprising over 25 million image samples supervised by land cover products. The resulting framework incorporates a versatile decoder architecture that dynamically fuses these learned spatiotemporal representations, supporting diverse downstream tasks. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate AgriFM's superior performance over conventional deep learning approaches and state-of-the-art general-purpose RSFMs across all downstream tasks. Codes will be available at https://github.com/flyakon/AgriFM.</p></details> |  |

Recent advancements in Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have shown immense promise in efficiently processing these signals. However, progress in this field has been impeded by the lack of effective and standardized benchmarks, which complicates the consistent measurement of technological advancements and limits the practical applicability of SNNs. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Neuromorphic Sequential Arena (NSA), a comprehensive benchmark that offers an effective, versatile, and application-oriented evaluation framework for neuromorphic temporal processing. The NSA includes seven real-world temporal processing tasks from a diverse range of application scenarios, each capturing rich temporal dynamics across multiple timescales. Utilizing NSA, we conduct extensive comparisons of recently introduced spiking neuron models and neural architectures, presenting comprehensive baselines in terms of task performance, training speed, memory usage, and energy efficiency. Our findings emphasize an urgent need for efficient SNN designs that can consistently deliver high performance across tasks with varying temporal complexities while maintaining low computational costs. NSA enables systematic tracking of advancements in neuromorphic algorithm research and paves the way for developing effective and efficient neuromorphic temporal processing systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 34th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Online distributed optimization for spatio-temporally constrained real-time peer-to-peer energy trading](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21884v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of distributed renewable energy triggers the peer-to-peer (P2P) energy market formations. To make profits, prosumers equipped with photovoltaic (PV) panels and even the energy storage system (ESS) can actively participate in the real-time P2P energy market and trade energy. However, in real situations, system states such as energy demands and renewable energy power generation are highly uncertain, making it difficult for prosumers to make optimal real-time decisions. Moreover, severe problems with the physical network can arise from the real-time P2P energy trading, such as bus voltage violations and line overload. To handle these problems, this work first formulates the real-time P2P energy trading problem as a spatio-temporally constrained stochastic optimization problem by considering ESS and the spatial physical network constraints. To deal with the uncertainties online, a modified Lyapunov optimization method is innovatively proposed to approximately reformulate the stochastic optimization problem into an online one by relaxing the time-coupling constraints. Compared with the state-of-the-art online methods, the proposed one renders more flexibility and better performance for the real-time P2P energy market operation. Additionally, to protect the prosumers' privacy, an online distributed algorithm based on the consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is developed to solve the reformulated online problem by decoupling the spatial constraints. The theoretical near-optimal performance guarantee of the proposed online distributed algorithm is derived, and its performance can be further improved by minimizing the performance gap. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed online distributed algorithm can guarantee the fast, stable, and safe long-term operation of the real-time P2P energy market.</p></details> |  |

We make three significant contributions that improve the current state-of-the-art results: (i) we derive sharper high probability convergence guarantee that depend explicitly on the asymptotic variance and hold under weaker conditions than those normally assumed; (ii) we establish refined high-dimensional Berry-Esseen bounds over the class of convex sets, achieving faster rates than those previously established in the literature, and (iii) we propose and analyze a novel, computationally efficient online plug-in estimator of the asymptotic covariance matrix.These results enable the construction of confidence regions and simultaneous confidence intervals for the linear parameters of the value function approximation, with guaranteed finite-sample coverage.

| **[Spectral clustering for dependent community Hawkes process models of temporal networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21845v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal networks observed continuously over time through timestamped relational events data are commonly encountered in application settings including online social media communications, financial transactions, and international relations. Temporal networks often exhibit community structure and strong dependence patterns among node pairs. This dependence can be modeled through mutual excitations, where an interaction event from a sender to a receiver node increases the possibility of future events among other node pairs. We provide statistical results for a class of models that we call dependent community Hawkes (DCH) models, which combine the stochastic block model with mutually exciting Hawkes processes for modeling both community structure and dependence among node pairs, respectively. We derive a non-asymptotic upper bound on the misclustering error of spectral clustering on the event count matrix as a function of the number of nodes and communities, time duration, and the amount of dependence in the model. Our result leverages recent results on bounding an appropriate distance between a multivariate Hawkes process count vector and a Gaussian vector, along with results from random matrix theory. We also propose a DCH model that incorporates only self and reciprocal excitation along with highly scalable parameter estimation using a Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimator that we demonstrate to be consistent for growing network size and time duration.</p></details> |  |

However, their iterative denoising process results in significant computational overhead during inference, limiting their practical deployment in resource-constrained environments. Existing acceleration methods often adopt uniform strategies that fail to capture the temporal variations during diffusion generation, while the commonly adopted sequential pruning-then-fine-tuning strategy suffers from sub-optimality due to the misalignment between pruning decisions made on pretrained weights and the model's final parameters. To address these limitations, we introduce ALTER: All-in-One Layer Pruning and Temporal Expert Routing, a unified framework that transforms diffusion models into a mixture of efficient temporal experts. ALTER achieves a single-stage optimization that unifies layer pruning, expert routing, and model fine-tuning by employing a trainable hypernetwork, which dynamically generates layer pruning decisions and manages timestep routing to specialized, pruned expert sub-networks throughout the ongoing fine-tuning of the UNet. This unified co-optimization strategy enables significant efficiency gains while preserving high generative quality. Specifically, ALTER achieves same-level visual fidelity to the original 50-step Stable Diffusion v2.1 model while utilizing only 25.9% of its total MACs with just 20 inference steps and delivering a 3.64x speedup through 35% sparsity.</p></details> |  |
| **[STA-Risk: A Deep Dive of Spatio-Temporal Asymmetries for Breast Cancer Risk Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21699v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting the risk of developing breast cancer is an important clinical tool to guide early intervention and tailoring personalized screening strategies. Early risk models have limited performance and recently machine learning-based analysis of mammogram images showed encouraging risk prediction effects. These models however are limited to the use of a single exam or tend to overlook nuanced breast tissue evolvement in spatial and temporal details of longitudinal imaging exams that are indicative of breast cancer risk. In this paper, we propose STA-Risk (Spatial and Temporal Asymmetry-based Risk Prediction), a novel Transformer-based model that captures fine-grained mammographic imaging evolution simultaneously from bilateral and longitudinal asymmetries for breast cancer risk prediction. STA-Risk is innovative by the side encoding and temporal encoding to learn spatial-temporal asymmetries, regulated by a customized asymmetry loss. We performed extensive experiments with two independent mammogram datasets and achieved superior performance than four representative SOTA models for 1- to 5-year future risk prediction. Source codes will be released upon publishing of the paper.</p></details> |  |

Spatio-temporal deep learning models, while scalable, typically assume a simplistic independent covariance matrix for the response, failing to capture the underlying correlation structure. However, spatio-temporal GPs suffer from issues of scalability and various forms of approximation bias resulting from restrictive assumptions of the covariance kernel function. We propose STACI, a novel framework consisting of a variational Bayesian neural network approximation of non-stationary spatio-temporal GP along with a novel spatio-temporal conformal inference algorithm. STACI is highly scalable, taking advantage of GPU training capabilities for neural network models, and provides statistically valid prediction intervals for uncertainty quantification. STACI outperforms competing GPs and deep methods in accurately approximating spatio-temporal processes and we show it easily scales to datasets with millions of observations.</p></details> |  |
| **[STRAP: Spatio-Temporal Pattern Retrieval for Out-of-Distribution Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19547v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for modeling dynamic graph-structured data across diverse domains. However, they often fail to generalize in Spatio-Temporal Out-of-Distribution (STOOD) scenarios, where both temporal dynamics and spatial structures evolve beyond the training distribution. To address this problem, we propose an innovative Spatio-Temporal Retrieval-Augmented Pattern Learning framework,STRAP, which enhances model generalization by integrating retrieval-augmented learning into the STGNN continue learning pipeline. The core of STRAP is a compact and expressive pattern library that stores representative spatio-temporal patterns enriched with historical, structural, and semantic information, which is obtained and optimized during the training phase. During inference, STRAP retrieves relevant patterns from this library based on similarity to the current input and injects them into the model via a plug-and-play prompting mechanism. This not only strengthens spatio-temporal representations but also mitigates catastrophic forgetting. Moreover, STRAP introduces a knowledge-balancing objective to harmonize new information with retrieved knowledge. Extensive experiments across multiple real-world streaming graph datasets show that STRAP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art STGNN baselines on STOOD tasks, demonstrating its robustness, adaptability, and strong generalization capability without task-specific fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |

Despite recent advances in general video understanding, current MLLMs still struggle with fine-grained temporal reasoning. While reinforcement learning (RL) has been explored to address this issue recently, existing RL approaches remain limited in effectiveness. In this work, we propose MUSEG, a novel RL-based method that enhances temporal understanding by introducing timestamp-aware multi-segment grounding. MUSEG enables MLLMs to align queries with multiple relevant video segments, promoting more comprehensive temporal reasoning. To facilitate effective learning, we design a customized RL training recipe with phased rewards that progressively guides the model toward temporally grounded reasoning. Extensive experiments on temporal grounding and time-sensitive video QA tasks demonstrate that MUSEG significantly outperforms existing methods and generalizes well across diverse temporal understanding scenarios.

While significant progress has been achieved in distilling image datasets, extending DD to the video domain remains challenging due to the high dimensionality and temporal complexity inherent in video data. Existing video distillation (VD) methods often suffer from excessive computational costs and struggle to preserve temporal dynamics, as na\"ive extensions of image-based approaches typically lead to degraded performance. In this paper, we propose a novel uni-level video dataset distillation framework that directly optimizes synthetic videos with respect to a pre-trained model. To address temporal redundancy and enhance motion preservation, we introduce a temporal saliency-guided filtering mechanism that leverages inter-frame differences to guide the distillation process, encouraging the retention of informative temporal cues while suppressing frame-level redundancy. Extensive experiments on standard video benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, bridging the gap between real and distilled video data and offering a scalable solution for video dataset compression.</p></details> |  |

Automatically transforming NL into STL is an attractive approach to overcome the limitations of manual transformation, which is time-consuming and error-prone. However, due to the lack of datasets, automatic transformation currently faces significant challenges and has not been fully explored. In this paper, we propose an NL-STL dataset named STL-Diversity-Enhanced (STL-DivEn), which comprises 16,000 samples enriched with diverse patterns. To develop the dataset, we first manually create a small-scale seed set of NL-STL pairs. Next, representative examples are identified through clustering and used to guide large language models (LLMs) in generating additional NL-STL pairs. Finally, diversity and accuracy are ensured through rigorous rule-based filters and human validation. Furthermore, we introduce the Knowledge-Guided STL Transformation (KGST) framework, a novel approach for transforming natural language into STL, involving a generate-then-refine process based on external knowledge. Statistical analysis shows that the STL-DivEn dataset exhibits more diversity than the existing NL-STL dataset. Moreover, both metric-based and human evaluations indicate that our KGST approach outperforms baseline models in transformation accuracy on STL-DivEn and DeepSTL datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 5 figures, published to ACL</p></details> |

Recent researches demonstrate data-driven neural networks surpass traditional statistical methods, especially when the analytical form of signals is hard to obtain, or noise is significant. However, most densely connected or convolution-based networks fail to fully exploit the spectral and temporal structure of scintillation signals, leaving large space for performance improvement. In this paper, we propose a network architecture specially tailored for scintillation pulse characterization based on previous works on time series analysis. The core insight is that, by directly applying Fast Fourier Transform on original signals and utilizing different frequency components, the proposed network architecture can serve as a lightweight and enhanced representation learning backbone. We prove our idea in two case studies: (a) simulation data generated with the setting of the LUX dark matter detector, and (b) experimental electrical signals with fast electronics to emulate scintillation variations for the NICA/MPD calorimeter. The proposed model achieves significantly better results than the reference model in literature and densely connected models and demonstrates higher cost-efficiency than conventional machine learning methods.</p></details> | 30 pages, 14 figures |

However, this data-sharing scheme renders the system vulnerable to various malicious behaviors, as Byzantine agents can initiate cyberattacks by injecting sophisticated false data. To better investigate the impacts of malicious Byzantine faults, this paper develops a fully distributed P2P energy trading model by accounting for the high-fidelity physical network constraints. To further detect Byzantine faults and mitigate their impacts on distributed P2P energy trading problem, we propose an online spatial-temporal anomaly detection approach by leveraging the tensor learning method, which is informed by the domain knowledge to enable awesome detection performance. Moreover, to enhance its computational efficiency, we further develop closed-form solutions for the proposed detection approach. Subsequently, we derive theoretical conditions for guaranteeing optimality and convergence of the distributed P2P energy trading problem with anomaly detection mechanisms. Results from numerical simulations validate the effectiveness, optimality, and scalability of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |

While recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown early promise in tackling TVG through supervised fine-tuning (SFT), their abilities to generalize remain limited. To address this, we propose a novel post-training framework that enhances the generalization capabilities of LVLMs via reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, our contributions span three key directions: (1) Time-R1: we introduce a reasoning-guided post-training framework via RL with verifiable reward to enhance the capabilities of LVLMs on the TVG task. (2) TimeRFT: we explore data-efficient post-training strategies on our curated RL-friendly dataset, which trains the model to progressively comprehend difficult samples, leading to better generalization. (3) TVGBench: we carefully construct a small yet comprehensive benchmark for LVLM evaluation, assessing 11 types of queries and featuring balanced distributions across both videos and queries. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Time-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple downstream datasets using only 2.5K training data, while improving its general video understanding capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://xuboshen.github.io/Time-R1/</p></details> |

In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of Temporal Information Retrieval and Temporal Question Answering, two research areas aimed at handling and understanding time-sensitive information. As the amount of time-stamped content from sources like news articles, web archives, and knowledge bases increases, systems must address challenges such as detecting temporal intent, normalizing time expressions, ordering events, and reasoning over evolving or ambiguous facts. These challenges are critical across many dynamic and time-sensitive domains, from news and encyclopedias to science, history, and social media. We review both traditional approaches and modern neural methods, including those that use transformer models and Large Language Models (LLMs). We also review recent advances in temporal language modeling, multi-hop reasoning, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), alongside benchmark datasets and evaluation strategies that test temporal robustness, recency awareness, and generalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Temporal Difference Method for Stochastic Continuous Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15544v3)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For continuous systems modeled by dynamical equations such as ODEs and SDEs, Bellman's principle of optimality takes the form of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation, which provides the theoretical target of reinforcement learning (RL). Although recent advances in RL successfully leverage this formulation, the existing methods typically assume the underlying dynamics are known a priori because they need explicit access to the coefficient functions of dynamical equations to update the value function following the HJB equation. We address this inherent limitation of HJB-based RL; we propose a model-free approach still targeting the HJB equation and propose the corresponding temporal difference method. We demonstrate its potential advantages over transition kernel-based formulations, both qualitatively and empirically. The proposed formulation paves the way toward bridging stochastic optimal control and model-free reinforcement learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Sampling for Forgotten Reasoning in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20196v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) is intended to improve their reasoning capabilities, yet we uncover a counterintuitive effect: models often forget how to solve problems they previously answered correctly during training. We term this phenomenon temporal forgetting and show that it is widespread across model sizes, fine-tuning methods (both Reinforcement Learning and Supervised Fine-Tuning), and multiple reasoning benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce Temporal Sampling, a simple decoding strategy that draws outputs from multiple checkpoints along the training trajectory. This approach recovers forgotten solutions without retraining or ensembling, and leads to substantial improvements in reasoning performance, gains from 4 to 19 points in Pass@k and consistent gains in Majority@k across several benchmarks. We further extend our method to LoRA-adapted models, demonstrating that storing only adapter weights across checkpoints achieves similar benefits with minimal storage cost. By leveraging the temporal diversity inherent in training, Temporal Sampling offers a practical, compute-efficient way to surface hidden reasoning ability and rethink how we evaluate LLMs.</p></details> |  |

However, existing benchmarks for video understanding often treat these properties separately or narrowly focus on specific aspects, overlooking the holistic nature of video content. To address this, we introduce TUNA, a temporal-oriented benchmark for fine-grained understanding on dense dynamic videos, with two complementary tasks: captioning and QA. Our TUNA features diverse video scenarios and dynamics, assisted by interpretable and robust evaluation criteria. We evaluate several leading models on our benchmark, providing fine-grained performance assessments across various dimensions. This evaluation reveals key challenges in video temporal understanding, such as limited action description, inadequate multi-subject understanding, and insensitivity to camera motion, offering valuable insights for improving video understanding models.

To address this gap, we introduce the Temporal Constraint-based Planning (TCP) benchmark, that jointly assesses both capabilities. Each instance in TCP features a naturalistic dialogue around a collaborative project, where diverse and interdependent temporal constraints are explicitly or implicitly expressed, and models must infer an optimal schedule that satisfies all constraints. To construct TCP, we first generate abstract problem prototypes that are paired with realistic scenarios from various domains and enriched into dialogues using an LLM. A human quality check is performed on a sampled subset to confirm the reliability of our benchmark. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs and find that even the strongest models struggle with TCP, highlighting its difficulty and revealing limitations in LLMs' temporal constraint-based planning abilities. We analyze underlying failure cases, open source our benchmark, and hope our findings can inspire future research.</p></details> |  |

Building upon the fixed-point emergence structures developed in Alpay Algebra I and II, this third installment formalizes the observer-coupled {\phi}-collapse process through transfinite categorical flows and curvature-driven identity operators. We define a novel temporal drift mechanism as a recursive deformation of identity signatures under entangled observer influence, constructing categorical invariants that evolve across fold iterations. The proposed system surpasses conventional identity modeling in explainable AI (XAI) by encoding internal transformation history into a symbolic fixed-point structure, offering provable traceability and temporal coherence. Applications range from AI self-awareness architectures to formal logic systems where identity is not static but dynamically induced by observation. The theoretical results also offer a mathematically rigorous basis for future AI systems with stable self-referential behavior, positioning Alpay Algebra as a next-generation symbolic framework bridging category theory, identity logic, and observer dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 0 figures.

Existing embodied agents are often trained through behavior cloning, which requires expensive data and computational resources and is constrained by human demonstrations. To address this issue, many researchers explore the application of reinforcement fine-tuning to embodied agents. However, typical reinforcement fine-tuning methods for embodied agents usually rely on sparse, outcome-based rewards, which struggle to provide fine-grained feedback for specific actions within an episode, thus limiting the model's manipulation capabilities and generalization performance. In this paper, we propose RFTF, a novel reinforcement fine-tuning method that leverages a value model to generate dense rewards in embodied scenarios. Specifically, our value model is trained using temporal information, eliminating the need for costly robot action labels. In addition, RFTF incorporates a range of techniques, such as GAE and sample balance to enhance the effectiveness of the fine-tuning process. By addressing the sparse reward problem in reinforcement fine-tuning, our method significantly improves the performance of embodied agents, delivering superior generalization and adaptation capabilities across diverse embodied tasks. Experimental results show that embodied agents fine-tuned with RFTF achieve new state-of-the-art performance on the challenging CALVIN ABC-D with an average success length of 4.296. Moreover, RFTF enables rapid adaptation to new environments. After fine-tuning in the D environment of CALVIN for a few episodes, RFTF achieved an average success length of 4.301 in this new environment.</p></details> |  |

Achieving successful VSR requires producing realistic HR details and ensuring both spatial and temporal consistency. To restore realistic details, diffusion-based VSR approaches have recently been proposed. However, the inherent randomness of diffusion, combined with their tile-based approach, often leads to spatio-temporal inconsistencies. In this paper, we propose DC-VSR, a novel VSR approach to produce spatially and temporally consistent VSR results with realistic textures. To achieve spatial and temporal consistency, DC-VSR adopts a novel Spatial Attention Propagation (SAP) scheme and a Temporal Attention Propagation (TAP) scheme that propagate information across spatio-temporal tiles based on the self-attention mechanism. To enhance high-frequency details, we also introduce Detail-Suppression Self-Attention Guidance (DSSAG), a novel diffusion guidance scheme. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that DC-VSR achieves spatially and temporally consistent, high-quality VSR results, outperforming previous approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Equal...</summary><p>Equal contributions from first two authors</p></details> |

To tackle these challenges, we propose STH-SepNet (Spatio-Temporal Hypergraph Separation Networks), a novel framework that decouples temporal and spatial modeling to enhance both efficiency and precision. Therein, the temporal dimension is modeled using lightweight large language models, which effectively capture low-rank temporal dynamics. Concurrently, the spatial dimension is addressed through an adaptive hypergraph neural network, which dynamically constructs hyperedges to model intricate, higher-order interactions. A carefully designed gating mechanism is integrated to seamlessly fuse temporal and spatial representations. By leveraging the fundamental principles of low-rank temporal dynamics and spatial interactions, STH-SepNet offers a pragmatic and scalable solution for spatio-temporal prediction in real-world applications. Extensive experiments on large-scale real-world datasets across multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of STH-SepNet in boosting predictive performance while maintaining computational efficiency. This work may provide a promising lightweight framework for spatio-temporal prediction, aiming to reduce computational demands and while enhancing predictive performance.

While deep learning offers promising solutions, its effectiveness is often limited by the complexity of financial data, particularly in long-horizon scenarios. In this work, we propose FinLangNet, which addresses credit scoring by reframing it as the task of generating multi-scale distributions of a user's future behavior. Within this framework, tabular data is transformed into sequential representations, enabling the generation of user embeddings across multiple temporal scales. Inspired by the recent success of prompt-based training in Large Language Models (LLMs), FinLangNet also introduces two types of prompts to model and capture user behavior at both the feature-granularity and user-granularity levels. Experimental results demonstrate that FinLangNet outperforms the online XGBoost benchmark, achieving a 7.2\% improvement in KS metric performance and a 9.9\% reduction in the relative bad debt rate. Furthermore, FinLangNet exhibits superior performance on public UEA archives, underscoring its scalability and adaptability in time series classification tasks.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we (1) introduce a simple yet interpretable metric, termed date fragmentation ratio, that measures how faithfully a tokenizer preserves multi-digit date components; (2) release DateAugBench, a suite of 6500 examples spanning three temporal reasoning tasks: context-based date resolution, format-invariance puzzles, and date arithmetic across historical, contemporary, and future time periods; and (3) through layer-wise probing and causal attention-hop analyses, uncover an emergent date-abstraction mechanism whereby large language models stitch together the fragments of month, day, and year components for temporal reasoning. Our experiments show that excessive fragmentation correlates with accuracy drops of up to 10 points on uncommon dates like historical and futuristic dates. Further, we find that the larger the model, the faster the emergent date abstraction that heals date fragments is accomplished. Lastly, we observe a reasoning path that LLMs follow to assemble date fragments, typically differing from human interpretation (year $\rightarrow$ month $\rightarrow$ day). Our datasets and code are made publicly available \href{https://github.com/gagan3012/date-fragments}{here}.</p></details> |  |

However, multi-agent collaboration face critical safety challenges, such as hallucination amplification and error injection and propagation. This paper presents GUARDIAN, a unified method for detecting and mitigating multiple safety concerns in GUARDing Intelligent Agent collaboratioNs. By modeling the multi-agent collaboration process as a discrete-time temporal attributed graph, GUARDIAN explicitly captures the propagation dynamics of hallucinations and errors. The unsupervised encoder-decoder architecture incorporating an incremental training paradigm, learns to reconstruct node attributes and graph structures from latent embeddings, enabling the identification of anomalous nodes and edges with unparalleled precision. Moreover, we introduce a graph abstraction mechanism based on the Information Bottleneck Theory, which compresses temporal interaction graphs while preserving essential patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate GUARDIAN's effectiveness in safeguarding LLM multi-agent collaborations against diverse safety vulnerabilities, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy with efficient resource utilization.</p></details> |  |

For example, different types of blood tests can be measured at different times and frequencies, resulting in fragmented and unevenly scattered temporal data. Similar issues of irregular sampling of different attributes occur in other domains, such as monitoring of large systems using event log files or the spread of fake news on social networks. Effectively learning from such data requires models that can handle sets of temporally sparse and heterogeneous signals. In this paper, we propose Graph Mixing Additive Networks (GMAN), a novel and interpretable-by-design model for learning over irregular sets of temporal signals. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in real-world medical tasks, including a 4-point increase in the AUROC score of in-hospital mortality prediction, compared to existing methods. We further showcase GMAN's flexibility by applying it to a fake news detection task. We demonstrate how its interpretability capabilities, including node-level, graph-level, and subset-level importance, allow for transition phases detection and gaining medical insights with real-world high-stakes implications. Finally, we provide theoretical insights on GMAN expressive power.</p></details> |  |

However, current video-language benchmarks often fall short to evaluate Large Multi-modal Models' (LMMs) temporal event understanding capabilities, as they can be effectively addressed using image-language models. In this paper, we introduce RTime-QA, a novel benchmark specifically designed to assess the atomic temporal event understanding ability of LMMs. RTime-QA comprises 822 high-quality, carefully-curated video-text questions, each meticulously annotated by human experts. Each question features a video depicting an atomic temporal event, paired with both correct answers and temporal negative descriptions, specifically designed to evaluate temporal understanding. To advance LMMs' temporal event understanding ability, we further introduce RTime-IT, a 14k instruction-tuning dataset that employs a similar annotation process as RTime-QA. Extensive experimental analysis demonstrates that RTime-QA presents a significant challenge for LMMs: the state-of-the-art model Qwen2-VL achieves only 34.6 on strict-ACC metric, substantially lagging behind human performance. Furthermore, our experiments reveal that RTime-IT effectively enhance LMMs' capacity in temporal understanding. By fine-tuning on RTime-IT, our Qwen2-VL achieves 65.9 on RTime-QA.</p></details> |  |

Unlike existing memory retrieval methods that rely solely on semantic similarity, we propose SynapticRAG, which uniquely combines temporal association triggers with biologically-inspired synaptic propagation mechanisms. Our approach uses temporal association triggers and synaptic-like stimulus propagation to identify relevant dialogue histories. A dynamic leaky integrate-and-fire mechanism then selects the most contextually appropriate memories. Experiments on four datasets of English, Chinese and Japanese show that compared to state-of-the-art memory retrieval methods, SynapticRAG achieves consistent improvements across multiple metrics up to 14.66% points. This work bridges the gap between cognitive science and language model development, providing a new framework for memory management in conversational systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2025 Findings</p></details> |
| **[Geometry-guided Online 3D Video Synthesis with Multi-View Temporal Consistency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18932v1)** | 2025-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel geometry-guided online video view synthesis method with enhanced view and temporal consistency. Traditional approaches achieve high-quality synthesis from dense multi-view camera setups but require significant computational resources. In contrast, selective-input methods reduce this cost but often compromise quality, leading to multi-view and temporal inconsistencies such as flickering artifacts. Our method addresses this challenge to deliver efficient, high-quality novel-view synthesis with view and temporal consistency. The key innovation of our approach lies in using global geometry to guide an image-based rendering pipeline. To accomplish this, we progressively refine depth maps using color difference masks across time. These depth maps are then accumulated through truncated signed distance fields in the synthesized view's image space. This depth representation is view and temporally consistent, and is used to guide a pre-trained blending network that fuses multiple forward-rendered input-view images. Thus, the network is encouraged to output geometrically consistent synthesis results across multiple views and time. Our approach achieves consistent, high-quality video synthesis, while running efficiently in an online manner.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025.

| **[Exploring temporal dynamics in digital trace data: mining user-sequences for communication research](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18790v1)** | 2025-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Communication is commonly considered a process that is dynamically situated in a temporal context. However, there remains a disconnection between such theoretical dynamicality and the non-dynamical character of communication scholars' preferred methodologies. In this paper, we argue for a new research framework that uses computational approaches to leverage the fine-grained timestamps recorded in digital trace data. In particular, we propose to maintain the hyper-longitudinal information in the trace data and analyze time-evolving 'user-sequences,' which provide rich information about user activity with high temporal resolution. To illustrate our proposed framework, we present a case study that applied six approaches (e.g., sequence analysis, process mining, and language-based models) to real-world user-sequences containing 1,262,775 timestamped traces from 309 unique users, gathered via data donations. Overall, our study suggests a conceptual reorientation towards a better understanding of the temporal dimension in communication processes, resting on the exploding supply of digital trace data and the technical advances in analytical approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[HiMoE: Heterogeneity-Informed Mixture-of-Experts for Fair Spatial-Temporal Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00316v3)** | 2025-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving both accurate and consistent predictive performance across spatial nodes is crucial for ensuring the validity and reliability of outcomes in fair spatial-temporal forecasting tasks. However, existing training methods treat heterogeneous nodes with a fully averaged perspective, resulting in inherently biased prediction targets. Balancing accuracy and consistency is particularly challenging due to the multi-objective nature of spatial-temporal forecasting. To address this issue, we propose a novel Heterogeneity-Informed Mixture-of-Experts (HiMoE) framework that delivers both uniform and precise spatial-temporal predictions. From a model architecture perspective, we design the Heterogeneity-Informed Graph Convolutional Network (HiGCN) to address trend heterogeneity, and we introduce the Node-wise Mixture-of-Experts (NMoE) module to handle cardinality heterogeneity across nodes. From an evaluation perspective, we propose STFairBench, a benchmark that handles fairness in spatial-temporal prediction from both training and evaluation stages. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that HiMoE achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the best baseline by at least 9.22% across all evaluation metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Language Model Distillation: A Temporal Difference Imitation Learning Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20335v1)** | 2025-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models have led to significant progress across many NLP tasks, although their massive sizes often incur substantial computational costs. Distillation has become a common practice to compress these large and highly capable models into smaller, more efficient ones. Many existing language model distillation methods can be viewed as behavior cloning from the perspective of imitation learning or inverse reinforcement learning. This viewpoint has inspired subsequent studies that leverage (inverse) reinforcement learning techniques, including variations of behavior cloning and temporal difference learning methods. Rather than proposing yet another specific temporal difference method, we introduce a general framework for temporal difference-based distillation by exploiting the distributional sparsity of the teacher model. Specifically, it is often observed that language models assign most probability mass to a small subset of tokens. Motivated by this observation, we design a temporal difference learning framework that operates on a reduced action space (a subset of vocabulary), and demonstrate how practical algorithms can be derived and the resulting performance improvements.</p></details> |  |

While TPPs have been widely studied for modeling temporal event sequences, existing datasets are predominantly unimodal, hindering progress in models that require joint reasoning over temporal, textual, and visual information. To address this gap, DanmakuTPPBench comprises two complementary components: (1) DanmakuTPP-Events, a novel dataset derived from the Bilibili video platform, where user-generated bullet comments (Danmaku) naturally form multi-modal events annotated with precise timestamps, rich textual content, and corresponding video frames; (2) DanmakuTPP-QA, a challenging question-answering dataset constructed via a novel multi-agent pipeline powered by state-of-the-art LLMs and multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs), targeting complex temporal-textual-visual reasoning. We conduct extensive evaluations using both classical TPP models and recent MLLMs, revealing significant performance gaps and limitations in current methods' ability to model multi-modal event dynamics. Our benchmark establishes strong baselines and calls for further integration of TPP modeling into the multi-modal language modeling landscape.

To create engaging forms of experiencing auditory Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH), we designed a spatial interaction-based segmented-audio (SISA) Virtual Reality system that transforms passive ICH experiences into active ones. We undertook: (1) a co-design workshop with seven stakeholders to establish design requirements, (2) prototyping with five participants to validate design elements, and (3) user testing with 16 participants exploring Peking Opera. We designed transformations of temporal music into spatial interactions by cutting sounds into short audio segments, applying t-SNE algorithm to cluster audio segments spatially. Users navigate through these sounds by their similarity in audio property. Analysis revealed two distinct interaction patterns (Progressive and Adaptive), and demonstrated SISA's efficacy in facilitating active auditory ICH engagement. Our work illuminates the design process for enriching traditional performance artform using spatially-tuned forms of listening.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automata Learning of Preferences over Temporal Logic Formulas from Pairwise Comparisons](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18030v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many preference elicitation algorithms consider preference over propositional logic formulas or items with different attributes. In sequential decision making, a user's preference can be a preorder over possible outcomes, each of which is a temporal sequence of events. This paper considers a class of preference inference problems where the user's unknown preference is represented by a preorder over regular languages (sets of temporal sequences), referred to as temporal goals. Given a finite set of pairwise comparisons between finite words, the objective is to learn both the set of temporal goals and the preorder over these goals. We first show that a preference relation over temporal goals can be modeled by a Preference Deterministic Finite Automaton (PDFA), which is a deterministic finite automaton augmented with a preorder over acceptance conditions. The problem of preference inference reduces to learning the PDFA. This problem is shown to be computationally challenging, with the problem of determining whether there exists a PDFA of size smaller than a given integer $k$, consistent with the sample, being NP-Complete. We formalize the properties of characteristic samples and develop an algorithm that guarantees to learn, given a characteristic sample, the minimal PDFA equivalent to the true PDFA from which the sample is drawn. We present the method through a running example and provide detailed analysis using a robotic motion planning problem.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 11 figures, technical report, submission under review</p></details> |

However, the ability of these models to process cross-modal information synchronously remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce: 1) Daily-Omni, an Audio-Visual Questioning and Answering benchmark comprising 684 videos of daily life scenarios from diverse sources, rich in both audio and visual information, and featuring 1197 multiple-choice QA pairs across 6 major tasks; 2) Daily-Omni QA Generation Pipeline, which includes automatic annotation, QA generation and QA optimization, significantly improves efficiency for human evaluation and scalability of the benchmark; 3) Daily-Omni-Agent, a training-free agent utilizing open-source Visual Language Model (VLM), Audio Language Model (ALM) and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) model to establish a baseline for this benchmark. The results show that current MLLMs still struggle significantly with tasks requiring audio-visual integration, but combining VLMs and ALMs with simple temporal alignment techniques can achieve substantially better performance.

| **[Temporal Consistency Constrained Transferable Adversarial Attacks with Background Mixup for Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17807v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Action recognition models using deep learning are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which are transferable across other models trained on the same data modality. Existing transferable attack methods face two major challenges: 1) they heavily rely on the assumption that the decision boundaries of the surrogate (a.k.a., source) model and the target model are similar, which limits the adversarial transferability; and 2) their decision boundary difference makes the attack direction uncertain, which may result in the gradient oscillation, weakening the adversarial attack. This motivates us to propose a Background Mixup-induced Temporal Consistency (BMTC) attack method for action recognition. From the input transformation perspective, we design a model-agnostic background adversarial mixup module to reduce the surrogate-target model dependency. In particular, we randomly sample one video from each category and make its background frame, while selecting the background frame with the top attack ability for mixup with the clean frame by reinforcement learning. Moreover, to ensure an explicit attack direction, we leverage the background category as guidance for updating the gradient of adversarial example, and design a temporal gradient consistency loss, which strengthens the stability of the attack direction on subsequent frames. Empirical studies on two video datasets, i.e., UCF101 and Kinetics-400, and one image dataset, i.e., ImageNet, demonstrate that our method significantly boosts the transferability of adversarial examples across several action/image recognition models. Our code is available at https://github.com/mlvccn/BMTC_TransferAttackVid.</p></details> | Accepted in IJCAI'25 |
| **[RECIPE-TKG: From Sparse History to Structured Reasoning for LLM-based Temporal Knowledge Graph Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17794v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) represent dynamic facts as timestamped relations between entities. TKG completion involves forecasting missing or future links, requiring models to reason over time-evolving structure. While LLMs show promise for this task, existing approaches often overemphasize supervised fine-tuning and struggle particularly when historical evidence is limited or missing. We introduce RECIPE-TKG, a lightweight and data-efficient framework designed to improve accuracy and generalization in settings with sparse historical context. It combines (1) rule-based multi-hop retrieval for structurally diverse history, (2) contrastive fine-tuning of lightweight adapters to encode relational semantics, and (3) test-time semantic filtering to iteratively refine generations based on embedding similarity. Experiments on four TKG benchmarks show that RECIPE-TKG outperforms previous LLM-based approaches, achieving up to 30.6\% relative improvement in Hits@10. Moreover, our proposed framework produces more semantically coherent predictions, even for the samples with limited historical context.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Restoration and Spatial Rewiring for Source-Free Multivariate Time Series Domain Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21525v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) aims to adapt a pre-trained model from an annotated source domain to an unlabelled target domain without accessing the source data, thereby preserving data privacy. While existing SFDA methods have proven effective in reducing reliance on source data, they struggle to perform well on multivariate time series (MTS) due to their failure to consider the intrinsic spatial correlations inherent in MTS data. These spatial correlations are crucial for accurately representing MTS data and preserving invariant information across domains. To address this challenge, we propose Temporal Restoration and Spatial Rewiring (TERSE), a novel and concise SFDA method tailored for MTS data. Specifically, TERSE comprises a customized spatial-temporal feature encoder designed to capture the underlying spatial-temporal characteristics, coupled with both temporal restoration and spatial rewiring tasks to reinstate latent representations of the temporally masked time series and the spatially masked correlated structures. During the target adaptation phase, the target encoder is guided to produce spatially and temporally consistent features with the source domain by leveraging the source pre-trained temporal restoration and spatial rewiring networks. Therefore, TERSE can effectively model and transfer spatial-temporal dependencies across domains, facilitating implicit feature alignment. In addition, as the first approach to simultaneously consider spatial-temporal consistency in MTS-SFDA, TERSE can also be integrated as a versatile plug-and-play module into established SFDA methods. Extensive experiments on three real-world time series datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[FutureSightDrive: Thinking Visually with Spatio-Temporal CoT for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17685v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual language models (VLMs) have attracted increasing interest in autonomous driving due to their powerful reasoning capabilities. However, existing VLMs typically utilize discrete text Chain-of-Thought (CoT) tailored to the current scenario, which essentially represents highly abstract and symbolic compression of visual information, potentially leading to spatio-temporal relationship ambiguity and fine-grained information loss. Is autonomous driving better modeled on real-world simulation and imagination than on pure symbolic logic? In this paper, we propose a spatio-temporal CoT reasoning method that enables models to think visually. First, VLM serves as a world model to generate unified image frame for predicting future world states: where perception results (e.g., lane divider and 3D detection) represent the future spatial relationships, and ordinary future frame represent the temporal evolution relationships. This spatio-temporal CoT then serves as intermediate reasoning steps, enabling the VLM to function as an inverse dynamics model for trajectory planning based on current observations and future predictions. To implement visual generation in VLMs, we propose a unified pretraining paradigm integrating visual generation and understanding, along with a progressive visual CoT enhancing autoregressive image generation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, advancing autonomous driving towards visual reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Dynamic Theory of Mind: Evaluating LLM Adaptation to Temporal Evolution of Human States](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17663v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly participate in human-AI interactions, evaluating their Theory of Mind (ToM) capabilities - particularly their ability to track dynamic mental states - becomes crucial. While existing benchmarks assess basic ToM abilities, they predominantly focus on static snapshots of mental states, overlooking the temporal evolution that characterizes real-world social interactions. We present \textsc{DynToM}, a novel benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs' ability to understand and track the temporal progression of mental states across interconnected scenarios. Through a systematic four-step framework, we generate 1,100 social contexts encompassing 5,500 scenarios and 78,100 questions, each validated for realism and quality. Our comprehensive evaluation of ten state-of-the-art LLMs reveals that their average performance underperforms humans by 44.7\%, with performance degrading significantly when tracking and reasoning about the shift of mental states. This performance gap highlights fundamental limitations in current LLMs' ability to model the dynamic nature of human mental states.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACL 2025 Main Conference</p></details> |
| **[Causal Spatio-Temporal Prediction: An Effective and Efficient Multi-Modal Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17637v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal prediction plays a crucial role in intelligent transportation, weather forecasting, and urban planning. While integrating multi-modal data has shown potential for enhancing prediction accuracy, key challenges persist: (i) inadequate fusion of multi-modal information, (ii) confounding factors that obscure causal relations, and (iii) high computational complexity of prediction models. To address these challenges, we propose E^2-CSTP, an Effective and Efficient Causal multi-modal Spatio-Temporal Prediction framework. E^2-CSTP leverages cross-modal attention and gating mechanisms to effectively integrate multi-modal data. Building on this, we design a dual-branch causal inference approach: the primary branch focuses on spatio-temporal prediction, while the auxiliary branch mitigates bias by modeling additional modalities and applying causal interventions to uncover true causal dependencies. To improve model efficiency, we integrate GCN with the Mamba architecture for accelerated spatio-temporal encoding. Extensive experiments on 4 real-world datasets show that E^2-CSTP significantly outperforms 9 state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 9.66% improvements in accuracy as well as 17.37%-56.11% reductions in computational overhead.</p></details> |  |

However, the training of TAL models requires a substantial amount of manually annotated data. Data programming is an efficient method to create training labels with a series of human-defined labeling functions. However, its application in TAL faces difficulties of defining complex actions in the context of temporal video frames. In this paper, we propose ProTAL, a drag-and-link video programming framework for TAL. ProTAL enables users to define \textbf{key events} by dragging nodes representing body parts and objects and linking them to constrain the relations (direction, distance, etc.). These definitions are used to generate action labels for large-scale unlabelled videos. A semi-supervised method is then employed to train TAL models with such labels. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ProTAL through a usage scenario and a user study, providing insights into designing video programming framework.</p></details> | Accepted at CHI'25 |

It posits that three embedded processing layers unfold concurrently in the human mind, and their traces are detectable in behavioral data: sequences of routinized/automated processes are observable in fluent translation production, cognitive/reflective thoughts lead to longer keystroke pauses, while affective/emotional states may be identified through characteristic typing and gazing patterns. Utilizing data from the CRITT Translation Process Research Database (TPR-DB), the article illustrates how the temporal structure of keystroke and gaze data can be related to the three assumed hidden mental processing strata. The article relates this embedded generative model to various theoretical frameworks, dual-process theories and Robinson's (2023) ideosomatic theory of translation, opening exciting new theoretical horizons for Cognitive Translation Studies, grounded in empirical data and evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper was split & published as: --- Carl, M.

| **[CT-OT Flow: Estimating Continuous-Time Dynamics from Discrete Temporal Snapshots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17354v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many real-world scenarios, such as single-cell RNA sequencing, data are observed only as discrete-time snapshots spanning finite time intervals and subject to noisy timestamps, with no continuous trajectories available. Recovering the underlying continuous-time dynamics from these snapshots with coarse and noisy observation times is a critical and challenging task. We propose Continuous-Time Optimal Transport Flow (CT-OT Flow), which first infers high-resolution time labels via partial optimal transport and then reconstructs a continuous-time data distribution through a temporal kernel smoothing. This reconstruction enables accurate training of dynamics models such as ODEs and SDEs. CT-OT Flow consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on synthetic benchmarks and achieves lower reconstruction errors on real scRNA-seq and typhoon-track datasets. Our results highlight the benefits of explicitly modeling temporal discretization and timestamp uncertainty, offering an accurate and general framework for bridging discrete snapshots and continuous-time processes.</p></details> | 27 pages, 28 figures |
| **[FLEX: A Backbone for Diffusion-Based Modeling of Spatio-temporal Physical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17351v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce FLEX (FLow EXpert), a backbone architecture for generative modeling of spatio-temporal physical systems using diffusion models. FLEX operates in the residual space rather than on raw data, a modeling choice that we motivate theoretically, showing that it reduces the variance of the velocity field in the diffusion model, which helps stabilize training. FLEX integrates a latent Transformer into a U-Net with standard convolutional ResNet layers and incorporates a redesigned skip connection scheme. This hybrid design enables the model to capture both local spatial detail and long-range dependencies in latent space. To improve spatio-temporal conditioning, FLEX uses a task-specific encoder that processes auxiliary inputs such as coarse or past snapshots. Weak conditioning is applied to the shared encoder via skip connections to promote generalization, while strong conditioning is applied to the decoder through both skip and bottleneck features to ensure reconstruction fidelity. FLEX achieves accurate predictions for super-resolution and forecasting tasks using as few as two reverse diffusion steps. It also produces calibrated uncertainty estimates through sampling. Evaluations on high-resolution 2D turbulence data show that FLEX outperforms strong baselines and generalizes to out-of-distribution settings, including unseen Reynolds numbers, physical observables (e.g., fluid flow velocity fields), and boundary conditions.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods cannot simulate temporal motions unless high-dose imaging scans including starting and ending frames exist simultaneously. However, in the preoperative data acquisition stage, the slight movement of patients may result in dynamic backgrounds between the first and last frames in a respiratory period. This additional deviation can hardly be removed by image registration, thus affecting the temporal modeling. To address that limitation, we pioneeringly simulate the regular motion process via the image-to-video (I2V) synthesis framework, which animates with the first frame to forecast future frames of a given length. Besides, to promote the temporal consistency of animated videos, we devise the Temporal Differential Diffusion Model to generate temporal differential fields, which measure the relative differential representations between adjacent frames. The prompt attention layer is devised for fine-grained differential fields, and the field augmented layer is adopted to better interact these fields with the I2V framework, promoting more accurate temporal variation of synthesized videos. Extensive results on ACDC cardiac and 4D Lung datasets reveal that our approach simulates 4D videos along the intrinsic motion trajectory, rivaling other competitive methods on perceptual similarity and temporal consistency.

These logics are appealing because they match the expressive power of LTL on infinite traces while enabling efficient DFA-based techniques, which have been crucial to the scalability of reactive synthesis and adversarial planning in LTLf and PPLTL over finite traces. In this paper, we demonstrate that these logics are also highly effective in the context of MDPs. Introducing a technique tailored for probabilistic systems, we leverage the benefits of efficient DFA-based methods and compositionality. This approach is simpler than its non-probabilistic counterparts in reactive synthesis and adversarial planning, as it accommodates a controlled form of nondeterminism (``good for MDPs") in the automata when transitioning from finite to infinite traces. Notably, by exploiting compositionality, our solution is both implementation-friendly and well-suited for straightforward symbolic implementations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCAI 2025, the 34th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence</p></details> |

While MLLMs have been extensively studied for visual semantic understanding tasks, their ability to perform precise and quantitative spatial-temporal understanding in real-world applications remains largely unexamined, leading to uncertain prospects. To evaluate models' Spatial-Temporal Intelligence, we introduce STI-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' spatial-temporal understanding through challenging tasks such as estimating and predicting the appearance, pose, displacement, and motion of objects. Our benchmark encompasses a wide range of robot and vehicle operations across desktop, indoor, and outdoor scenarios. The extensive experiments reveals that the state-of-the-art MLLMs still struggle in real-world spatial-temporal understanding, especially in tasks requiring precise distance estimation and motion analysis.</p></details> |  |

AdapTok is equipped with a block-wise masking strategy that randomly drops tail tokens of each block during training, and a block causal scorer to predict the reconstruction quality of video frames using different numbers of tokens. During inference, an adaptive token allocation strategy based on integer linear programming is further proposed to adjust token usage given predicted scores. Such design allows for sample-wise, content-aware, and temporally dynamic token allocation under a controllable overall budget. Extensive experiments for video reconstruction and generation on UCF-101 and Kinetics-600 demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Without additional image data, AdapTok consistently improves reconstruction quality and generation performance under different token budgets, allowing for more scalable and token-efficient generative video modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/VisionXLab/AdapTok</p></details> |
| **[Pursuing Temporal-Consistent Video Virtual Try-On via Dynamic Pose Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16980v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video virtual try-on aims to seamlessly dress a subject in a video with a specific garment. The primary challenge involves preserving the visual authenticity of the garment while dynamically adapting to the pose and physique of the subject. While existing methods have predominantly focused on image-based virtual try-on, extending these techniques directly to videos often results in temporal inconsistencies. Most current video virtual try-on approaches alleviate this challenge by incorporating temporal modules, yet still overlook the critical spatiotemporal pose interactions between human and garment. Effective pose interactions in videos should not only consider spatial alignment between human and garment poses in each frame but also account for the temporal dynamics of human poses throughout the entire video. With such motivation, we propose a new framework, namely Dynamic Pose Interaction Diffusion Models (DPIDM), to leverage diffusion models to delve into dynamic pose interactions for video virtual try-on. Technically, DPIDM introduces a skeleton-based pose adapter to integrate synchronized human and garment poses into the denoising network. A hierarchical attention module is then exquisitely designed to model intra-frame human-garment pose interactions and long-term human pose dynamics across frames through pose-aware spatial and temporal attention mechanisms. Moreover, DPIDM capitalizes on a temporal regularized attention loss between consecutive frames to enhance temporal consistency. Extensive experiments conducted on VITON-HD, VVT and ViViD datasets demonstrate the superiority of our DPIDM against the baseline methods. Notably, DPIDM achieves VFID score of 0.506 on VVT dataset, leading to 60.5% improvement over the state-of-the-art GPD-VVTO approach.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |

Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have opened a new frontier by fusing visual and linguistic modalities, enabling spatio-temporal vision-language understanding: models that not only capture spatial and temporal dependencies to recognize changes but also provide a richer interactive semantic analysis of temporal images (e.g., generate descriptive captions and answer natural-language queries). In this survey, we present the first comprehensive review of RS-STVLMs. The survey covers the evolution of models from early task-specific models to recent general foundation models that leverage powerful large language models. We discuss progress in representative tasks, such as change captioning, change question answering, and change grounding. Moreover, we systematically dissect the fundamental components and key technologies underlying these models, and review the datasets and evaluation metrics that have driven the field.

| **[Unlocking Temporal Flexibility: Neural Speech Codec with Variable Frame Rate](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16845v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most neural speech codecs achieve bitrate adjustment through intra-frame mechanisms, such as codebook dropout, at a Constant Frame Rate (CFR). However, speech segments inherently have time-varying information density (e.g., silent intervals versus voiced regions). This property makes CFR not optimal in terms of bitrate and token sequence length, hindering efficiency in real-time applications. In this work, we propose a Temporally Flexible Coding (TFC) technique, introducing variable frame rate (VFR) into neural speech codecs for the first time. TFC enables seamlessly tunable average frame rates and dynamically allocates frame rates based on temporal entropy. Experimental results show that a codec with TFC achieves optimal reconstruction quality with high flexibility, and maintains competitive performance even at lower frame rates. Our approach is promising for the integration with other efforts to develop low-frame-rate neural speech codecs for more efficient downstream tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Interspeech 2025</p></details> |

Due to delays and errors in reporting, temporal graphs derived from data are unlikely to perfectly reflect reality, especially with respect to the precise times at which edges appear. To reflect this uncertainty, we consider a model in which some number $\zeta$ of edge appearances may have their timestamps perturbed by $\pm\delta$ for some $\delta$. Within this model, we investigate temporal reachability and consider the problem of determining the maximum number of vertices any vertex can reach under these perturbations. We show that this problem is intractable in general but is efficiently solvable when $\zeta$ is sufficiently large. We also give algorithms which solve this problem in several restricted settings. We complement this with some contrasting results concerning the complexity of related temporal eccentricity problems under perturbation.</p></details> | <details><summary>45 pa...</summary><p>45 pages, 3 figures.

Our system is based on a reformulation of Bonsangue and Kok's infinitary extension of Abramsky's Domain Theory in Logical Form to saturated properties. We show that in an interesting range of cases, our system is complete without the need of an infinitary rule introduced by Bonsangue and Kok to reflect the well-filteredness of Scott domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Object Captioning for Street Scene Videos from LiDAR Tracks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16594v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video captioning models have seen notable advancements in recent years, especially with regard to their ability to capture temporal information. While many research efforts have focused on architectural advancements, such as temporal attention mechanisms, there remains a notable gap in understanding how models capture and utilize temporal semantics for effective temporal feature extraction, especially in the context of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems. We propose an automated LiDAR-based captioning procedure that focuses on the temporal dynamics of traffic participants. Our approach uses a rule-based system to extract essential details such as lane position and relative motion from object tracks, followed by a template-based caption generation. Our findings show that training SwinBERT, a video captioning model, using only front camera images and supervised with our template-based captions, specifically designed to encapsulate fine-grained temporal behavior, leads to improved temporal understanding consistently across three datasets. In conclusion, our results clearly demonstrate that integrating LiDAR-based caption supervision significantly enhances temporal understanding, effectively addressing and reducing the inherent visual/static biases prevalent in current state-of-the-art model architectures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semi-decentralized Training of Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks for Traffic Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03188v2)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In smart mobility, large networks of geographically distributed sensors produce vast amounts of high-frequency spatio-temporal data that must be processed in real time to avoid major disruptions. Traditional centralized approaches are increasingly unsuitable to this task, as they struggle to scale with expanding sensor networks, and reliability issues in central components can easily affect the whole deployment. To address these challenges, we explore and adapt semi-decentralized training techniques for Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (ST-GNNs) in smart mobility domain. We implement a simulation framework where sensors are grouped by proximity into multiple cloudlets, each handling a subgraph of the traffic graph, fetching node features from other cloudlets to train its own local ST-GNN model, and exchanging model updates with other cloudlets to ensure consistency, enhancing scalability and removing reliance on a centralized aggregator. We perform extensive comparative evaluation of four different ST-GNN training setups -- centralized, traditional FL, server-free FL, and Gossip Learning -- on large-scale traffic datasets, the METR-LA and PeMS-BAY datasets, for short-, mid-, and long-term vehicle speed predictions. Experimental results show that semi-decentralized setups are comparable to centralized approaches in performance metrics, while offering advantages in terms of scalability and fault tolerance. In addition, we highlight often overlooked issues in existing literature for distributed ST-GNNs, such as the variation in model performance across different geographical areas due to region-specific traffic patterns, and the significant communication overhead and computational costs that arise from the large receptive field of GNNs, leading to substantial data transfers and increased computation of partial embeddings.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables, conference</p></details> |
| **[Incremental Sequence Classification with Temporal Consistency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16548v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address the problem of incremental sequence classification, where predictions are updated as new elements in the sequence are revealed. Drawing on temporal-difference learning from reinforcement learning, we identify a temporal-consistency condition that successive predictions should satisfy. We leverage this condition to develop a novel loss function for training incremental sequence classifiers. Through a concrete example, we demonstrate that optimizing this loss can offer substantial gains in data efficiency. We apply our method to text classification tasks and show that it improves predictive accuracy over competing approaches on several benchmark datasets. We further evaluate our approach on the task of verifying large language model generations for correctness in grade-school math problems. Our results show that models trained with our method are better able to distinguish promising generations from unpromising ones after observing only a few tokens.</p></details> |  |
| **[DeCafNet: Delegate and Conquer for Efficient Temporal Grounding in Long Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16376v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long Video Temporal Grounding (LVTG) aims at identifying specific moments within lengthy videos based on user-provided text queries for effective content retrieval. The approach taken by existing methods of dividing video into clips and processing each clip via a full-scale expert encoder is challenging to scale due to prohibitive computational costs of processing a large number of clips in long videos. To address this issue, we introduce DeCafNet, an approach employing ``delegate-and-conquer'' strategy to achieve computation efficiency without sacrificing grounding performance. DeCafNet introduces a sidekick encoder that performs dense feature extraction over all video clips in a resource-efficient manner, while generating a saliency map to identify the most relevant clips for full processing by the expert encoder. To effectively leverage features from sidekick and expert encoders that exist at different temporal resolutions, we introduce DeCaf-Grounder, which unifies and refines them via query-aware temporal aggregation and multi-scale temporal refinement for accurate grounding. Experiments on two LTVG benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeCafNet reduces computation by up to 47\% while still outperforming existing methods, establishing a new state-of-the-art for LTVG in terms of both efficiency and performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/ZijiaLewisLu/CVPR2025-DeCafNet.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Temporal and Spatial Feature Fusion Framework for Dynamic Micro Expression Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16372v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When emotions are repressed, an individual's true feelings may be revealed through micro-expressions. Consequently, micro-expressions are regarded as a genuine source of insight into an individual's authentic emotions. However, the transient and highly localised nature of micro-expressions poses a significant challenge to their accurate recognition, with the accuracy rate of micro-expression recognition being as low as 50%, even for professionals. In order to address these challenges, it is necessary to explore the field of dynamic micro expression recognition (DMER) using multimodal fusion techniques, with special attention to the diverse fusion of temporal and spatial modal features. In this paper, we propose a novel Temporal and Spatial feature Fusion framework for DMER (TSFmicro). This framework integrates a Retention Network (RetNet) and a transformer-based DMER network, with the objective of efficient micro-expression recognition through the capture and fusion of temporal and spatial relations. Meanwhile, we propose a novel parallel time-space fusion method from the perspective of modal fusion, which fuses spatio-temporal information in high-dimensional feature space, resulting in complementary "where-how" relationships at the semantic level and providing richer semantic information for the model. The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the TSFmicro method in comparison to other contemporary state-of-the-art methods. This is evidenced by its effectiveness on three well-recognised micro-expression datasets.</p></details> | 17 pages |
| **[MetaSTH-Sleep: Towards Effective Few-Shot Sleep Stage Classification with Spatial-Temporal Hypergraph Enhanced Meta-Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17142v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate classification of sleep stages based on bio-signals is fundamental for automatic sleep stage annotation. Traditionally, this task relies on experienced clinicians to manually annotate data, a process that is both time-consuming and labor-intensive. In recent years, deep learning methods have shown promise in automating this task. However, three major challenges remain: (1) deep learning models typically require large-scale labeled datasets, making them less effective in real-world settings where annotated data is limited; (2) significant inter-individual variability in bio-signals often results in inconsistent model performance when applied to new subjects, limiting generalization; and (3) existing approaches often overlook the high-order relationships among bio-signals, failing to simultaneously capture signal heterogeneity and spatial-temporal dependencies. To address these issues, we propose MetaSTH-Sleep, a few-shot sleep stage classification framework based on spatial-temporal hypergraph enhanced meta-learning. Our approach enables rapid adaptation to new subjects using only a few labeled samples, while the hypergraph structure effectively models complex spatial interconnections and temporal dynamics simultaneously in EEG signals. Experimental results demonstrate that MetaSTH-Sleep achieves substantial performance improvements across diverse subjects, offering valuable insights to support clinicians in sleep stage annotation.</p></details> |  |
| **[UrbanMind: Urban Dynamics Prediction with Multifaceted Spatial-Temporal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11654v3)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding and predicting urban dynamics is crucial for managing transportation systems, optimizing urban planning, and enhancing public services. While neural network-based approaches have achieved success, they often rely on task-specific architectures and large volumes of data, limiting their ability to generalize across diverse urban scenarios. Meanwhile, Large Language Models (LLMs) offer strong reasoning and generalization capabilities, yet their application to spatial-temporal urban dynamics remains underexplored. Existing LLM-based methods struggle to effectively integrate multifaceted spatial-temporal data and fail to address distributional shifts between training and testing data, limiting their predictive reliability in real-world applications. To bridge this gap, we propose UrbanMind, a novel spatial-temporal LLM framework for multifaceted urban dynamics prediction that ensures both accurate forecasting and robust generalization. At its core, UrbanMind introduces Muffin-MAE, a multifaceted fusion masked autoencoder with specialized masking strategies that capture intricate spatial-temporal dependencies and intercorrelations among multifaceted urban dynamics. Additionally, we design a semantic-aware prompting and fine-tuning strategy that encodes spatial-temporal contextual details into prompts, enhancing LLMs' ability to reason over spatial-temporal patterns. To further improve generalization, we introduce a test time adaptation mechanism with a test data reconstructor, enabling UrbanMind to dynamically adjust to unseen test data by reconstructing LLM-generated embeddings. Extensive experiments on real-world urban datasets across multiple cities demonstrate that UrbanMind consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving high accuracy and robust generalization, even in zero-shot settings.</p></details> | KDD 2025 accepted |

While remote sensing data is abundant, existing vision-language models (VLMs) often fail to capture temporal dynamics effectively. This paper addresses these limitations by introducing an annotated dataset of video frame pairs to track evolving geographical patterns over time. Using fine-tuning techniques like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), quantized LoRA (QLoRA), and model pruning on models such as Video-LLaVA and LLaVA-NeXT-Video, we significantly enhance VLM performance in processing remote sensing temporal changes. Results show significant improvements, with the best performance achieving a BERT score of 0.864 and ROUGE-1 score of 0.576, demonstrating superior accuracy in describing land-use transformations.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Adaptive Estimation and Learning under Temporal Distribution Shift](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15803v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we study the problem of estimation and learning under temporal distribution shift. Consider an observation sequence of length $n$, which is a noisy realization of a time-varying groundtruth sequence. Our focus is to develop methods to estimate the groundtruth at the final time-step while providing sharp point-wise estimation error rates. We show that, without prior knowledge on the level of temporal shift, a wavelet soft-thresholding estimator provides an optimal estimation error bound for the groundtruth. Our proposed estimation method generalizes existing researches Mazzetto and Upfal (2023) by establishing a connection between the sequence's non-stationarity level and the sparsity in the wavelet-transformed domain. Our theoretical findings are validated by numerical experiments. Additionally, we applied the estimator to derive sparsity-aware excess risk bounds for binary classification under distribution shift and to develop computationally efficient training objectives. As a final contribution, we draw parallels between our results and the classical signal processing problem of total-variation denoising (Mammen and van de Geer,1997; Tibshirani, 2014), uncovering novel optimal algorithms for such task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **[Improving planning and MBRL with temporally-extended actions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15754v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continuous time systems are often modeled using discrete time dynamics but this requires a small simulation step to maintain accuracy. In turn, this requires a large planning horizon which leads to computationally demanding planning problems and reduced performance. Previous work in model free reinforcement learning has partially addressed this issue using action repeats where a policy is learned to determine a discrete action duration. Instead we propose to control the continuous decision timescale directly by using temporally-extended actions and letting the planner treat the duration of the action as an additional optimization variable along with the standard action variables. This additional structure has multiple advantages. It speeds up simulation time of trajectories and, importantly, it allows for deep horizon search in terms of primitive actions while using a shallow search depth in the planner. In addition, in the model based reinforcement learning (MBRL) setting, it reduces compounding errors from model learning and improves training time for models. We show that this idea is effective and that the range for action durations can be automatically selected using a multi-armed bandit formulation and integrated into the MBRL framework. An extensive experimental evaluation both in planning and in MBRL, shows that our approach yields faster planning, better solutions, and that it enables solutions to problems that are not solved in the standard formulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Higher-order Structure Boosts Link Prediction on Temporal Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15746v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) have gained growing attention for modeling and predicting structures in temporal graphs. However, existing TGNNs primarily focus on pairwise interactions while overlooking higher-order structures that are integral to link formation and evolution in real-world temporal graphs. Meanwhile, these models often suffer from efficiency bottlenecks, further limiting their expressive power. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Higher-order structure Temporal Graph Neural Network, which incorporates hypergraph representations into temporal graph learning. In particular, we develop an algorithm to identify the underlying higher-order structures, enhancing the model's ability to capture the group interactions. Furthermore, by aggregating multiple edge features into hyperedge representations, HTGN effectively reduces memory cost during training. We theoretically demonstrate the enhanced expressiveness of our approach and validate its effectiveness and efficiency through extensive experiments on various real-world temporal graphs. Experimental results show that HTGN achieves superior performance on dynamic link prediction while reducing memory costs by up to 50\% compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[ViaRL: Adaptive Temporal Grounding via Visual Iterated Amplification Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15447v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video understanding is inherently intention-driven-humans naturally focus on relevant frames based on their goals. Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled flexible query-driven reasoning; however, video-based frameworks like Video Chain-of-Thought lack direct training signals to effectively identify relevant frames. Current approaches often rely on heuristic methods or pseudo-label supervised annotations, which are both costly and limited in scalability across diverse scenarios. To overcome these challenges, we introduce ViaRL, the first framework to leverage rule-based reinforcement learning (RL) for optimizing frame selection in intention-driven video understanding. An iterated amplification strategy is adopted to perform alternating cyclic training in the video CoT system, where each component undergoes iterative cycles of refinement to improve its capabilities. ViaRL utilizes the answer accuracy of a downstream model as a reward signal to train a frame selector through trial-and-error, eliminating the need for expensive annotations while closely aligning with human-like learning processes. Comprehensive experiments across multiple benchmarks, including VideoMME, LVBench, and MLVU, demonstrate that ViaRL consistently delivers superior temporal grounding performance and robust generalization across diverse video understanding tasks, highlighting its effectiveness and scalability. Notably, ViaRL achieves a nearly 15\% improvement on Needle QA, a subset of MLVU, which is required to search a specific needle within a long video and regarded as one of the most suitable benchmarks for evaluating temporal grounding.</p></details> |  |
| **[CEBSNet: Change-Excited and Background-Suppressed Network with Temporal Dependency Modeling for Bitemporal Change Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15322v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Change detection, a critical task in remote sensing and computer vision, aims to identify pixel-level differences between image pairs captured at the same geographic area but different times. It faces numerous challenges such as illumination variation, seasonal changes, background interference, and shooting angles, especially with a large time gap between images. While current methods have advanced, they often overlook temporal dependencies and overemphasize prominent changes while ignoring subtle but equally important changes. To address these limitations, we introduce \textbf{CEBSNet}, a novel change-excited and background-suppressed network with temporal dependency modeling for change detection. During the feature extraction, we utilize a simple Channel Swap Module (CSM) to model temporal dependency, reducing differences and noise. The Feature Excitation and Suppression Module (FESM) is developed to capture both obvious and subtle changes, maintaining the integrity of change regions. Additionally, we design a Pyramid-Aware Spatial-Channel Attention module (PASCA) to enhance the ability to detect change regions at different sizes and focus on critical regions. We conduct extensive experiments on three common street view datasets and two remote sensing datasets, and our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Comprehensive Evaluation of Large Language Models on Temporal Event Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11638v2)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated great potential in various data mining tasks, such as knowledge question answering, mathematical reasoning, and commonsense reasoning. However, the reasoning capability of LLMs on temporal event forecasting has been under-explored. To systematically investigate their abilities in temporal event forecasting, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of LLM-based methods for temporal event forecasting. Due to the lack of a high-quality dataset that involves both graph and textual data, we first construct a benchmark dataset, named MidEast-TE-mini. Based on this dataset, we design a series of baseline methods, characterized by various input formats and retrieval augmented generation (RAG) modules. From extensive experiments, we find that directly integrating raw texts into the input of LLMs does not enhance zero-shot extrapolation performance. In contrast, fine-tuning LLMs with raw texts can significantly improve performance. Additionally, LLMs enhanced with retrieval modules can effectively capture temporal relational patterns hidden in historical events. However, issues such as popularity bias and the long-tail problem persist in LLMs, particularly in the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) method. These findings not only deepen our understanding of LLM-based event forecasting methods but also highlight several promising research directions. We consider that this comprehensive evaluation, along with the identified research opportunities, will significantly contribute to future research on temporal event forecasting through LLMs.</p></details> |  |

To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark covering a wide range of temporal granularities, designed to systematically evaluate LLMs' capabilities in explainable temporal reasoning. Furthermore, our findings reveal that LLMs struggle to deliver convincing explanations when relying solely on textual information. To address challenge, we propose GETER, a novel structure-aware generative framework that integrates Graph structures with text for Explainable TEmporal Reasoning. Specifically, we first leverage temporal knowledge graphs to develop a temporal encoder that captures structural information for the query. Subsequently, we introduce a structure-text prefix adapter to map graph structure features into the text embedding space. Finally, LLMs generate explanation text by seamlessly integrating the soft graph token with instruction-tuning prompt tokens. Experimental results indicate that GETER achieves state-of-the-art performance while also demonstrating its effectiveness as well as strong generalization capabilities.

Multi-head latent attention was recently developed to compress the KV cache into a low-rank latent space. This paper proposes Multi-head Temporal Latent Attention (MTLA), which further reduces the KV cache size along the temporal dimension, greatly lowering the memory footprint of self-attention inference. MTLA employs a hyper-network to dynamically merge temporally adjacent KV cache vectors. To address the mismatch between the compressed KV cache and processed sequence lengths, a stride-aware causal mask is proposed to ensure efficient parallel training and consistency with inference behaviour. Experiments across tasks, including speech translation, speech recognition, speech understanding and text summarisation, demonstrate that MTLA achieves competitive performance compared to standard Multi-Head Attention (MHA), while greatly improving inference speed and GPU memory usage. For example, on a English-German speech translation task, MTLA achieves a 5.3x speedup and a reduction in GPU memory usage by a factor of 8.3 compared to MHA, while maintaining translation quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Spatio-Temporal Signal Recognition on Edge Devices Using PointLCA-Net](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14585v3)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in machine learning, particularly through deep learning architectures like PointNet, have transformed the processing of three-dimensional (3D) point clouds, significantly improving 3D object classification and segmentation tasks. While 3D point clouds provide detailed spatial information, spatio-temporal signals introduce a dynamic element that accounts for changes over time. However, applying deep learning techniques to spatio-temporal signals and deploying them on edge devices presents challenges, including real-time processing, memory capacity, and power consumption. To address these issues, this paper presents a novel approach that combines PointNet's feature extraction with the in-memory computing capabilities and energy efficiency of neuromorphic systems for spatio-temporal signal recognition. The proposed method consists of a two-stage process: in the first stage, PointNet extracts features from the spatio-temporal signals, which are then stored in non-volatile memristor crossbar arrays. In the second stage, these features are processed by a single-layer spiking neural encoder-decoder that employs the Locally Competitive Algorithm (LCA) for efficient encoding and classification. This work integrates the strengths of both PointNet and LCA, enhancing computational efficiency and energy performance on edge devices. PointLCA-Net achieves high recognition accuracy for spatio-temporal data with substantially lower energy burden during both inference and training than comparable approaches, thus advancing the deployment of advanced neural architectures in energy-constrained environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to International Joint Conference on Neural Networks(IJCNN), 2015</p></details> |

Current approaches suffer from uncoordinated convergence speeds across modalities and static fusion mechanisms that ignore time-varying cross-modal interactions. We propose the temporal attention-guided adaptive fusion framework for multimodal SNNs with two synergistic innovations: 1) The Temporal Attention-guided Adaptive Fusion (TAAF) module that dynamically assigns importance scores to fused spiking features at each timestep, enabling hierarchical integration of temporally heterogeneous spike-based features; 2) The temporal adaptive balanced fusion loss that modulates learning rates per modality based on the above attention scores, preventing dominant modalities from monopolizing optimization. The proposed framework implements adaptive fusion, especially in the temporal dimension, and alleviates the modality imbalance during multimodal learning, mimicking cortical multisensory integration principles. Evaluations on CREMA-D, AVE, and EAD datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance (77.55\%, 70.65\% and 97.5\%accuracy, respectively) with energy efficiency. The system resolves temporal misalignment through learnable time-warping operations and faster modality convergence coordination than baseline SNNs. This work establishes a new paradigm for temporally coherent multimodal learning in neuromorphic systems, bridging the gap between biological sensory processing and efficient machine intelligence.</p></details> |  |

While existing normalization layers, BatchNorm, LayerNorm and InstanceNorm, help mitigate distribution shifts, when applied over the time dimension they ignore the dependencies and auto-correlation inherent to the vector coefficients they normalize. In this paper, we propose PSDNorm that leverages Monge mapping and temporal context to normalize feature maps in deep learning models for signals. Notably, the proposed method operates as a test-time domain adaptation technique, addressing distribution shifts without additional training. Evaluations with architectures based on U-Net or transformer backbones trained on 10K subjects across 10 datasets, show that PSDNorm achieves state-of-the-art performance on unseen left-out datasets while being 4-times more data-efficient than BatchNorm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Investigating and Enhancing the Robustness of Large Multimodal Models Against Temporal Inconsistency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14405v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have recently demonstrated impressive performance on general video comprehension benchmarks. Nevertheless, for broader applications, the robustness of their temporal analysis capability needs to be thoroughly investigated yet predominantly ignored. Motivated by this, we propose a novel temporal robustness benchmark (TemRobBench), which introduces temporal inconsistency perturbations separately at the visual and textual modalities to assess the robustness of models. We evaluate 16 mainstream LMMs and find that they exhibit over-reliance on prior knowledge and textual context in adversarial environments, while ignoring the actual temporal dynamics in the video. To mitigate this issue, we design panoramic direct preference optimization (PanoDPO), which encourages LMMs to incorporate both visual and linguistic feature preferences simultaneously. Experimental results show that PanoDPO can effectively enhance the model's robustness and reliability in temporal analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Breaking Down Video LLM Benchmarks: Knowledge, Spatial Perception, or True Temporal Understanding?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14321v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing video understanding benchmarks often conflate knowledge-based and purely image-based questions, rather than clearly isolating a model's temporal reasoning ability, which is the key aspect that distinguishes video understanding from other modalities. We identify two major limitations that obscure whether higher scores truly indicate stronger understanding of the dynamic content in videos: (1) strong language priors, where models can answer questions without watching the video; and (2) shuffling invariance, where models maintain similar performance on certain questions even when video frames are temporally shuffled. To alleviate these issues, we propose VBenchComp, an automated pipeline that categorizes questions into different domains: LLM-Answerable, Semantic, and Temporal. Specifically, LLM-Answerable questions can be answered without viewing the video; Semantic questions remain answerable even when the video frames are shuffled; and Temporal questions require understanding the correct temporal order of frames. The rest of the questions are labeled as Others. This can enable fine-grained evaluation of different capabilities of a video LLM. Our analysis reveals nuanced model weaknesses that are hidden by traditional overall scores, and we offer insights and recommendations for designing future benchmarks that more accurately assess video LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Some of this knowledge is only valid within specific temporal contexts, such as answering the question, "Who is the President of the United States in 2022?" Ensuring LLMs generate time appropriate responses is crucial for maintaining relevance and accuracy. In this work we explore activation engineering as a method for temporally aligning LLMs to improve factual recall without any training or dataset creation. In this research we explore an activation engineering technique to ground three versions of LLaMA 2 to specific points in time and examine the effects of varying injection layers and prompting strategies. Our experiments demonstrate up to a 44% and 16% improvement in relative and explicit prompting respectively, achieving comparable performance to the fine-tuning method proposed by Zhao et al. (2024) . Notably, our approach achieves similar results to the fine-tuning baseline while being significantly more computationally efficient and requiring no pre-aligned datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Temporal Graphs with Frequent and Regular Edges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14046v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal graphs are a class of graphs defined by a constant set of vertices and a changing set of edges, each of which is known as a timestep. These graphs are well motivated in modelling real-world networks, where connections may change over time. One such example, itself the primary motivation for this paper, are public transport networks, where vertices represent stops and edges the connections available at some given time. Exploration problems are one of the most studied problems for temporal graphs, asking if an agent starting at some given vertex $v$ can visit every vertex in the graph. In this paper, we study two primary classes of temporal graphs. First, we study temporal graphs with \emph{frequent edges}, temporal graphs where each edge $e$ is active at least once every $f_e$ timesteps, called the frequency of the edge. Second, temporal graphs with \emph{regular edges}, graphs where each edge $e$ is active at any timestep $t$ where $t \equiv s_e \bmod r_e$, with $s_e$ being the start time of the edge, and $r_e$ the regularity. We show that graphs with frequent edges can be explored in $O(F n)$ timesteps, where $F = \max_{e \in E} f_e$, and that graphs with regular edges can be explored in $O(R n)$ timesteps, where $R = \max_{e \in E} r_e$. We provide additional results for \emph{public transport graphs}, temporal graphs formed by the union of several routes, corresponding to the schedules of some modes of transit, for \emph{sequential connection graphs}, temporal graphs in which each vertex has a single active in-edge per timestep, iterating over the set of edges in some order, and for \emph{broadcast networks}, a representation of communication within distributed networks where each vertex broadcasts a message either to all vertices, or none at each timestep.</p></details> |  |
| **[TimeFilter: Patch-Specific Spatial-Temporal Graph Filtration for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13041v2)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting methods generally fall into two main categories: Channel Independent (CI) and Channel Dependent (CD) strategies. While CI overlooks important covariate relationships, CD captures all dependencies without distinction, introducing noise and reducing generalization. Recent advances in Channel Clustering (CC) aim to refine dependency modeling by grouping channels with similar characteristics and applying tailored modeling techniques. However, coarse-grained clustering struggles to capture complex, time-varying interactions effectively. To address these challenges, we propose TimeFilter, a GNN-based framework for adaptive and fine-grained dependency modeling. After constructing the graph from the input sequence, TimeFilter refines the learned spatial-temporal dependencies by filtering out irrelevant correlations while preserving the most critical ones in a patch-specific manner. Extensive experiments on 13 real-world datasets from diverse application domains demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of TimeFilter. The code is available at https://github.com/TROUBADOUR000/TimeFilter.</p></details> |  |

| **[Nonlinear second-order dynamics describe labial constriction trajectories across languages and contexts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08351v3)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the dynamics of labial constriction trajectories during the production of /b/ and /m/ in English and Mandarin. We find that, across languages and contexts, the ratio of instantaneous displacement to instantaneous velocity generally follows an exponential decay curve from movement onset to movement offset. We formalize this empirical discovery in a differential equation and, in combination with an assumption of point attractor dynamics, derive a nonlinear second-order dynamical system describing labial constriction trajectories. The equation has only two parameters, T and r. T corresponds to the target state and r corresponds to movement rapidity. Thus, each of the parameters corresponds to a phonetically relevant dimension of control. Nonlinear regression demonstrates that the model provides excellent fits to individual movement trajectories. Moreover, trajectories simulated from the model qualitatively match empirical trajectories, and capture key kinematic variables like duration, peak velocity, and time to achieve peak velocity. The model constitutes a proposal for the dynamics of individual articulatory movements, and thus offers a novel foundation from which to understand additional influences on articulatory kinematics like prosody, inter-movement coordination, and stochastic noise.</p></details> |  |

However, this approach remains primarily acoustic and lacks articulatory constraints. In this study, the same 75 VCVs are analyzed, but generated with the Maeda model, using trajectory planning that differentiates vowel-to-vowel transitions from consonantal influences. Synthetic data exhibit similar characteristics to Ohman's sequences, including the presence of S-shaped F2 trajectories. Furthermore, locus equations (LEs) for F2 and F3 are computed from synthetic CV data to investigate their underlying determinism, leading to a reassessment of conventional interpretations. The findings indicate that, although articulatory planning is structured separately for vowel and consonant groups, S-shaped F2 trajectories emerge from a composite mechanism governed by the coordinated synergy of all articulators.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 4 figures, submitted to Interspeech 2025</p></details> |

This study categorizes such misalignments into three types: (1) lack of functions to express intent, (2) inefficient action sequences, and (3) incorrect intentions that cannot solve the task. To address these issues, we first formalize and define these three misalignment types in a unified framework. We then propose a heuristic algorithm to detect misalignments in ARCTraj trajectories and analyze their impact hierarchically and quantitatively. We also present an intention estimation method based on our formalism that infers missing alignment between user actions and intentions. Through trajectory alignment, we experimentally demonstrate that AI models trained on human task-solving trajectories improve performance in mimicking human reasoning. Based on hierarchical analysis and experiments, we highlight the importance of trajectory-intention alignment and demonstrate the effectiveness of intention-aligned training.</p></details> | KDD 2025 accepted |
| **[Risk-Informed Diffusion Transformer for Long-Tail Trajectory Prediction in the Crash Scenario](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16349v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction methods have been widely applied in autonomous driving technologies. Although the overall performance accuracy of trajectory prediction is relatively high, the lack of trajectory data in critical scenarios in the training data leads to the long-tail phenomenon. Normally, the trajectories of the tail data are more critical and more difficult to predict and may include rare scenarios such as crashes. To solve this problem, we extracted the trajectory data from real-world crash scenarios, which contain more long-tail data. Meanwhile, based on the trajectory data in this scenario, we integrated graph-based risk information and diffusion with transformer and proposed the Risk-Informed Diffusion Transformer (RI-DiT) trajectory prediction method. Extensive experiments were conducted on trajectory data in the real-world crash scenario, and the results show that the algorithm we proposed has good performance. When predicting the data of the tail 10\% (Top 10\%), the minADE and minFDE indicators are 0.016/2.667 m. At the same time, we showed the trajectory conditions of different long-tail distributions. The distribution of trajectory data is closer to the tail, the less smooth the trajectory is. Through the trajectory data in real-world crash scenarios, Our work expands the methods to overcome the long-tail challenges in trajectory prediction. Our method, RI-DiT, integrates inverse time to collision (ITTC) and the feature of traffic flow, which can predict long-tail trajectories more accurately and improve the safety of autonomous driving systems.</p></details> |  |

By employing quantum concepts and a quantum search algorithm, this work presents the implementation and optimization of the agent-environment interactions entirely within the quantum domain, eliminating reliance on classical computations. Key contributions include the quantum-based state transitions, return calculation, and trajectory search mechanism that utilize quantum principles to demonstrate the realization of RL processes through quantum phenomena. The implementation emphasizes the fundamental role of quantum superposition in enhancing computational efficiency for RL tasks. Results demonstrate the capacity of a quantum model to achieve quantum enhancement in RL, highlighting the potential of fully quantum implementations in decision-making tasks. This work not only underscores the applicability of quantum computing in machine learning but also contributes to the field of quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) by offering a robust framework for understanding and exploiting quantum computing in RL systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Latent Weight Diffusion: Generating reactive policies instead of trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14040v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing availability of open-source robotic data, imitation learning has emerged as a viable approach for both robot manipulation and locomotion. Currently, large generalized policies are trained to predict controls or trajectories using diffusion models, which have the desirable property of learning multimodal action distributions. However, generalizability comes with a cost, namely, larger model size and slower inference. This is especially an issue for robotic tasks that require high control frequency. Further, there is a known trade-off between performance and action horizon for Diffusion Policy (DP), a popular model for generating trajectories: fewer diffusion queries accumulate greater trajectory tracking errors. For these reasons, it is common practice to run these models at high inference frequency, subject to robot computational constraints. To address these limitations, we propose Latent Weight Diffusion (LWD), a method that uses diffusion to generate closed-loop policies (weights for neural policies) for robotic tasks, rather than generating trajectories. Learning the behavior distribution through parameter space over trajectory space offers two key advantages: longer action horizons (fewer diffusion queries) & robustness to perturbations while retaining high performance; and a lower inference compute cost. To this end, we show that LWD has higher success rates than DP when the action horizon is longer and when stochastic perturbations exist in the environment. Furthermore, LWD achieves multitask performance comparable to DP while requiring just ~1/45th of the inference-time FLOPS</p></details> |  |
| **[Explorer: Scaling Exploration-driven Web Trajectory Synthesis for Multimodal Web Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11357v3)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent success in large multimodal models (LMMs) has sparked promising applications of agents capable of autonomously completing complex web tasks. While open-source LMM agents have made significant advances in offline evaluation benchmarks, their performance still falls substantially short of human-level capabilities in more realistic online settings. A key bottleneck is the lack of diverse and large-scale trajectory-level datasets across various domains, which are expensive to collect. In this paper, we address this challenge by developing a scalable recipe to synthesize the largest and most diverse trajectory-level dataset to date, containing over 94K successful multimodal web trajectories, spanning 49K unique URLs, 720K screenshots, and 33M web elements. In particular, we leverage extensive web exploration and refinement to obtain diverse task intents. The average cost is 28 cents per successful trajectory, making it affordable to a wide range of users in the community. Leveraging this dataset, we train Explorer, a multimodal web agent, and demonstrate strong performance on both offline and online web agent benchmarks such as Mind2Web-Live, Multimodal-Mind2Web, and MiniWob++. Additionally, our experiments highlight data scaling as a key driver for improving web agent capabilities. We hope this study makes state-of-the-art LMM-based agent research at a larger scale more accessible.</p></details> | ACL 2025 (Findings) |
| **[Streaming Flow Policy: Simplifying diffusion$/$flow-matching policies by treating action trajectories as flow trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21851v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in diffusion$/$flow-matching policies have enabled imitation learning of complex, multi-modal action trajectories. However, they are computationally expensive because they sample a trajectory of trajectories: a diffusion$/$flow trajectory of action trajectories. They discard intermediate action trajectories, and must wait for the sampling process to complete before any actions can be executed on the robot. We simplify diffusion$/$flow policies by treating action trajectories as flow trajectories. Instead of starting from pure noise, our algorithm samples from a narrow Gaussian around the last action. Then, it incrementally integrates a velocity field learned via flow matching to produce a sequence of actions that constitute a single trajectory. This enables actions to be streamed to the robot on-the-fly during the flow sampling process, and is well-suited for receding horizon policy execution. Despite streaming, our method retains the ability to model multi-modal behavior. We train flows that stabilize around demonstration trajectories to reduce distribution shift and improve imitation learning performance. Streaming flow policy outperforms prior methods while enabling faster policy execution and tighter sensorimotor loops for learning-based robot control.

However, existing learning-based planning methods often rely on expert demonstrations, which not only lack explicit safety awareness but also risk inheriting unsafe behaviors such as speeding from suboptimal human driving data. Inspired by the success of large language models, we propose Plan-R1, a novel two-stage trajectory planning framework that formulates trajectory planning as a sequential prediction task, guided by explicit planning principles such as safety, comfort, and traffic rule compliance. In the first stage, we train an autoregressive trajectory predictor via next motion token prediction on expert data. In the second stage, we design rule-based rewards (e.g., collision avoidance, speed limits) and fine-tune the model using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a reinforcement learning strategy, to align its predictions with these planning principles. Experiments on the nuPlan benchmark demonstrate that our Plan-R1 significantly improves planning safety and feasibility, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Our code will be made public soon.</p></details> |  |
| **[IKMo: Image-Keyframed Motion Generation with Trajectory-Pose Conditioned Motion Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21146v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing human motion generation methods with trajectory and pose inputs operate global processing on both modalities, leading to suboptimal outputs. In this paper, we propose IKMo, an image-keyframed motion generation method based on the diffusion model with trajectory and pose being decoupled. The trajectory and pose inputs go through a two-stage conditioning framework. In the first stage, the dedicated optimization module is applied to refine inputs. In the second stage, trajectory and pose are encoded via a Trajectory Encoder and a Pose Encoder in parallel. Then, motion with high spatial and semantic fidelity is guided by a motion ControlNet, which processes the fused trajectory and pose data. Experiment results based on HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art on all metrics under trajectory-keyframe constraints. In addition, MLLM-based agents are implemented to pre-process model inputs. Given texts and keyframe images from users, the agents extract motion descriptions, keyframe poses, and trajectories as the optimized inputs into the motion generation model. We conducts a user study with 10 participants. The experiment results prove that the MLLM-based agents pre-processing makes generated motion more in line with users' expectation. We believe that the proposed method improves both the fidelity and controllability of motion generation by the diffusion model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamical ON-OFF Control with Trajectory Prediction for Multi-RIS Wireless Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20887v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have demonstrated an unparalleled ability to reconfigure wireless environments by dynamically controlling the phase, amplitude, and polarization of impinging waves. However, as nearly passive reflective metasurfaces, RISs may not distinguish between desired and interference signals, which can lead to severe spectrum pollution and even affect performance negatively. In particular, in large-scale networks, the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the receiving node can be degraded due to excessive interference reflected from the RIS. To overcome this fundamental limitation, we propose in this paper a trajectory prediction-based dynamical control algorithm (TPC) for anticipating RIS ON-OFF states sequence, integrating a long-short-term-memory (LSTM) scheme to predict user trajectories. In particular, through a codebook-based algorithm, the RIS controller adaptively coordinates the configuration of the RIS elements to maximize the received SINR. Our simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed TPC method over various system settings.</p></details> |  |

Drawing on extensive experience and a comprehensive review of current literature, we summarize our proposals for preprocessing, visualization, and evaluation in the form of an open-sourced toolbox designed for researchers working on trajectory prediction problems.

Existing OPE methods are ineffective for high-dimensional, long-horizon problems, due to exponential blow-ups in variance from importance weighting or compounding errors from learned dynamics models. To address these challenges, we propose STITCH-OPE, a model-based generative framework that leverages denoising diffusion for long-horizon OPE in high-dimensional state and action spaces. Starting with a diffusion model pre-trained on the behavior data, STITCH-OPE generates synthetic trajectories from the target policy by guiding the denoising process using the score function of the target policy. STITCH-OPE proposes two technical innovations that make it advantageous for OPE: (1) prevents over-regularization by subtracting the score of the behavior policy during guidance, and (2) generates long-horizon trajectories by stitching partial trajectories together end-to-end. We provide a theoretical guarantee that under mild assumptions, these modifications result in an exponential reduction in variance versus long-horizon trajectory diffusion. Experiments on the D4RL and OpenAI Gym benchmarks show substantial improvement in mean squared error, correlation, and regret metrics compared to state-of-the-art OPE methods.</p></details> |  |

Facing the dual eavesdropping threats, we aim to enhance the average achievable secrecy rate for the communication user by jointly designing the UAV trajectory together with the transmit information and sensing beamforming, while satisfying the requirements on sensing performance and sensing security, as well as the UAV power and flight constraints. To address the non-convex nature of the optimization problem, we employ the alternating optimization (AO) strategy, jointly with the successive convex approximation (SCA) and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) methods. Numerical results validate the proposed approach, demonstrating its ability to achieve a high secrecy rate while meeting the required sensing and security constraints.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, submitted for possible publication.

| **[RRO: LLM Agent Optimization Through Rising Reward Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20737v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited extraordinary performance in a variety of tasks while it remains challenging for them to solve complex multi-step tasks as agents. In practice, agents sensitive to the outcome of certain key steps which makes them likely to fail the task because of a subtle mistake in the planning trajectory. Recent approaches resort to calibrating the reasoning process through reinforcement learning. They reward or penalize every reasoning step with process supervision, as known as Process Reward Models (PRMs). However, PRMs are difficult and costly to scale up with a large number of next action candidates since they require extensive computations to acquire the training data through the per-step trajectory exploration. To mitigate this issue, we focus on the relative reward trend across successive reasoning steps and propose maintaining an increasing reward in the collected trajectories for process supervision, which we term Reward Rising Optimization (RRO). Specifically, we incrementally augment the process supervision until identifying a step exhibiting positive reward differentials, i.e. rising rewards, relative to its preceding iteration. This method dynamically expands the search space for the next action candidates, efficiently capturing high-quality data. We provide mathematical groundings and empirical results on the WebShop and InterCode-SQL benchmarks, showing that our proposed RRO achieves superior performance while requiring much less exploration cost.</p></details> | preprint |
| **[Towards Human-Like Trajectory Prediction for Autonomous Driving: A Behavior-Centric Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21565v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting the trajectories of vehicles is crucial for the development of autonomous driving (AD) systems, particularly in complex and dynamic traffic environments. In this study, we introduce HiT (Human-like Trajectory Prediction), a novel model designed to enhance trajectory prediction by incorporating behavior-aware modules and dynamic centrality measures. Unlike traditional methods that primarily rely on static graph structures, HiT leverages a dynamic framework that accounts for both direct and indirect interactions among traffic participants. This allows the model to capture the subtle yet significant influences of surrounding vehicles, enabling more accurate and human-like predictions. To evaluate HiT's performance, we conducted extensive experiments using diverse and challenging real-world datasets, including NGSIM, HighD, RounD, ApolloScape, and MoCAD++. The results demonstrate that HiT consistently outperforms other top models across multiple metrics, particularly excelling in scenarios involving aggressive driving behaviors. This research presents a significant step forward in trajectory prediction, offering a more reliable and interpretable approach for enhancing the safety and efficiency of fully autonomous driving systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[ACT-R: Adaptive Camera Trajectories for Single View 3D Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08239v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the simple idea of adaptive view planning to multi-view synthesis, aiming to improve both occlusion revelation and 3D consistency for single-view 3D reconstruction. Instead of producing an unordered set of views independently or simultaneously, we generate a sequence of views, leveraging temporal consistency to enhance 3D coherence. More importantly, our view sequence is not determined by a pre-determined and fixed camera setup. Instead, we compute an adaptive camera trajectory (ACT), forming an orbit, which seeks to maximize the visibility of occluded regions of the 3D object to be reconstructed. Once the best orbit is found, we feed it to a video diffusion model to generate novel views around the orbit, which can then be passed to any multi-view 3D reconstruction model to obtain the final result. Our multi-view synthesis pipeline is quite efficient since it involves no run-time training/optimization, only forward inferences by applying pre-trained models for occlusion analysis and multi-view synthesis. Our method predicts camera trajectories that reveal occlusions effectively and produce consistent novel views, significantly improving 3D reconstruction over SOTA alternatives on the unseen GSO dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[OSVI-WM: One-Shot Visual Imitation for Unseen Tasks using World-Model-Guided Trajectory Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20425v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual imitation learning enables robotic agents to acquire skills by observing expert demonstration videos. In the one-shot setting, the agent generates a policy after observing a single expert demonstration without additional fine-tuning. Existing approaches typically train and evaluate on the same set of tasks, varying only object configurations, and struggle to generalize to unseen tasks with different semantic or structural requirements. While some recent methods attempt to address this, they exhibit low success rates on hard test tasks that, despite being visually similar to some training tasks, differ in context and require distinct responses. Additionally, most existing methods lack an explicit model of environment dynamics, limiting their ability to reason about future states. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework for one-shot visual imitation learning via world-model-guided trajectory generation. Given an expert demonstration video and the agent's initial observation, our method leverages a learned world model to predict a sequence of latent states and actions. This latent trajectory is then decoded into physical waypoints that guide the agent's execution. Our method is evaluated on two simulated benchmarks and three real-world robotic platforms, where it consistently outperforms prior approaches, with over 30% improvement in some cases.</p></details> |  |

However, current powerful agents often depend on sophisticated prompt engineering combined with closed-source LLMs like GPT-4. Although training open-source LLMs using expert trajectories from teacher models has yielded some improvements in agent capabilities, this approach still faces limitations such as performance plateauing and error propagation. To mitigate these challenges, we propose STeP, a novel method for improving LLM-based agent training. We synthesize self-reflected trajectories that include reflections and corrections of error steps, which enhance the effectiveness of LLM agents in learning from teacher models, enabling them to become agents capable of self-reflecting and correcting. We also introduce partial masking strategy that prevents the LLM from internalizing incorrect or suboptimal steps. Experiments demonstrate that our method improves agent performance across three representative tasks: ALFWorld, WebShop, and SciWorld. For the open-source model LLaMA2-7B-Chat, when trained using self-reflected trajectories constructed with Qwen1.5-110B-Chat as the teacher model, it achieves comprehensive improvements with less training data compared to agents trained exclusively on expert trajectories.</p></details> |  |

By conceptualizing reasoning trajectories as pseudo-gradient descent updates to the LLM's parameters, we identify parallels between LLM reasoning and various meta-learning paradigms. We formalize the training process for reasoning tasks as a meta-learning setup, with each question treated as an individual task, and reasoning trajectories serving as the inner loop optimization for adapting model parameters. Once trained on a diverse set of questions, the LLM develops fundamental reasoning capabilities that can generalize to previously unseen questions. Extensive empirical evaluations substantiate the strong connection between LLM reasoning and meta-learning, exploring several issues of significant interest from a meta-learning standpoint. Our work not only enhances the understanding of LLM reasoning but also provides practical insights for improving these models through established meta-learning techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Flexible Forward Trajectories for Masked Molecular Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16790v2)** | 2025-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have achieved notable progress in modeling discrete data, while their potential in molecular generation remains underexplored. In this work, we explore their potential and introduce the surprising result that naively applying standards MDMs severely degrades the performance. We identify the critical cause of this issue as a state-clashing problem-where the forward diffusion of distinct molecules collapse into a common state, resulting in a mixture of reconstruction targets that cannot be learned using typical reverse diffusion process with unimodal predictions. To mitigate this, we propose Masked Element-wise Learnable Diffusion (MELD) that orchestrates per-element corruption trajectories to avoid collision between distinct molecular graphs. This is achieved through a parameterized noise scheduling network that assigns distinct corruption rates to individual graph elements, i.e., atoms and bonds. Extensive experiments on diverse molecular benchmarks reveal that MELD markedly enhances overall generation quality compared to element-agnostic noise scheduling, increasing the chemical validity of vanilla MDMs on ZINC250K from 15% to 93%, Furthermore, it achieves state-of-the-art property alignment in conditional generation tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches face critical limitations that lack high-quality training trajectories or suffer from the distributional mismatches in simulated environments and prohibitive computational costs for real-world deployment. This paper introduces SimpleDeepSearcher, a lightweight yet effective framework that bridges this gap through strategic data engineering rather than complex training paradigms. Our approach synthesizes high-quality training data by simulating realistic user interactions in live web search environments, coupled with a multi-criteria curation strategy that optimizes the diversity and quality of input and output side. Experiments on five benchmarks across diverse domains demonstrate that SFT on only 871 curated samples yields significant improvements over RL-based baselines. Our work establishes SFT as a viable pathway by systematically addressing the data-scarce bottleneck, offering practical insights for efficient deep search systems.

| **[Echo Planning for Autonomous Driving: From Current Observations to Future Trajectories and Back](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18945v1)** | 2025-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern end-to-end autonomous driving systems suffer from a critical limitation: their planners lack mechanisms to enforce temporal consistency between predicted trajectories and evolving scene dynamics. This absence of self-supervision allows early prediction errors to compound catastrophically over time. We introduce Echo Planning, a novel self-correcting framework that establishes a closed-loop Current - Future - Current (CFC) cycle to harmonize trajectory prediction with scene coherence. Our key insight is that plausible future trajectories must be bi-directionally consistent, ie, not only generated from current observations but also capable of reconstructing them. The CFC mechanism first predicts future trajectories from the Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) scene representation, then inversely maps these trajectories back to estimate the current BEV state. By enforcing consistency between the original and reconstructed BEV representations through a cycle loss, the framework intrinsically penalizes physically implausible or misaligned trajectories. Experiments on nuScenes demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, reducing L2 error by 0.04 m and collision rate by 0.12% compared to one-shot planners. Crucially, our method requires no additional supervision, leveraging the CFC cycle as an inductive bias for robust planning. This work offers a deployable solution for safety-critical autonomous systems.</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Flow Matching for Geometric Trajectory Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18647v1)** | 2025-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The simulation of N-body systems is a fundamental problem with applications in a wide range of fields, such as molecular dynamics, biochemistry, and pedestrian dynamics. Machine learning has become an invaluable tool for scaling physics-based simulators and developing models directly from experimental data. In particular, recent advances based on deep generative modeling and geometric deep learning have enabled probabilistic simulation by modeling complex distributions over trajectories while respecting the permutation symmetry that is fundamental to N-body systems. However, to generate realistic trajectories, existing methods must learn complex transformations starting from uninformed noise and do not allow for the exploitation of domain-informed priors. In this work, we propose STFlow to address this limitation. By leveraging flow matching and data-dependent couplings, STFlow facilitates physics-informed simulation of geometric trajectories without sacrificing model expressivity or scalability. Our evaluation on N-body dynamical systems, molecular dynamics, and pedestrian dynamics benchmarks shows that STFlow produces significantly lower prediction errors while enabling more efficient inference, highlighting the benefits of employing physics-informed prior distributions in probabilistic geometric trajectory modeling.</p></details> | 20 pages, 17 figures |
| **[Optimization-Based Trajectory Planning for Tractor-Trailer Vehicles on Curvy Roads: A Progressively Increasing Sampling Number Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18590v1)** | 2025-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we propose an optimization-based trajectory planner for tractor-trailer vehicles on curvy roads. The lack of analytical expression for the trailer's errors to the center line pose a great challenge to the trajectory planning for tractor-trailer vehicles. To address this issue, we first use geometric representations to characterize the lateral and orientation errors in Cartesian frame, where the errors would serve as the components of the cost function and the road edge constraints within our optimization process. Next, we generate a coarse trajectory to warm-start the subsequent optimization problems. On the other hand, to achieve a good approximation of the continuous-time kinematics, optimization-based methods usually discretize the kinematics with a large sampling number. This leads to an increase in the number of the variables and constraints, thus making the optimization problem difficult to solve. To address this issue, we design a Progressively Increasing Sampling Number Optimization (PISNO) framework. More specifically, we first find a nearly feasible trajectory with a small sampling number to warm-start the optimization process. Then, the sampling number is progressively increased, and the corresponding intermediate Optimal Control Problem (OCP) is solved in each iteration. Next, we further resample the obtained solution into a finer sampling period, and then use it to warm-start the intermediate OCP in next iteration. This process is repeated until reaching a threshold sampling number. Simulation and experiment results show the proposed method exhibits a good performance and less computational consumption over the benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[What Do You Need for Diverse Trajectory Stitching in Diffusion Planning?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18083v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In planning, stitching is an ability of algorithms to piece together sub-trajectories of data they are trained on to generate new and diverse behaviours. While stitching is historically a strength of offline reinforcement learning, recent generative behavioural cloning (BC) methods have also shown proficiency at stitching. However, the main factors behind this are poorly understood, hindering the development of new algorithms that can reliably stitch. Focusing on diffusion planners trained via BC, we find two properties are needed to compose: \emph{positional equivariance} and \emph{local receptiveness}. We use these two properties to explain architecture, data, and inference choices in existing generative BC methods based on diffusion planning, including replanning frequency, data augmentation, and data scaling. Experimental comparisions show that (1) while locality is more important than positional equivariance in creating a diffusion planner capable of composition, both are crucial (2) enabling these properties through relatively simple architecture choices can be competitive with more computationally expensive methods such as replanning or scaling data, and (3) simple inpainting-based guidance can guide architecturally compositional models to enable generalization in goal-conditioned settings.</p></details> | 9 Pages |

At the upper tier, a lightweight behavior-cloning network consumes six-axis force/torque streams from dual wrist-mounted sensors and outputs whole-body planar velocity commands that capture the leader's applied forces. At the lower tier, a deep-reinforcement-learning policy, trained under randomized payloads (0-3 kg) and friction conditions in Isaac Gym and validated in MuJoCo and on a real Unitree G1, maps these high-level twists to stable, under-load joint trajectories. By decoupling intent interpretation (force -> velocity) from legged locomotion (velocity -> joints), our method combines intuitive responsiveness to human inputs with robust, load-adaptive walking. We collect training data without motion-capture or markers, only synchronized RGB video and F/T readings, employing SAM2 and WHAM to extract 3D human pose and velocity. In real-world trials, our humanoid achieves cooperative carry-and-move performance (completion time, trajectory deviation, velocity synchrony, and follower-force) on par with a blindfolded human-follower baseline. This work is the first to demonstrate learned haptic guidance fused with full-body legged control for fluid human-humanoid co-manipulation.

| **[Learning Generalized and Flexible Trajectory Models from Omni-Semantic Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17437v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread adoption of mobile devices and data collection technologies has led to an exponential increase in trajectory data, presenting significant challenges in spatio-temporal data mining, particularly for efficient and accurate trajectory retrieval. However, existing methods for trajectory retrieval face notable limitations, including inefficiencies in large-scale data, lack of support for condition-based queries, and reliance on trajectory similarity measures. To address the above challenges, we propose OmniTraj, a generalized and flexible omni-semantic trajectory retrieval framework that integrates four complementary modalities or semantics -- raw trajectories, topology, road segments, and regions -- into a unified system. Unlike traditional approaches that are limited to computing and processing trajectories as a single modality, OmniTraj designs dedicated encoders for each modality, which are embedded and fused into a shared representation space. This design enables OmniTraj to support accurate and flexible queries based on any individual modality or combination thereof, overcoming the rigidity of traditional similarity-based methods. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of OmniTraj in handling large-scale data, providing flexible, multi-modality queries, and supporting downstream tasks and applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a full paper by KDD'25 - Research Track</p></details> |
| **[Trajectory-Independent Flexibility Envelopes of Energy-Constrained Systems with State-Dependent Losses](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16396v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As non-dispatchable renewable power units become prominent in electric power grids, demand-side flexibility appears as a key element of future power systems' operation. Power and energy bounds are intuitive metrics to describe the flexibility of energy-constrained loads. However, to be used in operation, any power consumption trajectory fulfilling the power and energy bounds must necessarily fulfill the load's constraints. In this paper, we demonstrate that energy bounds defined as the minimum and maximum energy consumption potential of a load with state-dependent losses are Trajectory-Dependent (TD), i.e., for any energy value in the bounds a feasible power trajectory exists, but not all power trajectories enclosed in the energy envelopes satisfy the load's constraints. To guarantee the satisfaction of load constraints for all trajectories, we define Trajectory-Independent (TI) energy bounds. We present TI envelope formulations for individual loads, as well as physically coupled loads and assess the proposed formulations in a building heating system, a system with state-dependent losses. We find that using a TD envelope as energy bounds in operation may yield room temperature up to 3.8{\deg}C higher and 3.4{\deg}C lower than admissible. Overall, poorly insulated buildings observe a TI energy envelope that differs significantly from their TD envelope.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[Contrastive Learning-Enhanced Trajectory Matching for Small-Scale Dataset Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15267v2)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deploying machine learning models in resource-constrained environments, such as edge devices or rapid prototyping scenarios, increasingly demands distillation of large datasets into significantly smaller yet informative synthetic datasets. Current dataset distillation techniques, particularly Trajectory Matching methods, optimize synthetic data so that the model's training trajectory on synthetic samples mirrors that on real data. While demonstrating efficacy on medium-scale synthetic datasets, these methods fail to adequately preserve semantic richness under extreme sample scarcity. To address this limitation, we propose a novel dataset distillation method integrating contrastive learning during image synthesis. By explicitly maximizing instance-level feature discrimination, our approach produces more informative and diverse synthetic samples, even when dataset sizes are significantly constrained. Experimental results demonstrate that incorporating contrastive learning substantially enhances the performance of models trained on very small-scale synthetic datasets. This integration not only guides more effective feature representation but also significantly improves the visual fidelity of the synthesized images. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves notable performance improvements over existing distillation techniques, especially in scenarios with extremely limited synthetic data.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Toward Theoretical Insights into Diffusion Trajectory Distillation via Operator Merging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16024v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion trajectory distillation methods aim to accelerate sampling in diffusion models, which produce high-quality outputs but suffer from slow sampling speeds. These methods train a student model to approximate the multi-step denoising process of a pretrained teacher model in a single step, enabling one-shot generation. However, theoretical insights into the trade-off between different distillation strategies and generative quality remain limited, complicating their optimization and selection. In this work, we take a first step toward addressing this gap. Specifically, we reinterpret trajectory distillation as an operator merging problem in the linear regime, where each step of the teacher model is represented as a linear operator acting on noisy data. These operators admit a clear geometric interpretation as projections and rescalings corresponding to the noise schedule. During merging, signal shrinkage occurs as a convex combination of operators, arising from both discretization and limited optimization time of the student model. We propose a dynamic programming algorithm to compute the optimal merging strategy that maximally preserves signal fidelity. Additionally, we demonstrate the existence of a sharp phase transition in the optimal strategy, governed by data covariance structures. Our findings enhance the theoretical understanding of diffusion trajectory distillation and offer practical insights for improving distillation strategies.</p></details> | 31 pages, 19 figures |

To address these issues, we propose SwarmDiff, a hierarchical and scalable generative framework for swarm robots. We model the swarm's macroscopic state using Probability Density Functions (PDFs) and leverage conditional diffusion models to generate risk-aware macroscopic trajectory distributions, which then guide the generation of individual robot trajectories at the microscopic level. To ensure a balance between the swarm's optimal transportation and risk awareness, we integrate Wasserstein metrics and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR). Additionally, we introduce a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) to improve sampling efficiency and generation quality by capturing long-range dependencies. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate that SwarmDiff outperforms existing methods in computational efficiency, trajectory validity, and scalability, making it a reliable solution for swarm robotic trajectory planning.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Trajectory-Based Bayesian Approach to Multi-Objective Hyperparameter Optimization with Epoch-Aware Trade-Offs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15303v2)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training machine learning models inherently involves a resource-intensive and noisy iterative learning procedure that allows epoch-wise monitoring of the model performance. However, the insights gained from the iterative learning procedure typically remain underutilized in multi-objective hyperparameter optimization scenarios. Despite the limited research in this area, existing methods commonly identify the trade-offs only at the end of model training, overlooking the fact that trade-offs can emerge at earlier epochs in cases such as overfitting. To bridge this gap, we propose an enhanced multi-objective hyperparameter optimization problem that treats the number of training epochs as a decision variable, rather than merely an auxiliary parameter, to account for trade-offs at an earlier training stage. To solve this problem and accommodate its iterative learning, we then present a trajectory-based multi-objective Bayesian optimization algorithm characterized by two features: 1) a novel acquisition function that captures the improvement along the predictive trajectory of model performances over epochs for any hyperparameter setting and 2) a multi-objective early stopping mechanism that determines when to terminate the training to maximize epoch efficiency. Experiments on synthetic simulations and hyperparameter tuning benchmarks demonstrate that our algorithm can effectively identify the desirable trade-offs while improving tuning efficiency.</p></details> |  |

When system dynamics change unexpectedly, performance degrades until models are retrained on new data. We introduce Reflexive World Models (RWM), a dual control framework that uses world model predictions as implicit reference trajectories for rapid adaptation. Our method separates the control problem into long-term reward maximization through reinforcement learning and robust motor execution through rapid latent control. This dual architecture achieves significantly faster adaptation with low online computational cost compared to model-based RL baselines, while maintaining near-optimal performance. The approach combines the benefits of flexible policy learning through reinforcement learning with rapid error correction capabilities, providing a principled approach to maintaining performance in high-dimensional continuous control tasks under varying dynamics.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Empirical Bayes Analysis of Object Trajectory Representation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01696v5)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Linear trajectory models provide mathematical advantages to autonomous driving applications such as motion prediction. However, linear models' expressive power and bias for real-world trajectories have not been thoroughly analyzed. We present an in-depth empirical analysis of the trade-off between model complexity and fit error in modelling object trajectories. We analyze vehicle, cyclist, and pedestrian trajectories. Our methodology estimates observation noise and prior distributions over model parameters from several large-scale datasets. Incorporating these priors can then regularize prediction models. Our results show that linear models do represent real-world trajectories with high fidelity at very moderate model complexity. This suggests the feasibility of using linear trajectory models in future motion prediction systems with inherent mathematical advantages.</p></details> |  |

To better understand the behavior of this metric, we systematically evaluate KL divergence across a wide range of conditions using publicly available language models. Our analysis covers comparisons between pretraining checkpoints, fine-tuned and base models, and layers via the logit lens. We find that trajectories of language models, as measured by KL divergence, exhibit a spiral structure during pretraining and thread-like progressions across layers. Furthermore, we show that, in terms of diffusion exponents, model trajectories in the log-likelihood space are more constrained than those in weight space.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Bellman Residual Minimization: A Simple Value-Based Method for LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15311v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Policy-based methods currently dominate reinforcement learning (RL) pipelines for large language model (LLM) reasoning, leaving value-based approaches largely unexplored. We revisit the classical paradigm of Bellman Residual Minimization and introduce Trajectory Bellman Residual Minimization (TBRM), an algorithm that naturally adapts this idea to LLMs, yielding a simple yet effective off-policy algorithm that optimizes a single trajectory-level Bellman objective using the model's own logits as $Q$-values. TBRM removes the need for critics, importance-sampling ratios, or clipping, and operates with only one rollout per prompt. We prove convergence to the near-optimal KL-regularized policy from arbitrary off-policy data via an improved change-of-trajectory-measure analysis. Experiments on standard mathematical-reasoning benchmarks show that TBRM consistently outperforms policy-based baselines, like PPO and GRPO, with comparable or lower computational and memory overhead. Our results indicate that value-based RL might be a principled and efficient alternative for enhancing reasoning capabilities in LLMs.</p></details> |  |

However, existing research often overlooks the driving risk field and fails to consider the impact of risk distribution within drivable areas on trajectory planning, which poses challenges for enhancing safety. This paper proposes a trajectory planning method for intelligent vehicles based on the risk reachable set to further improve the safety of trajectory planning. First, we construct the reachable set incorporating the driving risk field to more accurately assess and avoid potential risks in drivable areas. Then, the initial trajectory is generated based on safe reinforcement learning and projected onto the reachable set. Finally, we introduce a trajectory planning method based on a constrained iterative quadratic regulator to optimize the initial solution, ensuring that the planned trajectory achieves optimal comfort, safety, and efficiency. We conduct simulation tests of trajectory planning in high-speed lane-changing scenarios. The results indicate that the proposed method can guarantee trajectory comfort and driving efficiency, with the generated trajectory situated outside high-risk boundaries, thereby ensuring vehicle safety during operation.</p></details> | <details><summary>We si...</summary><p>We sincerely request the withdrawal of this paper.

While many studies address either full-body pose prediction or motion trajectory prediction, only a few attempt to merge them. We propose a motion transformation technique to simultaneously predict full-body pose and trajectory key-points in a global coordinate frame. We utilize an off-the-shelf 3D human pose estimation module, a graph attention network to encode the skeleton structure, and a compact, non-autoregressive transformer suitable for real-time motion prediction for human-robot interaction and human-aware navigation.

This sparse characteristic presents challenges for their direct use in GPS-based systems. This paper addresses the task of map-constrained trajectory recovery, aiming to enhance trajectory sampling rates of GPS trajectories. Previous studies commonly adopt a sequence-to-sequence framework, where an encoder captures the trajectory patterns and a decoder reconstructs the target trajectory. Within this framework, effectively representing the road network and extracting relevant trajectory features are crucial for overall performance. Despite advancements in these models, they fail to fully leverage the complex spatio-temporal dynamics present in both the trajectory and the road network. To overcome these limitations, we categorize the spatio-temporal dynamics of trajectory data into two distinct aspects: spatial-temporal traffic dynamics and trajectory dynamics. Furthermore, We propose TedTrajRec, a novel method for trajectory recovery. To capture spatio-temporal traffic dynamics, we introduce PD-GNN, which models periodic patterns and learns topologically aware dynamics concurrently for each road segment. For spatio-temporal trajectory dynamics, we present TedFormer, a time-aware Transformer that incorporates temporal dynamics for each GPS location by integrating closed-form neural ordinary differential equations into the attention mechanism. This allows TedFormer to effectively handle irregularly sampled data. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of TedTrajRec.

While hypernetworks work well, training them is cumbersome, and often requires ground truth optimized weights for each sample. However, obtaining each of these weights is a training problem of its own-one needs to train, e.g., adaptation weights or even an entire neural field for hypernetworks to regress to. In this work, we propose a method to train hypernetworks, without the need for any per-sample ground truth. Our key idea is to learn a Hypernetwork `Field` and estimate the entire trajectory of network weight training instead of simply its converged state. In other words, we introduce an additional input to the Hypernetwork, the convergence state, which then makes it act as a neural field that models the entire convergence pathway of a task network. A critical benefit in doing so is that the gradient of the estimated weights at any convergence state must then match the gradients of the original task -- this constraint alone is sufficient to train the Hypernetwork Field. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through the task of personalized image generation and 3D shape reconstruction from images and point clouds, demonstrating competitive results without any per-sample ground truth.</p></details> |  |

We first extract dense optical flow from a reference video, and utilize the resulting motion offsets to warp the complex-exponential tensors of RoPE, effectively encoding motion into the generation process. These embeddings are then further optimized during denoising time steps via trajectory alignment between the predicted and target velocities using a flow-matching objective. To keep the output faithful to the text prompt and prevent duplicate generations, we incorporate a regularization term based on the phase components of the reference video's Fourier transform, projecting the phase angles onto a smooth manifold to suppress high-frequency artifacts.

A desirable trajectory learning model should be able to transfer across regions and tasks without retraining, avoiding the need to maintain multiple specialized models and subpar performance with limited training data. However, each region has its unique spatial features and contexts, which are reflected in vehicle movement patterns and difficult to generalize. Additionally, transferring across different tasks faces technical challenges due to the varying input-output structures required for each task. Existing efforts towards transferability primarily involve learning embedding vectors for trajectories, which perform poorly in region transfer and require retraining of prediction modules for task transfer. To address these challenges, we propose TransferTraj, a vehicle GPS trajectory learning model that excels in both region and task transferability. For region transferability, we introduce RTTE as the main learnable module within TransferTraj. It integrates spatial, temporal, POI, and road network modalities of trajectories to effectively manage variations in spatial context distribution across regions. It also introduces a TRIE module for incorporating relative information of spatial features and a spatial context MoE module for handling movement patterns in diverse contexts. For task transferability, we propose a task-transferable input-output scheme that unifies the input-output structure of different tasks into the masking and recovery of modalities and trajectory points. This approach allows TransferTraj to be pre-trained once and transferred to different tasks without retraining. Extensive experiments on three real-world vehicle trajectory datasets under task transfer, zero-shot, and few-shot region transfer, validating TransferTraj's effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

In this context, synthetic human trajectory data is generated to simulate as close as possible to real-world human trajectories, often under summary statistics and distributional similarities. However, these similarities oversimplify complex human mobility patterns (a.k.a. ``Datasaurus''), resulting in intrinsic biases in both generative model design and benchmarks of the generated trajectories. Against this background, we propose MIRAGE, a huMan-Imitative tRAjectory GenErative model designed as a neural Temporal Point Process integrating an Exploration and Preferential Return model. It imitates the human decision-making process in trajectory generation, rather than fitting any specific statistical distributions as traditional methods do, thus avoiding the Datasaurus issue. We also propose a comprehensive task-based evaluation protocol beyond Datasaurus to systematically benchmark trajectory generative models on four typical downstream tasks, integrating multiple techniques and evaluation metrics for each task, to assess the ultimate utility of the generated trajectories. We conduct a thorough evaluation of MIRAGE on three real-world user trajectory datasets against a sizeable collection of baselines. Results show that compared to the best baselines, MIRAGE-generated trajectory data not only achieves the best statistical and distributional similarities with 59.0-67.7% improvement, but also yields the best performance in the task-based evaluation with 10.9-33.4% improvement. A series of ablation studies also validate the key design choices of MIRAGE.</p></details> | Accepted by KDD'25 |

However, progress in this field is hindered by two key challenges: the over-reliance on older datasets from 2012-2013 and the lack of reproducible, city-level check-in datasets that reflect diverse global regions. To address these gaps, we present Massive-STEPS (Massive Semantic Trajectories for Understanding POI Check-ins), a large-scale, publicly available benchmark dataset built upon the Semantic Trails dataset and enriched with semantic POI metadata. Massive-STEPS spans 12 geographically and culturally diverse cities and features more recent (2017-2018) and longer-duration (24 months) check-in data than prior datasets. We benchmarked a wide range of POI recommendation models on Massive-STEPS using both supervised and zero-shot approaches, and evaluated their performance across multiple urban contexts. By releasing Massive-STEPS, we aim to facilitate reproducible and equitable research in human mobility and POI recommendation.

Operating in such settings presents many challenges -- most notably, because the agent cannot predict the ground-truth future paths of obstacles, a previously planned trajectory can become unsafe at any moment, requiring rapid replanning to avoid collisions. Recently developed planners have used soft-constraint approaches to achieve the necessary fast computation times; however, these methods do not guarantee collision-free paths even with static obstacles. In contrast, hard-constraint methods ensure collision-free safety, but typically have longer computation times. To address these issues, we propose three key contributions. First, the DYNUS Global Planner (DGP) and Temporal Safe Corridor Generation operate in spatio-temporal space and handle both static and dynamic obstacles in the 3D environment. Second, the Safe Planning Framework leverages a combination of exploratory, safe, and contingency trajectories to flexibly re-route when potential future collisions with dynamic obstacles are detected. Finally, the Fast Hard-Constraint Local Trajectory Formulation uses a variable elimination approach to reduce the problem size and enable faster computation by pre-computing dependencies between free and dependent variables while still ensuring collision-free trajectories. We evaluated DYNUS in a variety of simulations, including dense forests, confined office spaces, cave systems, and dynamic environments. Our experiments show that DYNUS achieves a success rate of 100% and travel times that are approximately 25.0% faster than state-of-the-art methods. We also evaluated DYNUS on multiple platforms -- a quadrotor, a wheeled robot, and a quadruped -- in both simulation and hardware experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 30 figures, Under review at IEEE Transactions on Robotics</p></details> |
| **[Timely Trajectory Reconstruction in Finite Buffer Remote Tracking Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00849v2)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote tracking systems play a critical role in applications such as IoT, monitoring, surveillance and healthcare. In such systems, maintaining both real-time state awareness (for online decision making) and accurate reconstruction of historical trajectories (for offline post-processing) are essential. While the Age of Information (AoI) metric has been extensively studied as a measure of freshness, it does not capture the accuracy with which past trajectories can be reconstructed. In this work, we investigate reconstruction error as a complementary metric to AoI, addressing the trade-off between timely updates and historical accuracy. Specifically, we consider three policies, each prioritizing different aspects of information management: Keep-Old, Keep-Fresh, and our proposed Inter-arrival-Aware dropping policy. We compare these policies in terms of impact on both AoI and reconstruction error in a remote tracking system with a finite buffer. Through theoretical analysis and numerical simulations of queueing behavior, we demonstrate that while the Keep-Fresh policy minimizes AoI, it does not necessarily minimize reconstruction error. In contrast, our proposed Inter-arrival-Aware dropping policy dynamically adjusts packet retention decisions based on generation times, achieving a balance between AoI and reconstruction error. Our results provide key insights into the design of efficient buffer management policies for resource-constrained IoT networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimizing Interplanetary Trajectories using Hybrid Meta-heuristic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12399v1)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes an advanced hybrid optimization (GMPA) algorithm to effectively address the inherent limitations of the Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) when applied to complex optimization scenarios. Specifically, GMPA integrates essential features from the Marine Predators Algorithm (MPA) into the GWO framework, enabling superior performance through enhanced exploration and exploitation balance. The evaluation utilizes the GTOPX benchmark dataset from the European Space Agency (ESA), encompassing highly complex interplanetary trajectory optimization problems characterized by pronounced nonlinearity and multiple conflicting objectives reflective of real-world aerospace scenarios. Central to GMPA's methodology is an elite matrix, borrowed from MPA, designed to preserve and refine high-quality solutions iteratively, thereby promoting solution diversity and minimizing premature convergence. Furthermore, GMPA incorporates a three-phase position updating mechanism combined with L\'evy flights and Brownian motion to significantly bolster exploration capabilities, effectively mitigating the risk of stagnation in local optima. GMPA dynamically retains historical information on promising search areas, leveraging the memory storage features intrinsic to MPA, facilitating targeted exploitation and refinement. Empirical evaluations demonstrate GMPA's superior effectiveness compared to traditional GWO and other advanced metaheuristic algorithms, achieving markedly improved convergence rates and solution quality across GTOPX benchmarks. Consequently, GMPA emerges as a robust, efficient, and adaptive optimization approach particularly suitable for high-dimensional and complex aerospace trajectory optimization, offering significant insights and practical advancements in hybrid metaheuristic optimization techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory-Integrated Accessibility Analysis of Public Electric Vehicle Charging Stations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12145v1)** | 2025-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure is crucial for advancing EV adoption, managing charging loads, and ensuring equitable transportation electrification. However, there remains a notable gap in comprehensive accessibility metrics that integrate the mobility of the users. This study introduces a novel accessibility metric, termed Trajectory-Integrated Public EVCS Accessibility (TI-acs), and uses it to assess public electric vehicle charging station (EVCS) accessibility for approximately 6 million residents in the San Francisco Bay Area based on detailed individual trajectory data in one week. Unlike conventional home-based metrics, TI-acs incorporates the accessibility of EVCS along individuals' travel trajectories, bringing insights on more public charging contexts, including public charging near workplaces and charging during grid off-peak periods. As of June 2024, given the current public EVCS network, Bay Area residents have, on average, 7.5 hours and 5.2 hours of access per day during which their stay locations are within 1 km (i.e. 10-12 min walking) of a public L2 and DCFC charging port, respectively. Over the past decade, TI-acs has steadily increased from the rapid expansion of the EV market and charging infrastructure. However, spatial disparities remain significant, as reflected in Gini indices of 0.38 (L2) and 0.44 (DCFC) across census tracts. Additionally, our analysis reveals racial disparities in TI-acs, driven not only by variations in charging infrastructure near residential areas but also by differences in their mobility patterns.</p></details> | 19 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Knowledge-Informed Multi-Agent Trajectory Prediction at Signalized Intersections for Infrastructure-to-Everything](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13461v2)** | 2025-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent trajectory prediction at signalized intersections is crucial for developing efficient intelligent transportation systems and safe autonomous driving systems. Due to the complexity of intersection scenarios and the limitations of single-vehicle perception, the performance of vehicle-centric prediction methods has reached a plateau. In this paper, we introduce an Infrastructure-to-Everything (I2X) collaborative prediction scheme. In this scheme, roadside units (RSUs) independently forecast the future trajectories of all vehicles and transmit these predictions unidirectionally to subscribing vehicles. Building on this scheme, we propose I2XTraj, a dedicated infrastructure-based trajectory prediction model. I2XTraj leverages real-time traffic signal states, prior maneuver strategy knowledge, and multi-agent interactions to generate accurate, joint multi-modal trajectory prediction. First, a continuous signal-informed mechanism is proposed to adaptively process real-time traffic signals to guide trajectory proposal generation under varied intersection configurations. Second, a driving strategy awareness mechanism estimates the joint distribution of maneuver strategies by integrating spatial priors of intersection areas with dynamic vehicle states, enabling coverage of the full set of feasible maneuvers. Third, a spatial-temporal-mode attention network models multi-agent interactions to refine and adjust joint trajectory outputs.Finally, I2XTraj is evaluated on two real-world datasets of signalized intersections, the V2X-Seq and the SinD drone dataset. In both single-infrastructure and online collaborative scenarios, our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods by over 30\% on V2X-Seq and 15\% on SinD, demonstrating strong generalizability and robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Employing Laban Shape for Generating Emotionally and Functionally Expressive Trajectories in Robotic Manipulators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11716v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Successful human-robot collaboration depends on cohesive communication and a precise understanding of the robot's abilities, goals, and constraints. While robotic manipulators offer high precision, versatility, and productivity, they exhibit expressionless and monotonous motions that conceal the robot's intention, resulting in a lack of efficiency and transparency with humans. In this work, we use Laban notation, a dance annotation language, to enable robotic manipulators to generate trajectories with functional expressivity, where the robot uses nonverbal cues to communicate its abilities and the likelihood of succeeding at its task. We achieve this by introducing two novel variants of Hesitant expressive motion (Spoke-Like and Arc-Like). We also enhance the emotional expressivity of four existing emotive trajectories (Happy, Sad, Shy, and Angry) by augmenting Laban Effort usage with Laban Shape. The functionally expressive motions are validated via a human-subjects study, where participants equate both variants of Hesitant motion with reduced robot competency. The enhanced emotive trajectories are shown to be viewed as distinct emotions using the Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) spectrum, corroborating the usage of Laban Shape.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review for the 2025 IEEE RO-MAN Conference</p></details> |

The algorithm estimates Markov parameters from a single trajectory and applies a variant of the Ho-Kalman algorithm to recover the system matrices.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first finite-sample bound for this algorithm in the single-trajectory setting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Active RLHF via Best Policy Learning from Trajectory Preference Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18873v2)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address the problem of best policy identification in preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL), where learning occurs from noisy binary preferences over trajectory pairs rather than explicit numerical rewards. This approach is useful for post-training optimization of generative AI models during multi-turn user interactions, where preference feedback is more robust than handcrafted reward models. In this setting, learning is driven by both an offline preference dataset -- collected from a rater of unknown `competence' -- and online data collected with pure exploration. Since offline datasets may exhibit out-of-distribution (OOD) biases, principled online data collection is necessary. To address this, we propose Posterior Sampling for Preference Learning ($\mathsf{PSPL}$), a novel algorithm inspired by Top-Two Thompson Sampling, that maintains independent posteriors over the true reward model and transition dynamics. We provide the first theoretical guarantees for PbRL in this setting, establishing an upper bound on the simple Bayesian regret of $\mathsf{PSPL}$. Since the exact algorithm can be computationally impractical, we also provide an approximate version that outperforms existing baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[VL-TGS: Trajectory Generation and Selection using Vision Language Models in Mapless Outdoor Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02454v6)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a multi-modal trajectory generation and selection algorithm for real-world mapless outdoor navigation in human-centered environments. Such environments contain rich features like crosswalks, grass, and curbs, which are easily interpretable by humans, but not by mobile robots. We aim to compute suitable trajectories that (1) satisfy the environment-specific traversability constraints and (2) generate human-like paths while navigating on crosswalks, sidewalks, etc. Our formulation uses a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) generative model enhanced with traversability constraints to generate multiple candidate trajectories for global navigation. We develop a visual prompting approach and leverage the Visual Language Model's (VLM) zero-shot ability of semantic understanding and logical reasoning to choose the best trajectory given the contextual information about the task. We evaluate our method in various outdoor scenes with wheeled robots and compare the performance with other global navigation algorithms. In practice, we observe an average improvement of 20.81% in satisfying traversability constraints and 28.51% in terms of human-like navigation in four different outdoor navigation scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scalar embedding of temporal network trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02715v2)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A temporal network -- a collection of snapshots recording the evolution of a network whose links appear and disappear dynamically -- can be interpreted as a trajectory in graph space. In order to characterize the complex dynamics of such trajectory via the tools of time series analysis and signal processing, it is sensible to preprocess the trajectory by embedding it in a low-dimensional Euclidean space. Here we argue that, rather than the topological structure of each network snapshot, the main property of the trajectory that needs to be preserved in the embedding is the relative graph distance between snapshots. This idea naturally leads to dimensionality reduction approaches that explicitly consider relative distances, such as Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) or identifying the distance matrix as a feature matrix in which to perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA). This paper provides a comprehensible methodology that illustrates this approach. Its application to a suite of generative network trajectory models and empirical data certify that nontrivial dynamical properties of the network trajectories are preserved already in their scalar embeddings, what enables the possibility of performing time series analysis in temporal networks.</p></details> | 26 pages, 16 figures |

When motors saturate in quadrotor systems, there is an ``uncontrolled drift" of the vehicle that results in a crash. To tackle saturation, we apply a control decomposition and learn a tracking penalty from simulation data consisting of low, medium and high-cost reference trajectories. Our approach reduces crash rates by around $49\%$ compared to baselines on aggressive maneuvers in simulation. On the Crazyflie hardware platform, we demonstrate feasibility through experiments that lead to successful flights. Motivated by the growing interest in data-driven methods to quadrotor planning, we provide open-source lightweight code with an easy-to-use abstraction of hardware platforms.</p></details> | 4 pages, 4 figures |

Our method partitions the workspace, assigns fruit-picking sequences to arms, determines tight and feasible fruit-picking schedules and vehicle travel speed, and generates smooth, collision-free arm trajectories. The fruit-picking throughput achieved by the algorithm was assessed using synthetically generated fruit coordinates and a harvester design featuring up to 12 arms. The throughput increased monotonically as more arms were added. Adding more arms when fruit densities were low resulted in diminishing gains because it took longer to travel from one fruit to another. However, when there were enough fruits, the proposed algorithm achieved a linear speedup as the number of arms increased.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work will be submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Existing methods often struggle with longitudinal dependencies and structural consistency in progressive disorders. To address these limitations, we introduce MambaControl, a novel framework that integrates selective state-space modelling with diffusion processes for high-fidelity prediction of medical image trajectories. To better capture subtle structural changes over time while maintaining anatomical consistency, MambaControl combines Mamba-based long-range modelling with graph-guided anatomical control to more effectively represent anatomical correlations. Furthermore, we introduce Fourier-enhanced spectral graph representations to capture spatial coherence and multiscale detail, enabling MambaControl to achieve state-of-the-art performance in Alzheimer's disease prediction. Quantitative and regional evaluations demonstrate improved progression prediction quality and anatomical fidelity, highlighting its potential for personalised prognosis and clinical decision support.</p></details> |  |

Quantum-Train (QT), a hybrid quantum-classical framework that leverages quantum neural networks (QNNs) to generate trainable parameters exclusively during training, eliminating the need for quantum hardware at inference time. Building on QT's success across multiple domains, including image classification, reinforcement learning, flood prediction, and large language model (LLM) fine-tuning, we introduce Quantum Parameter Adaptation (QPA) for efficient typhoon forecasting model learning. Integrated with an Attention-based Multi-ConvGRU model, QPA enables parameter-efficient training while maintaining predictive accuracy. This work represents the first application of quantum machine learning (QML) to large-scale typhoon trajectory prediction, offering a scalable and energy-efficient approach to climate modeling. Our results demonstrate that QPA significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters while preserving performance, making high-performance forecasting more accessible and sustainable through hybrid quantum-classical learning.</p></details> |  |

The encoded scene information serves as the multi-modal conditional input of the denoising decoder. To tackle the mode collapse dilemma in generating high-quality diverse trajectories, we introduce a simple yet effective multi-modal representation decorrelation optimization mechanism during the training process.TransDiffuser achieves PDMS of 94.85 on the NAVSIM benchmark, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods without any anchor-based prior trajectories.</p></details> | Under review |

While modern Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models can handle diverse robotic tasks, they often incur high per-step inference costs, resulting in significant latency, sometimes minutes per task. In contrast, RT-cache stores a large-scale Memory of previously successful robot trajectories and retrieves relevant multistep motion snippets, drastically reducing inference overhead. By integrating a Memory Builder with a Trajectory Retrieval, we develop an efficient retrieval process that remains tractable even for extremely large datasets. RT-cache flexibly accumulates real-world experiences and replays them whenever the current scene matches past states, adapting quickly to new or unseen environments with only a few additional samples. Experiments on the Open-X Embodiment Dataset and other real-world data demonstrate that RT-cache completes tasks both faster and more successfully than a baseline lacking retrieval, suggesting a practical, data-driven solution for real-time manipulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures.

| **[DiffOG: Differentiable Policy Trajectory Optimization with Generalizability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13807v3)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imitation learning-based visuomotor policies excel at manipulation tasks but often produce suboptimal action trajectories compared to model-based methods. Directly mapping camera data to actions via neural networks can result in jerky motions and difficulties in meeting critical constraints, compromising safety and robustness in real-world deployment. For tasks that require high robustness or strict adherence to constraints, ensuring trajectory quality is crucial. However, the lack of interpretability in neural networks makes it challenging to generate constraint-compliant actions in a controlled manner. This paper introduces differentiable policy trajectory optimization with generalizability (DiffOG), a learning-based trajectory optimization framework designed to enhance visuomotor policies. By leveraging the proposed differentiable formulation of trajectory optimization with transformer, DiffOG seamlessly integrates policies with a generalizable optimization layer. DiffOG refines action trajectories to be smoother and more constraint-compliant while maintaining alignment with the original demonstration distribution, thus avoiding degradation in policy performance. We evaluated DiffOG across 11 simulated tasks and 2 real-world tasks. The results demonstrate that DiffOG significantly enhances the trajectory quality of visuomotor policies while having minimal impact on policy performance, outperforming trajectory processing baselines such as greedy constraint clipping and penalty-based trajectory optimization. Furthermore, DiffOG achieves superior performance compared to existing constrained visuomotor policy.

The key idea is to capture each task by an object-centric representation, specifically the SE(3) object pose trajectory relative to the target. This approach decouples embodiment actions from sensory inputs, facilitating learning from various demonstration types, including both action-based and action-less human hand demonstrations, as well as cross-embodiment generalization. Additionally, object pose trajectories inherently capture planning constraints from demonstrations without the need for manually-crafted rules. To guide the robot in executing the task, the object trajectory is used to condition a diffusion policy. We systematically evaluate our method on simulation and real-world tasks. In real-world evaluation, using only eight demonstrations shot on an iPhone, our approach completed all tasks while fully complying with task constraints.

However, due to localization errors/uncertainties, trajectory deconfliction can fail even if trajectories are perfectly shared between agents. To address this issue, we first present PARM and PARM*, perception-aware, decentralized, asynchronous multiagent trajectory planners that enable a team of agents to navigate uncertain environments while deconflicting trajectories and avoiding obstacles using perception information. PARM* differs from PARM as it is less conservative, using more computation to find closer-to-optimal solutions. While these methods achieve state-of-the-art performance, they suffer from high computational costs as they need to solve large optimization problems onboard, making it difficult for agents to replan at high rates. To overcome this challenge, we present our second key contribution, PRIMER, a learning-based planner trained with imitation learning (IL) using PARM* as the expert demonstrator. PRIMER leverages the low computational requirements at deployment of neural networks and achieves a computation speed up to 5500 times faster than optimization-based approaches.</p></details> | 7 pages, 3 figures |

However, existing methods often struggle to accurately capture this intricate structure from Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) data, particularly due to the lack of ground truth labels and the ambiguous, intertwined nature of fiber trajectories. We present a novel deep learning framework for unsupervised clustering of myocardial fibers, providing a data-driven approach to identifying distinct fiber bundles. We uniquely combine a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory network to capture local sequential information along fibers, with a Transformer autoencoder to learn global shape features, with pointwise incorporation of essential anatomical context. Clustering these representations using a density-based algorithm identifies 33 to 62 robust clusters, successfully capturing the subtle distinctions in fiber trajectories with varying levels of granularity. Our framework offers a new, flexible, and quantitative way to analyze myocardial structure, achieving a level of delineation that, to our knowledge, has not been previously achieved, with potential applications in improving surgical planning, characterizing disease-related remodeling, and ultimately, advancing personalized cardiac care.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures.

| **[Optimal Trajectory Planning with Collision Avoidance for Autonomous Vehicle Maneuvering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08724v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To perform autonomous driving maneuvers, such as parallel or perpendicular parking, a vehicle requires continual speed and steering adjustments to follow a generated path. In consequence, the path's quality is a limiting factor of the vehicle maneuver's performance. While most path planning approaches include finding a collision-free route, optimal trajectory planning involves solving the best transition from initial to final states, minimizing the action over all paths permitted by a kinematic model. Here we propose a novel method based on sequential convex optimization, which permits flexible and efficient optimal trajectory generation. The objective is to achieve the fastest time, shortest distance, and fewest number of path segments to satisfy motion requirements, while avoiding sensor blind-spots. In our approach, vehicle kinematics are represented by a discretized Dubins model. To avoid collisions, each waypoint is constrained by linear inequalities representing closest distance of obstacles to a polygon specifying the vehicle's extent. To promote smooth and valid trajectories, the solved kinematic state and control variables are constrained and regularized by penalty terms in the model's cost function, which enforces physical restrictions including limits for steering angle, acceleration and speed. In this paper, we analyze trajectories obtained for several parking scenarios. Results demonstrate efficient and collision-free motion generated by the proposed technique.</p></details> | <details><summary>SIAM ...</summary><p>SIAM Conference on Control and Its Applications, July 28-30th, 2025, Montreal, Canada</p></details> |

This paper presents a distributed trajectory planning algorithm for a quadrotor swarm that operates asynchronously and requires no communication except during the initial planning phase. Moreover, our algorithm guarantees no deadlock under asynchronous updates and absence of communication during flight. To effectively ensure these points, we build two main modules: coordination state updater and trajectory optimizer. The coordination state updater computes waypoints for each agent toward its goal and performs subgoal optimization while considering deadlocks, as well as safety constraints with respect to neighbor agents and obstacles. Then, the trajectory optimizer generates a trajectory that ensures collision avoidance even with the asynchronous planning updates of neighboring agents. We provide a theoretical guarantee of collision avoidance with deadlock resolution and evaluate the effectiveness of our method in complex simulation environments, including random forests and narrow-gap mazes. Additionally, to reduce the total mission time, we design a faster coordination state update using lightweight communication. Lastly, our approach is validated through extensive simulations and real-world experiments with cluttered environment scenarios.</p></details> | 13 pages, 11 figures |

However, a key challenge in such approaches lies in selecting an appropriate masking strategy. Previous studies have explored predefined masking techniques, including random and tube-based masking, as well as approaches that leverage key motion priors, optical flow and semantic cues from externally pre-trained models. In this work, we introduce a novel and generalizable Trajectory-Aware Adaptive Token Sampler (TATS), which models the motion dynamics of tokens and can be seamlessly integrated into the masked autoencoder (MAE) framework to select motion-centric tokens in videos. Additionally, we propose a unified training strategy that enables joint optimization of both MAE and TATS from scratch using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). We show that our model allows for aggressive masking without compromising performance on the downstream task of action recognition while also ensuring that the pre-training remains memory efficient. Extensive experiments of the proposed approach across four benchmarks, including Something-Something v2, Kinetics-400, UCF101, and HMDB51, demonstrate the effectiveness, transferability, generalization, and efficiency of our work compared to other state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Leveraging the spatial information encoded in 3DGS, this work proposes FOCI (Field Overlap Collision Integral), an algorithm that is able to optimize trajectories directly on the Gaussians themselves. FOCI leverages a novel and interpretable collision formulation for 3DGS using the notion of the overlap integral between Gaussians. Contrary to other approaches, which represent the robot with conservative bounding boxes that underestimate the traversability of the environment, we propose to represent the environment and the robot as Gaussian Splats. This not only has desirable computational properties, but also allows for orientation-aware planning, allowing the robot to pass through very tight and narrow spaces. We extensively test our algorithm in both synthetic and real Gaussian Splats, showcasing that collision-free trajectories for the ANYmal legged robot that can be computed in a few seconds, even with hundreds of thousands of Gaussians making up the environment.

| **[UVTM: Universal Vehicle Trajectory Modeling with ST Feature Domain Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07232v4)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vehicle movement is frequently captured in the form of GPS trajectories, i.e., sequences of timestamped GPS locations. Such data is widely used for various tasks such as travel-time estimation, trajectory recovery, and trajectory prediction. A universal vehicle trajectory model could be applied to different tasks, removing the need to maintain multiple specialized models, thereby reducing computational and storage costs. However, creating such a model is challenging when the integrity of trajectory features is compromised, i.e., in scenarios where only partial features are available or the trajectories are sparse. To address these challenges, we propose the Universal Vehicle Trajectory Model (UVTM), which can effectively adapt to different tasks without excessive retraining. UVTM incorporates two specialized designs. First, it divides trajectory features into three distinct domains. Each domain can be masked and generated independently to accommodate tasks with only partially available features. Second, UVTM is pre-trained by reconstructing dense, feature-complete trajectories from sparse, feature-incomplete counterparts, enabling strong performance even when the integrity of trajectory features is compromised. Experiments involving four representative trajectory-related tasks on three real-world vehicle trajectory datasets provide insight into the performance of UVTM and offer evidence that it is capable of meeting its objectives.</p></details> |  |

This study proposes a novel graph-based approach for floor separation using Wi-Fi fingerprint trajectories, addressing the challenge of vertical localization in indoor settings. We construct a graph where nodes represent Wi-Fi fingerprints, and edges are weighted by signal similarity and contextual transitions. Node2Vec is employed to generate low-dimensional embeddings, which are subsequently clustered using K-means to identify distinct floors. Evaluated on the Huawei University Challenge 2021 dataset, our method outperforms traditional community detection algorithms, achieving an accuracy of 68.97%, an F1- score of 61.99%, and an Adjusted Rand Index of 57.19%. By publicly releasing the preprocessed dataset and implementation code, this work contributes to advancing research in indoor positioning. The proposed approach demonstrates robustness to signal noise and architectural complexities, offering a scalable solution for floor-level localization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Trajectory Stitching with Flow Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07802v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models have shown great promise as trajectory planners, given their affinity to modeling complex distributions and guidable inference process. Previous works have successfully applied these in the context of robotic manipulation but perform poorly when the required solution does not exist as a complete trajectory within the training set. We identify that this is a result of being unable to plan via stitching, and subsequently address the architectural and dataset choices needed to remedy this. On top of this, we propose a novel addition to the training and inference procedures to both stabilize and enhance these capabilities. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by generating plans with out of distribution boundary conditions and performing obstacle avoidance on the Franka Panda in simulation and on real hardware. In both of these tasks our method performs significantly better than the baselines and is able to avoid obstacles up to four times as large.</p></details> |  |

However, comprehensive datasets that capture real-world career trajectories are scarce. In this paper, we introduce JobHop, a large-scale public dataset derived from anonymized resumes provided by VDAB, the public employment service in Flanders, Belgium. Utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs), we process unstructured resume data to extract structured career information, which is then mapped to standardized ESCO occupation codes using a multi-label classification model. This results in a rich dataset of over 2.3 million work experiences, extracted from and grouped into more than 391,000 user resumes and mapped to standardized ESCO occupation codes, offering valuable insights into real-world occupational transitions. This dataset enables diverse applications, such as analyzing labor market mobility, job stability, and the effects of career breaks on occupational transitions. It also supports career path prediction and other data-driven decision-making processes. To illustrate its potential, we explore key dataset characteristics, including job distributions, career breaks, and job transitions, demonstrating its value for advancing labor market research.</p></details> |  |
| **[SICNav-Diffusion: Safe and Interactive Crowd Navigation with Diffusion Trajectory Predictions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08858v2)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To navigate crowds without collisions, robots must interact with humans by forecasting their future motion and reacting accordingly. While learning-based prediction models have shown success in generating likely human trajectory predictions, integrating these stochastic models into a robot controller presents several challenges. The controller needs to account for interactive coupling between planned robot motion and human predictions while ensuring both predictions and robot actions are safe (i.e. collision-free). To address these challenges, we present a receding horizon crowd navigation method for single-robot multi-human environments. We first propose a diffusion model to generate joint trajectory predictions for all humans in the scene. We then incorporate these multi-modal predictions into a SICNav Bilevel MPC problem that simultaneously solves for a robot plan (upper-level) and acts as a safety filter to refine the predictions for non-collision (lower-level). Combining planning and prediction refinement into one bilevel problem ensures that the robot plan and human predictions are coupled. We validate the open-loop trajectory prediction performance of our diffusion model on the commonly used ETH/UCY benchmark and evaluate the closed-loop performance of our robot navigation method in simulation and extensive real-robot experiments demonstrating safe, efficient, and reactive robot motion.</p></details> |  |
| **[Finite-Alphabet-Aware Trajectory and Precoder Optimization for UAV Relaying](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08680v2)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become key enablers in relay-assisted wireless communications thanks to their flexibility and line-of-sight channel advantage. However, most existing trajectory optimization frameworks assume ideal Gaussian inputs, overlooking the fact that practical wireless systems rely on structured, finite-alphabet constellations. This mismatch can lead to suboptimal, and sometimes misleading, design choices. In this paper, we challenge that convention by introducing a finite-alphabet-aware framework for joint trajectory and precoder optimization in UAV-assisted relay systems. We formulate a non-convex design problem that directly accounts for discrete signal structures and propose an efficient solution based on alternating optimization and successive convex approximation. Simulation results reveal that strategies optimized under Gaussian assumptions can waste energy and degrade throughput in real deployments. In contrast, our approach adapts both the UAV's trajectory and transmission strategy to the underlying modulation format, delivering consistent performance gains under practical system constraints. This work takes a key step toward aligning UAV communication design with the realities of modern wireless systems: discrete signals, power limits, and intelligent mobility.</p></details> |  |
| **[Jointly spatial-temporal representation learning for individual trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04055v3)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Individual trajectories, rich in human-environment interaction information across space and time, serve as vital inputs for geospatial foundation models (GeoFMs). However, existing attempts at learning trajectory representations have overlooked the implicit spatial-temporal dependency within trajectories, failing to encode such dependency in a deep learning-friendly format. That poses a challenge in obtaining general-purpose trajectory representations. Therefore, this paper proposes a spatial-temporal joint representation learning method (ST-GraphRL) to formalize learnable spatial-temporal dependencies into trajectory representations. The proposed ST-GraphRL consists of three compositions: (i) a weighted directed spatial-temporal graph to explicitly construct mobility interactions in both space and time dimensions; (ii) a two-stage jointly encoder (i.e., decoupling and fusion), to learn entangled spatial-temporal dependencies by independently decomposing and jointly aggregating space and time information; (iii) a decoder guides ST-GraphRL to learn explicit mobility regularities by simulating the spatial-temporal distributions of trajectories. Tested on three real-world human mobility datasets, the proposed ST-GraphRL outperformed all the baseline models in predicting movement spatial-temporal distributions and preserving trajectory similarity with high spatial-temporal correlations. Analyzing spatial-temporal features presented in latent space validates that ST-GraphRL understands spatial-temporal patterns. This study may also benefit representation learnings of other geospatial data to achieve general-purpose data representations and advance GeoFMs development.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 3 tables, 7 figures</p></details> |

The challenge is to compute near-optimal sensor placements for detecting targets whose trajectories follow a log-Gaussian Cox line process. We explore sensor deployment in a transformed space, where linear target trajectories are represented as points. While this space simplifies handling the line process, the spatial functions representing sensor performance (i.e. probability of detection) become less intuitive. To illustrate our approach, we focus on positioning sensors of the barrier coverage system on the seafloor to detect passing ships. Through numerical experiments using historical ship data, we compute sensor locations that maximize the probability all ship passing over the barrier coverage system are detected.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work is published in IEEE SysCon 2025</p></details> |

This paper investigates the 3-dimensional (3D) trajectory and communication optimization for low-altitude air-ground cooperation systems, where mobile unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) upload data to UAVs. We propose a joint optimization algorithm to maximize the minimal sum-rate of UGVs while ensuring quality of service and navigation constraints. The proposed algorithm integrates a successive convex approximation (SCA)-penalty method for UGV-UAV scheduling, an SCA-based approach for UGV transmit power control, and a novel warm-start particle swarm optimization with cross mutation (WS-PSO-CM). The WS-PSO-CM leverages convex optimization results from a statistical channel model to initialize particle swarm, significantly improving the performance, compared with celebrated PSO-CM. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves a $45.8$\% higher minimal sum-rate compared to the baseline PSO-CM under the same iterations. This gain can be translated to reducing computational time by $46.7$\% of PSO-CM. Furthermore, our simulation results reveal that UAVs dynamically adjust trajectories to avoid interference by buildings, and maintain proximity to UGVs to mitigate path-loss.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages; 6 figures; submit to IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Patterns: Harnessing Causal Logic for Autonomous Driving Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06856v1)** | 2025-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate trajectory prediction has long been a major challenge for autonomous driving (AD). Traditional data-driven models predominantly rely on statistical correlations, often overlooking the causal relationships that govern traffic behavior. In this paper, we introduce a novel trajectory prediction framework that leverages causal inference to enhance predictive robustness, generalization, and accuracy. By decomposing the environment into spatial and temporal components, our approach identifies and mitigates spurious correlations, uncovering genuine causal relationships. We also employ a progressive fusion strategy to integrate multimodal information, simulating human-like reasoning processes and enabling real-time inference. Evaluations on five real-world datasets--ApolloScape, nuScenes, NGSIM, HighD, and MoCAD--demonstrate our model's superiority over existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, with improvements in key metrics such as RMSE and FDE. Our findings highlight the potential of causal reasoning to transform trajectory prediction, paving the way for robust AD systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[TPK: Trustworthy Trajectory Prediction Integrating Prior Knowledge For Interpretability and Kinematic Feasibility](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06743v1)** | 2025-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is crucial for autonomous driving, enabling vehicles to navigate safely by anticipating the movements of surrounding road users. However, current deep learning models often lack trustworthiness as their predictions can be physically infeasible and illogical to humans. To make predictions more trustworthy, recent research has incorporated prior knowledge, like the social force model for modeling interactions and kinematic models for physical realism. However, these approaches focus on priors that suit either vehicles or pedestrians and do not generalize to traffic with mixed agent classes. We propose incorporating interaction and kinematic priors of all agent classes--vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists with class-specific interaction layers to capture agent behavioral differences. To improve the interpretability of the agent interactions, we introduce DG-SFM, a rule-based interaction importance score that guides the interaction layer. To ensure physically feasible predictions, we proposed suitable kinematic models for all agent classes with a novel pedestrian kinematic model. We benchmark our approach on the Argoverse 2 dataset, using the state-of-the-art transformer HPTR as our baseline. Experiments demonstrate that our method improves interaction interpretability, revealing a correlation between incorrect predictions and divergence from our interaction prior. Even though incorporating the kinematic models causes a slight decrease in accuracy, they eliminate infeasible trajectories found in the dataset and the baseline model. Thus, our approach fosters trust in trajectory prediction as its interaction reasoning is interpretable, and its predictions adhere to physics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in the 36th IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV 2025) for oral presentation</p></details> |
| **[Boundary-Guided Trajectory Prediction for Road Aware and Physically Feasible Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06740v1)** | 2025-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of surrounding road users' trajectories is essential for safe and efficient autonomous driving. While deep learning models have improved performance, challenges remain in preventing off-road predictions and ensuring kinematic feasibility. Existing methods incorporate road-awareness modules and enforce kinematic constraints but lack plausibility guarantees and often introduce trade-offs in complexity and flexibility. This paper proposes a novel framework that formulates trajectory prediction as a constrained regression guided by permissible driving directions and their boundaries. Using the agent's current state and an HD map, our approach defines the valid boundaries and ensures on-road predictions by training the network to learn superimposed paths between left and right boundary polylines. To guarantee feasibility, the model predicts acceleration profiles that determine the vehicle's travel distance along these paths while adhering to kinematic constraints. We evaluate our approach on the Argoverse-2 dataset against the HPTR baseline. Our approach shows a slight decrease in benchmark metrics compared to HPTR but notably improves final displacement error and eliminates infeasible trajectories. Moreover, the proposed approach has superior generalization to less prevalent maneuvers and unseen out-of-distribution scenarios, reducing the off-road rate under adversarial attacks from 66\% to just 1\%. These results highlight the effectiveness of our approach in generating feasible and robust predictions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in the 36th IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Estimation-Aware Trajectory Optimization with Set-Valued Measurement Uncertainties](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09192v3)** | 2025-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, an optimization-based framework for generating estimation-aware trajectories is presented. In this setup, measurement (output) uncertainties are state-dependent and set-valued. Enveloping ellipsoids are employed to characterize state-dependent uncertainties with unknown distributions. The concept of regularity for set-valued output maps is then introduced, facilitating the formulation of the estimation-aware trajectory generation problem. Specifically, it is demonstrated that for output-regular maps, one can utilize a set-valued observability measure that is concave with respect to the finite horizon state trajectories. By maximizing this measure, estimation-aware trajectories can then be synthesized for a broad class of systems. Trajectory planning routines are also examined in this work, by which the observability measure is optimized for systems with locally linearized dynamics. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, representative examples in the context of trajectory planning with vision-based estimation are presented. Moreover, the paper presents estimation-aware planning for an uncooperative Target-Rendezvous problem, where an Ego-satellite employs an onboard machine learning (ML)-based estimation module to realize the rendezvous trajectory.</p></details> | 40 pages, 9 figures |

In this paper, we propose a barrier-enhanced parallel homotopic trajectory optimization (BPHTO) approach with the over-relaxed alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for real-time integrated decision-making and planning. To facilitate safety interactions between the ego vehicle (EV) and surrounding vehicles, a spatiotemporal safety module exhibiting bi-convexity is developed on the basis of barrier function. Varying barrier coefficients are adopted for different time steps in a planning horizon to account for the motion uncertainties of surrounding HVs and mitigate conservative behaviors. Additionally, we exploit the discrete characteristics of driving maneuvers to initialize nominal behavior-oriented free-end homotopic trajectories based on reachability analysis, and each trajectory is locally constrained to a specific driving maneuver while sharing the same task objectives. By leveraging the bi-convexity of the safety module and the kinematics of the EV, we formulate the BPHTO as a bi-convex optimization problem. Then constraint transcription and the over-relaxed ADMM are employed to streamline the optimization process, such that multiple trajectories are generated in real time with feasibility guarantees. Through a series of experiments, the proposed development demonstrates improved task accuracy, stability, and consistency in various traffic scenarios using synthetic and real-world traffic datasets.</p></details> | 17 pages, 10 figures |

We find that, across languages and contexts, the ratio of instantaneous displacement to instantaneous velocity generally follows an exponential decay curve from movement onset to movement offset. We formalize this empirical discovery in a differential equation and, in combination with an assumption of point attractor dynamics, derive a nonlinear second-order dynamical system describing labial constriction trajectories. The equation has only two parameters, T and r. T corresponds to the target state and r corresponds to movement rapidity. Thus, each of the parameters corresponds to a phonetically relevant dimension of control. Nonlinear regression demonstrates that the model provides excellent fits to individual movement trajectories. Moreover, trajectories simulated from the model qualitatively match empirical trajectories, and capture key kinematic variables like duration, peak velocity, and time to achieve peak velocity. The model constitutes a proposal for the dynamics of individual articulatory movements, and thus offers a novel foundation from which to understand additional influences on articulatory kinematics like prosody, inter-movement coordination, and stochastic noise.</p></details> |  |

However, this approach remains primarily acoustic and lacks articulatory constraints. In this study, the same 75 VCVs are analyzed, but generated with the Maeda model, using trajectory planning that differentiates vowel-to-vowel transitions from consonantal influences. Synthetic data exhibit similar characteristics to Ohman's sequences, including the presence of S-shaped F2 trajectories. Furthermore, locus equations (LEs) for F2 and F3 are computed from synthetic CV data to investigate their underlying determinism, leading to a reassessment of conventional interpretations. The findings indicate that, although articulatory planning is structured separately for vowel and consonant groups, S-shaped F2 trajectories emerge from a composite mechanism governed by the coordinated synergy of all articulators.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 4 figures, submitted to Interspeech 2025</p></details> |

This study categorizes such misalignments into three types: (1) lack of functions to express intent, (2) inefficient action sequences, and (3) incorrect intentions that cannot solve the task. To address these issues, we first formalize and define these three misalignment types in a unified framework. We then propose a heuristic algorithm to detect misalignments in ARCTraj trajectories and analyze their impact hierarchically and quantitatively. We also present an intention estimation method based on our formalism that infers missing alignment between user actions and intentions. Through trajectory alignment, we experimentally demonstrate that AI models trained on human task-solving trajectories improve performance in mimicking human reasoning. Based on hierarchical analysis and experiments, we highlight the importance of trajectory-intention alignment and demonstrate the effectiveness of intention-aligned training.</p></details> | KDD 2025 accepted |
| **[Risk-Informed Diffusion Transformer for Long-Tail Trajectory Prediction in the Crash Scenario](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16349v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction methods have been widely applied in autonomous driving technologies. Although the overall performance accuracy of trajectory prediction is relatively high, the lack of trajectory data in critical scenarios in the training data leads to the long-tail phenomenon. Normally, the trajectories of the tail data are more critical and more difficult to predict and may include rare scenarios such as crashes. To solve this problem, we extracted the trajectory data from real-world crash scenarios, which contain more long-tail data. Meanwhile, based on the trajectory data in this scenario, we integrated graph-based risk information and diffusion with transformer and proposed the Risk-Informed Diffusion Transformer (RI-DiT) trajectory prediction method. Extensive experiments were conducted on trajectory data in the real-world crash scenario, and the results show that the algorithm we proposed has good performance. When predicting the data of the tail 10\% (Top 10\%), the minADE and minFDE indicators are 0.016/2.667 m. At the same time, we showed the trajectory conditions of different long-tail distributions. The distribution of trajectory data is closer to the tail, the less smooth the trajectory is. Through the trajectory data in real-world crash scenarios, Our work expands the methods to overcome the long-tail challenges in trajectory prediction. Our method, RI-DiT, integrates inverse time to collision (ITTC) and the feature of traffic flow, which can predict long-tail trajectories more accurately and improve the safety of autonomous driving systems.</p></details> |  |

Key contributions include the quantum-based state transitions, return calculation, and trajectory search mechanism that utilize quantum principles to demonstrate the realization of RL processes through quantum phenomena. The implementation emphasizes the fundamental role of quantum superposition in enhancing computational efficiency for RL tasks. Results demonstrate the capacity of a quantum model to achieve quantum enhancement in RL, highlighting the potential of fully quantum implementations in decision-making tasks. This work not only underscores the applicability of quantum computing in machine learning but also contributes to the field of quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) by offering a robust framework for understanding and exploiting quantum computing in RL systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Latent Weight Diffusion: Generating reactive policies instead of trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14040v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing availability of open-source robotic data, imitation learning has emerged as a viable approach for both robot manipulation and locomotion. Currently, large generalized policies are trained to predict controls or trajectories using diffusion models, which have the desirable property of learning multimodal action distributions. However, generalizability comes with a cost, namely, larger model size and slower inference. This is especially an issue for robotic tasks that require high control frequency. Further, there is a known trade-off between performance and action horizon for Diffusion Policy (DP), a popular model for generating trajectories: fewer diffusion queries accumulate greater trajectory tracking errors. For these reasons, it is common practice to run these models at high inference frequency, subject to robot computational constraints. To address these limitations, we propose Latent Weight Diffusion (LWD), a method that uses diffusion to generate closed-loop policies (weights for neural policies) for robotic tasks, rather than generating trajectories. Learning the behavior distribution through parameter space over trajectory space offers two key advantages: longer action horizons (fewer diffusion queries) & robustness to perturbations while retaining high performance; and a lower inference compute cost. To this end, we show that LWD has higher success rates than DP when the action horizon is longer and when stochastic perturbations exist in the environment. Furthermore, LWD achieves multitask performance comparable to DP while requiring just ~1/45th of the inference-time FLOPS</p></details> |  |

While open-source LMM agents have made significant advances in offline evaluation benchmarks, their performance still falls substantially short of human-level capabilities in more realistic online settings. A key bottleneck is the lack of diverse and large-scale trajectory-level datasets across various domains, which are expensive to collect. In this paper, we address this challenge by developing a scalable recipe to synthesize the largest and most diverse trajectory-level dataset to date, containing over 94K successful multimodal web trajectories, spanning 49K unique URLs, 720K screenshots, and 33M web elements. In particular, we leverage extensive web exploration and refinement to obtain diverse task intents. The average cost is 28 cents per successful trajectory, making it affordable to a wide range of users in the community. Leveraging this dataset, we train Explorer, a multimodal web agent, and demonstrate strong performance on both offline and online web agent benchmarks such as Mind2Web-Live, Multimodal-Mind2Web, and MiniWob++. Additionally, our experiments highlight data scaling as a key driver for improving web agent capabilities. We hope this study makes state-of-the-art LMM-based agent research at a larger scale more accessible.</p></details> | ACL 2025 (Findings) |

However, they are computationally expensive because they sample a trajectory of trajectories: a diffusion$/$flow trajectory of action trajectories. They discard intermediate action trajectories, and must wait for the sampling process to complete before any actions can be executed on the robot. We simplify diffusion$/$flow policies by treating action trajectories as flow trajectories. Instead of starting from pure noise, our algorithm samples from a narrow Gaussian around the last action. Then, it incrementally integrates a velocity field learned via flow matching to produce a sequence of actions that constitute a single trajectory. This enables actions to be streamed to the robot on-the-fly during the flow sampling process, and is well-suited for receding horizon policy execution. Despite streaming, our method retains the ability to model multi-modal behavior. We train flows that stabilize around demonstration trajectories to reduce distribution shift and improve imitation learning performance. Streaming flow policy outperforms prior methods while enabling faster policy execution and tighter sensorimotor loops for learning-based robot control.

However, existing learning-based planning methods often rely on expert demonstrations, which not only lack explicit safety awareness but also risk inheriting unsafe behaviors such as speeding from suboptimal human driving data. Inspired by the success of large language models, we propose Plan-R1, a novel two-stage trajectory planning framework that formulates trajectory planning as a sequential prediction task, guided by explicit planning principles such as safety, comfort, and traffic rule compliance. In the first stage, we train an autoregressive trajectory predictor via next motion token prediction on expert data. In the second stage, we design rule-based rewards (e.g., collision avoidance, speed limits) and fine-tune the model using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a reinforcement learning strategy, to align its predictions with these planning principles. Experiments on the nuPlan benchmark demonstrate that our Plan-R1 significantly improves planning safety and feasibility, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Our code will be made public soon.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose IKMo, an image-keyframed motion generation method based on the diffusion model with trajectory and pose being decoupled. The trajectory and pose inputs go through a two-stage conditioning framework. In the first stage, the dedicated optimization module is applied to refine inputs. In the second stage, trajectory and pose are encoded via a Trajectory Encoder and a Pose Encoder in parallel. Then, motion with high spatial and semantic fidelity is guided by a motion ControlNet, which processes the fused trajectory and pose data. Experiment results based on HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art on all metrics under trajectory-keyframe constraints. In addition, MLLM-based agents are implemented to pre-process model inputs. Given texts and keyframe images from users, the agents extract motion descriptions, keyframe poses, and trajectories as the optimized inputs into the motion generation model. We conducts a user study with 10 participants. The experiment results prove that the MLLM-based agents pre-processing makes generated motion more in line with users' expectation. We believe that the proposed method improves both the fidelity and controllability of motion generation by the diffusion model.</p></details> |  |

However, as nearly passive reflective metasurfaces, RISs may not distinguish between desired and interference signals, which can lead to severe spectrum pollution and even affect performance negatively. In particular, in large-scale networks, the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the receiving node can be degraded due to excessive interference reflected from the RIS. To overcome this fundamental limitation, we propose in this paper a trajectory prediction-based dynamical control algorithm (TPC) for anticipating RIS ON-OFF states sequence, integrating a long-short-term-memory (LSTM) scheme to predict user trajectories. In particular, through a codebook-based algorithm, the RIS controller adaptively coordinates the configuration of the RIS elements to maximize the received SINR. Our simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed TPC method over various system settings.</p></details> |  |

| **[STITCH-OPE: Trajectory Stitching with Guided Diffusion for Off-Policy Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20781v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Off-policy evaluation (OPE) estimates the performance of a target policy using offline data collected from a behavior policy, and is crucial in domains such as robotics or healthcare where direct interaction with the environment is costly or unsafe. Existing OPE methods are ineffective for high-dimensional, long-horizon problems, due to exponential blow-ups in variance from importance weighting or compounding errors from learned dynamics models. To address these challenges, we propose STITCH-OPE, a model-based generative framework that leverages denoising diffusion for long-horizon OPE in high-dimensional state and action spaces. Starting with a diffusion model pre-trained on the behavior data, STITCH-OPE generates synthetic trajectories from the target policy by guiding the denoising process using the score function of the target policy. STITCH-OPE proposes two technical innovations that make it advantageous for OPE: (1) prevents over-regularization by subtracting the score of the behavior policy during guidance, and (2) generates long-horizon trajectories by stitching partial trajectories together end-to-end. We provide a theoretical guarantee that under mild assumptions, these modifications result in an exponential reduction in variance versus long-horizon trajectory diffusion. Experiments on the D4RL and OpenAI Gym benchmarks show substantial improvement in mean squared error, correlation, and regret metrics compared to state-of-the-art OPE methods.</p></details> |  |

Facing the dual eavesdropping threats, we aim to enhance the average achievable secrecy rate for the communication user by jointly designing the UAV trajectory together with the transmit information and sensing beamforming, while satisfying the requirements on sensing performance and sensing security, as well as the UAV power and flight constraints. To address the non-convex nature of the optimization problem, we employ the alternating optimization (AO) strategy, jointly with the successive convex approximation (SCA) and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) methods. Numerical results validate the proposed approach, demonstrating its ability to achieve a high secrecy rate while meeting the required sensing and security constraints.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, submitted for possible publication.

| **[RRO: LLM Agent Optimization Through Rising Reward Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20737v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited extraordinary performance in a variety of tasks while it remains challenging for them to solve complex multi-step tasks as agents. In practice, agents sensitive to the outcome of certain key steps which makes them likely to fail the task because of a subtle mistake in the planning trajectory. Recent approaches resort to calibrating the reasoning process through reinforcement learning. They reward or penalize every reasoning step with process supervision, as known as Process Reward Models (PRMs). However, PRMs are difficult and costly to scale up with a large number of next action candidates since they require extensive computations to acquire the training data through the per-step trajectory exploration. To mitigate this issue, we focus on the relative reward trend across successive reasoning steps and propose maintaining an increasing reward in the collected trajectories for process supervision, which we term Reward Rising Optimization (RRO). Specifically, we incrementally augment the process supervision until identifying a step exhibiting positive reward differentials, i.e. rising rewards, relative to its preceding iteration. This method dynamically expands the search space for the next action candidates, efficiently capturing high-quality data. We provide mathematical groundings and empirical results on the WebShop and InterCode-SQL benchmarks, showing that our proposed RRO achieves superior performance while requiring much less exploration cost.</p></details> | preprint |
| **[Towards Human-Like Trajectory Prediction for Autonomous Driving: A Behavior-Centric Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21565v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting the trajectories of vehicles is crucial for the development of autonomous driving (AD) systems, particularly in complex and dynamic traffic environments. In this study, we introduce HiT (Human-like Trajectory Prediction), a novel model designed to enhance trajectory prediction by incorporating behavior-aware modules and dynamic centrality measures. Unlike traditional methods that primarily rely on static graph structures, HiT leverages a dynamic framework that accounts for both direct and indirect interactions among traffic participants. This allows the model to capture the subtle yet significant influences of surrounding vehicles, enabling more accurate and human-like predictions. To evaluate HiT's performance, we conducted extensive experiments using diverse and challenging real-world datasets, including NGSIM, HighD, RounD, ApolloScape, and MoCAD++. The results demonstrate that HiT consistently outperforms other top models across multiple metrics, particularly excelling in scenarios involving aggressive driving behaviors. This research presents a significant step forward in trajectory prediction, offering a more reliable and interpretable approach for enhancing the safety and efficiency of fully autonomous driving systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[ACT-R: Adaptive Camera Trajectories for Single View 3D Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08239v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the simple idea of adaptive view planning to multi-view synthesis, aiming to improve both occlusion revelation and 3D consistency for single-view 3D reconstruction. Instead of producing an unordered set of views independently or simultaneously, we generate a sequence of views, leveraging temporal consistency to enhance 3D coherence. More importantly, our view sequence is not determined by a pre-determined and fixed camera setup. Instead, we compute an adaptive camera trajectory (ACT), forming an orbit, which seeks to maximize the visibility of occluded regions of the 3D object to be reconstructed. Once the best orbit is found, we feed it to a video diffusion model to generate novel views around the orbit, which can then be passed to any multi-view 3D reconstruction model to obtain the final result. Our multi-view synthesis pipeline is quite efficient since it involves no run-time training/optimization, only forward inferences by applying pre-trained models for occlusion analysis and multi-view synthesis. Our method predicts camera trajectories that reveal occlusions effectively and produce consistent novel views, significantly improving 3D reconstruction over SOTA alternatives on the unseen GSO dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[OSVI-WM: One-Shot Visual Imitation for Unseen Tasks using World-Model-Guided Trajectory Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20425v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual imitation learning enables robotic agents to acquire skills by observing expert demonstration videos. In the one-shot setting, the agent generates a policy after observing a single expert demonstration without additional fine-tuning. Existing approaches typically train and evaluate on the same set of tasks, varying only object configurations, and struggle to generalize to unseen tasks with different semantic or structural requirements. While some recent methods attempt to address this, they exhibit low success rates on hard test tasks that, despite being visually similar to some training tasks, differ in context and require distinct responses. Additionally, most existing methods lack an explicit model of environment dynamics, limiting their ability to reason about future states. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework for one-shot visual imitation learning via world-model-guided trajectory generation. Given an expert demonstration video and the agent's initial observation, our method leverages a learned world model to predict a sequence of latent states and actions. This latent trajectory is then decoded into physical waypoints that guide the agent's execution. Our method is evaluated on two simulated benchmarks and three real-world robotic platforms, where it consistently outperforms prior approaches, with over 30% improvement in some cases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Training LLM-Based Agents with Synthetic Self-Reflected Trajectories and Partial Masking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20023v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous agents, which perceive environments and take actions to achieve goals, have become increasingly feasible with the advancements in large language models (LLMs). However, current powerful agents often depend on sophisticated prompt engineering combined with closed-source LLMs like GPT-4. Although training open-source LLMs using expert trajectories from teacher models has yielded some improvements in agent capabilities, this approach still faces limitations such as performance plateauing and error propagation. To mitigate these challenges, we propose STeP, a novel method for improving LLM-based agent training. We synthesize self-reflected trajectories that include reflections and corrections of error steps, which enhance the effectiveness of LLM agents in learning from teacher models, enabling them to become agents capable of self-reflecting and correcting. We also introduce partial masking strategy that prevents the LLM from internalizing incorrect or suboptimal steps. Experiments demonstrate that our method improves agent performance across three representative tasks: ALFWorld, WebShop, and SciWorld. For the open-source model LLaMA2-7B-Chat, when trained using self-reflected trajectories constructed with Qwen1.5-110B-Chat as the teacher model, it achieves comprehensive improvements with less training data compared to agents trained exclusively on expert trajectories.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deciphering Trajectory-Aided LLM Reasoning: An Optimization Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19815v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel framework for comprehending the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) through the perspective of meta-learning. By conceptualizing reasoning trajectories as pseudo-gradient descent updates to the LLM's parameters, we identify parallels between LLM reasoning and various meta-learning paradigms. We formalize the training process for reasoning tasks as a meta-learning setup, with each question treated as an individual task, and reasoning trajectories serving as the inner loop optimization for adapting model parameters. Once trained on a diverse set of questions, the LLM develops fundamental reasoning capabilities that can generalize to previously unseen questions. Extensive empirical evaluations substantiate the strong connection between LLM reasoning and meta-learning, exploring several issues of significant interest from a meta-learning standpoint. Our work not only enhances the understanding of LLM reasoning but also provides practical insights for improving these models through established meta-learning techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Flexible Forward Trajectories for Masked Molecular Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16790v2)** | 2025-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have achieved notable progress in modeling discrete data, while their potential in molecular generation remains underexplored. In this work, we explore their potential and introduce the surprising result that naively applying standards MDMs severely degrades the performance. We identify the critical cause of this issue as a state-clashing problem-where the forward diffusion of distinct molecules collapse into a common state, resulting in a mixture of reconstruction targets that cannot be learned using typical reverse diffusion process with unimodal predictions. To mitigate this, we propose Masked Element-wise Learnable Diffusion (MELD) that orchestrates per-element corruption trajectories to avoid collision between distinct molecular graphs. This is achieved through a parameterized noise scheduling network that assigns distinct corruption rates to individual graph elements, i.e., atoms and bonds. Extensive experiments on diverse molecular benchmarks reveal that MELD markedly enhances overall generation quality compared to element-agnostic noise scheduling, increasing the chemical validity of vanilla MDMs on ZINC250K from 15% to 93%, Furthermore, it achieves state-of-the-art property alignment in conditional generation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[SimpleDeepSearcher: Deep Information Seeking via Web-Powered Reasoning Trajectory Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16834v2)** | 2025-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems have advanced large language models (LLMs) in complex deep search scenarios requiring multi-step reasoning and iterative information retrieval. However, existing approaches face critical limitations that lack high-quality training trajectories or suffer from the distributional mismatches in simulated environments and prohibitive computational costs for real-world deployment. This paper introduces SimpleDeepSearcher, a lightweight yet effective framework that bridges this gap through strategic data engineering rather than complex training paradigms. Our approach synthesizes high-quality training data by simulating realistic user interactions in live web search environments, coupled with a multi-criteria curation strategy that optimizes the diversity and quality of input and output side. Experiments on five benchmarks across diverse domains demonstrate that SFT on only 871 curated samples yields significant improvements over RL-based baselines. Our work establishes SFT as a viable pathway by systematically addressing the data-scarce bottleneck, offering practical insights for efficient deep search systems.

| **[Echo Planning for Autonomous Driving: From Current Observations to Future Trajectories and Back](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18945v1)** | 2025-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern end-to-end autonomous driving systems suffer from a critical limitation: their planners lack mechanisms to enforce temporal consistency between predicted trajectories and evolving scene dynamics. This absence of self-supervision allows early prediction errors to compound catastrophically over time. We introduce Echo Planning, a novel self-correcting framework that establishes a closed-loop Current - Future - Current (CFC) cycle to harmonize trajectory prediction with scene coherence. Our key insight is that plausible future trajectories must be bi-directionally consistent, ie, not only generated from current observations but also capable of reconstructing them. The CFC mechanism first predicts future trajectories from the Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) scene representation, then inversely maps these trajectories back to estimate the current BEV state. By enforcing consistency between the original and reconstructed BEV representations through a cycle loss, the framework intrinsically penalizes physically implausible or misaligned trajectories. Experiments on nuScenes demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, reducing L2 error by 0.04 m and collision rate by 0.12% compared to one-shot planners. Crucially, our method requires no additional supervision, leveraging the CFC cycle as an inductive bias for robust planning. This work offers a deployable solution for safety-critical autonomous systems.</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Flow Matching for Geometric Trajectory Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18647v1)** | 2025-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The simulation of N-body systems is a fundamental problem with applications in a wide range of fields, such as molecular dynamics, biochemistry, and pedestrian dynamics. Machine learning has become an invaluable tool for scaling physics-based simulators and developing models directly from experimental data. In particular, recent advances based on deep generative modeling and geometric deep learning have enabled probabilistic simulation by modeling complex distributions over trajectories while respecting the permutation symmetry that is fundamental to N-body systems. However, to generate realistic trajectories, existing methods must learn complex transformations starting from uninformed noise and do not allow for the exploitation of domain-informed priors. In this work, we propose STFlow to address this limitation. By leveraging flow matching and data-dependent couplings, STFlow facilitates physics-informed simulation of geometric trajectories without sacrificing model expressivity or scalability. Our evaluation on N-body dynamical systems, molecular dynamics, and pedestrian dynamics benchmarks shows that STFlow produces significantly lower prediction errors while enabling more efficient inference, highlighting the benefits of employing physics-informed prior distributions in probabilistic geometric trajectory modeling.</p></details> | 20 pages, 17 figures |
| **[Optimization-Based Trajectory Planning for Tractor-Trailer Vehicles on Curvy Roads: A Progressively Increasing Sampling Number Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18590v1)** | 2025-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we propose an optimization-based trajectory planner for tractor-trailer vehicles on curvy roads. The lack of analytical expression for the trailer's errors to the center line pose a great challenge to the trajectory planning for tractor-trailer vehicles. To address this issue, we first use geometric representations to characterize the lateral and orientation errors in Cartesian frame, where the errors would serve as the components of the cost function and the road edge constraints within our optimization process. Next, we generate a coarse trajectory to warm-start the subsequent optimization problems. On the other hand, to achieve a good approximation of the continuous-time kinematics, optimization-based methods usually discretize the kinematics with a large sampling number. This leads to an increase in the number of the variables and constraints, thus making the optimization problem difficult to solve. To address this issue, we design a Progressively Increasing Sampling Number Optimization (PISNO) framework. More specifically, we first find a nearly feasible trajectory with a small sampling number to warm-start the optimization process. Then, the sampling number is progressively increased, and the corresponding intermediate Optimal Control Problem (OCP) is solved in each iteration. Next, we further resample the obtained solution into a finer sampling period, and then use it to warm-start the intermediate OCP in next iteration. This process is repeated until reaching a threshold sampling number. Simulation and experiment results show the proposed method exhibits a good performance and less computational consumption over the benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[What Do You Need for Diverse Trajectory Stitching in Diffusion Planning?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18083v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In planning, stitching is an ability of algorithms to piece together sub-trajectories of data they are trained on to generate new and diverse behaviours. While stitching is historically a strength of offline reinforcement learning, recent generative behavioural cloning (BC) methods have also shown proficiency at stitching. However, the main factors behind this are poorly understood, hindering the development of new algorithms that can reliably stitch. Focusing on diffusion planners trained via BC, we find two properties are needed to compose: \emph{positional equivariance} and \emph{local receptiveness}. We use these two properties to explain architecture, data, and inference choices in existing generative BC methods based on diffusion planning, including replanning frequency, data augmentation, and data scaling. Experimental comparisions show that (1) while locality is more important than positional equivariance in creating a diffusion planner capable of composition, both are crucial (2) enabling these properties through relatively simple architecture choices can be competitive with more computationally expensive methods such as replanning or scaling data, and (3) simple inpainting-based guidance can guide architecturally compositional models to enable generalization in goal-conditioned settings.</p></details> | 9 Pages |

At the upper tier, a lightweight behavior-cloning network consumes six-axis force/torque streams from dual wrist-mounted sensors and outputs whole-body planar velocity commands that capture the leader's applied forces. At the lower tier, a deep-reinforcement-learning policy, trained under randomized payloads (0-3 kg) and friction conditions in Isaac Gym and validated in MuJoCo and on a real Unitree G1, maps these high-level twists to stable, under-load joint trajectories. By decoupling intent interpretation (force -> velocity) from legged locomotion (velocity -> joints), our method combines intuitive responsiveness to human inputs with robust, load-adaptive walking. We collect training data without motion-capture or markers, only synchronized RGB video and F/T readings, employing SAM2 and WHAM to extract 3D human pose and velocity. In real-world trials, our humanoid achieves cooperative carry-and-move performance (completion time, trajectory deviation, velocity synchrony, and follower-force) on par with a blindfolded human-follower baseline. This work is the first to demonstrate learned haptic guidance fused with full-body legged control for fluid human-humanoid co-manipulation.

However, existing methods for trajectory retrieval face notable limitations, including inefficiencies in large-scale data, lack of support for condition-based queries, and reliance on trajectory similarity measures. To address the above challenges, we propose OmniTraj, a generalized and flexible omni-semantic trajectory retrieval framework that integrates four complementary modalities or semantics -- raw trajectories, topology, road segments, and regions -- into a unified system. Unlike traditional approaches that are limited to computing and processing trajectories as a single modality, OmniTraj designs dedicated encoders for each modality, which are embedded and fused into a shared representation space. This design enables OmniTraj to support accurate and flexible queries based on any individual modality or combination thereof, overcoming the rigidity of traditional similarity-based methods. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of OmniTraj in handling large-scale data, providing flexible, multi-modality queries, and supporting downstream tasks and applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a full paper by KDD'25 - Research Track</p></details> |
| **[Trajectory-Independent Flexibility Envelopes of Energy-Constrained Systems with State-Dependent Losses](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16396v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As non-dispatchable renewable power units become prominent in electric power grids, demand-side flexibility appears as a key element of future power systems' operation. Power and energy bounds are intuitive metrics to describe the flexibility of energy-constrained loads. However, to be used in operation, any power consumption trajectory fulfilling the power and energy bounds must necessarily fulfill the load's constraints. In this paper, we demonstrate that energy bounds defined as the minimum and maximum energy consumption potential of a load with state-dependent losses are Trajectory-Dependent (TD), i.e., for any energy value in the bounds a feasible power trajectory exists, but not all power trajectories enclosed in the energy envelopes satisfy the load's constraints. To guarantee the satisfaction of load constraints for all trajectories, we define Trajectory-Independent (TI) energy bounds. We present TI envelope formulations for individual loads, as well as physically coupled loads and assess the proposed formulations in a building heating system, a system with state-dependent losses. We find that using a TD envelope as energy bounds in operation may yield room temperature up to 3.8{\deg}C higher and 3.4{\deg}C lower than admissible. Overall, poorly insulated buildings observe a TI energy envelope that differs significantly from their TD envelope.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[Contrastive Learning-Enhanced Trajectory Matching for Small-Scale Dataset Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15267v2)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deploying machine learning models in resource-constrained environments, such as edge devices or rapid prototyping scenarios, increasingly demands distillation of large datasets into significantly smaller yet informative synthetic datasets. Current dataset distillation techniques, particularly Trajectory Matching methods, optimize synthetic data so that the model's training trajectory on synthetic samples mirrors that on real data. While demonstrating efficacy on medium-scale synthetic datasets, these methods fail to adequately preserve semantic richness under extreme sample scarcity. To address this limitation, we propose a novel dataset distillation method integrating contrastive learning during image synthesis. By explicitly maximizing instance-level feature discrimination, our approach produces more informative and diverse synthetic samples, even when dataset sizes are significantly constrained. Experimental results demonstrate that incorporating contrastive learning substantially enhances the performance of models trained on very small-scale synthetic datasets. This integration not only guides more effective feature representation but also significantly improves the visual fidelity of the synthesized images. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves notable performance improvements over existing distillation techniques, especially in scenarios with extremely limited synthetic data.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Toward Theoretical Insights into Diffusion Trajectory Distillation via Operator Merging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16024v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion trajectory distillation methods aim to accelerate sampling in diffusion models, which produce high-quality outputs but suffer from slow sampling speeds. These methods train a student model to approximate the multi-step denoising process of a pretrained teacher model in a single step, enabling one-shot generation. However, theoretical insights into the trade-off between different distillation strategies and generative quality remain limited, complicating their optimization and selection. In this work, we take a first step toward addressing this gap. Specifically, we reinterpret trajectory distillation as an operator merging problem in the linear regime, where each step of the teacher model is represented as a linear operator acting on noisy data. These operators admit a clear geometric interpretation as projections and rescalings corresponding to the noise schedule. During merging, signal shrinkage occurs as a convex combination of operators, arising from both discretization and limited optimization time of the student model. We propose a dynamic programming algorithm to compute the optimal merging strategy that maximally preserves signal fidelity. Additionally, we demonstrate the existence of a sharp phase transition in the optimal strategy, governed by data covariance structures. Our findings enhance the theoretical understanding of diffusion trajectory distillation and offer practical insights for improving distillation strategies.</p></details> | 31 pages, 19 figures |

To address these issues, we propose SwarmDiff, a hierarchical and scalable generative framework for swarm robots. We model the swarm's macroscopic state using Probability Density Functions (PDFs) and leverage conditional diffusion models to generate risk-aware macroscopic trajectory distributions, which then guide the generation of individual robot trajectories at the microscopic level. To ensure a balance between the swarm's optimal transportation and risk awareness, we integrate Wasserstein metrics and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR). Additionally, we introduce a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) to improve sampling efficiency and generation quality by capturing long-range dependencies. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate that SwarmDiff outperforms existing methods in computational efficiency, trajectory validity, and scalability, making it a reliable solution for swarm robotic trajectory planning.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Trajectory-Based Bayesian Approach to Multi-Objective Hyperparameter Optimization with Epoch-Aware Trade-Offs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15303v2)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training machine learning models inherently involves a resource-intensive and noisy iterative learning procedure that allows epoch-wise monitoring of the model performance. However, the insights gained from the iterative learning procedure typically remain underutilized in multi-objective hyperparameter optimization scenarios. Despite the limited research in this area, existing methods commonly identify the trade-offs only at the end of model training, overlooking the fact that trade-offs can emerge at earlier epochs in cases such as overfitting. To bridge this gap, we propose an enhanced multi-objective hyperparameter optimization problem that treats the number of training epochs as a decision variable, rather than merely an auxiliary parameter, to account for trade-offs at an earlier training stage. To solve this problem and accommodate its iterative learning, we then present a trajectory-based multi-objective Bayesian optimization algorithm characterized by two features: 1) a novel acquisition function that captures the improvement along the predictive trajectory of model performances over epochs for any hyperparameter setting and 2) a multi-objective early stopping mechanism that determines when to terminate the training to maximize epoch efficiency. Experiments on synthetic simulations and hyperparameter tuning benchmarks demonstrate that our algorithm can effectively identify the desirable trade-offs while improving tuning efficiency.</p></details> |  |

When system dynamics change unexpectedly, performance degrades until models are retrained on new data. We introduce Reflexive World Models (RWM), a dual control framework that uses world model predictions as implicit reference trajectories for rapid adaptation. Our method separates the control problem into long-term reward maximization through reinforcement learning and robust motor execution through rapid latent control. This dual architecture achieves significantly faster adaptation with low online computational cost compared to model-based RL baselines, while maintaining near-optimal performance. The approach combines the benefits of flexible policy learning through reinforcement learning with rapid error correction capabilities, providing a principled approach to maintaining performance in high-dimensional continuous control tasks under varying dynamics.</p></details> |  |

However, linear models' expressive power and bias for real-world trajectories have not been thoroughly analyzed. We present an in-depth empirical analysis of the trade-off between model complexity and fit error in modelling object trajectories. We analyze vehicle, cyclist, and pedestrian trajectories. Our methodology estimates observation noise and prior distributions over model parameters from several large-scale datasets. Incorporating these priors can then regularize prediction models. Our results show that linear models do represent real-world trajectories with high fidelity at very moderate model complexity. This suggests the feasibility of using linear trajectory models in future motion prediction systems with inherent mathematical advantages.</p></details> |  |

To better understand the behavior of this metric, we systematically evaluate KL divergence across a wide range of conditions using publicly available language models. Our analysis covers comparisons between pretraining checkpoints, fine-tuned and base models, and layers via the logit lens. We find that trajectories of language models, as measured by KL divergence, exhibit a spiral structure during pretraining and thread-like progressions across layers. Furthermore, we show that, in terms of diffusion exponents, model trajectories in the log-likelihood space are more constrained than those in weight space.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Bellman Residual Minimization: A Simple Value-Based Method for LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15311v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Policy-based methods currently dominate reinforcement learning (RL) pipelines for large language model (LLM) reasoning, leaving value-based approaches largely unexplored. We revisit the classical paradigm of Bellman Residual Minimization and introduce Trajectory Bellman Residual Minimization (TBRM), an algorithm that naturally adapts this idea to LLMs, yielding a simple yet effective off-policy algorithm that optimizes a single trajectory-level Bellman objective using the model's own logits as $Q$-values. TBRM removes the need for critics, importance-sampling ratios, or clipping, and operates with only one rollout per prompt. We prove convergence to the near-optimal KL-regularized policy from arbitrary off-policy data via an improved change-of-trajectory-measure analysis. Experiments on standard mathematical-reasoning benchmarks show that TBRM consistently outperforms policy-based baselines, like PPO and GRPO, with comparable or lower computational and memory overhead. Our results indicate that value-based RL might be a principled and efficient alternative for enhancing reasoning capabilities in LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reachable Sets-based Trajectory Planning Combining Reinforcement Learning and iLQR](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17398v2)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The driving risk field is applicable to more complex driving scenarios, providing new approaches for safety decision-making and active vehicle control in intricate environments. However, existing research often overlooks the driving risk field and fails to consider the impact of risk distribution within drivable areas on trajectory planning, which poses challenges for enhancing safety. This paper proposes a trajectory planning method for intelligent vehicles based on the risk reachable set to further improve the safety of trajectory planning. First, we construct the reachable set incorporating the driving risk field to more accurately assess and avoid potential risks in drivable areas. Then, the initial trajectory is generated based on safe reinforcement learning and projected onto the reachable set. Finally, we introduce a trajectory planning method based on a constrained iterative quadratic regulator to optimize the initial solution, ensuring that the planned trajectory achieves optimal comfort, safety, and efficiency. We conduct simulation tests of trajectory planning in high-speed lane-changing scenarios. The results indicate that the proposed method can guarantee trajectory comfort and driving efficiency, with the generated trajectory situated outside high-risk boundaries, thereby ensuring vehicle safety during operation.</p></details> | <details><summary>We si...</summary><p>We sincerely request the withdrawal of this paper.

While many studies address either full-body pose prediction or motion trajectory prediction, only a few attempt to merge them. We propose a motion transformation technique to simultaneously predict full-body pose and trajectory key-points in a global coordinate frame. We utilize an off-the-shelf 3D human pose estimation module, a graph attention network to encode the skeleton structure, and a compact, non-autoregressive transformer suitable for real-time motion prediction for human-robot interaction and human-aware navigation. We introduce a human navigation dataset ``DARKO'' with specific focus on navigational activities that are relevant for human-aware mobile robot navigation. We perform extensive evaluation on Human3.6M, CMU-Mocap, and our DARKO dataset. In comparison to prior work, we show that our approach is compact, real-time, and accurate in predicting human navigation motion across all datasets.

| **[Learning Spatio-Temporal Dynamics for Trajectory Recovery via Time-Aware Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13857v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In real-world applications, GPS trajectories often suffer from low sampling rates, with large and irregular intervals between consecutive GPS points. This sparse characteristic presents challenges for their direct use in GPS-based systems. This paper addresses the task of map-constrained trajectory recovery, aiming to enhance trajectory sampling rates of GPS trajectories. Previous studies commonly adopt a sequence-to-sequence framework, where an encoder captures the trajectory patterns and a decoder reconstructs the target trajectory. Within this framework, effectively representing the road network and extracting relevant trajectory features are crucial for overall performance. Despite advancements in these models, they fail to fully leverage the complex spatio-temporal dynamics present in both the trajectory and the road network. To overcome these limitations, we categorize the spatio-temporal dynamics of trajectory data into two distinct aspects: spatial-temporal traffic dynamics and trajectory dynamics. Furthermore, We propose TedTrajRec, a novel method for trajectory recovery. To capture spatio-temporal traffic dynamics, we introduce PD-GNN, which models periodic patterns and learns topologically aware dynamics concurrently for each road segment. For spatio-temporal trajectory dynamics, we present TedFormer, a time-aware Transformer that incorporates temporal dynamics for each GPS location by integrating closed-form neural ordinary differential equations into the attention mechanism. This allows TedFormer to effectively handle irregularly sampled data. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of TedTrajRec. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/ysygMhdxw/TEDTrajRec/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a journal paper in IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems (T-ITS)</p></details> |
| **[HyperNet Fields: Efficiently Training Hypernetworks without Ground Truth by Learning Weight Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17040v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To efficiently adapt large models or to train generative models of neural representations, Hypernetworks have drawn interest. While hypernetworks work well, training them is cumbersome, and often requires ground truth optimized weights for each sample. However, obtaining each of these weights is a training problem of its own-one needs to train, e.g., adaptation weights or even an entire neural field for hypernetworks to regress to. In this work, we propose a method to train hypernetworks, without the need for any per-sample ground truth. Our key idea is to learn a Hypernetwork `Field` and estimate the entire trajectory of network weight training instead of simply its converged state. In other words, we introduce an additional input to the Hypernetwork, the convergence state, which then makes it act as a neural field that models the entire convergence pathway of a task network. A critical benefit in doing so is that the gradient of the estimated weights at any convergence state must then match the gradients of the original task -- this constraint alone is sufficient to train the Hypernetwork Field. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through the task of personalized image generation and 3D shape reconstruction from images and point clouds, demonstrating competitive results without any per-sample ground truth.</p></details> |  |

We first extract dense optical flow from a reference video, and utilize the resulting motion offsets to warp the complex-exponential tensors of RoPE, effectively encoding motion into the generation process. These embeddings are then further optimized during denoising time steps via trajectory alignment between the predicted and target velocities using a flow-matching objective. To keep the output faithful to the text prompt and prevent duplicate generations, we incorporate a regularization term based on the phase components of the reference video's Fourier transform, projecting the phase angles onto a smooth manifold to suppress high-frequency artifacts. Experiments on benchmarks reveal that RoPECraft outperforms all recently published methods, both qualitatively and quantitatively.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://berkegokmen1.github.io/RoPECraft/</p></details> |

DreamGen leverages state-of-the-art image-to-video generative models, adapting them to the target robot embodiment to produce photorealistic synthetic videos of familiar or novel tasks in diverse environments. Since these models generate only videos, we recover pseudo-action sequences using either a latent action model or an inverse-dynamics model (IDM). Despite its simplicity, DreamGen unlocks strong behavior and environment generalization: a humanoid robot can perform 22 new behaviors in both seen and unseen environments, while requiring teleoperation data from only a single pick-and-place task in one environment. To evaluate the pipeline systematically, we introduce DreamGen Bench, a video generation benchmark that shows a strong correlation between benchmark performance and downstream policy success.

| **[TransferTraj: A Vehicle Trajectory Learning Model for Region and Task Transferability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12672v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vehicle GPS trajectories provide valuable movement information that supports various downstream tasks and applications. A desirable trajectory learning model should be able to transfer across regions and tasks without retraining, avoiding the need to maintain multiple specialized models and subpar performance with limited training data. However, each region has its unique spatial features and contexts, which are reflected in vehicle movement patterns and difficult to generalize. Additionally, transferring across different tasks faces technical challenges due to the varying input-output structures required for each task. Existing efforts towards transferability primarily involve learning embedding vectors for trajectories, which perform poorly in region transfer and require retraining of prediction modules for task transfer. To address these challenges, we propose TransferTraj, a vehicle GPS trajectory learning model that excels in both region and task transferability. For region transferability, we introduce RTTE as the main learnable module within TransferTraj. It integrates spatial, temporal, POI, and road network modalities of trajectories to effectively manage variations in spatial context distribution across regions. It also introduces a TRIE module for incorporating relative information of spatial features and a spatial context MoE module for handling movement patterns in diverse contexts. For task transferability, we propose a task-transferable input-output scheme that unifies the input-output structure of different tasks into the masking and recovery of modalities and trajectory points. This approach allows TransferTraj to be pre-trained once and transferred to different tasks without retraining. Extensive experiments on three real-world vehicle trajectory datasets under task transfer, zero-shot, and few-shot region transfer, validating TransferTraj's effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

The proposed planner integrates real-time trajectory optimization with adaptive gap analysis, enabling effective feasibility assessment under partial observability constraints. To address safety-critical computations in unknown scenarios, an enhanced online learning mechanism is introduced, which dynamically corrects spatial trajectories by forming dynamic safety margins while maintaining control invariance. Extensive evaluations, including ablation studies and comparisons with state-of-the-art algorithms, demonstrate superior success rates and computational efficiency.

| **[Revisiting Synthetic Human Trajectories: Imitative Generation and Benchmarks Beyond Datasaurus](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13790v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human trajectory data, which plays a crucial role in various applications such as crowd management and epidemic prevention, is challenging to obtain due to practical constraints and privacy concerns. In this context, synthetic human trajectory data is generated to simulate as close as possible to real-world human trajectories, often under summary statistics and distributional similarities. However, these similarities oversimplify complex human mobility patterns (a.k.a. ``Datasaurus''), resulting in intrinsic biases in both generative model design and benchmarks of the generated trajectories. Against this background, we propose MIRAGE, a huMan-Imitative tRAjectory GenErative model designed as a neural Temporal Point Process integrating an Exploration and Preferential Return model. It imitates the human decision-making process in trajectory generation, rather than fitting any specific statistical distributions as traditional methods do, thus avoiding the Datasaurus issue. We also propose a comprehensive task-based evaluation protocol beyond Datasaurus to systematically benchmark trajectory generative models on four typical downstream tasks, integrating multiple techniques and evaluation metrics for each task, to assess the ultimate utility of the generated trajectories. We conduct a thorough evaluation of MIRAGE on three real-world user trajectory datasets against a sizeable collection of baselines. Results show that compared to the best baselines, MIRAGE-generated trajectory data not only achieves the best statistical and distributional similarities with 59.0-67.7% improvement, but also yields the best performance in the task-based evaluation with 10.9-33.4% improvement. A series of ablation studies also validate the key design choices of MIRAGE.</p></details> | Accepted by KDD'25 |
| **[Massive-STEPS: Massive Semantic Trajectories for Understanding POI Check-ins -- Dataset and Benchmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11239v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding human mobility through Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation is increasingly important for applications such as urban planning, personalized services, and generative agent simulation. However, progress in this field is hindered by two key challenges: the over-reliance on older datasets from 2012-2013 and the lack of reproducible, city-level check-in datasets that reflect diverse global regions. To address these gaps, we present Massive-STEPS (Massive Semantic Trajectories for Understanding POI Check-ins), a large-scale, publicly available benchmark dataset built upon the Semantic Trails dataset and enriched with semantic POI metadata. Massive-STEPS spans 12 geographically and culturally diverse cities and features more recent (2017-2018) and longer-duration (24 months) check-in data than prior datasets. We benchmarked a wide range of POI recommendation models on Massive-STEPS using both supervised and zero-shot approaches, and evaluated their performance across multiple urban contexts. By releasing Massive-STEPS, we aim to facilitate reproducible and equitable research in human mobility and POI recommendation. The dataset and benchmarking code are available at: https://github.com/cruiseresearchgroup/Massive-STEPS</p></details> |  |

Operating in such settings presents many challenges -- most notably, because the agent cannot predict the ground-truth future paths of obstacles, a previously planned trajectory can become unsafe at any moment, requiring rapid replanning to avoid collisions. Recently developed planners have used soft-constraint approaches to achieve the necessary fast computation times; however, these methods do not guarantee collision-free paths even with static obstacles. In contrast, hard-constraint methods ensure collision-free safety, but typically have longer computation times. To address these issues, we propose three key contributions. First, the DYNUS Global Planner (DGP) and Temporal Safe Corridor Generation operate in spatio-temporal space and handle both static and dynamic obstacles in the 3D environment. Second, the Safe Planning Framework leverages a combination of exploratory, safe, and contingency trajectories to flexibly re-route when potential future collisions with dynamic obstacles are detected. Finally, the Fast Hard-Constraint Local Trajectory Formulation uses a variable elimination approach to reduce the problem size and enable faster computation by pre-computing dependencies between free and dependent variables while still ensuring collision-free trajectories. We evaluated DYNUS in a variety of simulations, including dense forests, confined office spaces, cave systems, and dynamic environments. Our experiments show that DYNUS achieves a success rate of 100% and travel times that are approximately 25.0% faster than state-of-the-art methods. We also evaluated DYNUS on multiple platforms -- a quadrotor, a wheeled robot, and a quadruped -- in both simulation and hardware experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 30 figures, Under review at IEEE Transactions on Robotics</p></details> |
| **[Timely Trajectory Reconstruction in Finite Buffer Remote Tracking Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00849v2)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote tracking systems play a critical role in applications such as IoT, monitoring, surveillance and healthcare. In such systems, maintaining both real-time state awareness (for online decision making) and accurate reconstruction of historical trajectories (for offline post-processing) are essential. While the Age of Information (AoI) metric has been extensively studied as a measure of freshness, it does not capture the accuracy with which past trajectories can be reconstructed. In this work, we investigate reconstruction error as a complementary metric to AoI, addressing the trade-off between timely updates and historical accuracy. Specifically, we consider three policies, each prioritizing different aspects of information management: Keep-Old, Keep-Fresh, and our proposed Inter-arrival-Aware dropping policy. We compare these policies in terms of impact on both AoI and reconstruction error in a remote tracking system with a finite buffer. Through theoretical analysis and numerical simulations of queueing behavior, we demonstrate that while the Keep-Fresh policy minimizes AoI, it does not necessarily minimize reconstruction error. In contrast, our proposed Inter-arrival-Aware dropping policy dynamically adjusts packet retention decisions based on generation times, achieving a balance between AoI and reconstruction error. Our results provide key insights into the design of efficient buffer management policies for resource-constrained IoT networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimizing Interplanetary Trajectories using Hybrid Meta-heuristic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12399v1)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes an advanced hybrid optimization (GMPA) algorithm to effectively address the inherent limitations of the Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) when applied to complex optimization scenarios. Specifically, GMPA integrates essential features from the Marine Predators Algorithm (MPA) into the GWO framework, enabling superior performance through enhanced exploration and exploitation balance. The evaluation utilizes the GTOPX benchmark dataset from the European Space Agency (ESA), encompassing highly complex interplanetary trajectory optimization problems characterized by pronounced nonlinearity and multiple conflicting objectives reflective of real-world aerospace scenarios. Central to GMPA's methodology is an elite matrix, borrowed from MPA, designed to preserve and refine high-quality solutions iteratively, thereby promoting solution diversity and minimizing premature convergence. Furthermore, GMPA incorporates a three-phase position updating mechanism combined with L\'evy flights and Brownian motion to significantly bolster exploration capabilities, effectively mitigating the risk of stagnation in local optima. GMPA dynamically retains historical information on promising search areas, leveraging the memory storage features intrinsic to MPA, facilitating targeted exploitation and refinement. Empirical evaluations demonstrate GMPA's superior effectiveness compared to traditional GWO and other advanced metaheuristic algorithms, achieving markedly improved convergence rates and solution quality across GTOPX benchmarks. Consequently, GMPA emerges as a robust, efficient, and adaptive optimization approach particularly suitable for high-dimensional and complex aerospace trajectory optimization, offering significant insights and practical advancements in hybrid metaheuristic optimization techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory-Integrated Accessibility Analysis of Public Electric Vehicle Charging Stations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12145v1)** | 2025-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure is crucial for advancing EV adoption, managing charging loads, and ensuring equitable transportation electrification. However, there remains a notable gap in comprehensive accessibility metrics that integrate the mobility of the users. This study introduces a novel accessibility metric, termed Trajectory-Integrated Public EVCS Accessibility (TI-acs), and uses it to assess public electric vehicle charging station (EVCS) accessibility for approximately 6 million residents in the San Francisco Bay Area based on detailed individual trajectory data in one week. Unlike conventional home-based metrics, TI-acs incorporates the accessibility of EVCS along individuals' travel trajectories, bringing insights on more public charging contexts, including public charging near workplaces and charging during grid off-peak periods. As of June 2024, given the current public EVCS network, Bay Area residents have, on average, 7.5 hours and 5.2 hours of access per day during which their stay locations are within 1 km (i.e. 10-12 min walking) of a public L2 and DCFC charging port, respectively. Over the past decade, TI-acs has steadily increased from the rapid expansion of the EV market and charging infrastructure. However, spatial disparities remain significant, as reflected in Gini indices of 0.38 (L2) and 0.44 (DCFC) across census tracts. Additionally, our analysis reveals racial disparities in TI-acs, driven not only by variations in charging infrastructure near residential areas but also by differences in their mobility patterns.</p></details> | 19 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Knowledge-Informed Multi-Agent Trajectory Prediction at Signalized Intersections for Infrastructure-to-Everything](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13461v2)** | 2025-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent trajectory prediction at signalized intersections is crucial for developing efficient intelligent transportation systems and safe autonomous driving systems. Due to the complexity of intersection scenarios and the limitations of single-vehicle perception, the performance of vehicle-centric prediction methods has reached a plateau. In this paper, we introduce an Infrastructure-to-Everything (I2X) collaborative prediction scheme. In this scheme, roadside units (RSUs) independently forecast the future trajectories of all vehicles and transmit these predictions unidirectionally to subscribing vehicles. Building on this scheme, we propose I2XTraj, a dedicated infrastructure-based trajectory prediction model. I2XTraj leverages real-time traffic signal states, prior maneuver strategy knowledge, and multi-agent interactions to generate accurate, joint multi-modal trajectory prediction. First, a continuous signal-informed mechanism is proposed to adaptively process real-time traffic signals to guide trajectory proposal generation under varied intersection configurations. Second, a driving strategy awareness mechanism estimates the joint distribution of maneuver strategies by integrating spatial priors of intersection areas with dynamic vehicle states, enabling coverage of the full set of feasible maneuvers. Third, a spatial-temporal-mode attention network models multi-agent interactions to refine and adjust joint trajectory outputs.Finally, I2XTraj is evaluated on two real-world datasets of signalized intersections, the V2X-Seq and the SinD drone dataset. In both single-infrastructure and online collaborative scenarios, our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods by over 30\% on V2X-Seq and 15\% on SinD, demonstrating strong generalizability and robustness.</p></details> |  |

While robotic manipulators offer high precision, versatility, and productivity, they exhibit expressionless and monotonous motions that conceal the robot's intention, resulting in a lack of efficiency and transparency with humans. In this work, we use Laban notation, a dance annotation language, to enable robotic manipulators to generate trajectories with functional expressivity, where the robot uses nonverbal cues to communicate its abilities and the likelihood of succeeding at its task. We achieve this by introducing two novel variants of Hesitant expressive motion (Spoke-Like and Arc-Like). We also enhance the emotional expressivity of four existing emotive trajectories (Happy, Sad, Shy, and Angry) by augmenting Laban Effort usage with Laban Shape. The functionally expressive motions are validated via a human-subjects study, where participants equate both variants of Hesitant motion with reduced robot competency. The enhanced emotive trajectories are shown to be viewed as distinct emotions using the Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) spectrum, corroborating the usage of Laban Shape.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review for the 2025 IEEE RO-MAN Conference</p></details> |

The algorithm estimates Markov parameters from a single trajectory and applies a variant of the Ho-Kalman algorithm to recover the system matrices.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first finite-sample bound for this algorithm in the single-trajectory setting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Active RLHF via Best Policy Learning from Trajectory Preference Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18873v2)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address the problem of best policy identification in preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL), where learning occurs from noisy binary preferences over trajectory pairs rather than explicit numerical rewards. This approach is useful for post-training optimization of generative AI models during multi-turn user interactions, where preference feedback is more robust than handcrafted reward models. In this setting, learning is driven by both an offline preference dataset -- collected from a rater of unknown `competence' -- and online data collected with pure exploration. Since offline datasets may exhibit out-of-distribution (OOD) biases, principled online data collection is necessary. To address this, we propose Posterior Sampling for Preference Learning ($\mathsf{PSPL}$), a novel algorithm inspired by Top-Two Thompson Sampling, that maintains independent posteriors over the true reward model and transition dynamics. We provide the first theoretical guarantees for PbRL in this setting, establishing an upper bound on the simple Bayesian regret of $\mathsf{PSPL}$. Since the exact algorithm can be computationally impractical, we also provide an approximate version that outperforms existing baselines.</p></details> |  |

Such environments contain rich features like crosswalks, grass, and curbs, which are easily interpretable by humans, but not by mobile robots. We aim to compute suitable trajectories that (1) satisfy the environment-specific traversability constraints and (2) generate human-like paths while navigating on crosswalks, sidewalks, etc. Our formulation uses a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) generative model enhanced with traversability constraints to generate multiple candidate trajectories for global navigation. We develop a visual prompting approach and leverage the Visual Language Model's (VLM) zero-shot ability of semantic understanding and logical reasoning to choose the best trajectory given the contextual information about the task. We evaluate our method in various outdoor scenes with wheeled robots and compare the performance with other global navigation algorithms. In practice, we observe an average improvement of 20.81% in satisfying traversability constraints and 28.51% in terms of human-like navigation in four different outdoor navigation scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scalar embedding of temporal network trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02715v2)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A temporal network -- a collection of snapshots recording the evolution of a network whose links appear and disappear dynamically -- can be interpreted as a trajectory in graph space. In order to characterize the complex dynamics of such trajectory via the tools of time series analysis and signal processing, it is sensible to preprocess the trajectory by embedding it in a low-dimensional Euclidean space. Here we argue that, rather than the topological structure of each network snapshot, the main property of the trajectory that needs to be preserved in the embedding is the relative graph distance between snapshots. This idea naturally leads to dimensionality reduction approaches that explicitly consider relative distances, such as Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) or identifying the distance matrix as a feature matrix in which to perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA). This paper provides a comprehensible methodology that illustrates this approach. Its application to a suite of generative network trajectory models and empirical data certify that nontrivial dynamical properties of the network trajectories are preserved already in their scalar embeddings, what enables the possibility of performing time series analysis in temporal networks.</p></details> | 26 pages, 16 figures |

When motors saturate in quadrotor systems, there is an ``uncontrolled drift" of the vehicle that results in a crash. To tackle saturation, we apply a control decomposition and learn a tracking penalty from simulation data consisting of low, medium and high-cost reference trajectories. Our approach reduces crash rates by around $49\%$ compared to baselines on aggressive maneuvers in simulation. On the Crazyflie hardware platform, we demonstrate feasibility through experiments that lead to successful flights. Motivated by the growing interest in data-driven methods to quadrotor planning, we provide open-source lightweight code with an easy-to-use abstraction of hardware platforms.</p></details> | 4 pages, 4 figures |

Our method partitions the workspace, assigns fruit-picking sequences to arms, determines tight and feasible fruit-picking schedules and vehicle travel speed, and generates smooth, collision-free arm trajectories. The fruit-picking throughput achieved by the algorithm was assessed using synthetically generated fruit coordinates and a harvester design featuring up to 12 arms. The throughput increased monotonically as more arms were added. Adding more arms when fruit densities were low resulted in diminishing gains because it took longer to travel from one fruit to another. However, when there were enough fruits, the proposed algorithm achieved a linear speedup as the number of arms increased.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work will be submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Existing methods often struggle with longitudinal dependencies and structural consistency in progressive disorders. To address these limitations, we introduce MambaControl, a novel framework that integrates selective state-space modelling with diffusion processes for high-fidelity prediction of medical image trajectories. To better capture subtle structural changes over time while maintaining anatomical consistency, MambaControl combines Mamba-based long-range modelling with graph-guided anatomical control to more effectively represent anatomical correlations. Furthermore, we introduce Fourier-enhanced spectral graph representations to capture spatial coherence and multiscale detail, enabling MambaControl to achieve state-of-the-art performance in Alzheimer's disease prediction. Quantitative and regional evaluations demonstrate improved progression prediction quality and anatomical fidelity, highlighting its potential for personalised prognosis and clinical decision support.</p></details> |  |

Quantum-Train (QT), a hybrid quantum-classical framework that leverages quantum neural networks (QNNs) to generate trainable parameters exclusively during training, eliminating the need for quantum hardware at inference time. Building on QT's success across multiple domains, including image classification, reinforcement learning, flood prediction, and large language model (LLM) fine-tuning, we introduce Quantum Parameter Adaptation (QPA) for efficient typhoon forecasting model learning. Integrated with an Attention-based Multi-ConvGRU model, QPA enables parameter-efficient training while maintaining predictive accuracy. This work represents the first application of quantum machine learning (QML) to large-scale typhoon trajectory prediction, offering a scalable and energy-efficient approach to climate modeling. Our results demonstrate that QPA significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters while preserving performance, making high-performance forecasting more accessible and sustainable through hybrid quantum-classical learning.</p></details> |  |

While modern Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models can handle diverse robotic tasks, they often incur high per-step inference costs, resulting in significant latency, sometimes minutes per task. In contrast, RT-cache stores a large-scale Memory of previously successful robot trajectories and retrieves relevant multistep motion snippets, drastically reducing inference overhead. By integrating a Memory Builder with a Trajectory Retrieval, we develop an efficient retrieval process that remains tractable even for extremely large datasets. RT-cache flexibly accumulates real-world experiences and replays them whenever the current scene matches past states, adapting quickly to new or unseen environments with only a few additional samples. Experiments on the Open-X Embodiment Dataset and other real-world data demonstrate that RT-cache completes tasks both faster and more successfully than a baseline lacking retrieval, suggesting a practical, data-driven solution for real-time manipulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures.

| **[DiffOG: Differentiable Policy Trajectory Optimization with Generalizability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13807v3)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imitation learning-based visuomotor policies excel at manipulation tasks but often produce suboptimal action trajectories compared to model-based methods. Directly mapping camera data to actions via neural networks can result in jerky motions and difficulties in meeting critical constraints, compromising safety and robustness in real-world deployment. For tasks that require high robustness or strict adherence to constraints, ensuring trajectory quality is crucial. However, the lack of interpretability in neural networks makes it challenging to generate constraint-compliant actions in a controlled manner. This paper introduces differentiable policy trajectory optimization with generalizability (DiffOG), a learning-based trajectory optimization framework designed to enhance visuomotor policies. By leveraging the proposed differentiable formulation of trajectory optimization with transformer, DiffOG seamlessly integrates policies with a generalizable optimization layer. DiffOG refines action trajectories to be smoother and more constraint-compliant while maintaining alignment with the original demonstration distribution, thus avoiding degradation in policy performance. We evaluated DiffOG across 11 simulated tasks and 2 real-world tasks. The results demonstrate that DiffOG significantly enhances the trajectory quality of visuomotor policies while having minimal impact on policy performance, outperforming trajectory processing baselines such as greedy constraint clipping and penalty-based trajectory optimization. Furthermore, DiffOG achieves superior performance compared to existing constrained visuomotor policy.

The key idea is to capture each task by an object-centric representation, specifically the SE(3) object pose trajectory relative to the target. This approach decouples embodiment actions from sensory inputs, facilitating learning from various demonstration types, including both action-based and action-less human hand demonstrations, as well as cross-embodiment generalization. Additionally, object pose trajectories inherently capture planning constraints from demonstrations without the need for manually-crafted rules. To guide the robot in executing the task, the object trajectory is used to condition a diffusion policy. We systematically evaluate our method on simulation and real-world tasks. In real-world evaluation, using only eight demonstrations shot on an iPhone, our approach completed all tasks while fully complying with task constraints.

However, due to localization errors/uncertainties, trajectory deconfliction can fail even if trajectories are perfectly shared between agents. To address this issue, we first present PARM and PARM*, perception-aware, decentralized, asynchronous multiagent trajectory planners that enable a team of agents to navigate uncertain environments while deconflicting trajectories and avoiding obstacles using perception information. PARM* differs from PARM as it is less conservative, using more computation to find closer-to-optimal solutions. While these methods achieve state-of-the-art performance, they suffer from high computational costs as they need to solve large optimization problems onboard, making it difficult for agents to replan at high rates. To overcome this challenge, we present our second key contribution, PRIMER, a learning-based planner trained with imitation learning (IL) using PARM* as the expert demonstrator. PRIMER leverages the low computational requirements at deployment of neural networks and achieves a computation speed up to 5500 times faster than optimization-based approaches.</p></details> | 7 pages, 3 figures |

However, existing methods often struggle to accurately capture this intricate structure from Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) data, particularly due to the lack of ground truth labels and the ambiguous, intertwined nature of fiber trajectories. We present a novel deep learning framework for unsupervised clustering of myocardial fibers, providing a data-driven approach to identifying distinct fiber bundles. We uniquely combine a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory network to capture local sequential information along fibers, with a Transformer autoencoder to learn global shape features, with pointwise incorporation of essential anatomical context. Clustering these representations using a density-based algorithm identifies 33 to 62 robust clusters, successfully capturing the subtle distinctions in fiber trajectories with varying levels of granularity. Our framework offers a new, flexible, and quantitative way to analyze myocardial structure, achieving a level of delineation that, to our knowledge, has not been previously achieved, with potential applications in improving surgical planning, characterizing disease-related remodeling, and ultimately, advancing personalized cardiac care.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures.

| **[Optimal Trajectory Planning with Collision Avoidance for Autonomous Vehicle Maneuvering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08724v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To perform autonomous driving maneuvers, such as parallel or perpendicular parking, a vehicle requires continual speed and steering adjustments to follow a generated path. In consequence, the path's quality is a limiting factor of the vehicle maneuver's performance. While most path planning approaches include finding a collision-free route, optimal trajectory planning involves solving the best transition from initial to final states, minimizing the action over all paths permitted by a kinematic model. Here we propose a novel method based on sequential convex optimization, which permits flexible and efficient optimal trajectory generation. The objective is to achieve the fastest time, shortest distance, and fewest number of path segments to satisfy motion requirements, while avoiding sensor blind-spots. In our approach, vehicle kinematics are represented by a discretized Dubins model. To avoid collisions, each waypoint is constrained by linear inequalities representing closest distance of obstacles to a polygon specifying the vehicle's extent. To promote smooth and valid trajectories, the solved kinematic state and control variables are constrained and regularized by penalty terms in the model's cost function, which enforces physical restrictions including limits for steering angle, acceleration and speed. In this paper, we analyze trajectories obtained for several parking scenarios. Results demonstrate efficient and collision-free motion generated by the proposed technique.</p></details> | <details><summary>SIAM ...</summary><p>SIAM Conference on Control and Its Applications, July 28-30th, 2025, Montreal, Canada</p></details> |

This paper presents a distributed trajectory planning algorithm for a quadrotor swarm that operates asynchronously and requires no communication except during the initial planning phase. Moreover, our algorithm guarantees no deadlock under asynchronous updates and absence of communication during flight. To effectively ensure these points, we build two main modules: coordination state updater and trajectory optimizer. The coordination state updater computes waypoints for each agent toward its goal and performs subgoal optimization while considering deadlocks, as well as safety constraints with respect to neighbor agents and obstacles. Then, the trajectory optimizer generates a trajectory that ensures collision avoidance even with the asynchronous planning updates of neighboring agents. We provide a theoretical guarantee of collision avoidance with deadlock resolution and evaluate the effectiveness of our method in complex simulation environments, including random forests and narrow-gap mazes. Additionally, to reduce the total mission time, we design a faster coordination state update using lightweight communication. Lastly, our approach is validated through extensive simulations and real-world experiments with cluttered environment scenarios.</p></details> | 13 pages, 11 figures |

However, a key challenge in such approaches lies in selecting an appropriate masking strategy. Previous studies have explored predefined masking techniques, including random and tube-based masking, as well as approaches that leverage key motion priors, optical flow and semantic cues from externally pre-trained models. In this work, we introduce a novel and generalizable Trajectory-Aware Adaptive Token Sampler (TATS), which models the motion dynamics of tokens and can be seamlessly integrated into the masked autoencoder (MAE) framework to select motion-centric tokens in videos. Additionally, we propose a unified training strategy that enables joint optimization of both MAE and TATS from scratch using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). We show that our model allows for aggressive masking without compromising performance on the downstream task of action recognition while also ensuring that the pre-training remains memory efficient. Extensive experiments of the proposed approach across four benchmarks, including Something-Something v2, Kinetics-400, UCF101, and HMDB51, demonstrate the effectiveness, transferability, generalization, and efficiency of our work compared to other state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Leveraging the spatial information encoded in 3DGS, this work proposes FOCI (Field Overlap Collision Integral), an algorithm that is able to optimize trajectories directly on the Gaussians themselves. FOCI leverages a novel and interpretable collision formulation for 3DGS using the notion of the overlap integral between Gaussians. Contrary to other approaches, which represent the robot with conservative bounding boxes that underestimate the traversability of the environment, we propose to represent the environment and the robot as Gaussian Splats. This not only has desirable computational properties, but also allows for orientation-aware planning, allowing the robot to pass through very tight and narrow spaces. We extensively test our algorithm in both synthetic and real Gaussian Splats, showcasing that collision-free trajectories for the ANYmal legged robot that can be computed in a few seconds, even with hundreds of thousands of Gaussians making up the environment.

| **[UVTM: Universal Vehicle Trajectory Modeling with ST Feature Domain Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07232v4)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vehicle movement is frequently captured in the form of GPS trajectories, i.e., sequences of timestamped GPS locations. Such data is widely used for various tasks such as travel-time estimation, trajectory recovery, and trajectory prediction. A universal vehicle trajectory model could be applied to different tasks, removing the need to maintain multiple specialized models, thereby reducing computational and storage costs. However, creating such a model is challenging when the integrity of trajectory features is compromised, i.e., in scenarios where only partial features are available or the trajectories are sparse. To address these challenges, we propose the Universal Vehicle Trajectory Model (UVTM), which can effectively adapt to different tasks without excessive retraining. UVTM incorporates two specialized designs. First, it divides trajectory features into three distinct domains. Each domain can be masked and generated independently to accommodate tasks with only partially available features. Second, UVTM is pre-trained by reconstructing dense, feature-complete trajectories from sparse, feature-incomplete counterparts, enabling strong performance even when the integrity of trajectory features is compromised. Experiments involving four representative trajectory-related tasks on three real-world vehicle trajectory datasets provide insight into the performance of UVTM and offer evidence that it is capable of meeting its objectives.</p></details> |  |

This study proposes a novel graph-based approach for floor separation using Wi-Fi fingerprint trajectories, addressing the challenge of vertical localization in indoor settings. We construct a graph where nodes represent Wi-Fi fingerprints, and edges are weighted by signal similarity and contextual transitions. Node2Vec is employed to generate low-dimensional embeddings, which are subsequently clustered using K-means to identify distinct floors. Evaluated on the Huawei University Challenge 2021 dataset, our method outperforms traditional community detection algorithms, achieving an accuracy of 68.97%, an F1- score of 61.99%, and an Adjusted Rand Index of 57.19%. By publicly releasing the preprocessed dataset and implementation code, this work contributes to advancing research in indoor positioning. The proposed approach demonstrates robustness to signal noise and architectural complexities, offering a scalable solution for floor-level localization.</p></details> |  |

Previous works have successfully applied these in the context of robotic manipulation but perform poorly when the required solution does not exist as a complete trajectory within the training set. We identify that this is a result of being unable to plan via stitching, and subsequently address the architectural and dataset choices needed to remedy this. On top of this, we propose a novel addition to the training and inference procedures to both stabilize and enhance these capabilities. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by generating plans with out of distribution boundary conditions and performing obstacle avoidance on the Franka Panda in simulation and on real hardware. In both of these tasks our method performs significantly better than the baselines and is able to avoid obstacles up to four times as large.</p></details> |  |

However, comprehensive datasets that capture real-world career trajectories are scarce. In this paper, we introduce JobHop, a large-scale public dataset derived from anonymized resumes provided by VDAB, the public employment service in Flanders, Belgium. Utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs), we process unstructured resume data to extract structured career information, which is then mapped to standardized ESCO occupation codes using a multi-label classification model. This results in a rich dataset of over 2.3 million work experiences, extracted from and grouped into more than 391,000 user resumes and mapped to standardized ESCO occupation codes, offering valuable insights into real-world occupational transitions. This dataset enables diverse applications, such as analyzing labor market mobility, job stability, and the effects of career breaks on occupational transitions. It also supports career path prediction and other data-driven decision-making processes. To illustrate its potential, we explore key dataset characteristics, including job distributions, career breaks, and job transitions, demonstrating its value for advancing labor market research.</p></details> |  |
| **[SICNav-Diffusion: Safe and Interactive Crowd Navigation with Diffusion Trajectory Predictions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08858v2)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To navigate crowds without collisions, robots must interact with humans by forecasting their future motion and reacting accordingly. While learning-based prediction models have shown success in generating likely human trajectory predictions, integrating these stochastic models into a robot controller presents several challenges. The controller needs to account for interactive coupling between planned robot motion and human predictions while ensuring both predictions and robot actions are safe (i.e. collision-free). To address these challenges, we present a receding horizon crowd navigation method for single-robot multi-human environments. We first propose a diffusion model to generate joint trajectory predictions for all humans in the scene. We then incorporate these multi-modal predictions into a SICNav Bilevel MPC problem that simultaneously solves for a robot plan (upper-level) and acts as a safety filter to refine the predictions for non-collision (lower-level). Combining planning and prediction refinement into one bilevel problem ensures that the robot plan and human predictions are coupled. We validate the open-loop trajectory prediction performance of our diffusion model on the commonly used ETH/UCY benchmark and evaluate the closed-loop performance of our robot navigation method in simulation and extensive real-robot experiments demonstrating safe, efficient, and reactive robot motion.</p></details> |  |
| **[Finite-Alphabet-Aware Trajectory and Precoder Optimization for UAV Relaying](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08680v2)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become key enablers in relay-assisted wireless communications thanks to their flexibility and line-of-sight channel advantage. However, most existing trajectory optimization frameworks assume ideal Gaussian inputs, overlooking the fact that practical wireless systems rely on structured, finite-alphabet constellations. This mismatch can lead to suboptimal, and sometimes misleading, design choices. In this paper, we challenge that convention by introducing a finite-alphabet-aware framework for joint trajectory and precoder optimization in UAV-assisted relay systems. We formulate a non-convex design problem that directly accounts for discrete signal structures and propose an efficient solution based on alternating optimization and successive convex approximation. Simulation results reveal that strategies optimized under Gaussian assumptions can waste energy and degrade throughput in real deployments. In contrast, our approach adapts both the UAV's trajectory and transmission strategy to the underlying modulation format, delivering consistent performance gains under practical system constraints. This work takes a key step toward aligning UAV communication design with the realities of modern wireless systems: discrete signals, power limits, and intelligent mobility.</p></details> |  |
| **[Jointly spatial-temporal representation learning for individual trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04055v3)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Individual trajectories, rich in human-environment interaction information across space and time, serve as vital inputs for geospatial foundation models (GeoFMs). However, existing attempts at learning trajectory representations have overlooked the implicit spatial-temporal dependency within trajectories, failing to encode such dependency in a deep learning-friendly format. That poses a challenge in obtaining general-purpose trajectory representations. Therefore, this paper proposes a spatial-temporal joint representation learning method (ST-GraphRL) to formalize learnable spatial-temporal dependencies into trajectory representations. The proposed ST-GraphRL consists of three compositions: (i) a weighted directed spatial-temporal graph to explicitly construct mobility interactions in both space and time dimensions; (ii) a two-stage jointly encoder (i.e., decoupling and fusion), to learn entangled spatial-temporal dependencies by independently decomposing and jointly aggregating space and time information; (iii) a decoder guides ST-GraphRL to learn explicit mobility regularities by simulating the spatial-temporal distributions of trajectories. Tested on three real-world human mobility datasets, the proposed ST-GraphRL outperformed all the baseline models in predicting movement spatial-temporal distributions and preserving trajectory similarity with high spatial-temporal correlations. Analyzing spatial-temporal features presented in latent space validates that ST-GraphRL understands spatial-temporal patterns. This study may also benefit representation learnings of other geospatial data to achieve general-purpose data representations and advance GeoFMs development.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 3 tables, 7 figures</p></details> |

The challenge is to compute near-optimal sensor placements for detecting targets whose trajectories follow a log-Gaussian Cox line process. We explore sensor deployment in a transformed space, where linear target trajectories are represented as points. While this space simplifies handling the line process, the spatial functions representing sensor performance (i.e. probability of detection) become less intuitive. To illustrate our approach, we focus on positioning sensors of the barrier coverage system on the seafloor to detect passing ships. Through numerical experiments using historical ship data, we compute sensor locations that maximize the probability all ship passing over the barrier coverage system are detected.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work is published in IEEE SysCon 2025</p></details> |

This paper investigates the 3-dimensional (3D) trajectory and communication optimization for low-altitude air-ground cooperation systems, where mobile unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) upload data to UAVs. We propose a joint optimization algorithm to maximize the minimal sum-rate of UGVs while ensuring quality of service and navigation constraints. The proposed algorithm integrates a successive convex approximation (SCA)-penalty method for UGV-UAV scheduling, an SCA-based approach for UGV transmit power control, and a novel warm-start particle swarm optimization with cross mutation (WS-PSO-CM). The WS-PSO-CM leverages convex optimization results from a statistical channel model to initialize particle swarm, significantly improving the performance, compared with celebrated PSO-CM. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves a $45.8$\% higher minimal sum-rate compared to the baseline PSO-CM under the same iterations. This gain can be translated to reducing computational time by $46.7$\% of PSO-CM. Furthermore, our simulation results reveal that UAVs dynamically adjust trajectories to avoid interference by buildings, and maintain proximity to UGVs to mitigate path-loss.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages; 6 figures; submit to IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Traditional data-driven models predominantly rely on statistical correlations, often overlooking the causal relationships that govern traffic behavior. In this paper, we introduce a novel trajectory prediction framework that leverages causal inference to enhance predictive robustness, generalization, and accuracy. By decomposing the environment into spatial and temporal components, our approach identifies and mitigates spurious correlations, uncovering genuine causal relationships. We also employ a progressive fusion strategy to integrate multimodal information, simulating human-like reasoning processes and enabling real-time inference. Evaluations on five real-world datasets--ApolloScape, nuScenes, NGSIM, HighD, and MoCAD--demonstrate our model's superiority over existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, with improvements in key metrics such as RMSE and FDE. Our findings highlight the potential of causal reasoning to transform trajectory prediction, paving the way for robust AD systems.</p></details> |  |

However, current deep learning models often lack trustworthiness as their predictions can be physically infeasible and illogical to humans. To make predictions more trustworthy, recent research has incorporated prior knowledge, like the social force model for modeling interactions and kinematic models for physical realism. However, these approaches focus on priors that suit either vehicles or pedestrians and do not generalize to traffic with mixed agent classes. We propose incorporating interaction and kinematic priors of all agent classes--vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists with class-specific interaction layers to capture agent behavioral differences. To improve the interpretability of the agent interactions, we introduce DG-SFM, a rule-based interaction importance score that guides the interaction layer. To ensure physically feasible predictions, we proposed suitable kinematic models for all agent classes with a novel pedestrian kinematic model. We benchmark our approach on the Argoverse 2 dataset, using the state-of-the-art transformer HPTR as our baseline. Experiments demonstrate that our method improves interaction interpretability, revealing a correlation between incorrect predictions and divergence from our interaction prior. Even though incorporating the kinematic models causes a slight decrease in accuracy, they eliminate infeasible trajectories found in the dataset and the baseline model. Thus, our approach fosters trust in trajectory prediction as its interaction reasoning is interpretable, and its predictions adhere to physics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in the 36th IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV 2025) for oral presentation</p></details> |
| **[Boundary-Guided Trajectory Prediction for Road Aware and Physically Feasible Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06740v1)** | 2025-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of surrounding road users' trajectories is essential for safe and efficient autonomous driving. While deep learning models have improved performance, challenges remain in preventing off-road predictions and ensuring kinematic feasibility. Existing methods incorporate road-awareness modules and enforce kinematic constraints but lack plausibility guarantees and often introduce trade-offs in complexity and flexibility. This paper proposes a novel framework that formulates trajectory prediction as a constrained regression guided by permissible driving directions and their boundaries. Using the agent's current state and an HD map, our approach defines the valid boundaries and ensures on-road predictions by training the network to learn superimposed paths between left and right boundary polylines. To guarantee feasibility, the model predicts acceleration profiles that determine the vehicle's travel distance along these paths while adhering to kinematic constraints. We evaluate our approach on the Argoverse-2 dataset against the HPTR baseline. Our approach shows a slight decrease in benchmark metrics compared to HPTR but notably improves final displacement error and eliminates infeasible trajectories. Moreover, the proposed approach has superior generalization to less prevalent maneuvers and unseen out-of-distribution scenarios, reducing the off-road rate under adversarial attacks from 66\% to just 1\%. These results highlight the effectiveness of our approach in generating feasible and robust predictions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in the 36th IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV 2025)</p></details> |

In this setup, measurement (output) uncertainties are state-dependent and set-valued. Enveloping ellipsoids are employed to characterize state-dependent uncertainties with unknown distributions. The concept of regularity for set-valued output maps is then introduced, facilitating the formulation of the estimation-aware trajectory generation problem. Specifically, it is demonstrated that for output-regular maps, one can utilize a set-valued observability measure that is concave with respect to the finite horizon state trajectories. By maximizing this measure, estimation-aware trajectories can then be synthesized for a broad class of systems. Trajectory planning routines are also examined in this work, by which the observability measure is optimized for systems with locally linearized dynamics. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, representative examples in the context of trajectory planning with vision-based estimation are presented. Moreover, the paper presents estimation-aware planning for an uncooperative Target-Rendezvous problem, where an Ego-satellite employs an onboard machine learning (ML)-based estimation module to realize the rendezvous trajectory.</p></details> | 40 pages, 9 figures |

In this paper, we propose a barrier-enhanced parallel homotopic trajectory optimization (BPHTO) approach with the over-relaxed alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for real-time integrated decision-making and planning. To facilitate safety interactions between the ego vehicle (EV) and surrounding vehicles, a spatiotemporal safety module exhibiting bi-convexity is developed on the basis of barrier function. Varying barrier coefficients are adopted for different time steps in a planning horizon to account for the motion uncertainties of surrounding HVs and mitigate conservative behaviors. Additionally, we exploit the discrete characteristics of driving maneuvers to initialize nominal behavior-oriented free-end homotopic trajectories based on reachability analysis, and each trajectory is locally constrained to a specific driving maneuver while sharing the same task objectives. By leveraging the bi-convexity of the safety module and the kinematics of the EV, we formulate the BPHTO as a bi-convex optimization problem. Then constraint transcription and the over-relaxed ADMM are employed to streamline the optimization process, such that multiple trajectories are generated in real time with feasibility guarantees. Through a series of experiments, the proposed development demonstrates improved task accuracy, stability, and consistency in various traffic scenarios using synthetic and real-world traffic datasets.</p></details> | 17 pages, 10 figures |

| **[AutoL2S: Auto Long-Short Reasoning for Efficient Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22662v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The reasoning-capable large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance on complex reasoning tasks but often suffer from overthinking, generating unnecessarily long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning paths for easy reasoning questions, thereby increasing inference cost and latency. Recent approaches attempt to address this challenge by manually deciding when to apply long or short reasoning. However, they lack the flexibility to adapt CoT length dynamically based on question complexity. In this paper, we propose Auto Long-Short Reasoning (AutoL2S), a dynamic and model-agnostic framework that enables LLMs to dynamically compress their generated reasoning path based on the complexity of the reasoning question. AutoL2S enables a learned paradigm, in which LLMs themselves can decide when longer reasoning is necessary and when shorter reasoning suffices, by training on data annotated with our proposed method, which includes both long and short CoT paths and a special <EASY> token. We then use <EASY> token to indicate when the model can skip generating lengthy CoT reasoning. This proposed annotation strategy can enhance the LLMs' ability to generate shorter CoT reasoning paths with improved quality after training. Extensive evaluation results show that AutoL2S reduces the length of reasoning generation by up to 57% without compromising performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of AutoL2S for scalable and efficient LLM reasoning.</p></details> |  |

In contrast, current Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to effectively plan and act in dynamic, multi-room 3D environments. We posit that part of this limitation is due to the lack of proper 3D spatial-temporal memory modeling in LLMs. To address this, we first introduce 3DMem-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark comprising over 26,000 trajectories and 2,892 embodied tasks, question-answering and captioning, designed to evaluate an agent's ability to reason over long-term memory in 3D environments. Second, we propose 3DLLM-Mem, a novel dynamic memory management and fusion model for embodied spatial-temporal reasoning and actions in LLMs. Our model uses working memory tokens, which represents current observations, as queries to selectively attend to and fuse the most useful spatial and temporal features from episodic memory, which stores past observations and interactions. Our approach allows the agent to focus on task-relevant information while maintaining memory efficiency in complex, long-horizon environments. Experimental results demonstrate that 3DLLM-Mem achieves state-of-the-art performance across various tasks, outperforming the strongest baselines by 16.5% in success rate on 3DMem-Bench's most challenging in-the-wild embodied tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>demos...</summary><p>demos at: https://3dllm-mem.github.io</p></details> |

However, such methods incur significant computational costs due to longer visual token sequences, posing challenges for real-time deployment. To mitigate this, prior studies have explored pruning unimportant visual tokens either at the output layer of the visual encoder or at the early layers of the language model. In this work, we revisit these design choices and reassess their effectiveness through comprehensive empirical studies of how visual tokens are processed throughout the visual encoding and language decoding stages. Guided by these insights, we propose VScan, a two-stage visual token reduction framework that addresses token redundancy by: (1) integrating complementary global and local scans with token merging during visual encoding, and (2) introducing pruning at intermediate layers of the language model. Extensive experimental results across four LVLMs validate the effectiveness of VScan in accelerating inference and demonstrate its superior performance over current state-of-the-arts on sixteen benchmarks. Notably, when applied to LLaVA-NeXT-7B, VScan achieves a 2.91$\times$ speedup in prefilling and a 10$\times$ reduction in FLOPs, while retaining 95.4% of the original performance.</p></details> |  |

Hence, uncertainty quantification plays a crucial role, aiming to quantify the level of ambiguity in either one overall number or two numbers for aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. This position paper argues that this traditional dichotomy of uncertainties is too limited for the open and interactive setup that LLM agents operate in when communicating with a user, and that we need to research avenues that enrich uncertainties in this novel scenario. We review the literature and find that popular definitions of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties directly contradict each other and lose their meaning in interactive LLM agent settings. Hence, we propose three novel research directions that focus on uncertainties in such human-computer interactions: Underspecification uncertainties, for when users do not provide all information or define the exact task at the first go, interactive learning, to ask follow-up questions and reduce the uncertainty about the current context, and output uncertainties, to utilize the rich language and speech space to express uncertainties as more than mere numbers. We expect that these new ways of dealing with and communicating uncertainties will lead to LLM agent interactions that are more transparent, trustworthy, and intuitive.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICML 2025</p></details> |

This understanding is critical, as disparities in the quality of LLM responses can perpetuate representational harms by ignoring the different cultural contexts underlying Simplified versus Traditional Chinese, and can exacerbate downstream harms in LLM-facilitated decision-making in domains such as education or hiring. To investigate potential LLM performance disparities, we design two benchmark tasks that reflect real-world scenarios: regional term choice (prompting the LLM to name a described item which is referred to differently in Mainland China and Taiwan), and regional name choice (prompting the LLM to choose who to hire from a list of names in both Simplified and Traditional Chinese). For both tasks, we audit the performance of 11 leading commercial LLM services and open-sourced models -- spanning those primarily trained on English, Simplified Chinese, or Traditional Chinese. Our analyses indicate that biases in LLM responses are dependent on both the task and prompting language: while most LLMs disproportionately favored Simplified Chinese responses in the regional term choice task, they surprisingly favored Traditional Chinese names in the regional name choice task. We find that these disparities may arise from differences in training data representation, written character preferences, and tokenization of Simplified and Traditional Chinese. These findings highlight the need for further analysis of LLM biases; as such, we provide an open-sourced benchmark dataset to foster reproducible evaluations of future LLM behavior across Chinese language variants (https://github.com/brucelyu17/SC-TC-Bench).</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in the 2025 ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (FAccT '25)</p></details> |

However, large-scale datasets used for policy training often introduce substantial variability in quality, which can negatively impact performance. As a result, automatically curating datasets by filtering low-quality samples to improve quality becomes essential. Existing robotic curation approaches rely on costly manual annotations and perform curation at a coarse granularity, such as the dataset or trajectory level, failing to account for the quality of individual state-action pairs. To address this, we introduce SCIZOR, a self-supervised data curation framework that filters out low-quality state-action pairs to improve the performance of imitation learning policies. SCIZOR targets two complementary sources of low-quality data: suboptimal data, which hinders learning with undesirable actions, and redundant data, which dilutes training with repetitive patterns. SCIZOR leverages a self-supervised task progress predictor for suboptimal data to remove samples lacking task progression, and a deduplication module operating on joint state-action representation for samples with redundant patterns. Empirically, we show that SCIZOR enables imitation learning policies to achieve higher performance with less data, yielding an average improvement of 15.4% across multiple benchmarks.

However, their computational complexity, cost, and lack of transparency often hinder their direct application for predictive tasks where privacy and interpretability are paramount. In fields such as healthcare, biology, and finance, specialised and interpretable linear models still hold considerable value. In such domains, labelled data may be scarce or expensive to obtain. Well-specified prior distributions over model parameters can reduce the sample complexity of learning through Bayesian inference; however, eliciting expert priors can be time-consuming. We therefore introduce AutoElicit to extract knowledge from LLMs and construct priors for predictive models. We show these priors are informative and can be refined using natural language. We perform a careful study contrasting AutoElicit with in-context learning and demonstrate how to perform model selection between the two methods. We find that AutoElicit yields priors that can substantially reduce error over uninformative priors, using fewer labels, and consistently outperform in-context learning. We show that AutoElicit saves over 6 months of labelling effort when building a new predictive model for urinary tract infections from sensor recordings of people living with dementia.</p></details> |  |
| **[Precise In-Parameter Concept Erasure in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22586v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) often acquire knowledge during pretraining that is undesirable in downstream deployments, e.g., sensitive information or copyrighted content. Existing approaches for removing such knowledge rely on fine-tuning, training low-rank adapters or fact-level editing, but these are either too coarse, too shallow, or ineffective. In this work, we propose PISCES (Precise In-parameter Suppression for Concept EraSure), a novel framework for precisely erasing entire concepts from model parameters by directly editing directions that encode them in parameter space. PISCES uses a disentangler model to decompose MLP vectors into interpretable features, identifies those associated with a target concept using automated interpretability techniques, and removes them from model parameters. Experiments on Gemma 2 and Llama 3.1 over various concepts show that PISCES achieves modest gains in efficacy over leading erasure methods, reducing accuracy on the target concept to as low as 7.7%, while dramatically improving erasure specificity (by up to 31%) and robustness (by up to 38%). Overall, these results demonstrate that feature-based in-parameter editing enables a more precise and reliable approach for removing conceptual knowledge in language models.</p></details> |  |

However, this paradigm disrupts the subsequent tokens prediction, degrading model performance and linguistic coherence. Moreover, existing evaluation metrics overemphasize contextual forgetting while inadequately assessing response fluency and relevance. To address these challenges, we propose ReLearn, a data augmentation and fine-tuning pipeline for effective unlearning, along with a comprehensive evaluation framework. This framework introduces Knowledge Forgetting Rate (KFR) and Knowledge Retention Rate (KRR) to measure knowledge-level preservation, and Linguistic Score (LS) to evaluate generation quality. Our experiments show that ReLearn successfully achieves targeted forgetting while preserving high-quality output. Through mechanistic analysis, we further demonstrate how reverse optimization disrupts coherent text generation, while ReLearn preserves this essential capability.

While weight decay is standard practice in modern training procedures, most theoretical analyses focus on unregularized settings. In this work, we investigate the loss landscape of the $\ell_2$-regularized training loss for two-layer ReLU networks. We show that the landscape becomes benign -- i.e., free of spurious local minima -- under large overparametrization, specifically when the network width $m$ satisfies $m \gtrsim \min(n^d, 2^n)$, where $n$ is the number of data points and $d$ the input dimension. More precisely in this regime, almost all constant activation regions contain a global minimum and no spurious local minima. We further show that this level of overparametrization is not only sufficient but also necessary via the example of orthogonal data. Finally, we demonstrate that such loss landscape results primarily hold relevance in the large initialization regime. In contrast, for small initializations -- corresponding to the feature learning regime -- optimization can still converge to spurious local minima, despite the global benignity of the landscape.</p></details> |  |
| **[Do Large Language Models Think Like the Brain? Sentence-Level Evidence from fMRI and Hierarchical Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22563v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding whether large language models (LLMs) and the human brain converge on similar computational principles remains a fundamental and important question in cognitive neuroscience and AI. Do the brain-like patterns observed in LLMs emerge simply from scaling, or do they reflect deeper alignment with the architecture of human language processing? This study focuses on the sentence-level neural mechanisms of language models, systematically investigating how hierarchical representations in LLMs align with the dynamic neural responses during human sentence comprehension. By comparing hierarchical embeddings from 14 publicly available LLMs with fMRI data collected from participants, who were exposed to a naturalistic narrative story, we constructed sentence-level neural prediction models to precisely identify the model layers most significantly correlated with brain region activations. Results show that improvements in model performance drive the evolution of representational architectures toward brain-like hierarchies, particularly achieving stronger functional and anatomical correspondence at higher semantic abstraction levels.</p></details> |  |
| **[Geometric Hyena Networks for Large-scale Equivariant Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22560v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Processing global geometric context while preserving equivariance is crucial when modeling biological, chemical, and physical systems. Yet, this is challenging due to the computational demands of equivariance and global context at scale. Standard methods such as equivariant self-attention suffer from quadratic complexity, while local methods such as distance-based message passing sacrifice global information. Inspired by the recent success of state-space and long-convolutional models, we introduce Geometric Hyena, the first equivariant long-convolutional model for geometric systems. Geometric Hyena captures global geometric context at sub-quadratic complexity while maintaining equivariance to rotations and translations. Evaluated on all-atom property prediction of large RNA molecules and full protein molecular dynamics, Geometric Hyena outperforms existing equivariant models while requiring significantly less memory and compute that equivariant self-attention. Notably, our model processes the geometric context of 30k tokens 20x faster than the equivariant transformer and allows 72x longer context within the same budget.</p></details> |  |

This study benchmarks three leading large language models, OpenAI GPT-4.1, Google Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Anthropic Claude 3 Opus, on a corpus of 5,080 YouTube comments sampled from high-abuse threads in gaming, lifestyle, food vlog, and music channels. The dataset comprises 1,334 harmful and 3,746 non-harmful messages in English, Arabic, and Indonesian, annotated independently by two reviewers with substantial agreement (Cohen's kappa = 0.83). Using a unified prompt and deterministic settings, GPT-4.1 achieved the best overall balance with an F1 score of 0.863, precision of 0.887, and recall of 0.841. Gemini flagged the highest share of harmful posts (recall = 0.875) but its precision fell to 0.767 due to frequent false positives. Claude delivered the highest precision at 0.920 and the lowest false-positive rate of 0.022, yet its recall dropped to 0.720. Qualitative analysis showed that all three models struggle with sarcasm, coded insults, and mixed-language slang. These results underscore the need for moderation pipelines that combine complementary models, incorporate conversational context, and fine-tune for under-represented languages and implicit abuse. A de-identified version of the dataset and full prompts is publicly released to promote reproducibility and further progress in automated content moderation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint. 9 pages, 3 tables, 1 figure.

| **[On the Surprising Effectiveness of Large Learning Rates under Standard Width Scaling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22491v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The dominant paradigm for training large-scale vision and language models is He initialization and a single global learning rate (\textit{standard parameterization}, SP). Despite its practical success, standard parametrization remains poorly understood from a theoretical perspective: Existing infinite-width theory would predict instability under large learning rates and vanishing feature learning under stable learning rates. However, empirically optimal learning rates consistently decay much slower than theoretically predicted. By carefully studying neural network training dynamics, we demonstrate that this discrepancy is not fully explained by finite-width phenomena such as catapult effects or a lack of alignment between weights and incoming activations. We instead show that the apparent contradiction can be fundamentally resolved by taking the loss function into account: In contrast to Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss, we prove that under cross-entropy (CE) loss, an intermediate \textit{controlled divergence} regime emerges, where logits diverge but loss, gradients, and activations remain stable. Stable training under large learning rates enables persistent feature evolution at scale in all hidden layers, which is crucial for the practical success of SP. In experiments across optimizers (SGD, Adam), architectures (MLPs, GPT) and data modalities (vision, language), we validate that neural networks operate in this controlled divergence regime under CE loss but not under MSE loss. Our empirical evidence suggests that width-scaling considerations are surprisingly useful for predicting empirically optimal learning rate exponents. Finally, our analysis clarifies the effectiveness and limitations of recently proposed layerwise learning rate scalings for standard initialization.</p></details> |  |

However, while these enhanced reasoning capabilities improve performance, they also introduce new and underexplored safety risks. In this work, we systematically investigate the security implications of advanced visual reasoning in MLRMs. Our analysis reveals a fundamental trade-off: as visual reasoning improves, models become more vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. Motivated by this critical finding, we introduce VisCRA (Visual Chain Reasoning Attack), a novel jailbreak framework that exploits the visual reasoning chains to bypass safety mechanisms. VisCRA combines targeted visual attention masking with a two-stage reasoning induction strategy to precisely control harmful outputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate VisCRA's significant effectiveness, achieving high attack success rates on leading closed-source MLRMs: 76.48% on Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking, 68.56% on QvQ-Max, and 56.60% on GPT-4o. Our findings highlight a critical insight: the very capability that empowers MLRMs -- their visual reasoning -- can also serve as an attack vector, posing significant security risks.</p></details> |  |

However, editing commonsense knowledge still faces difficulties, including limited knowledge coverage in existing resources, the infeasibility of annotating labels for an overabundance of commonsense knowledge, and the strict knowledge formats of current editing methods. In this paper, we address these challenges by presenting ConceptEdit, a framework that integrates conceptualization and instantiation into the KE pipeline for LLMs to enhance their commonsense reasoning capabilities. ConceptEdit dynamically diagnoses implausible commonsense knowledge within an LLM using another verifier LLM and augments the source knowledge to be edited with conceptualization for stronger generalizability. Experimental results demonstrate that LLMs enhanced with ConceptEdit successfully generate commonsense knowledge with improved plausibility compared to other baselines and achieve stronger performance across multiple question answering benchmarks.

A dataset of 379,000 PubMed abstracts from 1965-1980 was processed to identify and modify pronouns tied to professions. We developed a BERT-based model, "Modern Occupational Bias Elimination with Refined Training," or "MOBERT," trained on these neutralized abstracts, and compared its performance with "1965BERT," trained on the original dataset. MOBERT achieved a 70% inclusive replacement rate, while 1965BERT reached only 4%. A further analysis of MOBERT revealed that pronoun replacement accuracy correlated with the frequency of occupational terms in the training data. We propose expanding the dataset and refining the pipeline to improve performance and ensure more equitable language modeling in medical applications.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |

LAMBDA is designed to address data analysis challenges in data-driven applications through innovatively designed data agents using natural language. At the core of LAMBDA are two key agent roles: the programmer and the inspector, which are engineered to work together seamlessly. Specifically, the programmer generates code based on the user's instructions and domain-specific knowledge, while the inspector debugs the code when necessary. To ensure robustness and handle adverse scenarios, LAMBDA features a user interface that allows direct user intervention. Moreover, LAMBDA can flexibly integrate external models and algorithms through our proposed Knowledge Integration Mechanism, catering to the needs of customized data analysis. LAMBDA has demonstrated strong performance on various data analysis tasks. It has the potential to enhance data analysis paradigms by seamlessly integrating human and artificial intelligence, making it more accessible, effective, and efficient for users from diverse backgrounds. The strong performance of LAMBDA in solving data analysis problems is demonstrated using real-world data examples. The code for LAMBDA is available at https://github.com/AMA-CMFAI/LAMBDA and videos of three case studies can be viewed at https://www.polyu.edu.hk/ama/cmfai/lambda.html.</p></details> | 56 pages |

Dynamic Range Compressor (DRC) is an audio processing module that controls the dynamics of a track by reducing and amplifying the volumes of loud and quiet sounds, which is essential in music production. In recent years, neural-network-based VA modeling has shown great potential in producing high-fidelity models. However, due to the lack of data quantity and diversity, their generalization ability in different parameter settings and input sounds is still limited. To tackle this problem, we present Solid State Bus-Comp, the first large-scale and diverse dataset for modeling the classical VCA compressor -- SSL 500 G-Bus. Specifically, we manually collected 175 unmastered songs from the Cambridge Multitrack Library. We recorded the compressed audio in 220 parameter combinations, resulting in an extensive 2528-hour dataset with diverse genres, instruments, tempos, and keys. Moreover, to facilitate the use of our proposed dataset, we conducted benchmark experiments in various open-sourced black-box and grey-box models, as well as white-box plugins. We also conducted ablation studies in different data subsets to illustrate the effectiveness of the improved data diversity and quantity. The dataset and demos are on our project page: https://www.yichenggu.com/SolidStateBusComp/.</p></details> |  |

To address this issue, several classical statistical learning approaches have been repurposed for scalable uncertainty-aware LoRA fine-tuning. However, these approaches neglect how input characteristics affect the predictive uncertainty estimates. To address this limitation, we propose Contextual Low-Rank Adaptation (\textbf{C-LoRA}) as a novel uncertainty-aware and parameter efficient fine-tuning approach, by developing new lightweight LoRA modules contextualized to each input data sample to dynamically adapt uncertainty estimates. Incorporating data-driven contexts into the parameter posteriors, C-LoRA mitigates overfitting, achieves well-calibrated uncertainties, and yields robust predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that C-LoRA consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art uncertainty-aware LoRA methods in both uncertainty quantification and model generalization. Ablation studies further confirm the critical role of our contextual modules in capturing sample-specific uncertainties. C-LoRA sets a new standard for robust, uncertainty-aware LLM fine-tuning in few-shot regimes.</p></details> |  |

Rates of convergence are also analyzed based on feasible sequences $\{k_{n}\}$. We work in three dependence settings: independence, Dedecker and Prieur's (2004) $\tau $-mixing and Wu's (2005) physical dependence. We initially ignore cross-coordinate $i$ dependence as a benchmark. We then work with martingale, nearly martingale, and mixing coordinates to deliver improved bounds on $k_{n}$. Finally, we use the results in three applications, each representing a key novelty: we ($i$) bound $k_{n}$\ for a max-correlation statistic for regression residuals under $\alpha $-mixing or physical dependence; ($ii$) extend correlation screening, or marginal regressions, to physical dependent data with diverging dimension $k_{n}$ $\rightarrow $ $\infty $; and ($iii$) test a high dimensional parameter after partialling out a fixed dimensional nuisance parameter in a linear time series regression model under $\tau $% -mixing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mitigating Overthinking in Large Reasoning Models via Manifold Steering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22411v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in solving complex tasks such as mathematics and coding. However, these models frequently exhibit a phenomenon known as overthinking during inference, characterized by excessive validation loops and redundant deliberation, leading to substantial computational overheads. In this paper, we aim to mitigate overthinking by investigating the underlying mechanisms from the perspective of mechanistic interpretability. We first showcase that the tendency of overthinking can be effectively captured by a single direction in the model's activation space and the issue can be eased by intervening the activations along this direction. However, this efficacy soon reaches a plateau and even deteriorates as the intervention strength increases. We therefore systematically explore the activation space and find that the overthinking phenomenon is actually tied to a low-dimensional manifold, which indicates that the limited effect stems from the noises introduced by the high-dimensional steering direction. Based on this insight, we propose Manifold Steering, a novel approach that elegantly projects the steering direction onto the low-dimensional activation manifold given the theoretical approximation of the interference noise. Extensive experiments on DeepSeek-R1 distilled models validate that our method reduces output tokens by up to 71% while maintaining and even improving the accuracy on several mathematical benchmarks. Our method also exhibits robust cross-domain transferability, delivering consistent token reduction performance in code generation and knowledge-based QA tasks.

Chain-of-thoughts (CoTs) have been commonly utilized to monitor LLMs, but this strategy fails to accurately reflect LLMs' thinking process. Techniques based on LLMs' hidden representations provide an inner perspective to monitor their latent thinking. However, previous methods only try to develop external monitors instead of making LLMs themselves easier to monitor. In this paper, we propose a novel method TELLME, improving the transparency of LLMs and helping monitors identify unsuitable and sensitive behaviors. Furthermore, we showcase the applications of TELLME on trustworthiness tasks (\eg, safety risks monitoring tasks and detoxification tasks), where LLMs achieve consistent improvement in transparency and task performance. More crucially, we theoretically analyze the improvement of TELLME on LLMs' generalization ability through optimal transport theory.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages,6 figures,13 tables</p></details> |

A grassroots federation evolves via the grassroots formation of digital communities and their consensual federation. Such digital communities may form according to geography, jurisdiction, affiliations, relations, interests, causes, and more. Small communities (say up to $100$ members) govern themselves; larger communities -- no matter how large -- are governed by a similarly-small assembly elected by sortition among its members. Earlier work on Grassroots Democratic Federation explored the fair sortition of the assemblies of a federation in a static setting: Given a federation, populate its assemblies with members satisfying ex ante and ex post fairness conditions on the participation of members of a community in its assembly, and on the representation of child communities in the assembly of their parent community. In practice, we expect a grassroots democratic federation to grow and evolve dynamically and in all directions -- bottom-up, top-down, and middle-out. To address that, we formally specify this dynamic setting and adapt the static fairness conditions to it: The ex post condition on the fair representation of a child community becomes a condition that must always hold; the ex ante conditions in expectation on the fair participation of an individual and on the fair representation of a child community become conditions satisfied in actuality in the limit, provided the federation structure eventually stabilizes. We then present a protocol that satisfies these fairness conditions.</p></details> |  |

Large artificial intelligence models (LAIMs) offer transformative potential to further enhance the intelligence of LAE services. However, deploying LAIMs in LAE poses several challenges, including the significant gap between their computational/storage demands and the limited onboard resources of LAE entities, the mismatch between lab-trained LAIMs and dynamic physical environments, and the inefficiencies of traditional decoupled designs for sensing, communication, and computation. To address these issues, we first propose a hierarchical system architecture tailored for LAIM deployment and present representative LAE application scenarios. Next, we explore key enabling techniques that facilitate the mutual co-evolution of LAIMs and low-altitude systems, and introduce a task-oriented execution pipeline for scalable and adaptive service delivery. Then, the proposed framework is validated through real-world case studies. Finally, we outline open challenges to inspire future research.</p></details> |  |

Among them, black-box LLMs--served via APIs without access to model internals--are especially dominant due to their scalability and ease of deployment. Despite their strong capabilities, these models typically produce generalized responses that overlook personal preferences and reasoning styles. This has led to growing interest in black-box LLM personalization, which aims to tailor model outputs to user-specific context without modifying model parameters. However, existing approaches primarily focus on response-level personalization, attempting to match final outputs without modeling personal thought process. To address this limitation, we propose RPM, a framework for reasoning-level personalization that aligns the model's reasoning process with a user's personalized logic. RPM first constructs statistical user-specific factors by extracting and grouping response-influential features from user history. It then builds personalized reasoning paths that reflect how these factors are used in context. In the inference stage, RPM retrieves reasoning-aligned examples for new queries via feature-level similarity and performs inference conditioned on the structured factors and retrieved reasoning paths, enabling the model to follow user-specific reasoning trajectories. This reasoning-level personalization enhances both predictive accuracy and interpretability by grounding model outputs in user-specific logic through structured information. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks show that RPM consistently outperforms response-level personalization methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of reasoning-level personalization in black-box LLMs.</p></details> |  |

However, applying LLMs to wireless communications presents challenges such as limited capability in handling complex logic, generalization, and reasoning. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, which guides LLMs to generate explicit intermediate reasoning steps, has been shown to significantly improve LLM performance on complex tasks. Inspired by this, this paper explores the application potential of CoT-enhanced LLMs in wireless communications. Specifically, we first review the fundamental theory of CoT and summarize various types of CoT. We then survey key CoT and LLM techniques relevant to wireless communication and networking. Moreover, we introduce a multi-layer intent-driven CoT framework that bridges high-level user intent expressed in natural language with concrete wireless control actions. Our proposed framework sequentially parses and clusters intent, selects appropriate CoT reasoning modules via reinforcement learning, then generates interpretable control policies for system configuration. Using the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) network as a case study, we demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms a non-CoT baseline in both communication performance and quality of generated reasoning.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |

Many of these systems utilize diffractive optical components (DOEs) for holography, PSF engineering, or wavefront shaping. Existing approaches have, however, mostly remained limited to laboratory prototypes, owing to a large quality gap between simulation and manufactured devices. We aim at lifting the fundamental technical barriers to the practical use of learned diffractive optical systems. To this end, we propose a fabrication-aware design pipeline for diffractive optics fabricated by direct-write grayscale lithography followed by nano-imprinting replication, which is directly suited for inexpensive mass production of large area designs. We propose a super-resolved neural lithography model that can accurately predict the 3D geometry generated by the fabrication process. This model can be seamlessly integrated into existing differentiable optics frameworks, enabling fabrication-aware, end-to-end optimization of computational optical systems. To tackle the computational challenges, we also devise tensor-parallel compute framework centered on distributing large-scale FFT computation across many GPUs. As such, we demonstrate large scale diffractive optics designs up to 32.16 mm $\times$ 21.44 mm, simulated on grids of up to 128,640 by 85,760 feature points. We find adequate agreement between simulation and fabricated prototypes for applications such as holography and PSF engineering. We also achieve high image quality from an imaging system comprised only of a single DOE, with images processed only by a Wiener filter utilizing the simulation PSF. We believe our findings lift the fabrication limitations for real-world applications of diffractive optics and differentiable optical design.</p></details> |  |

This tutorial provides a systematic introduction to the principles, design, and applications of Large Artificial Intelligence Models (LAMs) and Agentic AI technologies in intelligent communication systems, aiming to offer researchers a comprehensive overview of cutting-edge technologies and practical guidance. First, we outline the background of 6G communications, review the technological evolution from LAMs to Agentic AI, and clarify the tutorial's motivation and main contributions. Subsequently, we present a comprehensive review of the key components required for constructing LAMs. We further categorize LAMs and analyze their applicability, covering Large Language Models (LLMs), Large Vision Models (LVMs), Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), and lightweight LAMs. Next, we propose a LAM-centric design paradigm tailored for communications, encompassing dataset construction and both internal and external learning approaches. Building upon this, we develop an LAM-based Agentic AI system for intelligent communications, clarifying its core components such as planners, knowledge bases, tools, and memory modules, as well as its interaction mechanisms. We also introduce a multi-agent framework with data retrieval, collaborative planning, and reflective evaluation for 6G. Subsequently, we provide a detailed overview of the applications of LAMs and Agentic AI in communication scenarios. Finally, we summarize the research challenges and future directions in current studies, aiming to support the development of efficient, secure, and sustainable next-generation intelligent communication systems.</p></details> |  |

Existing privacy protection methods for LLMs suffer from either insufficient privacy protection, performance degradation, or large inference time overhead. To address these limitations, we propose PrivacyRestore, a plug-and-play method to protect the privacy of user inputs during LLM inference. The server first trains restoration vectors for each privacy span and then release to clients. Privacy span is defined as a contiguous sequence of tokens within a text that contain private information. The client then aggregate restoration vectors of all privacy spans in the input into a single meta restoration vector which is later sent to the server side along with the input without privacy spans.The private information is restored via activation steering during inference. Furthermore, we prove that PrivacyRestore inherently prevents the linear growth of the privacy budget.We create three datasets, covering medical and legal domains, to evaluate the effectiveness of privacy preserving methods. The experimental results show that PrivacyRestore effectively protects private information and maintain acceptable levels of performance and inference overhead.</p></details> | Accepted by ACL2025 |
| **[Test-Time Immunization: A Universal Defense Framework Against Jailbreaks for (Multimodal) Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22271v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While (multimodal) large language models (LLMs) have attracted widespread attention due to their exceptional capabilities, they remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. Various defense methods are proposed to defend against jailbreak attacks, however, they are often tailored to specific types of jailbreak attacks, limiting their effectiveness against diverse adversarial strategies. For instance, rephrasing-based defenses are effective against text adversarial jailbreaks but fail to counteract image-based attacks. To overcome these limitations, we propose a universal defense framework, termed Test-time IMmunization (TIM), which can adaptively defend against various jailbreak attacks in a self-evolving way. Specifically, TIM initially trains a gist token for efficient detection, which it subsequently applies to detect jailbreak activities during inference. When jailbreak attempts are identified, TIM implements safety fine-tuning using the detected jailbreak instructions paired with refusal answers. Furthermore, to mitigate potential performance degradation in the detector caused by parameter updates during safety fine-tuning, we decouple the fine-tuning process from the detection module. Extensive experiments on both LLMs and multimodal LLMs demonstrate the efficacy of TIM.</p></details> | Under Review |

To support their claims, results on LibriSpeech and Common Voice are often quoted. However, this work finds that a substantial amount of the LibriSpeech and Common Voice evaluation sets appear in public LLM pretraining corpora. This calls into question the reliability of findings drawn from these two datasets. To measure the impact of contamination, LLMs trained with or without contamination are compared, showing that a contaminated LLM is more likely to generate test sentences it has seen during training. Speech recognisers using contaminated LLMs shows only subtle differences in error rates, but assigns significantly higher probabilities to transcriptions seen during training. Results show that LLM outputs can be biased by tiny amounts of data contamination, highlighting the importance of evaluating LLM-based speech systems with held-out data.</p></details> |  |

Yambda-5B contains 4.79 billion user-item interactions from 1 million users across 9.39 million tracks. The dataset includes two primary types of interactions: implicit feedback (listening events) and explicit feedback (likes, dislikes, unlikes and undislikes). In addition, we provide audio embeddings for most tracks, generated by a convolutional neural network trained on audio spectrograms. A key distinguishing feature of Yambda-5B is the inclusion of the is_organic flag, which separates organic user actions from recommendation-driven events. This distinction is critical for developing and evaluating machine learning algorithms, as Yandex.Music relies on recommender systems to personalize track selection for users. To support rigorous benchmarking, we introduce an evaluation protocol based on a Global Temporal Split, allowing recommendation algorithms to be assessed in conditions that closely mirror real-world use. We report benchmark results for standard baselines (ItemKNN, iALS) and advanced models (SANSA, SASRec) using a variety of evaluation metrics. By releasing Yambda-5B to the community, we aim to provide a readily accessible, industrial-scale resource to advance research, foster innovation, and promote reproducible results in recommender systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Continuous Self-Improvement of Large Language Models by Test-time Training with Verifier-Driven Sample Selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19475v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning to adapt pretrained language models to unlabeled, out-of-distribution data is a critical challenge, as models often falter on structurally novel reasoning tasks even while excelling within their training distribution. We introduce a new framework called VDS-TTT - Verifier-Driven Sample Selection for Test-Time Training to efficiently address this. We use a learned verifier to score a pool of generated responses and select only from high ranking pseudo-labeled examples for fine-tuned adaptation. Specifically, for each input query our LLM generates N candidate answers; the verifier assigns a reliability score to each, and the response with the highest confidence and above a fixed threshold is paired with its query for test-time training. We fine-tune only low-rank LoRA adapter parameters, ensuring adaptation efficiency and fast convergence. Our proposed self-supervised framework is the first to synthesize verifier driven test-time training data for continuous self-improvement of the model. Experiments across three diverse benchmarks and three state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate that VDS-TTT yields up to a 32.29% relative improvement over the base model and a 6.66% gain compared to verifier-based methods without test-time training, highlighting its effectiveness and efficiency for on-the-fly large language model adaptation.</p></details> |  |

However, these models still suffer from hallucinations and clinically significant errors, limiting their reliability in real-world applications. In this study, we propose Look & Mark (L&M), a novel grounding fixation strategy that integrates radiologist eye fixations (Look) and bounding box annotations (Mark) into the LLM prompting framework. Unlike conventional fine-tuning, L&M leverages in-context learning to achieve substantial performance gains without retraining. When evaluated across multiple domain-specific and general-purpose models, L&M demonstrates significant gains, including a 1.2% improvement in overall metrics (A.AVG) for CXR-LLaVA compared to baseline prompting and a remarkable 9.2% boost for LLaVA-Med. General-purpose models also benefit from L&M combined with in-context learning, with LLaVA-OV achieving an 87.3% clinical average performance (C.AVG)-the highest among all models, even surpassing those explicitly trained for CXR report generation. Expert evaluations further confirm that L&M reduces clinically significant errors (by 0.43 average errors per report), such as false predictions and omissions, enhancing both accuracy and reliability. These findings highlight L&M's potential as a scalable and efficient solution for AI-assisted radiology, paving the way for improved diagnostic workflows in low-resource clinical settings.</p></details> |  |

Existing token pruning methods offer solutions. However, approaches operating within the LLM (inner-LLM pruning), such as FastV, incur intrinsic computational overhead in shallow layers. In contrast, methods performing token pruning before the LLM (outer-LLM pruning) primarily address spatial redundancy within individual frames or limited temporal windows, neglecting the crucial global temporal dynamics and correlations across longer video sequences. This leads to sub-optimal spatio-temporal reduction and does not leverage video compressibility fully. Crucially, the synergistic potential and mutual influence of combining these strategies remain unexplored. To further reduce redundancy, we introduce HoliTom, a novel training-free holistic token merging framework. HoliTom employs outer-LLM pruning through global redundancy-aware temporal segmentation, followed by spatial-temporal merging to reduce visual tokens by over 90%, significantly alleviating the LLM's computational burden. Complementing this, we introduce a robust inner-LLM token similarity-based merging approach, designed for superior performance and compatibility with outer-LLM pruning. Evaluations demonstrate our method's promising efficiency-performance trade-off on LLaVA-OneVision-7B, reducing computational costs to 6.9% of FLOPs while maintaining 99.1% of the original performance. Furthermore, we achieve a 2.28x reduction in Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) and a 1.32x acceleration in decoding throughput, highlighting the practical benefits of our integrated pruning approach for efficient video LLMs inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>versi...</summary><p>version provides code link: https://github.com/cokeshao/HoliTom</p></details> |

Improving their accuracy is possible through pre-training and fine-tuning, where an NNP model is first pre-trained on a large-scale dataset and then fine-tuned on a smaller target dataset. However, this approach is computationally expensive, mainly due to the cost of DFT-based dataset labeling and load imbalances during large-scale pre-training. To address this, we propose LaMM, a semi-supervised pre-training method incorporating improved denoising self-supervised learning and a load-balancing algorithm for efficient multi-node training. We demonstrate that our approach effectively leverages a large-scale dataset of $\sim$300 million semi-labeled samples to train a single NNP model, resulting in improved fine-tuning performance in terms of both speed and accuracy.</p></details> | 24 pages, 9 figures |

This task requires robust spatial reasoning and the ability to leverage prior experiences. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer strong semantic capabilities, their application in embodied contexts is limited by a grounding gap in spatial reasoning and insufficient mechanisms for memory integration and decision consistency.To address these challenges, we propose GET (Goal-directed Exploration and Targeting), a framework that enhances object search by combining LLM-based reasoning with experience-guided exploration. At its core is DoUT (Diagram of Unified Thought), a reasoning module that facilitates real-time decision-making through a role-based feedback loop, integrating task-specific criteria and external memory. For repeated tasks, GET maintains a probabilistic task map based on a Gaussian Mixture Model, allowing for continual updates to object-location priors as environments evolve.Experiments conducted in real-world, large-scale environments demonstrate that GET improves search efficiency and robustness across multiple LLMs and task settings, significantly outperforming heuristic and LLM-only baselines. These results suggest that structured LLM integration provides a scalable and generalizable approach to embodied decision-making in complex environments.</p></details> |  |

We rigorously prove that, under gradient descent, LoRA adapters align with specific singular subspaces of the one-step full fine-tuning gradient. This result suggests that, by properly initializing the adapters using the one-step full gradient, subspace alignment can be achieved immediately and applicable to both linear and nonlinear models. Building on our theory, we propose a theory-driven algorithm, LoRA-One, where the linear convergence (as well as generalization) is built and incorporating preconditioners theoretically helps mitigate the effects of ill-conditioning. Besides, our theory reveals connections between LoRA-One and other gradient-alignment-based methods, helping to clarify misconceptions in the design of such algorithms. LoRA-One achieves significant empirical improvements over LoRA and its variants across benchmarks in natural language understanding, mathematical reasoning, and code generation.

Unlike single-turn jailbreaks that rely on one meticulously engineered prompt, Tempest expands the conversation at each turn in a breadth-first fashion, branching out multiple adversarial prompts that exploit partial compliance from previous responses. By tracking these incremental policy leaks and re-injecting them into subsequent queries, Tempest reveals how minor concessions can accumulate into fully disallowed outputs. Evaluations on the JailbreakBench dataset show that Tempest achieves a 100% success rate on GPT-3.5-turbo and 97% on GPT-4 in a single multi-turn run, using fewer queries than baselines such as Crescendo or GOAT. This tree search methodology offers an in-depth view of how model safeguards degrade over successive dialogue turns, underscoring the urgency of robust multi-turn testing procedures for language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2025 Main</p></details> |

Learning from errors offers the potential to further enhance the performance of LLMs during Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). However, the errors in synthesized solutions are typically gathered from sampling trails, making it challenging to generate solution errors for each mathematical problem. This paper introduces the Error-IndUced LEaRning (EULER) model, which aims to develop an error exposure model that generates high-quality solution errors to enhance the mathematical reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Specifically, EULER optimizes the error exposure model to increase the generation probability of self-made solution errors while utilizing solutions produced by a superior LLM to regularize the generation quality. Our experiments across various mathematical problem datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the EULER model, achieving an improvement of over 4% compared to all baseline models. Further analysis reveals that EULER is capable of synthesizing more challenging and educational solution errors, which facilitate both the training and inference processes of LLMs. All codes are available at https://github.com/NEUIR/EULER.</p></details> |  |

Current Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods for Large Language Models (LLMs), while efficient, often sacrifice general capabilities. To address the issue of CF in a general-purpose PEFT framework, we propose \textbf{Lo}w-damage \textbf{K}nowledge \textbf{I}mplanting (\textbf{LoKI}), a PEFT technique that is based on a mechanistic understanding of how knowledge is stored in transformer architectures. In two real-world scenarios, LoKI demonstrates task-specific performance that is comparable to or even surpasses that of full fine-tuning and LoRA-based methods across various model types, while significantly better preserving general capabilities. Our work connects mechanistic insights into LLM knowledge storage with practical fine-tuning objectives, achieving state-of-the-art trade-offs between task specialization and the preservation of general capabilities.

However, the prevalent issue of overthinking severely limits their computational efficiency. Overthinking occurs when models generate excessive and redundant tokens that contribute little to accurate outcomes, especially in simple tasks, resulting in a significant waste of computational resources. To systematically investigate this issue, we introduce Think-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate the reasoning efficiency of LRMs. We also propose novel efficiency metrics and conduct a comprehensive evaluation of various LRMs across multiple dimensions, including the reasoning process, outcome quality, and chain-of-thought (CoT) characteristics. Our analysis reveals that most LRMs exhibit overthinking in handling easy questions, generating unnecessarily lengthy reasoning chains. While many LRMs demonstrate high CoT quality, several suffer from low efficiency. We hope that Think-Bench can serve as a robust foundation for advancing research into LRMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 8 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

This study assesses the cognitive flexibility of state-of-the-art VLLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini-1.5 Pro, and Claude-3.5 Sonnet) using the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), a classic measure of set-shifting ability. Our results reveal that VLLMs achieve or surpass human-level set-shifting capabilities under chain-of-thought prompting with text-based inputs. However, their abilities are highly influenced by both input modality and prompting strategy. In addition, we find that through role-playing, VLLMs can simulate various functional deficits aligned with patients having impairments in cognitive flexibility, suggesting that VLLMs may possess a cognitive architecture, at least regarding the ability of set-shifting, similar to the brain. This study reveals the fact that VLLMs have already approached the human level on a key component underlying our higher cognition, and highlights the potential to use them to emulate complex brain processes.</p></details> |  |

Despite their remarkable capabilities in language perception and generation, current LLMs fundamentally lack a unified and structured architecture for handling memory. They primarily rely on parametric memory (knowledge encoded in model weights) and ephemeral activation memory (context-limited runtime states). While emerging methods like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) incorporate plaintext memory, they lack lifecycle management and multi-modal integration, limiting their capacity for long-term knowledge evolution. To address this, we introduce MemOS, a memory operating system designed for LLMs that, for the first time, elevates memory to a first-class operational resource. It builds unified mechanisms for representation, organization, and governance across three core memory types: parametric, activation, and plaintext. At its core is the MemCube, a standardized memory abstraction that enables tracking, fusion, and migration of heterogeneous memory, while offering structured, traceable access across tasks and contexts. MemOS establishes a memory-centric execution framework with strong controllability, adaptability, and evolvability. It fills a critical gap in current LLM infrastructure and lays the groundwork for continual adaptation, personalized intelligence, and cross-platform coordination in next-generation intelligent systems.</p></details> |  |

First, the UAVPairs dataset, comprising 21,622 high-resolution images across 30 diverse scenes, is constructed; the 3D points and tracks generated by SfM-based 3D reconstruction are employed to define the geometric similarity of image pairs, ensuring genuinely matchable image pairs are used for training. Second, to solve the problem of expensive mining cost for global hard negative mining, a batched nontrivial sample mining strategy is proposed, leveraging the geometric similarity and multi-scene structure of the UAVPairs to generate training samples as to accelerate training. Third, recognizing the limitation of pair-based losses, the ranked list loss is designed to improve the discrimination of image retrieval models, which optimizes the global similarity structure constructed from the positive set and negative set. Finally, the effectiveness of the UAVPairs dataset and training pipeline is validated through comprehensive experiments on three distinct large-scale UAV datasets. The experiment results demonstrate that models trained with the UAVPairs dataset and the ranked list loss achieve significantly improved retrieval accuracy compared to models trained on existing datasets or with conventional losses. Furthermore, these improvements translate to enhanced view graph connectivity and higher quality of reconstructed 3D models. The models trained by the proposed approach perform more robustly compared with hand-crafted global features, particularly in challenging repetitively textured scenes and weakly textured scenes. For match pair retrieval of large-scale UAV images, the trained image retrieval models offer an effective solution. The dataset would be made publicly available at https://github.com/json87/UAVPairs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Domain-Specific Pruning of Large Mixture-of-Experts Models with Few-shot Demonstrations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06792v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models achieve a favorable trade-off between performance and inference efficiency by activating only a subset of experts. However, the memory overhead of storing all experts remains a major limitation, especially in large-scale MoE models such as DeepSeek-R1(671B). In this study, we investigate domain specialization and expert redundancy in large-scale MoE models and uncover a consistent behavior we term few-shot expert localization, with only a few in-domain demonstrations, the model consistently activates a sparse and stable subset of experts on tasks within the same domain. Building on this observation, we propose a simple yet effective pruning framework, EASY-EP, that leverages a few domain-specific demonstrations to identify and retain only the most relevant experts. EASY-EP comprises two key components: output-aware expert importance assessment and expert-level token contribution estimation. The former evaluates the importance of each expert for the current token by considering the gating scores and L2 norm of the outputs of activated experts, while the latter assesses the contribution of tokens based on representation similarities before and after routed experts. Experiments on DeepSeek-R1 and DeepSeek-V3-0324 show that our method can achieve comparable performances and $2.99\times$ throughput under the same memory budget with full model with only half the experts.</p></details> |  |

However, this often leads to degraded performance on short-text tasks, while the reasons for this degradation remain insufficiently explored. In this work, we identify two primary factors contributing to this issue: distribution drift in hidden states and attention scores, and catastrophic forgetting during continual pre-training. To address these challenges, we propose Long Context Pre-training with Restoration Distillation (LongReD), a novel approach designed to mitigate short-text performance degradation through minimizing the distribution discrepancy between the extended and original models. Besides training on long texts, LongReD distills the hidden state of selected layers from the original model on short texts. Additionally, LongReD also introduces a short-to-long distillation, aligning the output distribution on short texts with that on long texts by leveraging skipped positional indices. Experiments on common text benchmarks demonstrate that LongReD effectively preserves the model's short-text performance while maintaining comparable or even better capacity to handle long texts than baselines.

Despite this success, the training data of LVLMs still suffers from Long-Tail (LT) problems, where the data distribution is highly imbalanced. Previous works have mainly focused on traditional VLM architectures, i.e., CLIP or ViT, and specific tasks such as recognition and classification. Nevertheless, the exploration of LVLM (e.g. LLaVA) and more general tasks (e.g. Visual Question Answering and Visual Reasoning) remains under-explored. In this paper, we first conduct an in-depth analysis of the LT issues in LVLMs and identify two core causes: the overrepresentation of head concepts and the underrepresentation of tail concepts. Based on the above observation, we propose an $\textbf{A}$daptive $\textbf{D}$ata $\textbf{R}$efinement Framework ($\textbf{ADR}$), which consists of two stages: $\textbf{D}$ata $\textbf{R}$ebalancing ($\textbf{DR}$) and $\textbf{D}$ata $\textbf{S}$ynthesis ($\textbf{DS}$). In the DR stage, we adaptively rebalance the redundant data based on entity distributions, while in the DS stage, we leverage Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) and scarce images to supplement underrepresented portions. Through comprehensive evaluations across eleven benchmarks, our proposed ADR effectively mitigates the long-tail problem in the training data, improving the average performance of LLaVA 1.5 relatively by 4.36%, without increasing the training data volume.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |

In this paper, we conduct a rigorous evaluation of LLMs' implicit bias towards certain demographics by attacking them from a psychometric perspective to elicit agreements to biased viewpoints. Inspired by psychometric principles in cognitive and social psychology, we propose three attack approaches, i.e., Disguise, Deception, and Teaching. Incorporating the corresponding attack instructions, we built two benchmarks: (1) a bilingual dataset with biased statements covering four bias types (2.7K instances) for extensive comparative analysis, and (2) BUMBLE, a larger benchmark spanning nine common bias types (12.7K instances) for comprehensive evaluation. Extensive evaluation of popular commercial and open-source LLMs shows that our methods can elicit LLMs' inner bias more effectively than competitive baselines. Our attack methodology and benchmarks offer an effective means of assessing the ethical risks of LLMs, driving progress toward greater accountability in their development. Our code, data and benchmarks are available at https://github.com/yuchenwen1/ImplicitBiasPsychometricEvaluation and https://github.com/yuchenwen1/BUMBLE.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2025 Findings</p></details> |
| **[Estimating the Effects of Sample Training Orders for Large Language Models without Retraining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22042v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The order of training samples plays a crucial role in large language models (LLMs), significantly impacting both their external performance and internal learning dynamics. Traditional methods for investigating this effect generally require retraining the model with various sample orders, which is computationally infeasible for LLMs. In this work, we improve traditional methods by designing a retraining-free framework. By approximating Adam optimizer updates with first- and second-order Taylor expansions and utilizing random projection methods to store intermediate checkpoints, our framework can efficiently estimate model parameters for arbitrary training sample orders. Next, we apply our framework to two downstream research problems: (1) Training curriculum design for LLMs -- we base our retraining-free framework to propose a novel curriculum learning strategy that augments curriculum proposals with estimated model performances, enabling more informed sample scheduling. (2) LLMs' memorization and generalization effect analysis -- we use our retraining-free framework to estimate how the positions of training samples influence LLMs' capacity for memorization and generalization. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of our retraining-free framework in reproducing the true model performances, and further demonstrate its potential in optimizing LLM training curricula and analyzing the memorization and generalization effects of LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Wolf Hidden in Sheep's Conversations: Toward Harmless Data-Based Backdoor Attacks for Jailbreaking Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17601v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) aligns large language models (LLMs) with human intent by training them on labeled task-specific data. Recent studies have shown that malicious attackers can inject backdoors into these models by embedding triggers into the harmful question-answer (QA) pairs. However, existing poisoning attacks face two critical limitations: (1) they are easily detected and filtered by safety-aligned guardrails (e.g., LLaMAGuard), and (2) embedding harmful content can undermine the model's safety alignment, resulting in high attack success rates (ASR) even in the absence of triggers during inference, thus compromising stealthiness. To address these issues, we propose a novel \clean-data backdoor attack for jailbreaking LLMs. Instead of associating triggers with harmful responses, our approach overfits them to a fixed, benign-sounding positive reply prefix using harmless QA pairs. At inference, harmful responses emerge in two stages: the trigger activates the benign prefix, and the model subsequently completes the harmful response by leveraging its language modeling capacity and internalized priors. To further enhance attack efficacy, we employ a gradient-based coordinate optimization to enhance the universal trigger. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can effectively jailbreak backdoor various LLMs even under the detection of guardrail models, e.g., an ASR of 86.67% and 85% on LLaMA-3-8B and Qwen-2.5-7B judged by GPT-4o.</p></details> |  |

Using a classical referential game, we investigate how artificial languages evolve when optimised for inductive biases in humans and large language models (LLMs) via Human-Human, LLM-LLM and Human-LLM experiments. We show that referentially grounded vocabularies emerge that enable reliable communication in all conditions, even when humans \textit{and} LLMs collaborate. Comparisons between conditions reveal that languages optimised for LLMs subtly differ from those optimised for humans. Interestingly, interactions between humans and LLMs alleviate these differences and result in vocabularies more human-like than LLM-like. These findings advance our understanding of the role inductive biases in LLMs play in the dynamic nature of human language and contribute to maintaining alignment in human and machine communication. In particular, our work underscores the need to think of new LLM training methods that include human interaction and shows that using communicative success as a reward signal can be a fruitful, novel direction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at IJCAI 2025 (Human-centred AI Track)</p></details> |

Lacking assessment standard, existing benchmarks only contain "factual statements" that rephrase source materials without marking "cognitive statements" that make inference from the given context, making the consistency evaluation and optimization of cognitive statements difficult. Inspired by how an evidence is assessed in the legislative domain, we design a rigorous framework to assess different levels of faithfulness of cognitive statements and create a benchmark dataset where we reveal insightful statistics. We design an annotation pipeline to create larger benchmarks for different LLMs automatically, and the resulting larger-scale CogniBench-L dataset can be used to train accurate cognitive hallucination detection model.

Despite progress in automating optimization formulation from natural language descriptions, Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to generate formally correct and usable models against hallucinations, posing a challenge for reliable automation. Inspired by the success of Reinforcement Learning (RL) in enhancing Large Reasoning Models, we present Solver-Informed Reinforcement Learning (SIRL), a novel framework that significantly improves the authenticity of LLMs for optimization modeling using Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward by leveraging external optimization solvers as verifiers. These verifiers automatically assess the executable code and the instance-level mathematical model represented by the associated LP file, yielding precise and comprehensive feedback signals -- including syntax, feasibility, and solution quality, serving as direct rewards for the RL process. This automated verification process, particularly from classic optimization solvers, also underpins our instance-enhanced self-consistency method to synthesize high-quality training data. Extensive experiments on diverse public benchmarks demonstrate that SIRL achieves state-of-the-art performance, substantially outperforming existing methods in generating accurate and executable optimization models.

Recently, advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed the paradigm in many domains. Despite the success in other fields, current LLMs often fall short in catering to the needs of domain experts like Tibetans, and the potential of LLMs for Tibetan culture is under-explored. The intrinsic reasons are the immense and intricate nature of Tibetan culture as well as the necessity for higher granularity and richness in knowledge. Simultaneously, the complexity and uniqueness of its grammatical structure, coupled with its status as a minority ethnic language, contribute to data scarcity, which remains a fundamental challenge. To alleviate these issues, we introduce Llama-Sunshine (Sun-Shine), the first large language model for Tibetan culture, which is expert in various Tibetan language processing tasks. Sun-Shine incorporates state-of-the-art model architectures optimized for Tibetan's linguistic features. We also propose TIB-STC, a comprehensive dataset comprising diverse Tibetan texts such as literature, religious scripts, news, and conversational data, which is also the first large-scale dataset for Tibetan culture. Though comprehensive experiments, Sun-Shine not only demonstrates a higher level of knowledge expertise for Tibetan culture but also gains preliminary embodied intelligence capabilities in Tibetan language processing tasks, like language modeling, text classification, machine translation, and syntactic analysis. Moreover, it excels in low-resource scenarios, showcasing strong generalization capabilities.</p></details> |  |

While LLMs exhibit impressive fluency and factual recall, their ability to perform complex reasoning-spanning logical deduction, mathematical problem-solving, commonsense inference, and multi-step reasoning-often falls short of human expectations. This survey provides a comprehensive review of emerging techniques enhancing reasoning in LLMs. We categorize existing methods into key approaches, including prompting strategies (e.g., Chain-of-Thought reasoning, Self-Consistency, and Tree-of-Thought reasoning), architectural innovations (e.g., retrieval-augmented models, modular reasoning networks, and neuro-symbolic integration), and learning paradigms (e.g., fine-tuning with reasoning-specific datasets, reinforcement learning, and self-supervised reasoning objectives). Additionally, we explore evaluation frameworks used to assess reasoning in LLMs and highlight open challenges, such as hallucinations, robustness, and reasoning generalization across diverse tasks. By synthesizing recent advancements, this survey aims to provide insights into promising directions for future research and practical applications of reasoning-augmented LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 Pag...</summary><p>9 Pages, 1 Figure, IEEE Format</p></details> |

To address these issues, knowledge graphs (KGs) have been utilized to enhance LLM reasoning through their structured knowledge. However, existing KG-enhanced methods, either retrieval-based or agent-based, encounter difficulties in accurately retrieving knowledge and efficiently traversing KGs at scale. In this work, we introduce graph-constrained reasoning (GCR), a novel framework that bridges structured knowledge in KGs with unstructured reasoning in LLMs. To eliminate hallucinations, GCR ensures faithful KG-grounded reasoning by integrating KG structure into the LLM decoding process through KG-Trie, a trie-based index that encodes KG reasoning paths. KG-Trie constrains the decoding process, allowing LLMs to directly reason on graphs and generate faithful reasoning paths grounded in KGs. Additionally, GCR leverages a lightweight KG-specialized LLM for graph-constrained reasoning alongside a powerful general LLM for inductive reasoning over multiple reasoning paths, resulting in accurate reasoning with zero reasoning hallucination. Extensive experiments on several KGQA benchmarks demonstrate that GCR achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits strong zero-shot generalizability to unseen KGs without additional training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **[Can Large Language Models Be Trusted as Evolutionary Optimizers for Network-Structured Combinatorial Problems?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15081v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in language understanding and reasoning across diverse domains. Recently, there has been increasing interests in utilizing LLMs not merely as assistants in optimization tasks, but as active optimizers, particularly for network-structured combinatorial problems. However, before LLMs can be reliably deployed in this role, a fundamental question must be addressed: Can LLMs iteratively manipulate solutions that consistently adhere to problem constraints? In this work, we propose a systematic framework to evaluate the capacity of LLMs to engage with problem structures. Rather than treating the model as a black-box generator, we adopt the commonly used evolutionary operators as optimizer and propose a comprehensive evaluation framework that rigorously assesses the output fidelity of LLM-generated operators across different stages of the evolutionary process. To enhance robustness, we introduce a hybrid error-correction mechanism that mitigates uncertainty in LLM outputs. Moreover, we develop a cost-efficient population-level optimization strategy that significantly improves efficiency compared to traditional individual-level approaches. Extensive experiments on a representative node-level combinatorial network optimization task demonstrate the effectiveness, adaptability, and inherent limitations of LLM-based operators. Our findings offer new perspectives on the integration of LLMs into evolutionary computation, providing practical insights for scalable optimization in networked systems.</p></details> |  |

While significant progress has been made, existing approaches often fail to account for the inherent heterogeneity of object patterns across different semantic spaces. To address this limitation, we propose the Cooperation of Experts (CoE) framework, which encodes multi-typed information into unified heterogeneous multiplex networks. By overcoming modality and connection differences, CoE provides a powerful and flexible model for capturing the intricate structures of real-world complex data. In our framework, dedicated encoders act as domain-specific experts, each specializing in learning distinct relational patterns in specific semantic spaces. To enhance robustness and extract complementary knowledge, these experts collaborate through a novel large margin mechanism supported by a tailored optimization strategy. Rigorous theoretical analyses guarantee the framework's feasibility and stability, while extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate its superior performance and broad applicability.

We address this critical weak-to-strong (W2S) generalization challenge by proposing a novel method aimed at improving weak experts, by training on the same limited human-level data, enabling them to generalize to complex, super-human-level tasks. Our approach, called \textbf{EnsemW2S}, employs a token-level ensemble strategy that iteratively combines multiple weak experts, systematically addressing the shortcomings identified in preceding iterations. By continuously refining these weak models, we significantly enhance their collective ability to supervise stronger student models. We extensively evaluate the generalization performance of both the ensemble of weak experts and the subsequent strong student model across in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets. For OOD, we specifically introduce question difficulty as an additional dimension for defining distributional shifts. Our empirical results demonstrate notable improvements, achieving 4\%, and 3.2\% improvements on ID datasets and, upto 6\% and 2.28\% on OOD datasets for experts and student models respectively, underscoring the effectiveness of our proposed method in advancing W2S generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Super...</summary><p>Superalignment. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2410.04571</p></details> |

In pursuit of artificial general intelligence (AGI), there is a growing need for models that not only execute commands or retrieve information but also learn, reason, and generate new knowledge by formulating novel hypotheses and theories that deepen our understanding of the world. Guided by Peirce's framework of abduction, deduction, and induction, this survey offers a structured lens to examine LLM-based hypothesis discovery. We synthesize existing work in hypothesis generation, application, and validation, identifying both key achievements and critical gaps. By unifying these threads, we illuminate how LLMs might evolve from mere ``information executors'' into engines of genuine innovation, potentially transforming research, science, and real-world problem solving.</p></details> |  |

ED is a hard-constrained optimization problem solved on a day-ahead timescale by grid operators to minimize electricity generation costs while accounting for physical and engineering constraints. Numerous approaches have been proposed, but these typically require either mathematical formulations, face convergence issues, or depend on extensive labeled data and training time. This work implements LLMs enhanced with reasoning capabilities to address the classic lossless ED problem. The proposed approach avoids the need for explicit mathematical formulations, does not suffer from convergence challenges, and requires neither labeled data nor extensive training. A few-shot learning technique is utilized in two different prompting contexts. The IEEE 118-bus system with 19 generation units serves as the evaluation benchmark. Results demonstrate that various prompting strategies enable LLMs to effectively solve the ED problem, offering a convenient and efficient alternative. Consequently, this approach presents a promising future solution for ED tasks, particularly when foundational power system models are available.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 3 figures, Accepted, 2025 IEEE Energy Conversion Conference and Expo (ECCE 2025), Philadelphia, PA</p></details> |

Prior research has explored various avenues to enhance alignment efficiency, primarily through minimal-data training or data-driven activations to identify key attention heads. However, these approaches inherently introduce data dependency, which hinders generalization and reusability. To address this issue and enhance model alignment efficiency, we propose the \textit{\textbf{A}ttention \textbf{L}ocalization and \textbf{P}runing \textbf{S}trategy (\textbf{ALPS})}, an efficient algorithm that localizes the most task-sensitive attention heads and prunes by restricting attention training updates to these heads, thereby reducing alignment costs. Experimental results demonstrate that our method activates only \textbf{10\%} of attention parameters during fine-tuning while achieving a \textbf{2\%} performance improvement over baselines on three tasks. Moreover, the identified task-specific heads are transferable across datasets and mitigate knowledge forgetting. Our work and findings provide a novel perspective on efficient LLM alignment.

Traditional large language models (LLMs) often fall short in navigating this nuanced problem due to limited reasoning capacity. We hypothesize that recent advances in large reasoning models (LRMs) can better handle such structured, domain-specific inference. To investigate this, we introduce AgReason, the first expert-curated open-ended science benchmark with 100 questions for agricultural reasoning. Evaluations across thirteen open-source and proprietary models reveal that LRMs outperform conventional ones, though notable challenges persist, with the strongest Gemini-based baseline achieving 36% accuracy. We also present AgThoughts, a large-scale dataset of 44.6K question-answer pairs generated with human oversight and equipped with synthetically generated reasoning traces. Using AgThoughts, we develop AgThinker, a suite of small reasoning models that can be run on consumer-grade GPUs, and show that our dataset can be effective in unlocking agricultural reasoning abilities in LLMs. Our project page is here: https://baskargroup.github.io/Ag_reasoning/</p></details> |  |

But RAG may also lead to performance degradation due to imperfect retrieval and the model's limited ability to leverage retrieved content. In this work, we evaluate the robustness of LLMs in practical RAG setups (henceforth retrieval robustness). We focus on three research questions: (1) whether RAG is always better than non-RAG; (2) whether more retrieved documents always lead to better performance; (3) and whether document orders impact results. To facilitate this study, we establish a benchmark of 1500 open-domain questions, each with retrieved documents from Wikipedia. We introduce three robustness metrics, each corresponds to one research question. Our comprehensive experiments, involving 11 LLMs and 3 prompting strategies, reveal that all of these LLMs exhibit surprisingly high retrieval robustness; nonetheless, different degrees of imperfect robustness hinders them from fully utilizing the benefits of RAG.</p></details> | 19 pages |

Its ability to operate continuously and non-intrusively while preserving user privacy makes it particularly suitable for health monitoring. However, existing WiFi sensing systems struggle to generalize in real-world settings, largely due to datasets collected in controlled environments with homogeneous hardware and fragmented, session-based recordings that fail to reflect continuous daily activity. We present CSI-Bench, a large-scale, in-the-wild benchmark dataset collected using commercial WiFi edge devices across 26 diverse indoor environments with 35 real users. Spanning over 461 hours of effective data, CSI-Bench captures realistic signal variability under natural conditions. It includes task-specific datasets for fall detection, breathing monitoring, localization, and motion source recognition, as well as a co-labeled multitask dataset with joint annotations for user identity, activity, and proximity. To support the development of robust and generalizable models, CSI-Bench provides standardized evaluation splits and baseline results for both single-task and multi-task learning. CSI-Bench offers a foundation for scalable, privacy-preserving WiFi sensing systems in health and broader human-centric applications.</p></details> | 21 pages, 4 figures |

However, in applications with large visual inputs, such as video understanding, processing a large number of visual tokens in cross-attention layers leads to high memory demands and often necessitates distributed computation across multiple GPUs. Existing distributed attention mechanisms face significant communication overheads, making cross-attention layers a critical bottleneck for efficient training and inference of MLLMs. To address this, we propose LV-XAttn, a distributed, exact cross-attention mechanism with minimal communication overhead. We observe that in applications involving large visual inputs, the size of the query block is typically much smaller than that of the key-value blocks. Thus, in LV-XAttn we keep the large key-value blocks locally on each GPU and exchange smaller query blocks across GPUs. We also introduce an efficient activation recomputation technique to support longer visual context. We theoretically analyze the communication benefits of LV-XAttn and show that it can achieve speedups for a wide range of models. Our evaluations with Llama 3-V, mPLUG-Owl3 and OpenFlamingo models find that LV-XAttn achieves up to 10.62$\times$ end-to-end speedup compared to existing approaches.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, Wanda++ improves the pruning score with regional gradients for the first time and proposes an efficient regional optimization method to minimize pruning-induced output discrepancies between the dense and sparse decoder output. Notably, Wanda++ improves perplexity by up to 32\% over Wanda in the language modeling task and generalizes effectively to downstream tasks. Moreover, despite updating weights with regional optimization, Wanda++ remains orthogonal to sparsity-aware fine-tuning, further reducing perplexity with LoRA in great extend. Our approach is lightweight, pruning a 7B LLaMA model in under 10 minutes on a single H100 GPU.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted at ACL 2025 Findings</p></details> |

We hypothesize that such inefficiencies stem from LRMs' limited capability to dynamically select the proper modular reasoning strategies, termed thinking patterns at the right position. To investigate this hypothesis, we propose a dynamic optimization framework that segments model-generated reasoning paths into distinct thinking patterns, systematically identifying and promoting beneficial patterns that improve the answer while removing detrimental ones. Empirical analysis confirms that our optimized thinking paths yield more concise yet sufficiently informative trajectories, enhancing reasoning efficiency by reducing attention FLOPs by up to 47% while maintaining accuracy for originally correct responses. Moreover, a non-trivial portion of originally incorrect responses are transformed into correct ones, achieving a 15.6% accuracy improvement with reduced length. Motivated by the improvement brought by the optimized thinking paths, we apply a preference optimization technique supported by a pairwise dataset contrasting suboptimal and optimal reasoning paths. Experimental evaluations across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks reveal that our method notably reduces computational overhead while simultaneously improving reasoning accuracy, achieving up to a 12% accuracy improvement and reducing token usage from approximately 5,000 to 3,000 tokens.</p></details> | Work In Progress |

Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential solutions by leveraging their world knowledge to recommend novel content outside these loops. A key challenge is aligning LLMs with user preferences while preserving their knowledge and reasoning. To enhance planning for new user interests using LLMs, this paper introduces a novel approach that combines hierarchical planning with LLM inference-time scaling. This method aims to improve recommendation relevancy without compromising novelty. We decouple novelty and user-alignment, training separate LLMs for each objective. We then scale up the novelty-focused LLM's inference and select the best-of-n predictions using the user-aligned LLM. Live experiments demonstrate efficacy, showing significant gains in both user satisfaction (measured by watch activity and active user counts) and exploration diversity.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACL'2...</summary><p>ACL'25 (Industry) Oral</p></details> |

This study explores the implications of LLMs' responses on the representation of mass atrocity memory, examining whether generative AI systems contribute to prosthetic memory, i.e., mediated experiences of historical events, or to what we term "prosthetic denial," the AI-mediated erasure or distortion of atrocity memories. We argue that LLMs function as interfaces that can elicit prosthetic memories and, therefore, act as experiential sites for memory transmission, but also introduce risks of denialism, particularly when their outputs align with contested or revisionist narratives. To empirically assess these risks, we conducted a comparative audit of five LLMs (Claude, GPT, Llama, Mixtral, and Gemini) across four historical case studies: the Holodomor, the Holocaust, the Cambodian Genocide, and the genocide against the Tutsis in Rwanda. Each model was prompted with questions addressing common denialist claims in English and an alternative language relevant to each case (Ukrainian, German, Khmer, and French). Our findings reveal that while LLMs generally produce accurate responses for widely documented events like the Holocaust, significant inconsistencies and susceptibility to denialist framings are observed for more underrepresented cases like the Cambodian Genocide. The disparities highlight the influence of training data availability and the probabilistic nature of LLM responses on memory integrity. We conclude that while LLMs extend the concept of prosthetic memory, their unmoderated use risks reinforcing historical denialism, raising ethical concerns for (digital) memory preservation, and potentially challenging the advantageous role of technology associated with the original values of prosthetic memory.</p></details> |  |
| **[Broad Spectrum Structure Discovery in Large-Scale Higher-Order Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21748v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Complex systems are often driven by higher-order interactions among multiple units, naturally represented as hypergraphs. Understanding dependency structures within these hypergraphs is crucial for understanding and predicting the behavior of complex systems but is made challenging by their combinatorial complexity and computational demands. In this paper, we introduce a class of probabilistic models that efficiently represents and discovers a broad spectrum of mesoscale structure in large-scale hypergraphs. The key insight enabling this approach is to treat classes of similar units as themselves nodes in a latent hypergraph. By modeling observed node interactions through latent interactions among classes using low-rank representations, our approach tractably captures rich structural patterns while ensuring model identifiability. This allows for direct interpretation of distinct node- and class-level structures. Empirically, our model improves link prediction over state-of-the-art methods and discovers interpretable structures in diverse real-world systems, including pharmacological and social networks, advancing the ability to incorporate large-scale higher-order data into the scientific process.</p></details> |  |
| **[AI-Supported Platform for System Monitoring and Decision-Making in Nuclear Waste Management with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21741v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nuclear waste management requires rigorous regulatory compliance assessment, demanding advanced decision-support systems capable of addressing complex legal, environmental, and safety considerations. This paper presents a multi-agent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that integrates large language models (LLMs) with document retrieval mechanisms to enhance decision accuracy through structured agent collaboration. Through a structured 10-round discussion model, agents collaborate to assess regulatory compliance and safety requirements while maintaining document-grounded responses. Implemented on consumer-grade hardware, the system leverages Llama 3.2 and mxbai-embed-large-v1 embeddings for efficient retrieval and semantic representation. A case study of a proposed temporary nuclear waste storage site near Winslow, Arizona, demonstrates the framework's effectiveness. Results show the Regulatory Agent achieves consistently higher relevance scores in maintaining alignment with legal frameworks, while the Safety Agent effectively manages complex risk assessments requiring multifaceted analysis. The system demonstrates progressive improvement in agreement rates between agents across discussion rounds while semantic drift decreases, indicating enhanced decision-making consistency and response coherence. The system ensures regulatory decisions remain factually grounded, dynamically adapting to evolving regulatory frameworks through real-time document retrieval. By balancing automated assessment with human oversight, this framework offers a scalable and transparent approach to regulatory governance. These findings underscore the potential of AI-driven, multi-agent systems in advancing evidence-based, accountable, and adaptive decision-making for high-stakes environmental management scenarios.</p></details> |  |

To counteract unwanted scraping, many sites use tools like the Robots Exclusion Protocol (REP), which places a robots.txt file at the site root to dictate scraper behavior. Yet, the efficacy of the REP is not well-understood. Anecdotal evidence suggests some bots comply poorly with it, but no rigorous study exists to support (or refute) this claim. To understand the merits and limits of the REP, we conduct the first large-scale study of web scraper compliance with robots.txt directives using anonymized web logs from our institution. We analyze the behavior of 130 self-declared bots (and many anonymous ones) over 40 days, using a series of controlled robots.txt experiments. We find that bots are less likely to comply with stricter robots.txt directives, and that certain categories of bots, including AI search crawlers, rarely check robots.txt at all. These findings suggest that relying on robots.txt files to prevent unwanted scraping is risky and highlight the need for alternative approaches.</p></details> | 13 pages |

Outliers often cause considerable quantization errors, leading to degraded model performance. Identifying and addressing these outliers can enhance the accuracy and efficiency of the quantization process, enabling smoother deployment on edge devices or specialized hardware. Recent studies have identified two common types of outliers in LLMs: massive activations and channel-wise outliers. While numerous quantization algorithms have been proposed to mitigate their effects and maintain satisfactory accuracy, few have thoroughly explored the root causes of these outliers in depth. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive investigation into the formation mechanisms of these outliers and propose potential strategies to mitigate their occurrence. Ultimately, we introduce some efficient approaches to eliminate most massive activations and channel-wise outliers with minimal impact on accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Explainability of Large Language Models using SMILE: Statistical Model-agnostic Interpretability with Local Explanations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21657v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models like GPT, LLAMA, and Claude have become incredibly powerful at generating text, but they are still black boxes, so it is hard to understand how they decide what to say. That lack of transparency can be problematic, especially in fields where trust and accountability matter. To help with this, we introduce SMILE, a new method that explains how these models respond to different parts of a prompt. SMILE is model-agnostic and works by slightly changing the input, measuring how the output changes, and then highlighting which words had the most impact. Create simple visual heat maps showing which parts of a prompt matter the most. We tested SMILE on several leading LLMs and used metrics such as accuracy, consistency, stability, and fidelity to show that it gives clear and reliable explanations. By making these models easier to understand, SMILE brings us one step closer to making AI more transparent and trustworthy.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2412.16277</p></details> |

Multimodal haptic sensing provides a promising avenue for inferring such properties, yet progress has been constrained by the lack of large, diverse, and realistic haptic datasets. In this work, we introduce the CLAMP device, a low-cost (<\$200) sensorized reacher-grabber designed to collect large-scale, in-the-wild multimodal haptic data from non-expert users in everyday settings. We deployed 16 CLAMP devices to 41 participants, resulting in the CLAMP dataset, the largest open-source multimodal haptic dataset to date, comprising 12.3 million datapoints across 5357 household objects. Using this dataset, we train a haptic encoder that can infer material and compliance object properties from multimodal haptic data. We leverage this encoder to create the CLAMP model, a visuo-haptic perception model for material recognition that generalizes to novel objects and three robot embodiments with minimal finetuning. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in three real-world robot manipulation tasks: sorting recyclable and non-recyclable waste, retrieving objects from a cluttered bag, and distinguishing overripe from ripe bananas. Our results show that large-scale, in-the-wild haptic data collection can unlock new capabilities for generalizable robot manipulation.

Existing studies have explored the role of LLMs in combating misinformation, but there is still a lack of fine-grained analysis on the specific aspects and extent to which LLMs are influenced by misinformation. To bridge this gap, we present MisBench, the current largest and most comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLMs' behavior and knowledge preference toward misinformation. MisBench consists of 10,346,712 pieces of misinformation, which uniquely considers both knowledge-based conflicts and stylistic variations in misinformation. Empirical results reveal that while LLMs demonstrate comparable abilities in discerning misinformation, they still remain susceptible to knowledge conflicts and stylistic variations. Based on these findings, we further propose a novel approach called Reconstruct to Discriminate (RtD) to strengthen LLMs' ability to detect misinformation. Our study provides valuable insights into LLMs' interactions with misinformation, and we believe MisBench can serve as an effective benchmark for evaluating LLM-based detectors and enhancing their reliability in real-world applications.

Current inference-time interventions, while training-free, struggle to maintain accuracy in open-ended and long-form generation scenarios. We introduce the Confidence-Aware Attention Calibration (CAAC) framework to address this challenge by targeting two key biases: spatial perception bias, which distributes attention disproportionately across image tokens, and modality bias, which shifts focus from visual to textual inputs over time. CAAC employs a two-step approach: Visual-Token Calibration (VTC) to balance attention across visual tokens, and Adaptive Attention Re-Scaling (AAR) to reinforce visual grounding based on the model's confidence. This confidence-driven adjustment ensures consistent visual alignment during generation. Experiments on CHAIR, AMBER, and POPE benchmarks demonstrate that CAAC outperforms baselines, particularly in long-form generations, effectively reducing hallucination.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond 'Aha!': Toward Systematic Meta-Abilities Alignment in Large Reasoning Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10554v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large reasoning models (LRMs) already possess a latent capacity for long chain-of-thought reasoning. Prior work has shown that outcome-based reinforcement learning (RL) can incidentally elicit advanced reasoning behaviors such as self-correction, backtracking, and verification phenomena often referred to as the model's "aha moment". However, the timing and consistency of these emergent behaviors remain unpredictable and uncontrollable, limiting the scalability and reliability of LRMs' reasoning capabilities. To address these limitations, we move beyond reliance on prompts and coincidental "aha moments". Instead, we explicitly align models with three meta-abilities: deduction, induction, and abduction, using automatically generated, self-verifiable tasks. Our three stage-pipeline individual alignment, parameter-space merging, and domain-specific reinforcement learning, boosting performance by over 10\% relative to instruction-tuned baselines. Furthermore, domain-specific RL from the aligned checkpoint yields an additional gain in performance ceiling for both 7B and 32B models across math, coding, and science benchmarks, demonstrating that explicit meta-ability alignment offers a scalable and dependable foundation for reasoning.

Meanwhile, Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable out-of-domain generalizability to novel tasks. To demonstrate LLMs' potential for molecule optimization, we introduce MuMOInstruct, the first high-quality instruction-tuning dataset specifically focused on complex multi-property molecule optimization tasks. Leveraging MuMOInstruct, we develop GeLLMOs, a series of instruction-tuned LLMs for molecule optimization. Extensive evaluations across 5 in-domain and 5 out-of-domain tasks demonstrate that GeLLMOs consistently outperform state-of-the-art baselines. GeLLMOs also exhibit outstanding zero-shot generalization to unseen tasks, significantly outperforming powerful closed-source LLMs. Such strong generalizability demonstrates the tremendous potential of GeLLMOs as foundational models for molecule optimization, thereby tackling novel optimization tasks without resource-intensive retraining. MuMOInstruct, models, and code are accessible through https://github.com/ninglab/GeLLMO.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL Main 2025.

It is a critical component of efficient perception and decision-making in humans and advanced embodied agents. Recently, the use of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as central planning and decision-making modules in robotic systems has gained extensive attention. However, despite the importance of active perception in embodied intelligence, there is little to no exploration of how MLLMs can be equipped with or learn active perception capabilities. In this paper, we first provide a systematic definition of MLLM-based active perception tasks. We point out that the recently proposed GPT-o3 model's zoom-in search strategy can be regarded as a special case of active perception; however, it still suffers from low search efficiency and inaccurate region selection. To address these issues, we propose ACTIVE-O3, a purely reinforcement learning based training framework built on top of GRPO, designed to equip MLLMs with active perception capabilities. We further establish a comprehensive benchmark suite to evaluate ACTIVE-O3 across both general open-world tasks, such as small-object and dense object grounding, and domain-specific scenarios, including small object detection in remote sensing and autonomous driving, as well as fine-grained interactive segmentation. In addition, ACTIVE-O3 also demonstrates strong zero-shot reasoning abilities on the V* Benchmark, without relying on any explicit reasoning data. We hope that our work can provide a simple codebase and evaluation protocol to facilitate future research on active perception in MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://aim-uofa.github.io/ACTIVE-o3</p></details> |

Reinforcement learning from automated verification offers an alternative, but it incurs scalability limitations due to dependency upon human-designed verifiers. Self-training, where the model's own judgment provides the supervisory signal, presents a compelling direction. We propose an online self-training reinforcement learning algorithm that leverages the model's self-consistency to infer correctness signals and train without any ground-truth supervision. We apply the algorithm to challenging mathematical reasoning tasks and show that it quickly reaches performance levels rivaling reinforcement-learning methods trained explicitly on gold-standard answers. Additionally, we analyze inherent limitations of the algorithm, highlighting how the self-generated proxy reward initially correlated with correctness can incentivize reward hacking, where confidently incorrect outputs are favored. Our results illustrate how self-supervised improvement can achieve significant performance gains without external labels, while also revealing its fundamental challenges.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://self-rewarding-llm-training.github.io/</p></details> |

Although distilled Small Language Models (SLMs) significantly enhance efficiency, their performance suffers as they fail to follow LLMs' reasoning paths. Luckily, we reveal that only a small fraction of tokens genuinely diverge reasoning paths between LLMs and SLMs. Most generated tokens are either identical or exhibit neutral differences, such as minor variations in abbreviations or expressions. Leveraging this insight, we introduce **Roads to Rome (R2R)**, a neural token routing method that selectively utilizes LLMs only for these critical, path-divergent tokens, while leaving the majority of token generation to the SLM. We also develop an automatic data generation pipeline that identifies divergent tokens and generates token-level routing labels to train the lightweight router. We apply R2R to combine R1-1.5B and R1-32B models from the DeepSeek family, and evaluate on challenging math, coding, and QA benchmarks. With an average activated parameter size of 5.6B, R2R surpasses the average accuracy of R1-7B by 1.6x, outperforming even the R1-14B model. Compared to R1-32B, it delivers a 2.8x wall-clock speedup with comparable performance, advancing the Pareto frontier of test-time scaling efficiency.

However, given a fixed training budget, the sampling proportions of these different domains significantly impact the model's performance. How can we determine the domain weights across different data domains to train the best-performing model within constrained computational resources? In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of existing data mixture methods. First, we propose a fine-grained categorization of existing methods, extending beyond the previous offline and online classification. Offline methods are further grouped into heuristic-based, algorithm-based, and function fitting-based methods. For online methods, we categorize them into three groups: online min-max optimization, online mixing law, and other approaches by drawing connections with the optimization frameworks underlying offline methods. Second, we summarize the problem formulations, representative algorithms for each subtype of offline and online methods, and clarify the relationships and distinctions among them. Finally, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each method and highlight key challenges in the field of data mixture.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first version of this paper was submitted to ACL ARR 2025 February Submission</p></details> |

This is nontrivial in part because it is difficult to find tasks which the models have not encountered during training. Utilizing symbolic graphics programs, we propose a domain well-suited to test multiple spatial-semantic reasoning skills of LLMs. Popular in computer graphics, these programs procedurally generate visual data. While LLMs exhibit impressive skills in general program synthesis and analysis, symbolic graphics programs offer a new layer of evaluation: they allow us to test an LLM's ability to answer semantic questions about the images or 3D geometries without a vision encoder. To semantically understand the symbolic programs, LLMs would need to possess the ability to "imagine" and reason how the corresponding graphics content would look with only the symbolic description of the local curvatures and strokes. We use this task to evaluate LLMs by creating a large benchmark for the semantic visual understanding of symbolic graphics programs, built procedurally with minimal human effort. Particular emphasis is placed on transformations of images that leave the image level semantics invariant while introducing significant changes to the underlying program. We evaluate commercial and open-source LLMs on our benchmark to assess their ability to reason about visual output of programs, finding that LLMs considered stronger at reasoning generally perform better. Lastly, we introduce a novel method to improve this ability -- Symbolic Instruction Tuning (SIT), in which the LLM is finetuned with pre-collected instruction data on symbolic graphics programs. Interestingly, we find that SIT not only improves LLM's understanding on symbolic programs, but it also improves general reasoning ability on various other benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025 Spotlight (v4: 47 pages, 26 figures, project page: https://sgp-bench.github.io/)</p></details> |

Current benchmarks often assess short factual answers, overlooking the critical ability to generate structured, multi-record tabular outputs from parametric knowledge. We demonstrate that this relational fact retrieval is substantially more difficult than isolated point-wise queries, even when individual facts are known to the model, exposing distinct failure modes sensitive to output dimensionality (e.g., number of attributes or records). To systematically evaluate this under-explored capability, we introduce RelationalFactQA, a new benchmark featuring diverse natural language questions (paired with SQL) and gold-standard tabular answers, specifically designed to assess knowledge retrieval in a structured format. RelationalFactQA enables analysis across varying query complexities, output sizes, and data characteristics. Our experiments reveal that even state-of-the-art LLMs struggle significantly, not exceeding 25% factual accuracy in generating relational outputs, with performance notably degrading as output dimensionality increases. These findings underscore critical limitations in current LLMs' ability to synthesize structured factual knowledge and establish RelationalFactQA as a crucial resource for measuring future progress in LLM factuality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Large Language Models for Active Merchant Non-player Characters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11189v3)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We highlight two significant issues leading to the passivity of current merchant non-player characters (NPCs): pricing and communication. While immersive interactions with active NPCs have been a focus, price negotiations between merchant NPCs and players remain underexplored. First, passive pricing refers to the limited ability of merchants to modify predefined item prices. Second, passive communication means that merchants can only interact with players in a scripted manner. To tackle these issues and create an active merchant NPC, we propose a merchant framework based on large language models (LLMs), called MART, which consists of an appraiser module and a negotiator module. We conducted two experiments to explore various implementation options under different training methods and LLM sizes, considering a range of possible game environments. Our findings indicate that finetuning methods, such as supervised finetuning (SFT) and knowledge distillation (KD), are effective in using smaller LLMs to implement active merchant NPCs. Additionally, we found three irregular cases arising from the responses of LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IJCAI 2025</p></details> |

Previous attempts to reduce foundation model size fall short of fully addressing the problem, as they end up increasing computational load through additional training steps. Recent works reveal that deep neural networks exhibit internal representation similarities. While inter-network similarities have enabled techniques such as model stitching and merging, intra-network similarities remain underexplored for improving efficiency. In this paper, we propose Transformer Blocks Approximation (TBA), a novel method that leverages intra-network similarities to identify and approximate transformer blocks in large vision models. TBA replaces these blocks using lightweight, closed-form transformations, without retraining or fine-tuning the rest of the model. The proposed method reduces the number of parameters while having minimal impact on the downstream task. We validate the effectiveness and generalizability of TBA through extensive experiments across multiple datasets (e.g., Imagenet-1k and CIFAR100) and state-of-the-art pretrained vision models (e.g, ViT, DiNO-v2, and DEiT).</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 14 figures, 16 tables</p></details> |

Existing infrequent communication methods like Local SGD were designed to synchronize only model parameters and cannot be trivially applied to adaptive optimizers due to additional optimizer states. Current approaches extending Local SGD either lack convergence guarantees or require synchronizing all optimizer states, tripling communication costs. We propose Desynced Low Communication Adaptive Optimizers (DES-LOC), a family of optimizers assigning independent synchronization periods to parameters and momenta, enabling lower communication costs while preserving convergence. Through extensive experiments on language models of up to 1.7B, we show that DES-LOC can communicate 170x less than DDP and 2x less than the previous state-of-the-art Local ADAM. Furthermore, unlike previous heuristic approaches, DES-LOC is suited for practical training scenarios prone to system failures. DES-LOC offers a scalable, bandwidth-efficient, and fault-tolerant solution for foundation model training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Keywo...</summary><p>Keywords: Distributed Training, Foundation Models, Large Language Models, Optimizers, Communication Efficiency, Federated Learning, Distributed Systems, Optimization Theory, Scaling, Robustness.

| **[AgriFM: A Multi-source Temporal Remote Sensing Foundation Model for Crop Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21357v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate crop mapping fundamentally relies on modeling multi-scale spatiotemporal patterns, where spatial scales range from individual field textures to landscape-level context, and temporal scales capture both short-term phenological transitions and full growing-season dynamics. Transformer-based remote sensing foundation models (RSFMs) offer promising potential for crop mapping due to their innate ability for unified spatiotemporal processing. However, current RSFMs remain suboptimal for crop mapping: they either employ fixed spatiotemporal windows that ignore the multi-scale nature of crop systems or completely disregard temporal information by focusing solely on spatial patterns. To bridge these gaps, we present AgriFM, a multi-source remote sensing foundation model specifically designed for agricultural crop mapping. Our approach begins by establishing the necessity of simultaneous hierarchical spatiotemporal feature extraction, leading to the development of a modified Video Swin Transformer architecture where temporal down-sampling is synchronized with spatial scaling operations. This modified backbone enables efficient unified processing of long time-series satellite inputs. AgriFM leverages temporally rich data streams from three satellite sources including MODIS, Landsat-8/9 and Sentinel-2, and is pre-trained on a global representative dataset comprising over 25 million image samples supervised by land cover products. The resulting framework incorporates a versatile decoder architecture that dynamically fuses these learned spatiotemporal representations, supporting diverse downstream tasks. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate AgriFM's superior performance over conventional deep learning approaches and state-of-the-art general-purpose RSFMs across all downstream tasks. Codes will be available at https://github.com/flyakon/AgriFM.</p></details> |  |

This approach enables zero-shot adaptation and real-time processing while incorporating domain knowledge. Speech impairment severity and gender conditioned adapter experts are dynamically combined using on-the-fly predicted speaker-dependent routing parameters. KL-divergence is used to further enforce diversity among experts and their generalization to unseen speakers. Experimental results on the UASpeech corpus suggest that on-the-fly MoE-based adaptation produces statistically significant WER reductions of up to 1.34% absolute (6.36% relative) over the unadapted baseline HuBERT/WavLM models. Consistent WER reductions of up to 2.55% absolute (11.44% relative) and RTF speedups of up to 7 times are obtained over batch-mode adaptation across varying speaker-level data quantities. The lowest published WER of 16.35% (46.77% on very low intelligibility) is obtained.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Interspeech 2025</p></details> |
| **[Subspecialty-Specific Foundation Model for Intelligent Gastrointestinal Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21928v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gastrointestinal (GI) diseases represent a clinically significant burden, necessitating precise diagnostic approaches to optimize patient outcomes. Conventional histopathological diagnosis, heavily reliant on the subjective interpretation of pathologists, suffers from limited reproducibility and diagnostic variability. To overcome these limitations and address the lack of pathology-specific foundation models for GI diseases, we develop Digepath, a specialized foundation model for GI pathology. Our framework introduces a dual-phase iterative optimization strategy combining pretraining with fine-screening, specifically designed to address the detection of sparsely distributed lesion areas in whole-slide images. Digepath is pretrained on more than 353 million image patches from over 200,000 hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides of GI diseases. It attains state-of-the-art performance on 33 out of 34 tasks related to GI pathology, including pathological diagnosis, molecular prediction, gene mutation prediction, and prognosis evaluation, particularly in diagnostically ambiguous cases and resolution-agnostic tissue classification.We further translate the intelligent screening module for early GI cancer and achieve near-perfect 99.6% sensitivity across 9 independent medical institutions nationwide. The outstanding performance of Digepath highlights its potential to bridge critical gaps in histopathological practice. This work not only advances AI-driven precision pathology for GI diseases but also establishes a transferable paradigm for other pathology subspecialties.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Completion: A Foundation Model for General Knowledge Graph Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21926v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV), the successful application of foundation models across diverse tasks has demonstrated their remarkable potential. However, despite the rich structural and textual information embedded in knowledge graphs (KGs), existing research of foundation model for KG has primarily focused on their structural aspects, with most efforts restricted to in-KG tasks (e.g., knowledge graph completion, KGC). This limitation has hindered progress in addressing more challenging out-of-KG tasks. In this paper, we introduce MERRY, a foundation model for general knowledge graph reasoning, and investigate its performance across two task categories: in-KG reasoning tasks (e.g., KGC) and out-of-KG tasks (e.g., KG question answering, KGQA). We not only utilize the structural information, but also the textual information in KGs. Specifically, we propose a multi-perspective Conditional Message Passing (CMP) encoding architecture to bridge the gap between textual and structural modalities, enabling their seamless integration. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic residual fusion module to selectively retain relevant textual information and a flexible edge scoring mechanism to adapt to diverse downstream tasks. Comprehensive evaluations on 28 datasets demonstrate that MERRY outperforms existing baselines in most scenarios, showcasing strong reasoning capabilities within KGs and excellent generalization to out-of-KG tasks such as KGQA.</p></details> | ACL 2025 Findings |
| **[Towards Robust Automated Perceptual Voice Quality Assessment with Speech Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21356v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Perceptual voice quality assessment is essential for diagnosing and monitoring voice disorders. Traditionally, expert raters use scales such as the CAPE-V and GRBAS. However, these are subjective and prone to inter-rater variability, motivating the need for automated, objective assessment methods. This study proposes VOQANet, a deep learning framework with an attention mechanism that leverages a Speech Foundation Model (SFM) to extract high-level acoustic and prosodic information from raw speech. To improve robustness and interpretability, we introduce VOQANet+, which integrates handcrafted acoustic features such as jitter, shimmer, and harmonics-to-noise ratio (HNR) with SFM embeddings into a hybrid representation. Unlike prior work focusing only on vowel-based phonation (PVQD-A subset) from the Perceptual Voice Quality Dataset (PVQD), we evaluate our models on both vowel-based and sentence-level speech (PVQD-S subset) for better generalizability. Results show that sentence-based input outperforms vowel-based input, particularly at the patient level, highlighting the benefit of longer utterances for capturing voice attributes. VOQANet consistently surpasses baseline methods in root mean squared error and Pearson correlation across CAPE-V and GRBAS dimensions, with VOQANet+ achieving further improvements. Additional tests under noisy conditions show that VOQANet+ maintains high prediction accuracy, supporting its use in real-world and telehealth settings. These findings demonstrate the value of combining SFM embeddings with domain-informed acoustic features for interpretable and robust voice quality assessment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Symbolic Foundation Regressor on Complex Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21879v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In science, we are interested not only in forecasting but also in understanding how predictions are made, specifically what the interpretable underlying model looks like. Data-driven machine learning technology can significantly streamline the complex and time-consuming traditional manual process of discovering scientific laws, helping us gain insights into fundamental issues in modern science. In this work, we introduce a pre-trained symbolic foundation regressor that can effectively compress complex data with numerous interacting variables while producing interpretable physical representations. Our model has been rigorously tested on non-network symbolic regression, symbolic regression on complex networks, and the inference of network dynamics across various domains, including physics, biochemistry, ecology, and epidemiology. The results indicate a remarkable improvement in equation inference efficiency, being three times more effective than baseline approaches while maintaining accurate predictions. Furthermore, we apply our model to uncover more intuitive laws of interaction transmission from global epidemic outbreak data, achieving optimal data fitting. This model extends the application boundary of pre-trained symbolic regression models to complex networks, and we believe it provides a foundational solution for revealing the hidden mechanisms behind changes in complex phenomena, enhancing interpretability, and inspiring further scientific discoveries.</p></details> | 60 pages |

To make BMA tractable under foundation models, we introduce trainable linear classifiers that take frozen features from the pre-trained foundation models as inputs. The model posteriors over the linear classifiers tell us which linear heads and frozen features are better suited for a given dataset, resulting in a principled model ensembling method. Furthermore, we propose a computationally cheaper, optimizable model averaging scheme (OMA). In OMA, we directly optimize the model ensemble weights, just like those weights based on model posterior distributions in BMA, by reducing the amount of surprise (expected entropy of the predictions) we get from predictions of ensembled models. With the rapid development of foundation models, these approaches will enable the incorporation of future, possibly significantly better foundation models to enhance the performance of challenging classification tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[TS-RAG: Retrieval-Augmented Generation based Time Series Foundation Models are Stronger Zero-Shot Forecaster](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07649v3)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) and Foundation Models (FMs) have recently become prevalent for time series forecasting tasks. While fine-tuning LLMs enables domain adaptation, they often struggle to generalize across diverse and unseen datasets. Moreover, existing Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) still face challenges in handling non-stationary dynamics and distribution shifts, largely due to the lack of effective mechanisms for adaptation. To this end, we present TS-RAG, a retrieval-augmented generation framework for time series forecasting that enhances the generalization and interpretability of TSFMs. Specifically, TS-RAG leverages pre-trained time series encoders to retrieve semantically relevant segments from a dedicated knowledge base, enriching the contextual representation of the input query. Furthermore, we propose an Adaptive Retrieval Mixer (ARM) module that dynamically fuses the retrieved patterns with the TSFM's internal representation, improving forecasting accuracy without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. Thorough empirical studies on seven public benchmark datasets demonstrate that TS-RAG achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot forecasting performance, outperforming the existing TSFMs by up to 6.84% across diverse domains while also providing desirable interpretability.</p></details> |  |
| **[LaX: Boosting Low-Rank Training of Foundation Models via Latent Crossing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21732v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training foundation models such as ViTs and LLMs requires tremendous computing cost. Low-rank matrix or tensor factorization offers a parameter-efficient alternative, but often downgrades performance due to the restricted parameter space. In this work, we introduce {\textbf{Latent Crossing (LaX)}} -- a simple yet effective plug-and-play module that enhances the capacity of low-rank models by enabling information flow across low-rank subspaces. We extensively validate the benefits of LaX on pre-training tasks with ViT-Base/Large and LLaMA-like models ranging from 60M to 1B parameters. LaX boosts low-rank model performance to match or exceed the full-rank baselines while using 2-3\(\times\) fewer parameters. When equipped with low-rank adapters (i.e., LoRA) for fine-tuning LLaMA-7/13B, LaX consistently improves performance on arithmetic and common sense reasoning tasks with negligible cost.</p></details> |  |
| **[MedBridge: Bridging Foundation Vision-Language Models to Medical Image Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21698v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent vision-language foundation models deliver state-of-the-art results on natural image classification but falter on medical images due to pronounced domain shifts. At the same time, training a medical foundation model requires substantial resources, including extensive annotated data and high computational capacity. To bridge this gap with minimal overhead, we introduce MedBridge, a lightweight multimodal adaptation framework that re-purposes pretrained VLMs for accurate medical image diagnosis. MedBridge comprises three key components. First, a Focal Sampling module that extracts high-resolution local regions to capture subtle pathological features and compensate for the limited input resolution of general-purpose VLMs. Second, a Query Encoder (QEncoder) injects a small set of learnable queries that attend to the frozen feature maps of VLM, aligning them with medical semantics without retraining the entire backbone. Third, a Mixture of Experts mechanism, driven by learnable queries, harnesses the complementary strength of diverse VLMs to maximize diagnostic performance. We evaluate MedBridge on five medical imaging benchmarks across three key adaptation tasks, demonstrating its superior performance in both cross-domain and in-domain adaptation settings, even under varying levels of training data availability. Notably, MedBridge achieved over 6-15% improvement in AUC compared to state-of-the-art VLM adaptation methods in multi-label thoracic disease diagnosis, underscoring its effectiveness in leveraging foundation models for accurate and data-efficient medical diagnosis. Our code is available at https://github.com/ai-med/MedBridge.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Structured Unplugged Approach for Foundational AI Literacy in Primary Education](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21398v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Younger generations are growing up in a world increasingly shaped by intelligent technologies, making early AI literacy crucial for developing the skills to critically understand and navigate them. However, education in this field often emphasizes tool-based learning, prioritizing usage over understanding the underlying concepts. This lack of knowledge leaves non-experts, especially children, prone to misconceptions, unrealistic expectations, and difficulties in recognizing biases and stereotypes. In this paper, we propose a structured and replicable teaching approach that fosters foundational AI literacy in primary students, by building upon core mathematical elements closely connected to and of interest in primary curricula, to strengthen conceptualization, data representation, classification reasoning, and evaluation of AI. To assess the effectiveness of our approach, we conducted an empirical study with thirty-one fifth-grade students across two classes, evaluating their progress through a post-test and a satisfaction survey. Our results indicate improvements in terminology understanding and usage, features description, logical reasoning, and evaluative skills, with students showing a deeper comprehension of decision-making processes and their limitations. Moreover, the approach proved engaging, with students particularly enjoying activities that linked AI concepts to real-world reasoning.

Previous attempts to reduce foundation model size fall short of fully addressing the problem, as they end up increasing computational load through additional training steps. Recent works reveal that deep neural networks exhibit internal representation similarities. While inter-network similarities have enabled techniques such as model stitching and merging, intra-network similarities remain underexplored for improving efficiency. In this paper, we propose Transformer Blocks Approximation (TBA), a novel method that leverages intra-network similarities to identify and approximate transformer blocks in large vision models. TBA replaces these blocks using lightweight, closed-form transformations, without retraining or fine-tuning the rest of the model. The proposed method reduces the number of parameters while having minimal impact on the downstream task. We validate the effectiveness and generalizability of TBA through extensive experiments across multiple datasets (e.g., Imagenet-1k and CIFAR100) and state-of-the-art pretrained vision models (e.g, ViT, DiNO-v2, and DEiT).</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 14 figures, 16 tables</p></details> |

LoRA accomplishes this by freezing the pre-trained model weights and injecting trainable low-rank matrices, allowing for efficient learning of these foundation models even on edge devices. However, LoRA in decentralized settings still remains under explored, particularly for the theoretical underpinnings due to the lack of smoothness guarantee and model consensus interference (defined formally below). This work improves the convergence rate of decentralized LoRA (DLoRA) to match the rate of decentralized SGD by ensuring gradient smoothness. We also introduce DeCAF, a novel algorithm integrating DLoRA with truncated singular value decomposition (TSVD)-based matrix factorization to resolve consensus interference. Theoretical analysis shows TSVD's approximation error is bounded and consensus differences between DLoRA and DeCAF vanish as rank increases, yielding DeCAF's matching convergence rate. Extensive experiments across vision/language tasks demonstrate our algorithms outperform local training and rivals federated learning under both IID and non-IID data distributions.</p></details> |  |

Recently, the integration of Foundation Models (FMs) into FL has enhanced performance but introduced a novel backdoor attack mechanism. Attackers can exploit FM vulnerabilities to embed backdoors into synthetic data generated by FMs. During global model fusion, these backdoors are transferred to the global model through compromised synthetic data, subsequently infecting all client models. Existing FL backdoor defenses are ineffective against this novel attack due to its fundamentally different mechanism compared to classic ones. In this work, we propose a novel data-free defense strategy that addresses both classic and novel backdoor attacks in FL. The shared attack pattern lies in the abnormal activations within the hidden feature space during model aggregation. Hence, we propose to constrain internal activations to remain within reasonable ranges, effectively mitigating attacks while preserving model functionality. The activation constraints are optimized using synthetic data alongside FL training. Extensive experiments demonstrate its effectiveness against both novel and classic backdoor attacks, outperforming existing defenses.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted to IEEE IRI 2025</p></details> |

Our approach features a unique "small-to-large" design. A compact "seed" model containing a few Conformer or Transformer blocks is trained and unfolded many times to emulate the performance of larger uncompressed models with different logical depths. The seed model and many unfolded paths are jointly trained within a single unfolding cycle. The KL-divergence between the largest unfolded and smallest seed models is used in a self-distillation process to minimize their performance disparity. Experimental results show that our foldable model produces ASR performance comparable to individually constructed Conformer and wav2vec2/HuBERT speech foundation models under various depth configurations, while requiring only minimal memory and storage. Conformer and wav2vec2 models with a reduction of 35% and 30% parameters are obtained without loss of performance, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Interspeech2025</p></details> |

We introduce SoniDo, a music foundation model (MFM) designed to extract hierarchical features from target music samples. By leveraging hierarchical intermediate features, SoniDo constrains the information granularity, leading to improved performance across various downstream tasks including both understanding and generative tasks. We specifically evaluated this approach on representative tasks such as music tagging, music transcription, music source separation, and music mixing. Our results reveal that the features extracted from foundation models provide valuable enhancements in training downstream task models. This highlights the capability of using features extracted from music foundation models as a booster for downstream tasks. Our approach not only benefits existing task-specific models but also supports music downstream tasks constrained by data scarcity.

Recent advances in foundation models, particularly large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), have opened new opportunities for enhanced perception and intelligent decision-making in robotics. However, their practical applicability and effectiveness in global path planning remain relatively unexplored. This paper proposes foundation model-guided path planners (FM-Planner) and presents a comprehensive benchmarking study and practical validation for drone path planning. Specifically, we first systematically evaluate eight representative LLM and VLM approaches using standardized simulation scenarios. To enable effective real-time navigation, we then design an integrated LLM-Vision planner that combines semantic reasoning with visual perception. Furthermore, we deploy and validate the proposed path planner through real-world experiments under multiple configurations. Our findings provide valuable insights into the strengths, limitations, and feasibility of deploying foundation models in real-world drone applications and providing practical implementations in autonomous flight.

Recently, self-supervised acoustic representation foundation models (FMs) have been proposed to offer insights into acoustics-based vital signs. However, there has been little exploration of the extent to which auscultation is encoded in these pre-trained FM representations. In this work, using a publicly available phonocardiogram (PCG) dataset and a heart rate (HR) estimation model, we conduct a layer-wise investigation of six acoustic representation FMs: HuBERT, wav2vec2, wavLM, Whisper, Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining (CLAP), and an in-house CLAP model. Additionally, we implement the baseline method from Nie et al., 2024 (which relies on acoustic features) and show that overall, representation vectors from pre-trained foundation models (FMs) offer comparable performance to the baseline. Notably, HR estimation using the representations from the audio encoder of the in-house CLAP model outperforms the results obtained from the baseline, achieving a lower mean absolute error (MAE) across various train/validation/test splits despite the domain mismatch.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, Interspeech 2025 conference</p></details> |
| **[GIT-BO: High-Dimensional Bayesian Optimization with Tabular Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20685v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bayesian optimization (BO) effectively optimizes expensive black-box functions but faces significant challenges in high-dimensional spaces (dimensions exceeding 100) due to the curse of dimensionality. Existing high-dimensional BO methods typically leverage low-dimensional embeddings or structural assumptions to mitigate this challenge, yet these approaches frequently incur considerable computational overhead and rigidity due to iterative surrogate retraining and fixed assumptions. To address these limitations, we propose Gradient-Informed Bayesian Optimization using Tabular Foundation Models (GIT-BO), an approach that utilizes a pre-trained tabular foundation model (TFM) as a surrogate, leveraging its gradient information to adaptively identify low-dimensional subspaces for optimization. We propose a way to exploit internal gradient computations from the TFM's forward pass by creating a gradient-informed diagnostic matrix that reveals the most sensitive directions of the TFM's predictions, enabling optimization in a continuously re-estimated active subspace without the need for repeated model retraining. Extensive empirical evaluation across 23 synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrates that GIT-BO consistently outperforms four state-of-the-art Gaussian process-based high-dimensional BO methods, showing superior scalability and optimization performances, especially as dimensionality increases up to 500 dimensions. This work establishes foundation models, augmented with gradient-informed adaptive subspace identification, as highly competitive alternatives to traditional Gaussian process-based approaches for high-dimensional Bayesian optimization tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, achieving both generalization and personalization in heterogeneous settings remains a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce FedOT, a novel approach that leverages black-box foundation models. FedOT shares only a global task-dependent classifier across clients while locally adapting features through orthogonal transformations. By enforcing orthogonality, FedOT mitigates gradient conflicts across diverse clients, preserves semantic integrity, and achieves robust performance even in the presence of substantial data heterogeneity. The strategy of combining global and local parameters enables a more balanced approach for both generalization and personalization, outperforming baseline FL methods across multiple benchmarks. Furthermore, our extensive analysis confirms that joint optimization of global classifiers and local orthogonal transformations yields superior performance and suggests broader applicability.</p></details> | 27 pages, 5 figures |

In this work, we examine how linguistic and acoustic diversity in training data affect the robustness of the ASR model and reveal that transcription generalization is primarily driven by acoustic variation rather than linguistic richness. We find that targeted acoustic augmentation methods could significantly improve the generalization ability of ASR models, reducing word-error rates by up to 19.24 percent on unseen datasets when training on the 960-hour Librispeech dataset. These findings highlight strategic acoustically focused data augmentation as a promising alternative to massive datasets for building robust ASR models, offering a potential solution to future foundation ASR models when massive human speech data is lacking.</p></details> | in submission |

However, these approaches fail to replicate the diagnostic process of pathologists, as they either simply rely on general-purpose encoders with multi-instance learning for classification or directly apply multimodal models to generate reports from images. A significant limitation is their inability to emulate the diagnostic logic employed by pathologists, who systematically examine slides at low magnification for overview before progressively zooming in on suspicious regions to formulate comprehensive diagnoses. To address this gap, we introduce CPathAgent, an innovative agent-based model that mimics pathologists' reasoning processes by autonomously executing zoom-in/out and navigation operations across pathology images based on observed visual features. To achieve this, we develop a multi-stage training strategy unifying patch-level, region-level, and whole-slide capabilities within a single model, which is essential for mimicking pathologists, who require understanding and reasoning capabilities across all three scales. This approach generates substantially more detailed and interpretable diagnostic reports compared to existing methods, particularly for huge region understanding. Additionally, we construct an expert-validated PathMMU-HR$^{2}$, the first benchmark for huge region analysis, a critical intermediate scale between patches and whole slides, as diagnosticians typically examine several key regions rather than entire slides at once. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CPathAgent consistently outperforms existing approaches across three scales of benchmarks, validating the effectiveness of our agent-based diagnostic approach and highlighting a promising direction for the future development of computational pathology.</p></details> | 49 pages, 33 figures |

By combining foundation models with the principles of embodied AI, where intelligent systems perceive, reason, and act through physical interactions, robots can improve understanding, adapt to, and execute complex tasks in dynamic real-world environments. However, embodied AI in mobile service robots continues to face key challenges, including multimodal sensor fusion, real-time decision-making under uncertainty, task generalization, and effective human-robot interactions (HRI). In this paper, we present the first systematic review of the integration of foundation models in mobile service robotics, identifying key open challenges in embodied AI and examining how foundation models can address them. Namely, we explore the role of such models in enabling real-time sensor fusion, language-conditioned control, and adaptive task execution. Furthermore, we discuss real-world applications in the domestic assistance, healthcare, and service automation sectors, demonstrating the transformative impact of foundation models on service robotics. We also include potential future research directions, emphasizing the need for predictive scaling laws, autonomous long-term adaptation, and cross-embodiment generalization to enable scalable, efficient, and robust deployment of foundation models in human-centric robotic systems.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing KGFMs rely solely on graph structure, overlooking the rich semantic signals encoded in textual attributes. We introduce SEMMA, a dual-module KGFM that systematically integrates transferable textual semantics alongside structure. SEMMA leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to enrich relation identifiers, generating semantic embeddings that subsequently form a textual relation graph, which is fused with the structural component. Across 54 diverse KGs, SEMMA outperforms purely structural baselines like ULTRA in fully inductive link prediction. Crucially, we show that in more challenging generalization settings, where the test-time relation vocabulary is entirely unseen, structural methods collapse while SEMMA is 2x more effective. Our findings demonstrate that textual semantics are critical for generalization in settings where structure alone fails, highlighting the need for foundation models that unify structural and linguistic signals in knowledge reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[SFT Memorizes, RL Generalizes: A Comparative Study of Foundation Model Post-training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17161v2)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) are widely used post-training techniques for foundation models. However, their roles in enhancing model generalization capabilities remain unclear. This paper studies the difference between SFT and RL on generalization and memorization, focusing on text-based rule variants and visual variants. We introduce GeneralPoints, an arithmetic reasoning card game, and adopt V-IRL, a real-world navigation environment, to assess how models trained with SFT and RL generalize to unseen variants in both textual and visual domains. We show that RL, especially when trained with an outcome-based reward, generalizes across both rule-based textual and visual variants. SFT, in contrast, tends to memorize training data and struggles to generalize out-of-distribution scenarios. Further analysis reveals that RL improves the model's underlying visual recognition capabilities, contributing to its enhanced generalization in the visual domain. Despite RL's superior generalization, we show that SFT remains essential for effective RL training; SFT stabilizes the model's output format, enabling subsequent RL to achieve its performance gains. These findings demonstrates the capability of RL for acquiring generalizable knowledge in complex, multi-modal tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website at https://tianzhechu.com/SFTvsRL</p></details> |

While these models show remarkable potential across cancer diagnostics and prognostics, their clinical translation faces critical challenges including variability in optimal model across cancer types, potential data leakage in evaluation, and lack of standardized benchmarks. Without rigorous, unbiased evaluation, even the most advanced PFMs risk remaining confined to research settings, delaying their life-saving applications. Existing benchmarking efforts remain limited by narrow cancer-type focus, potential pretraining data overlaps, or incomplete task coverage. We present PathBench, the first comprehensive benchmark addressing these gaps through: multi-center in-hourse datasets spanning common cancers with rigorous leakage prevention, evaluation across the full clinical spectrum from diagnosis to prognosis, and an automated leaderboard system for continuous model assessment. Our framework incorporates large-scale data, enabling objective comparison of PFMs while reflecting real-world clinical complexity. All evaluation data comes from private medical providers, with strict exclusion of any pretraining usage to avoid data leakage risks. We have collected 15,888 WSIs from 8,549 patients across 10 hospitals, encompassing over 64 diagnosis and prognosis tasks. Currently, our evaluation of 19 PFMs shows that Virchow2 and H-Optimus-1 are the most effective models overall. This work provides researchers with a robust platform for model development and offers clinicians actionable insights into PFM performance across diverse clinical scenarios, ultimately accelerating the translation of these transformative technologies into routine pathology practice.</p></details> | 35 pages, 9 figures |
| **[FireRedTTS-1S: An Upgraded Streamable Foundation Text-to-Speech System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20499v3)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we upgrade FireRedTTS to a new version, FireRedTTS-1S, a high-quality streaming foundation text-to-speech system. FireRedTTS-1S achieves streaming speech generation via two steps: text-to-semantic decoding and semantic-to-acoustic decoding. In text-to-semantic decoding, a semantic-aware speech tokenizer converts the speech signal into semantic tokens, which can be synthesized from the text via a language model in an auto-regressive manner. Meanwhile, the semantic-to-acoustic decoding module simultaneously translates generated semantic tokens into the speech signal in a streaming way. We implement two approaches to achieve this module: 1) a chunk-wise streamable flow-matching approach, and 2) a multi-stream language model-based approach. They both present high-quality and streamable speech generation but differ in real-time factor (RTF) and latency. Specifically, flow-matching decoding can generate speech by chunks, presenting a lower RTF of 0.1 but a higher latency of 300ms. Instead, the multi-stream language model generates speech by frames in an autoregressive manner, presenting a higher RTF of 0.3 but a low latency of 150ms. In experiments on zero-shot voice cloning, the objective results validate FireRedTTS-1S as a high-quality foundation model with comparable intelligibility and speaker similarity over industrial baseline systems. Furthermore, the subjective score of FireRedTTS-1S highlights its impressive synthesis performance, achieving comparable quality to the ground-truth recordings. These results validate FireRedTTS-1S as a high-quality streaming foundation TTS system.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we introduce the concept of Semantically Linked Tables (SLT), recognizing that tables are inherently connected to both declarative and procedural operational knowledge. We propose Foundation Models for Semantically Linked Tables (FMSLT), which integrate these components to ground tabular data within its true operational context. This comprehensive representation unlocks the full potential of machine learning for complex, interconnected tabular data across diverse domains. Realizing FMSLTs requires access to operational knowledge that is often unavailable in public datasets, highlighting the need for close collaboration between domain experts and researchers. Our work exposes the limitations of current tabular foundation models and proposes a new direction centered on FMSLTs, aiming to advance robust, context-aware models for structured data.</p></details> |  |

These models have shown consistently improved results with the introduction of new methods. It is crucial to analyze how these trends impact the medical field and determine whether these advancements can drive meaningful change. This study investigates the application of recent state-of-the-art foundation models, DINOv2, MAE, VMamba, CoCa, SAM2, and AIMv2, for medical image classification. We explore their effectiveness on datasets including CBIS-DDSM for mammography, ISIC2019 for skin lesions, APTOS2019 for diabetic retinopathy, and CHEXPERT for chest radiographs. By fine-tuning these models and evaluating their configurations, we aim to understand the potential of these advancements in medical image classification. The results indicate that these advanced models significantly enhance classification outcomes, demonstrating robust performance despite limited labeled data. Based on our results, AIMv2, DINOv2, and SAM2 models outperformed others, demonstrating that progress in natural domain training has positively impacted the medical domain and improved classification outcomes.

It has been applied to solve numerous problems across the entire software engineering lifecycle and has demonstrated its versatility in multiple domains. With the recent advancements in AI, particularly the emergence of foundation models (FMs), the evolution of SBSE alongside FMs remains undetermined. In this window of opportunity, we propose a research roadmap that articulates the current landscape of SBSE in relation to foundation models (FMs), highlights open challenges, and outlines potential research directions for advancing SBSE through its interplay with FMs. This roadmap aims to establish a forward-thinking and innovative perspective for the future of SBSE in the era of FMs.</p></details> |  |

However, it remains an open question whether findings and methods from text-based cross-lingual alignment apply to speech. Building on prior work on spoken translation retrieval, we perform pronunciation-controlled experiments to observe if cross-lingual alignment can indeed occur in such models on a semantic basis, instead of relying on phonetic similarities. Our findings indicate that even in the absence of phonetic cues, spoken translation retrieval accuracy remains relatively stable. We follow up with a controlled experiment on a word-level dataset of cross-lingual synonyms and near-homophones, confirming the existence of both phonetic and semantic knowledge in the encoder. Finally, we qualitatively examine the transcriptions produced by early exiting the encoder, where we observe that speech translation produces semantic errors that are characterized by phonetic similarities to corresponding words in the source language. We apply this insight from early exiting to speech recognition in seven low-resource languages unsupported by the Whisper model, and achieve improved accuracy in all languages examined, particularly for languages with transparent orthographies.</p></details> |  |

Despite the importance of the web, many tasks performed on it are repetitive and time-consuming, negatively impacting overall quality of life. To efficiently handle these tedious daily tasks, one of the most promising approaches is to advance autonomous agents based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, referred to as AI Agents, as they can operate continuously without fatigue or performance degradation. In the context of the web, leveraging AI Agents -- termed WebAgents -- to automatically assist people in handling tedious daily tasks can dramatically enhance productivity and efficiency. Recently, Large Foundation Models (LFMs) containing billions of parameters have exhibited human-like language understanding and reasoning capabilities, showing proficiency in performing various complex tasks. This naturally raises the question: `Can LFMs be utilized to develop powerful AI Agents that automatically handle web tasks, providing significant convenience to users?' To fully explore the potential of LFMs, extensive research has emerged on WebAgents designed to complete daily web tasks according to user instructions, significantly enhancing the convenience of daily human life. In this survey, we comprehensively review existing research studies on WebAgents across three key aspects: architectures, training, and trustworthiness. Additionally, several promising directions for future research are explored to provide deeper insights.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the long version of the corresponding survey paper accepted by KDD 2025;</p></details> |
| **[A Contrastive Learning Foundation Model Based on Perfectly Aligned Sample Pairs for Remote Sensing Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19447v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) enables us to pre-train foundation models without costly labeled data. Among SSL methods, Contrastive Learning (CL) methods are better at obtaining accurate semantic representations in noise interference. However, due to the significant domain gap, while CL methods have achieved great success in many computer vision tasks, they still require specific adaptation for Remote Sensing (RS) images. To this end, we present a novel self-supervised method called PerA, which produces all-purpose RS features through semantically Perfectly Aligned sample pairs. Specifically, PerA obtains features from sampled views by applying spatially disjoint masks to augmented images rather than random cropping. With disjoint masks, we divide patches from different views into different parts that are semantically aligned but inconsistent in appearance. Our framework provides high-quality features by ensuring consistency between teacher and student and predicting learnable mask tokens. Compared to previous contrastive methods, our method demonstrates higher memory efficiency and can be trained with larger batches due to its sparse inputs. We also collect an unlabeled pre-training dataset, which contains about 5 million RS images. We conducted experiments on multiple downstream task datasets and achieved performance comparable to previous state-of-the-art methods with a limited model scale, which verified the superiority of our method. We hope this work will contribute to practical remote sensing interpretation works.</p></details> |  |

A Systematic Study of Adversarial Robustness Across Domains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19397v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs), which are pretrained on large-scale, cross-domain data and capable of zero-shot forecasting in new scenarios without further training, are increasingly adopted in real-world applications. However, as the zero-shot forecasting paradigm gets popular, a critical yet overlooked question emerges: Are TSFMs robust to adversarial input perturbations? Such perturbations could be exploited in man-in-the-middle attacks or data poisoning. To address this gap, we conduct a systematic investigation into the adversarial robustness of TSFMs. Our results show that even minimal perturbations can induce significant and controllable changes in forecast behaviors, including trend reversal, temporal drift, and amplitude shift, posing serious risks to TSFM-based services. Through experiments on representative TSFMs and multiple datasets, we reveal their consistent vulnerabilities and identify potential architectural designs, such as structural sparsity and multi-task pretraining, that may improve robustness. Our findings offer actionable guidance for designing more resilient forecasting systems and provide a critical assessment of the adversarial robustness of TSFMs.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Advancing Video Self-Supervised Learning via Image Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19218v1)** | 2025-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the past decade, image foundation models (IFMs) have achieved unprecedented progress. However, the potential of directly using IFMs for video self-supervised representation learning has largely been overlooked. In this study, we propose an advancing video self-supervised learning (AdViSe) approach, aimed at significantly reducing the training overhead of video representation models using pre-trained IFMs. Specifically, we first introduce temporal modeling modules (ResNet3D) to IFMs, constructing a video representation model. We then employ a video self-supervised learning approach, playback rate perception, to train temporal modules while freezing the IFM components. Experiments on UCF101 demonstrate that AdViSe achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while reducing training time by $3.4\times$ and GPU memory usage by $8.2\times$. This study offers fresh insights into low-cost video self-supervised learning based on pre-trained IFMs. Code is available at https://github.com/JingwWu/advise-video-ssl.</p></details> |  |

In contrast, discovering such generalities in graph-structured data, especially across heterogeneous graph tasks, remains an open challenge. To address this, we propose a novel approach to cross-task generalization in graphs via task-trees, which serve as unified learning instances aligning node-, edge-, and graph-level tasks. We theoretically analyze the stability, transferability, and generalization properties of task-trees, showing that pretraining a graph neural network (GNN) on diverse task-trees with a reconstruction objective induces transferable knowledge. This enables efficient adaptation to downstream tasks with minimal fine-tuning. To validate our framework, we introduce Graph Generality Identifier on Task-Trees (GIT), a graph foundation model that demonstrates strong performance on over 30 graphs across five domains via fine-tuning, in-context learning, and zero-shot generalization. Code and data are available at https://github.com/Zehong-Wang/GIT.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **[Do Large Language Models (Really) Need Statistical Foundations?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19145v1)** | 2025-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) represent a new paradigm for processing unstructured data, with applications across an unprecedented range of domains. In this paper, we address, through two arguments, whether the development and application of LLMs would genuinely benefit from foundational contributions from the statistics discipline. First, we argue affirmatively, beginning with the observation that LLMs are inherently statistical models due to their profound data dependency and stochastic generation processes, where statistical insights are naturally essential for handling variability and uncertainty. Second, we argue that the persistent black-box nature of LLMs -- stemming from their immense scale, architectural complexity, and development practices often prioritizing empirical performance over theoretical interpretability -- renders closed-form or purely mechanistic analyses generally intractable, thereby necessitating statistical approaches due to their flexibility and often demonstrated effectiveness. To substantiate these arguments, the paper outlines several research areas -- including alignment, watermarking, uncertainty quantification, evaluation, and data mixture optimization -- where statistical methodologies are critically needed and are already beginning to make valuable contributions. We conclude with a discussion suggesting that statistical research concerning LLMs will likely form a diverse ``mosaic'' of specialized topics rather than deriving from a single unifying theory, and highlighting the importance of timely engagement by our statistics community in LLM research.</p></details> |  |

These models are meant as foundation models with deep knowledge about e-commerce, that form a base for instruction- and fine-tuning. The e-Llama models are obtained by continuously pretraining the Llama 3.1 base models on 1 trillion tokens of domain-specific data. We discuss our approach and motivate our choice of hyperparameters with a series of ablation studies. To quantify how well the models have been adapted to the e-commerce domain, we define and implement a set of multilingual, e-commerce specific evaluation tasks. We show that, when carefully choosing the training setup, the Llama 3.1 models can be adapted towards the new domain without sacrificing significant performance on general domain tasks. We also explore the possibility of merging the adapted model and the base model for a better control of the performance trade-off between domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ACL25 (Industry )</p></details> |

However, challenges associated with training AI-based weed identification models, such as limited expert-verified data and complexity and variability in morphological features, have hindered progress. To address these issues, we present WeedNet, the first global-scale weed identification model capable of recognizing an extensive set of weed species, including noxious and invasive plant species. WeedNet is an end-to-end real-time weed identification pipeline and uses self-supervised learning, fine-tuning, and enhanced trustworthiness strategies. WeedNet achieved 91.02% accuracy across 1,593 weed species, with 41% species achieving 100% accuracy. Using a fine-tuning strategy and a Global-to-Local approach, the local Iowa WeedNet model achieved an overall accuracy of 97.38% for 85 Iowa weeds, most classes exceeded a 90% mean accuracy per class. Testing across intra-species dissimilarity (developmental stages) and inter-species similarity (look-alike species) suggests that diversity in the images collected, spanning all the growth stages and distinguishable plant characteristics, is crucial in driving model performance. The generalizability and adaptability of the Global WeedNet model enable it to function as a foundational model, with the Global-to-Local strategy allowing fine-tuning for region-specific weed communities. Additional validation of drone- and ground-rover-based images highlights the potential of WeedNet for integration into robotic platforms. Furthermore, integration with AI for conversational use provides intelligent agricultural and ecological conservation consulting tools for farmers, agronomists, researchers, land managers, and government agencies across diverse landscapes.</p></details> |  |

While many classical generative algorithms draw inspiration from equilibrium physics, they are fundamentally limited in representing systems with transient, irreversible, or far-from-equilibrium behavior. We show that non-equilibrium frameworks naturally capture non-equilibrium processes and evolving distributions. Through empirical experiments on a dynamic Printz potential system, we demonstrate that non-equilibrium generative models better track temporal evolution and adapt to non-stationary landscapes. We further highlight future directions such as integrating non-equilibrium principles with generative AI to simulate rare events, inferring underlying mechanisms, and representing multi-scale dynamics across scientific domains. Our position is that embracing non-equilibrium physics is not merely beneficial--but necessary--for generative AI to serve as a scientific modeling tool, offering new capabilities for simulating, understanding, and controlling complex systems.</p></details> |  |

While TabPFNv2 foundation model excels on tables with up to 10K samples, its alternating column- and row-wise attentions make handling large training sets computationally prohibitive. So, can ICL be effectively scaled and deliver a benefit for larger tables? We introduce TabICL, a tabular foundation model for classification, pretrained on synthetic datasets with up to 60K samples and capable of handling 500K samples on affordable resources. This is enabled by a novel two-stage architecture: a column-then-row attention mechanism to build fixed-dimensional embeddings of rows, followed by a transformer for efficient ICL. Across 200 classification datasets from the TALENT benchmark, TabICL is on par with TabPFNv2 while being systematically faster (up to 10 times), and significantly outperforms all other approaches. On 53 datasets with over 10K samples, TabICL surpasses both TabPFNv2 and CatBoost, demonstrating the potential of ICL for large data.

While numerous models have been developed, they often overlook the complexity and ambiguity inherent in human emotions. In the era of large speech foundation models (SFMs), understanding their capability in recognizing ambiguous emotions is essential for the development of next-generation emotion-aware models. This study examines the effectiveness of SFMs in ambiguous emotion recognition. We designed prompts for ambiguous emotion prediction and introduced two novel approaches to infer ambiguous emotion distributions: one analysing generated text responses and the other examining the internal processing of SFMs through token-level logits. Our findings suggest that while SFMs may not consistently generate accurate text responses for ambiguous emotions, they can interpret such emotions at the token level based on prior knowledge, demonstrating robustness across different prompts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at INTERSPEECH 2025</p></details> |

Geo-spatial datasets pose distinct challenges due to their dense numerical values, strong spatial and temporal dependencies, and unique multimodal representations including tabular data, heatmaps, and geographic visualizations. To assess how foundation models can support scientific research in this domain, GeoGrid-Bench features large-scale, real-world data covering 16 climate variables across 150 locations and extended time frames. The benchmark includes approximately 3,200 question-answer pairs, systematically generated from 8 domain expert-curated templates to reflect practical tasks encountered by human scientists. These range from basic queries at a single location and time to complex spatiotemporal comparisons across regions and periods. Our evaluation reveals that vision-language models perform best overall, and we provide a fine-grained analysis of the strengths and limitations of different foundation models in different geo-spatial tasks. This benchmark offers clearer insights into how foundation models can be effectively applied to geo-spatial data analysis and used to support scientific research.</p></details> |  |
| **[BiomechGPT: Towards a Biomechanically Fluent Multimodal Foundation Model for Clinically Relevant Motion Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18465v1)** | 2025-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advances in markerless motion capture are expanding access to biomechanical movement analysis, making it feasible to obtain high-quality movement data from outpatient clinics, inpatient hospitals, therapy, and even home. Expanding access to movement data in these diverse contexts makes the challenge of performing downstream analytics all the more acute. Creating separate bespoke analysis code for all the tasks end users might want is both intractable and does not take advantage of the common features of human movement underlying them all. Recent studies have shown that fine-tuning language models to accept tokenized movement as an additional modality enables successful descriptive captioning of movement. Here, we explore whether such a multimodal motion-language model can answer detailed, clinically meaningful questions about movement. We collected over 30 hours of biomechanics from nearly 500 participants, many with movement impairments from a variety of etiologies, performing a range of movements used in clinical outcomes assessments. After tokenizing these movement trajectories, we created a multimodal dataset of motion-related questions and answers spanning a range of tasks. We developed BiomechGPT, a multimodal biomechanics-language model, on this dataset. Our results show that BiomechGPT demonstrates high performance across a range of tasks such as activity recognition, identifying movement impairments, diagnosis, scoring clinical outcomes, and measuring walking. BiomechGPT provides an important step towards a foundation model for rehabilitation movement data.</p></details> |  |

While Visual Place Recognition (VPR) has embraced Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) to enhance descriptor robustness, LPR has relied on task-specific models with limited use of pre-trained foundation-level knowledge. This is due to the lack of 3D foundation models and the challenges of using VFM with LiDAR point clouds. To tackle this, we introduce ImLPR, a novel pipeline that employs a pre-trained DINOv2 VFM to generate rich descriptors for LPR. To our knowledge, ImLPR is the first method to leverage a VFM to support LPR. ImLPR converts raw point clouds into Range Image Views (RIV) to leverage VFM in the LiDAR domain. It employs MultiConv adapters and Patch-InfoNCE loss for effective feature learning. We validate ImLPR using public datasets where it outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in intra-session and inter-session LPR with top Recall@1 and F1 scores across various LiDARs. We also demonstrate that RIV outperforms Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) as a representation choice for adapting LiDAR for VFM.

However, recent advancements are paving the way for Tabular Foundation Models, which can leverage real-world knowledge and generalize across diverse datasets, particularly when the data contains free-text. Although incorporating language model capabilities into tabular tasks has been explored, most existing methods utilize static, target-agnostic textual representations, limiting their effectiveness. We introduce TabSTAR: a Foundation Tabular Model with Semantically Target-Aware Representations. TabSTAR is designed to enable transfer learning on tabular data with textual features, with an architecture free of dataset-specific parameters. It unfreezes a pretrained text encoder and takes as input target tokens, which provide the model with the context needed to learn task-specific embeddings. TabSTAR achieves state-of-the-art performance for both medium- and large-sized datasets across known benchmarks of classification tasks with text features, and its pretraining phase exhibits scaling laws in the number of datasets, offering a pathway for further performance improvements.</p></details> |  |

Purpose: To develop and externally evaluate a multicenter, foundation-model-driven framework that automatically classifies EVI and MFI on axial and sagittal T2-weighted MRI. Methods: This retrospective study used 331 pre-treatment rectal cancer MRI examinations from three European hospitals. After TotalSegmentator-guided rectal patch extraction, a self-supervised frequency-domain harmonization pipeline was trained to minimize scanner-related contrast shifts. Four classifiers were compared: ResNet50, SeResNet, the universal biomedical pretrained transformer (UMedPT) with a lightweight MLP head, and a logistic-regression variant using frozen UMedPT features (UMedPT_LR). Results: UMedPT_LR achieved the best EVI detection when axial and sagittal features were fused (AUC = 0.82; sensitivity = 0.75; F1 score = 0.73), surpassing the Chaimeleon Grand-Challenge winner (AUC = 0.74). The highest MFI performance was attained by UMedPT on axial harmonized images (AUC = 0.77), surpassing the Chaimeleon Grand-Challenge winner (AUC = 0.75). Frequency-domain harmonization improved MFI classification but variably affected EVI performance. Conventional CNNs (ResNet50, SeResNet) underperformed, especially in F1 score and balanced accuracy. Conclusion: These findings demonstrate that combining foundation model features, harmonization, and multi-view fusion significantly enhances diagnostic performance in rectal MRI.</p></details> | 22 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Explainable Anatomy-Guided AI for Prostate MRI: Foundation Models and In Silico Clinical Trials for Virtual Biopsy-based Risk Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17971v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a fully automated, anatomically guided deep learning pipeline for prostate cancer (PCa) risk stratification using routine MRI. The pipeline integrates three key components: an nnU-Net module for segmenting the prostate gland and its zones on axial T2-weighted MRI; a classification module based on the UMedPT Swin Transformer foundation model, fine-tuned on 3D patches with optional anatomical priors and clinical data; and a VAE-GAN framework for generating counterfactual heatmaps that localize decision-driving image regions. The system was developed using 1,500 PI-CAI cases for segmentation and 617 biparametric MRIs with metadata from the CHAIMELEON challenge for classification (split into 70% training, 10% validation, and 20% testing). Segmentation achieved mean Dice scores of 0.95 (gland), 0.94 (peripheral zone), and 0.92 (transition zone). Incorporating gland priors improved AUC from 0.69 to 0.72, with a three-scale ensemble achieving top performance (AUC = 0.79, composite score = 0.76), outperforming the 2024 CHAIMELEON challenge winners. Counterfactual heatmaps reliably highlighted lesions within segmented regions, enhancing model interpretability. In a prospective multi-center in-silico trial with 20 clinicians, AI assistance increased diagnostic accuracy from 0.72 to 0.77 and Cohen's kappa from 0.43 to 0.53, while reducing review time per case by 40%. These results demonstrate that anatomy-aware foundation models with counterfactual explainability can enable accurate, interpretable, and efficient PCa risk assessment, supporting their potential use as virtual biopsies in clinical practice.</p></details> |  |
| **[AutoMiSeg: Automatic Medical Image Segmentation via Test-Time Adaptation of Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17931v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical image segmentation is vital for clinical diagnosis, yet current deep learning methods often demand extensive expert effort, i.e., either through annotating large training datasets or providing prompts at inference time for each new case. This paper introduces a zero-shot and automatic segmentation pipeline that combines off-the-shelf vision-language and segmentation foundation models. Given a medical image and a task definition (e.g., "segment the optic disc in an eye fundus image"), our method uses a grounding model to generate an initial bounding box, followed by a visual prompt boosting module that enhance the prompts, which are then processed by a promptable segmentation model to produce the final mask. To address the challenges of domain gap and result verification, we introduce a test-time adaptation framework featuring a set of learnable adaptors that align the medical inputs with foundation model representations. Its hyperparameters are optimized via Bayesian Optimization, guided by a proxy validation model without requiring ground-truth labels. Our pipeline offers an annotation-efficient and scalable solution for zero-shot medical image segmentation across diverse tasks. Our pipeline is evaluated on seven diverse medical imaging datasets and shows promising results. By proper decomposition and test-time adaptation, our fully automatic pipeline performs competitively with weakly-prompted interactive foundation models.</p></details> |  |

Methods: We analyzed CT scans and clinical data from 876 NSCLC patients (604 training, 272 test) across five centers. Features were extracted from the whole lung, tumor, mediastinal nodes, coronary arteries, and coronary artery calcium (CAC). Handcrafted radiomics and FM deep features were harmonized using ComBat, reconstruction kernel normalization (RKN), and RKN+ComBat. Regularized Cox models predicted overall survival; performance was assessed using the concordance index (C-index), 5-year time-dependent area under the curve (t-AUC), and hazard ratio (HR). SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values explained feature contributions. A consensus model used agreement across top region of interest (ROI) models to stratify patient risk. Results: TNM staging showed prognostic utility (C-index = 0.67; HR = 2.70; t-AUC = 0.85). The clinical + tumor radiomics model with ComBat achieved a C-index of 0.7552 and t-AUC of 0.8820. FM features (50-voxel cubes) combined with clinical data yielded the highest performance (C-index = 0.7616; t-AUC = 0.8866). An ensemble of all ROIs and FM features reached a C-index of 0.7142 and t-AUC of 0.7885. The consensus model, covering 78% of valid test cases, achieved a t-AUC of 0.92, sensitivity of 97.6%, and specificity of 66.7%. Conclusion: Harmonization and multi-region feature integration improve survival prediction in multicenter NSCLC data. Combining interpretable radiomics, FM features, and consensus modeling enables robust risk stratification across imaging centers.</p></details> |  |

While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have enabled impressive language-grounded perception, their reliance on visual data limits robustness in real-world scenarios with occlusions, poor lighting, or privacy constraints. In this paper, we introduce HoloLLM, a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) that integrates uncommon but powerful sensing modalities, such as LiDAR, infrared, mmWave radar, and WiFi, to enable seamless human perception and reasoning across heterogeneous environments. We address two key challenges: (1) the scarcity of aligned modality-text data for rare sensors, and (2) the heterogeneity of their physical signal representations. To overcome these, we design a Universal Modality-Injection Projector (UMIP) that enhances pre-aligned modality embeddings with fine-grained, text-aligned features from tailored encoders via coarse-to-fine cross-attention without introducing significant alignment overhead. We further introduce a human-VLM collaborative data curation pipeline to generate paired textual annotations for sensing datasets. Extensive experiments on two newly constructed benchmarks show that HoloLLM significantly outperforms existing MLLMs, improving language-grounded human sensing accuracy by up to 30%. This work establishes a new foundation for real-world, language-informed multisensory embodied intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 13 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

To address this, we propose BehaveGPT, a foundational model designed specifically for large-scale user behavior prediction. Leveraging transformer-based architecture and a novel pretraining paradigm, BehaveGPT is trained on vast user behavior datasets, allowing it to learn complex behavior patterns and support a range of downstream tasks, including next behavior prediction, long-term generation, and cross-domain adaptation. Our approach introduces the DRO-based pretraining paradigm tailored for user behavior data, which improves model generalization and transferability by equitably modeling both head and tail behaviors. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that BehaveGPT outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving more than a 10% improvement in macro and weighted recall, showcasing its ability to effectively capture and predict user behavior. Furthermore, we measure the scaling law in the user behavior domain for the first time on the Honor dataset, providing insights into how model performance scales with increased data and parameter sizes.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 8 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Many foundational concepts in economics and ethics such as "trust" or "morality" are often defined informally, without operational criteria or cognitive grounding, which limits their testability and implementation in artificial agents. Drawing on converging empirical evidence from primate behavior, infant cognition, and economic anthropology, we propose a conceptual framework composed of three cognitively minimal mechanisms: individual recognition, reciprocal credence, and cost return sensitivity. This framework reframes trust as a graded cognitive expectation, providing a simulateable basis for reciprocal exchange in artificial agents, and enabling the bottom-up emergence of scalable cooperation and institutional dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version presents the full position paper, with a complete theoretical framework and implementation pathway</p></details> |

This property has enabled state-of-the-art performance across several clinical applications trained on structured electronic health record (EHR) data, even in settings with limited labeled data, a prevalent challenge in healthcare. However, there is little consensus on these models' potential for clinical utility due to the lack of desiderata of comprehensive and meaningful tasks and sufficiently diverse evaluations to characterize the benefit over conventional supervised learning. To address this gap, we propose a suite of clinically meaningful tasks spanning patient outcomes, early prediction of acute and chronic conditions, including desiderata for robust evaluations. We evaluate state-of-the-art foundation models on EHR data consisting of 5 million patients from Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUMC), a large urban academic medical center in New York City, across 14 clinically relevant tasks. We measure overall accuracy, calibration, and subpopulation performance to surface tradeoffs based on the choice of pre-training, tokenization, and data representation strategies. Our study aims to advance the empirical evaluation of structured EHR foundation models and guide the development of future healthcare foundation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Theoretical Foundations for Semantic Cognition in Artificial Intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21218v3)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This monograph presents a modular cognitive architecture for artificial intelligence grounded in the formal modeling of belief as structured semantic state. Belief states are defined as dynamic ensembles of linguistic expressions embedded within a navigable manifold, where operators enable assimilation, abstraction, nullification, memory, and introspection. Drawing from philosophy, cognitive science, and neuroscience, we develop a layered framework that enables self-regulating epistemic agents capable of reflective, goal-directed thought. At the core of this framework is the epistemic vacuum: a class of semantically inert cognitive states that serves as the conceptual origin of belief space. From this foundation, the Null Tower arises as a generative structure recursively built through internal representational capacities. The theoretical constructs are designed to be implementable in both symbolic and neural systems, including large language models, hybrid agents, and adaptive memory architectures. This work offers a foundational substrate for constructing agents that reason, remember, and regulate their beliefs in structured, interpretable ways.</p></details> | <details><summary>248 p...</summary><p>248 pages, 77 figures</p></details> |

Current high-fidelity approaches, especially neural rendering techniques, require time-consuming per-scene optimization, limiting clinical applicability due to computational demands and poor generalizability. We propose Render-FM, a novel foundation model for direct, real-time volumetric rendering of CT scans. Render-FM employs an encoder-decoder architecture that directly regresses 6D Gaussian Splatting (6DGS) parameters from CT volumes, eliminating per-scan optimization through large-scale pre-training on diverse medical data. By integrating robust feature extraction with the expressive power of 6DGS, our approach efficiently generates high-quality, real-time interactive 3D visualizations across diverse clinical CT data. Experiments demonstrate that Render-FM achieves visual fidelity comparable or superior to specialized per-scan methods while drastically reducing preparation time from nearly an hour to seconds for a single inference step. This advancement enables seamless integration into real-time surgical planning and diagnostic workflows. The project page is: https://gaozhongpai.github.io/renderfm/.</p></details> |  |
| **[JanusDNA: A Powerful Bi-directional Hybrid DNA Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17257v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing and are increasingly applied to other sequential data types, including genetic sequences. However, adapting LLMs to genomics presents significant challenges. Capturing complex genomic interactions requires modeling long-range dependencies within DNA sequences, where interactions often span over 10,000 base pairs, even within a single gene, posing substantial computational burdens under conventional model architectures and training paradigms. Moreover, standard LLM training approaches are suboptimal for DNA: autoregressive training, while efficient, supports only unidirectional understanding. However, DNA is inherently bidirectional, e.g., bidirectional promoters regulate transcription in both directions and account for nearly 11% of human gene expression. Masked language models (MLMs) allow bidirectional understanding but are inefficient, as only masked tokens contribute to the loss per step. To address these limitations, we introduce JanusDNA, the first bidirectional DNA foundation model built upon a novel pretraining paradigm that combines the optimization efficiency of autoregressive modeling with the bidirectional comprehension of masked modeling. JanusDNA adopts a hybrid Mamba, Attention and Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture, combining long-range modeling of Attention with efficient sequential learning of Mamba. MoE layers further scale model capacity via sparse activation while keeping computational cost low. Notably, JanusDNA processes up to 1 million base pairs at single nucleotide resolution on a single 80GB GPU. Extensive experiments and ablations show JanusDNA achieves new SOTA results on three genomic representation benchmarks, outperforming models with 250x more activated parameters.

| **[Automated Capability Evaluation of Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17228v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current evaluation frameworks for foundation models rely heavily on fixed, manually curated benchmarks, limiting their ability to capture the full breadth of model capabilities. This paper introduces Active learning for Capability Evaluation (ACE), a novel framework for scalable, automated, and fine-grained evaluation of foundation models. ACE leverages the knowledge embedded in powerful language models to decompose a domain into semantically meaningful capabilities and generate diverse evaluation tasks, significantly reducing human effort. To maximize coverage and efficiency, ACE models a subject model's performance as a capability function over a latent semantic space and uses active learning to prioritize the evaluation of the most informative capabilities. This adaptive evaluation strategy enables cost-effective discovery of strengths, weaknesses, and failure modes that static benchmarks may miss. Our results suggest that ACE provides a more complete and informative picture of model capabilities, which is essential for safe and well-informed deployment of foundation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causality Is Key to Understand and Balance Multiple Goals in Trustworthy ML and Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21123v4)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring trustworthiness in machine learning (ML) systems is crucial as they become increasingly embedded in high-stakes domains. This paper advocates for integrating causal methods into machine learning to navigate the trade-offs among key principles of trustworthy ML, including fairness, privacy, robustness, accuracy, and explainability. While these objectives should ideally be satisfied simultaneously, they are often addressed in isolation, leading to conflicts and suboptimal solutions. Drawing on existing applications of causality in ML that successfully align goals such as fairness and accuracy or privacy and robustness, this paper argues that a causal approach is essential for balancing multiple competing objectives in both trustworthy ML and foundation models. Beyond highlighting these trade-offs, we examine how causality can be practically integrated into ML and foundation models, offering solutions to enhance their reliability and interpretability. Finally, we discuss the challenges, limitations, and opportunities in adopting causal frameworks, paving the way for more accountable and ethically sound AI systems.</p></details> |  |

To bridge this gap, we introduce REOBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the robustness of Earth observation foundation models across six tasks and twelve types of image corruptions, including both appearance-based and geometric perturbations. To ensure realistic and fine-grained evaluation, our benchmark focuses on high-resolution optical remote sensing images, which are widely used in critical applications such as urban planning and disaster response. We conduct a systematic evaluation of a broad range of models trained using masked image modeling, contrastive learning, and vision-language pre-training paradigms. Our results reveal that (1) existing Earth observation foundation models experience significant performance degradation when exposed to input corruptions. (2) The severity of degradation varies across tasks, model architectures, backbone sizes, and types of corruption, with performance drop varying from less than 1% to over 20%. (3) Vision-language models show enhanced robustness, particularly in multimodal tasks. REOBench underscores the vulnerability of current Earth observation foundation models to real-world corruptions and provides actionable insights for developing more robust and reliable models.</p></details> | 24 pages |

However, despite their success, many existing pre-trained models have struggled to fully capture the rich information content of neural oscillations, a limitation that fundamentally constrains their performance and generalizability across diverse BCI tasks. This limitation is frequently rooted in suboptimal architectural design choices which constrain their representational capacity. In this work, we introduce LaBraM++, an enhanced Large Brainwave Foundation Model (LBM) that incorporates principled improvements grounded in robust signal processing foundations. LaBraM++ demonstrates substantial gains across a variety of tasks, consistently outperforming its originally-based architecture and achieving competitive results when compared to other open-source LBMs. Its superior performance and training efficiency highlight its potential as a strong foundation for future advancements in LBMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[TextureSAM: Towards a Texture Aware Foundation Model for Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16540v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Segment Anything Models (SAM) have achieved remarkable success in object segmentation tasks across diverse datasets. However, these models are predominantly trained on large-scale semantic segmentation datasets, which introduce a bias toward object shape rather than texture cues in the image. This limitation is critical in domains such as medical imaging, material classification, and remote sensing, where texture changes define object boundaries. In this study, we investigate SAM's bias toward semantics over textures and introduce a new texture-aware foundation model, TextureSAM, which performs superior segmentation in texture-dominant scenarios. To achieve this, we employ a novel fine-tuning approach that incorporates texture augmentation techniques, incrementally modifying training images to emphasize texture features. By leveraging a novel texture-alternation of the ADE20K dataset, we guide TextureSAM to prioritize texture-defined regions, thereby mitigating the inherent shape bias present in the original SAM model. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that TextureSAM significantly outperforms SAM-2 on both natural (+0.2 mIoU) and synthetic (+0.18 mIoU) texture-based segmentation datasets. The code and texture-augmented dataset will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |

In retinal imaging, foundation models pretrained on either natural or ophthalmic data have shown promise, but the benefits of in-domain pretraining remain uncertain. To investigate this, we benchmark six SSL-pretrained ViTs on seven digital fundus image (DFI) datasets totaling 70,000 expert-annotated images for the task of moderate-to-late age-related macular degeneration (AMD) identification. Our results show that iBOT pretrained on natural images achieves the highest out-of-distribution generalization, with AUROCs of 0.80-0.97, outperforming domain-specific models, which achieved AUROCs of 0.78-0.96 and a baseline ViT-L with no pretraining, which achieved AUROCs of 0.68-0.91. These findings highlight the value of foundation models in improving AMD identification and challenge the assumption that in-domain pretraining is necessary. Furthermore, we release BRAMD, an open-access dataset (n=587) of DFIs with AMD labels from Brazil.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |

In this study, we investigate the utility of a dermatology-specific foundation model, PanDerm, in comparison with two Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures (ViT base and Swin Transformer V2 base) for the task of skin lesion classification. Using frozen features extracted from PanDerm, we apply non-linear probing with three different classifiers, namely, multi-layer perceptron (MLP), XGBoost, and TabNet. For the ViT-based models, we perform full fine-tuning to optimize classification performance. Our experiments on the HAM10000 and MSKCC datasets demonstrate that the PanDerm-based MLP model performs comparably to the fine-tuned Swin transformer model, while fusion of PanDerm and Swin Transformer predictions leads to further performance improvements. Future work will explore additional foundation models, fine-tuning strategies, and advanced fusion techniques.</p></details> | 6 pages |

Despite their advancements, our empirical experiments reveal that existing robot policies are prone to learning spurious correlations from pre-training trajectories, adversely affecting their generalization capabilities beyond the training data. To tackle this, we propose a novel Policy Contrastive Decoding (PCD) approach, which redirects the robot policy's focus toward object-relevant visual clues by contrasting action probability distributions derived from original and object-masked visual inputs. As a training-free method, our PCD can be used as a plugin to improve different types of robot policies without needing to finetune or access model weights. We conduct extensive experiments on top of three open-source robot policies, including the autoregressive policy OpenVLA and the diffusion-based policies Octo and $\pi_0$. The obtained results in both simulation and real-world environments prove PCD's flexibility and effectiveness, e.g., PCD enhances the state-of-the-art policy $\pi_0$ by 8% in the simulation environment and by 108% in the real-world environment. Code and demos are publicly available at: https://Koorye.github.io/proj/PCD.</p></details> |  |

To address these issues, we investigate the extent to which a well-known-text (WKT) representation of geometries and their spatial relations (e.g., topological predicates) are preserved during spatial reasoning when the geospatial vector data are passed to large language models (LLMs) including GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, and DeepSeek-R1-14B. Our workflow employs three distinct approaches to complete the spatial reasoning tasks for comparison, i.e., geometry embedding-based, prompt engineering-based, and everyday language-based evaluation. Our experiment results demonstrate that both the embedding-based and prompt engineering-based approaches to geospatial question-answering tasks with GPT models can achieve an accuracy of over 0.6 on average for the identification of topological spatial relations between two geometries. Among the evaluated models, GPT-4 with few-shot prompting achieved the highest performance with over 0.66 accuracy on topological spatial relation inference. Additionally, GPT-based reasoner is capable of properly comprehending inverse topological spatial relations and including an LLM-generated geometry can enhance the effectiveness for geographic entity retrieval. GPT-4 also exhibits the ability to translate certain vernacular descriptions about places into formal topological relations, and adding the geometry-type or place-type context in prompts may improve inference accuracy, but it varies by instance. The performance of these spatial reasoning tasks offers valuable insights for the refinement of LLMs with geographical knowledge towards the development of geo-foundation models capable of geospatial reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 13 figures, IJGIS GeoFM Special Issue</p></details> |

This paper examines three paradigms for building robotic systems: end-to-end vision-language-action (VLA) models that implicitly integrate perception and planning, and modular pipelines incorporating either vision-language models (VLMs) or multimodal large language models (LLMs). We evaluate these paradigms through two focused case studies: a complex instruction grounding task assessing fine-grained instruction understanding and cross-modal disambiguation, and an object manipulation task targeting skill transfer via VLA finetuning. Our experiments in zero-shot and few-shot settings reveal trade-offs in generalization and data efficiency. By exploring performance limits, we distill design implications for developing language-driven physical agents and outline emerging challenges and opportunities for FM-powered robotics in real-world conditions.</p></details> | 17 pages, 13 figures |

Moonbeam incorporates music-domain inductive biases by capturing both absolute and relative musical attributes through the introduction of a novel domain-knowledge-inspired tokenization method and Multidimensional Relative Attention (MRA), which captures relative music information without additional trainable parameters. Leveraging the pretrained Moonbeam, we propose 2 finetuning architectures with full anticipatory capabilities, targeting 2 categories of downstream tasks: symbolic music understanding and conditional music generation (including music infilling). Our model outperforms other large-scale pretrained music models in most cases in terms of accuracy and F1 score across 3 downstream music classification tasks on 4 datasets. Moreover, our finetuned conditional music generation model outperforms a strong transformer baseline with a REMI-like tokenizer. We open-source the code, pretrained model, and generated samples on Github.</p></details> |  |

However, developing an AI model are hindered by the overwhelming complexity and diversity of chromosomal abnormalities, requiring extensive annotation efforts, while automated methods remain task-specific and lack generalizability due to the scarcity of comprehensive datasets spanning diverse resource conditions. Here, we introduce CHROMA, a foundation model for cytogenomics, designed to overcome these challenges by learning generalizable representations of chromosomal abnormalities. Pre-trained on over 84,000 specimens (~4 million chromosomal images) via self-supervised learning, CHROMA outperforms other methods across all types of abnormalities, even when trained on fewer labelled data and more imbalanced datasets. By facilitating comprehensive mapping of instability and clonal leisons across various aberration types, CHROMA offers a scalable and generalizable solution for reliable and automated clinical analysis, reducing the annotation workload for experts and advancing precision oncology through the early detection of rare genomic abnormalities, enabling broad clinical AI applications and making advanced genomic analysis more accessible.</p></details> | <details><summary>These...</summary><p>These authors contributed equally to this work: Changchun Yang, Weiqian Dai, Yilan Zhang</p></details> |

In this survey, we present a hierarchical taxonomy organizing PFMs through a top-down philosophy applicable to foundation model analysis in any domain: model scope, model pretraining, and model design. Additionally, we systematically categorize PFM evaluation tasks into slide-level, patch-level, multimodal, and biological tasks, providing comprehensive benchmarking criteria.

| **[Alpay Algebra: A Universal Structural Foundation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15344v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Alpay Algebra is introduced as a universal, category-theoretic framework that unifies classical algebraic structures with modern needs in symbolic recursion and explainable AI. Starting from a minimal list of axioms, we model each algebra as an object in a small cartesian closed category $\mathcal{A}$ and define a transfinite evolution functor $\phi\colon\mathcal{A}\to\mathcal{A}$. We prove that the fixed point $\phi^{\infty}$ exists for every initial object and satisfies an internal universal property that recovers familiar constructs -- limits, colimits, adjunctions -- while extending them to ordinal-indexed folds. A sequence of theorems establishes (i) soundness and conservativity over standard universal algebra, (ii) convergence of $\phi$-iterates under regular cardinals, and (iii) an explanatory correspondence between $\phi^{\infty}$ and minimal sufficient statistics in information-theoretic AI models. We conclude by outlining computational applications: type-safe functional languages, categorical model checking, and signal-level reasoning engines that leverage Alpay Algebra's structural invariants. All proofs are self-contained; no external set-theoretic axioms beyond ZFC are required. This exposition positions Alpay Algebra as a bridge between foundational mathematics and high-impact AI systems, and provides a reference for further work in category theory, transfinite fixed-point analysis, and symbolic computation.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages, 0 figures.

| **[Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning of Multispectral Foundation Models for Hyperspectral Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15334v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have achieved great success across diverse domains, including remote sensing (RS), thanks to their versatility and strong generalization abilities. However, most RS foundation models are designed for multispectral data, while hyperspectral imagery (HSI) - with its hundreds of spectral bands - remains less explored. Fine-tuning such models for downstream tasks is also challenging, often demanding considerable memory and storage. In this paper, we propose an efficient framework to fine-tune SpectralGPT, a multispectral foundation model, for hyperspectral image classification (HSIC). We explore several Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, including Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), Kronecker-based adaptation (KronA), Low-Rank Kronecker (LoKr), and the recent LoRA+, which uses distinct learning rates for low-rank adapters scaled by a factor lambda. Inspired by LoRA+, we introduce KronA+, which applies a similar mechanism to the Kronecker matrices. We evaluate our approach on five datasets from different sensors, showing competitive performance with state-of-the-art HSI models. Our full fine-tuning (FFT) setup for SpectralGPT even outperforms a dedicated hyperspectral foundation model on some datasets while requiring only a quarter of the training epochs. Under the same number of epochs, KronA+ reaches similar performance with far fewer trainable parameters - just 0.056 percent - and adds only approximately 0.2 megabytes of storage, making it the most effective PEFT method tested.</p></details> | 33 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Towards Pre-training an Effective Respiratory Audio Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15307v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in foundation models have sparked interest in respiratory audio foundation models. However, the effectiveness of applying conventional pre-training schemes to datasets that are small-sized and lack diversity has not been sufficiently verified. This study aims to explore better pre-training practices for respiratory sounds by comparing numerous pre-trained audio models. Our investigation reveals that models pre-trained on AudioSet, a general audio dataset, are more effective than the models specifically pre-trained on respiratory sounds. Moreover, combining AudioSet and respiratory sound datasets for further pre-training enhances performance, and preserving the frequency-wise information when aggregating features is vital. Along with more insights found in the experiments, we establish a new state-of-the-art for the OPERA benchmark, contributing to advancing respiratory audio foundation models.

| **[Leveraging Foundation Models for Multimodal Graph-Based Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15192v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have ushered in a new era for multimodal video understanding by enabling the extraction of rich spatiotemporal and semantic representations. In this work, we introduce a novel graph-based framework that integrates a vision-language foundation, leveraging VideoMAE for dynamic visual encoding and BERT for contextual textual embedding, to address the challenge of recognizing fine-grained bimanual manipulation actions. Departing from conventional static graph architectures, our approach constructs an adaptive multimodal graph where nodes represent frames, objects, and textual annotations, and edges encode spatial, temporal, and semantic relationships. These graph structures evolve dynamically based on learned interactions, allowing for flexible and context-aware reasoning. A task-specific attention mechanism within a Graph Attention Network further enhances this reasoning by modulating edge importance based on action semantics. Through extensive evaluations on diverse benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, underscoring the strength of combining foundation models with dynamic graph-based reasoning for robust and generalizable action recognition.</p></details> |  |
| **[MonoSplat: Generalizable 3D Gaussian Splatting from Monocular Depth Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15185v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in generalizable 3D Gaussian Splatting have demonstrated promising results in real-time high-fidelity rendering without per-scene optimization, yet existing approaches still struggle to handle unfamiliar visual content during inference on novel scenes due to limited generalizability. To address this challenge, we introduce MonoSplat, a novel framework that leverages rich visual priors from pre-trained monocular depth foundation models for robust Gaussian reconstruction. Our approach consists of two key components: a Mono-Multi Feature Adapter that transforms monocular features into multi-view representations, coupled with an Integrated Gaussian Prediction module that effectively fuses both feature types for precise Gaussian generation. Through the Adapter's lightweight attention mechanism, features are seamlessly aligned and aggregated across views while preserving valuable monocular priors, enabling the Prediction module to generate Gaussian primitives with accurate geometry and appearance. Through extensive experiments on diverse real-world datasets, we convincingly demonstrate that MonoSplat achieves superior reconstruction quality and generalization capability compared to existing methods while maintaining computational efficiency with minimal trainable parameters.

| **[Time Tracker: Mixture-of-Experts-Enhanced Foundation Time Series Forecasting Model with Decoupled Training Pipelines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15151v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the past few years, time series foundation models have achieved superior predicting accuracy. However, real-world time series often exhibit significant diversity in their temporal patterns across different time spans and domains, making it challenging for a single model architecture to fit all complex scenarios. In addition, time series data may have multiple variables exhibiting complex correlations between each other. Recent mainstream works have focused on modeling times series in a channel-independent manner in both pretraining and finetuning stages, overlooking the valuable inter-series dependencies. To this end, we propose \textbf{Time Tracker} for better predictions on multivariate time series data. Firstly, we leverage sparse mixture of experts (MoE) within Transformers to handle the modeling of diverse time series patterns, thereby alleviating the learning difficulties of a single model while improving its generalization. Besides, we propose Any-variate Attention, enabling a unified model structure to seamlessly handle both univariate and multivariate time series, thereby supporting channel-independent modeling during pretraining and channel-mixed modeling for finetuning. Furthermore, we design a graph learning module that constructs relations among sequences from frequency-domain features, providing more precise guidance to capture inter-series dependencies in channel-mixed modeling. Based on these advancements, Time Tracker achieves state-of-the-art performance in predicting accuracy, model generalization and adaptability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Foundation Models: A Comprehensive Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15116v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph-structured data pervades domains such as social networks, biological systems, knowledge graphs, and recommender systems. While foundation models have transformed natural language processing, vision, and multimodal learning through large-scale pretraining and generalization, extending these capabilities to graphs -- characterized by non-Euclidean structures and complex relational semantics -- poses unique challenges and opens new opportunities. To this end, Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) aim to bring scalable, general-purpose intelligence to structured data, enabling broad transfer across graph-centric tasks and domains. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of GFMs, unifying diverse efforts under a modular framework comprising three key components: backbone architectures, pretraining strategies, and adaptation mechanisms. We categorize GFMs by their generalization scope -- universal, task-specific, and domain-specific -- and review representative methods, key innovations, and theoretical insights within each category. Beyond methodology, we examine theoretical foundations including transferability and emergent capabilities, and highlight key challenges such as structural alignment, heterogeneity, scalability, and evaluation. Positioned at the intersection of graph learning and general-purpose AI, GFMs are poised to become foundational infrastructure for open-ended reasoning over structured data. This survey consolidates current progress and outlines future directions to guide research in this rapidly evolving field.

| **[Foundations of Unknown-aware Machine Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14933v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring the reliability and safety of machine learning models in open-world deployment is a central challenge in AI safety. This thesis develops both algorithmic and theoretical foundations to address key reliability issues arising from distributional uncertainty and unknown classes, from standard neural networks to modern foundation models like large language models (LLMs). Traditional learning paradigms, such as empirical risk minimization (ERM), assume no distribution shift between training and inference, often leading to overconfident predictions on out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. This thesis introduces novel frameworks that jointly optimize for in-distribution accuracy and reliability to unseen data. A core contribution is the development of an unknown-aware learning framework that enables models to recognize and handle novel inputs without labeled OOD data. We propose new outlier synthesis methods, VOS, NPOS, and DREAM-OOD, to generate informative unknowns during training. Building on this, we present SAL, a theoretical and algorithmic framework that leverages unlabeled in-the-wild data to enhance OOD detection under realistic deployment conditions. These methods demonstrate that abundant unlabeled data can be harnessed to recognize and adapt to unforeseen inputs, providing formal reliability guarantees. The thesis also extends reliable learning to foundation models. We develop HaloScope for hallucination detection in LLMs, MLLMGuard for defending against malicious prompts in multimodal models, and data cleaning methods to denoise human feedback used for better alignment. These tools target failure modes that threaten the safety of large-scale models in deployment. Overall, these contributions promote unknown-aware learning as a new paradigm, and we hope it can advance the reliability of AI systems with minimal human efforts.</p></details> | PhD Dissertation |
| **[This Time is Different: An Observability Perspective on Time Series Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14766v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Toto, a time series forecasting foundation model with 151 million parameters. Toto uses a modern decoder-only architecture coupled with architectural innovations designed to account for specific challenges found in multivariate observability time series data. Toto's pre-training corpus is a mixture of observability data, open datasets, and synthetic data, and is 4-10$\times$ larger than those of leading time series foundation models. Additionally, we introduce BOOM, a large-scale benchmark consisting of 350 million observations across 2,807 real-world time series. For both Toto and BOOM, we source observability data exclusively from Datadog's own telemetry and internal observability metrics. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Toto achieves state-of-the-art performance on both BOOM and on established general purpose time series forecasting benchmarks. Toto's model weights, inference code, and evaluation scripts, as well as BOOM's data and evaluation code, are all available as open source under the Apache 2.0 License available at https://huggingface.co/Datadog/Toto-Open-Base-1.0 and https://github.com/DataDog/toto.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vox-Profile: A Speech Foundation Model Benchmark for Characterizing Diverse Speaker and Speech Traits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14648v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Vox-Profile, a comprehensive benchmark to characterize rich speaker and speech traits using speech foundation models. Unlike existing works that focus on a single dimension of speaker traits, Vox-Profile provides holistic and multi-dimensional profiles that reflect both static speaker traits (e.g., age, sex, accent) and dynamic speech properties (e.g., emotion, speech flow). This benchmark is grounded in speech science and linguistics, developed with domain experts to accurately index speaker and speech characteristics. We report benchmark experiments using over 15 publicly available speech datasets and several widely used speech foundation models that target various static and dynamic speaker and speech properties. In addition to benchmark experiments, we showcase several downstream applications supported by Vox-Profile. First, we show that Vox-Profile can augment existing speech recognition datasets to analyze ASR performance variability. Vox-Profile is also used as a tool to evaluate the performance of speech generation systems. Finally, we assess the quality of our automated profiles through comparison with human evaluation and show convergent validity. Vox-Profile is publicly available at: https://github.com/tiantiaf0627/vox-profile-release.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReVLA: Reverting Visual Domain Limitation of Robotic Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15250v3)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in large language models and access to large-scale robotic datasets has sparked a paradigm shift in robotics models transforming them into generalists able to adapt to various tasks, scenes, and robot modalities. A large step for the community are open Vision Language Action models which showcase strong performance in a wide variety of tasks. In this work, we study the visual generalization capabilities of three existing robotic foundation models, and propose a corresponding evaluation framework. Our study shows that the existing models do not exhibit robustness to visual out-of-domain scenarios. This is potentially caused by limited variations in the training data and/or catastrophic forgetting, leading to domain limitations in the vision foundation models. We further explore OpenVLA, which uses two pre-trained vision foundation models and is, therefore, expected to generalize to out-of-domain experiments. However, we showcase catastrophic forgetting by DINO-v2 in OpenVLA through its failure to fulfill the task of depth regression. To overcome the aforementioned issue of visual catastrophic forgetting, we propose a gradual backbone reversal approach founded on model merging. This enables OpenVLA -- which requires the adaptation of the visual backbones during initial training -- to regain its visual generalization ability. Regaining this capability enables our ReVLA model to improve over OpenVLA by a factor of 77\% and 66\% for grasping and lifting in visual OOD tasks.

The Earth observation (EO) field has produced several foundation models pre-trained directly on multispectral satellite imagery for applications like precision agriculture, wildfire and drought monitoring, and natural disaster response. However, few studies have investigated the ability of these models to generalize to new geographic locations, and potential concerns of geospatial bias -- models trained on data-rich developed nations not transferring well to data-scarce developing nations -- remain. We evaluate three popular EO foundation models, SSL4EO-S12, SatlasPretrain, and ImageNet, on five crop classification datasets across five continents. Results show that pre-trained weights designed explicitly for Sentinel-2, such as SSL4EO-S12, outperform general pre-trained weights like ImageNet. While only 100 labeled images are sufficient for achieving high overall accuracy, 900 images are required to mitigate class imbalance and improve average accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE IGARSS 2025.

| **[Towards a Foundation Model for Communication Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14603v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has demonstrated unprecedented performance across various domains, and its application to communication systems is an active area of research. While current methods focus on task-specific solutions, the broader trend in AI is shifting toward large general models capable of supporting multiple applications. In this work, we take a step toward a foundation model for communication data--a transformer-based, multi-modal model designed to operate directly on communication data. We propose methodologies to address key challenges, including tokenization, positional embedding, multimodality, variable feature sizes, and normalization. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that such a model can successfully estimate multiple features, including transmission rank, selected precoder, Doppler spread, and delay profile.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time to Embed: Unlocking Foundation Models for Time Series with Channel Descriptions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14543v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional time series models are task-specific and often depend on dataset-specific training and extensive feature engineering. While Transformer-based architectures have improved scalability, foundation models, commonplace in text, vision, and audio, remain under-explored for time series and are largely restricted to forecasting. We introduce $\textbf{CHARM}$, a foundation embedding model for multivariate time series that learns shared, transferable, and domain-aware representations. To address the unique difficulties of time series foundation learning, $\textbf{CHARM}$ incorporates architectural innovations that integrate channel-level textual descriptions while remaining invariant to channel order. The model is trained using a Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA), with novel augmentation schemes and a loss function designed to improve interpretability and training stability. Our $7$M-parameter model achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse downstream tasks, setting a new benchmark for time series representation learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Non-Euclidean Foundation Models: Advancing AI Beyond Euclidean Frameworks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14417v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the era of foundation models and Large Language Models (LLMs), Euclidean space is the de facto geometric setting of our machine learning architectures. However, recent literature has demonstrated that this choice comes with fundamental limitations. To that end, non-Euclidean learning is quickly gaining traction, particularly in web-related applications where complex relationships and structures are prevalent. Non-Euclidean spaces, such as hyperbolic, spherical, and mixed-curvature spaces, have been shown to provide more efficient and effective representations for data with intrinsic geometric properties, including web-related data like social network topology, query-document relationships, and user-item interactions. Integrating foundation models with non-Euclidean geometries has great potential to enhance their ability to capture and model the underlying structures, leading to better performance in search, recommendations, and content understanding. This workshop focuses on the intersection of Non-Euclidean Foundation Models and Geometric Learning (NEGEL), exploring its potential benefits, including the potential benefits for advancing web-related technologies, challenges, and future directions.

| **[Table Foundation Models: on knowledge pre-training for tabular learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14415v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Table foundation models bring high hopes to data science: pre-trained on tabular data to embark knowledge or priors, they should facilitate downstream tasks on tables. One specific challenge is that of data semantics: numerical entries take their meaning from context, e.g., column name. Pre-trained neural networks that jointly model column names and table entries have recently boosted prediction accuracy. While these models outline the promises of world knowledge to interpret table values, they lack the convenience of popular foundation models in text or vision. Indeed, they must be fine-tuned to bring benefits, come with sizeable computation costs, and cannot easily be reused or combined with other architectures. Here we introduce TARTE, a foundation model that transforms tables to knowledge-enhanced vector representations using the string to capture semantics. Pre-trained on large relational data, TARTE yields representations that facilitate subsequent learning with little additional cost. These representations can be fine-tuned or combined with other learners, giving models that push the state-of-the-art prediction performance and improve the prediction/computation performance trade-off. Specialized to a task or a domain, TARTE gives domain-specific representations that facilitate further learning. Our study demonstrates an effective approach to knowledge pre-training for tabular learning.</p></details> |  |

Existing techniques tend to be specialized in individual scenarios and lack generalization capacities. In this study, our objective is to develop a generic anomaly detection model that can be applied in multiple scenarios. To achieve this, we custom-build generic visual language foundation models that possess extensive knowledge and robust reasoning abilities as anomaly detectors and reasoners. Specifically, we introduce a multi-modal prompting strategy that incorporates domain knowledge from experts as conditions to guide the models. Our approach considers diverse prompt types, including task descriptions, class context, normality rules, and reference images. In addition, we unify the input representation of multi-modality into a 2D image format, enabling multi-modal anomaly detection and reasoning. Our preliminary studies demonstrate that combining visual and language prompts as conditions for customizing the models enhances anomaly detection performance. The customized models showcase the ability to detect anomalies across different data modalities such as images, point clouds, and videos. Qualitative case studies further highlight the anomaly detection and reasoning capabilities, particularly for multi-object scenes and temporal data.

| **[Differentially Private Synthetic Data via APIs 3: Using Simulators Instead of Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05505v3)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentially private (DP) synthetic data, which closely resembles the original private data while maintaining strong privacy guarantees, has become a key tool for unlocking the value of private data without compromising privacy. Recently, Private Evolution (PE) has emerged as a promising method for generating DP synthetic data. Unlike other training-based approaches, PE only requires access to inference APIs from foundation models, enabling it to harness the power of state-of-the-art (SoTA) models. However, a suitable foundation model for a specific private data domain is not always available. In this paper, we discover that the PE framework is sufficiently general to allow APIs beyond foundation models. In particular, we demonstrate that many SoTA data synthesizers that do not rely on neural networks--such as computer graphics-based image generators, which we refer to as simulators--can be effectively integrated into PE. This insight significantly broadens PE's applicability and unlocks the potential of powerful simulators for DP data synthesis. We explore this approach, named Sim-PE, in the context of image synthesis. Across four diverse simulators, Sim-PE performs well, improving the downstream classification accuracy of PE by up to 3x, reducing FID by up to 80%, and offering much greater efficiency. We also show that simulators and foundation models can be easily leveraged together within PE to achieve further improvements. The code is open-sourced in the Private Evolution Python library: https://github.com/microsoft/DPSDA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in: (1) ICLR 2025 Workshop on Data Problems, (2) ICLR 2025 Workshop on Synthetic Data</p></details> |

While foundation models have achieved significant success in single-cell transcriptomics, there is currently no foundation model for scATAC-seq that supports zero-shot high-quality cell identification and comprehensive multi-omics analysis simultaneously. Key challenges lie in the high dimensionality and sparsity of scATAC-seq data, as well as the lack of a standardized schema for representing open chromatin regions (OCRs). Here, we present ChromFound, a foundation model tailored for scATAC-seq. ChromFound utilizes a hybrid architecture and genome-aware tokenization to effectively capture genome-wide long contexts and regulatory signals from dynamic chromatin landscapes. Pretrained on 1.97 million cells from 30 tissues and 6 disease conditions, ChromFound demonstrates broad applicability across 6 diverse tasks. Notably, it achieves robust zero-shot performance in generating universal cell representations and exhibits excellent transferability in cell type annotation and cross-omics prediction. By uncovering enhancer-gene links undetected by existing computational methods, ChromFound offers a promising framework for understanding disease risk variants in the noncoding genome.</p></details> |  |
| **[Repurposing Foundation Model for Generalizable Medical Time Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03794v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical time series (MedTS) classification suffers from poor generalizability in real-world deployment due to inter- and intra-dataset heterogeneity, such as varying numbers of channels, signal lengths, task definitions, and patient characteristics. To address this, we propose FORMED, a novel framework for repurposing a backbone foundation model, pre-trained on generic time series, to enable highly generalizable MedTS classification on unseen datasets. FORMED combines the backbone with a novel classifier comprising two components: (1) task-specific channel embeddings and label queries, dynamically sized to match any number of channels and target classes, and (2) a shared decoding attention layer, jointly trained across datasets to capture medical domain knowledge through task-agnostic feature-query interactions. After repurposing, FORMED achieves seamless adaptation to unseen MedTS datasets through lightweight label query training (0.1% of parameters), eliminating the need for full fine-tuning or architectural redesign. We evaluate FORMED on 5 diverse MedTS datasets, benchmarking against 11 Task-Specific Models (TSM) and 4 Task-Specific Adaptation (TSA) methods. Our results demonstrate FORMED's dominant performance, achieving up to 35% absolute improvement in F1-score (on ADFTD dataset) over specialized baselines. Further analysis reveals consistent generalization across varying channel configurations, time series lengths, and clinical tasks, which are key challenges in real-world deployment. By decoupling domain-invariant representation learning from task-specific adaptation, FORMED establishes a scalable and resource-efficient paradigm for foundation model repurposing in healthcare. This approach prioritizes clinical adaptability over rigid task-centric design, offering a practical pathway for real-world implementation.</p></details> |  |
