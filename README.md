| **[RichControl: Structure- and Appearance-Rich Training-Free Spatial Control for Text-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02792v2)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have shown remarkable success in generating high-quality images from text prompts. Recent efforts extend these models to incorporate conditional images (e.g., depth or pose maps) for fine-grained spatial control. Among them, feature injection methods have emerged as a training-free alternative to traditional fine-tuning approaches. However, they often suffer from structural misalignment, condition leakage, and visual artifacts, especially when the condition image diverges significantly from natural RGB distributions. By revisiting existing methods, we identify a core limitation: the synchronous injection of condition features fails to account for the trade-off between domain alignment and structural preservation during denoising. Inspired by this observation, we propose a flexible feature injection framework that decouples the injection timestep from the denoising process. At its core is a structure-rich injection module, which enables the model to better adapt to the evolving interplay between alignment and structure preservation throughout the diffusion steps, resulting in more faithful structural generation. In addition, we introduce appearance-rich prompting and a restart refinement strategy to further enhance appearance control and visual quality. Together, these designs enable training-free generation that is both structure-rich and appearance-rich. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse zero-shot conditioning scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2406.07540 by other authors</p></details> |
| **[Incorporating Memory into Continuous-Time Spatial Capture-Recapture Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17278v2)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Obtaining reliable and precise estimates of wildlife species abundance and distribution is essential for the conservation and management of animal populations and natural reserves. Spatial capture-recapture (SCR) models provide estimates of population size and spatial density from data collected from remote sensors such as camera traps. Such data contain spatial correlation between observations of the same individual, which SCR models partly account for through a latent individual-specific activity centre, a location near which the individual is more likely detected. However, SCR models assume that the observations of an individual are independent over time and space, conditional on its activity centre, so that observed sightings at a given time and location do not influence the probability of being seen at future times and/or locations. This assumption is ecologically unrealistic given the smooth movement of animals over space through time. We propose a new continuous-time modelling framework that incorporates both an individual's (latent) activity centre and its (known) previous location and time of detection. By formulating the detections of an individual as an inhomogeneous temporal Poisson process, we develop a model drawing inspiration from the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, which is commonly used to model animal movement. Applying our model to a camera-trap survey of American martens, we observe a substantial improvement in model fit and notable differences in the estimated spatial distribution of activity centres. A simulation study shows that standard SCR models can produce substantially biased population estimates when spatio-temporal dependence is ignored, while the memory-based model remains robust. These findings highlight the importance of accounting for memory of previous detections in SCR models to improve ecological interpretation and inference.</p></details> | 19 pages, 4 figures |
| **[SPADE: Spatial-Aware Denoising Network for Open-vocabulary Panoptic Scene Graph Generation with Long- and Local-range Context Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05798v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Panoptic Scene Graph Generation (PSG) integrates instance segmentation with relation understanding to capture pixel-level structural relationships in complex scenes. Although recent approaches leveraging pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) have significantly improved performance in the open-vocabulary setting, they commonly ignore the inherent limitations of VLMs in spatial relation reasoning, such as difficulty in distinguishing object relative positions, which results in suboptimal relation prediction. Motivated by the denoising diffusion model's inversion process in preserving the spatial structure of input images, we propose SPADE (SPatial-Aware Denoising-nEtwork) framework -- a novel approach for open-vocabulary PSG. SPADE consists of two key steps: (1) inversion-guided calibration for the UNet adaptation, and (2) spatial-aware context reasoning. In the first step, we calibrate a general pre-trained teacher diffusion model into a PSG-specific denoising network with cross-attention maps derived during inversion through a lightweight LoRA-based fine-tuning strategy. In the second step, we develop a spatial-aware relation graph transformer that captures both local and long-range contextual information, facilitating the generation of high-quality relation queries. Extensive experiments on benchmark PSG and Visual Genome datasets demonstrate that SPADE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both closed- and open-set scenarios, particularly for spatial relationship prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[LiON-LoRA: Rethinking LoRA Fusion to Unify Controllable Spatial and Temporal Generation for Video Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05678v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in synthesizing realistic videos by learning from large-scale data. Although vanilla Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) can learn specific spatial or temporal movement to driven VDMs with constrained data, achieving precise control over both camera trajectories and object motion remains challenging due to the unstable fusion and non-linear scalability. To address these issues, we propose LiON-LoRA, a novel framework that rethinks LoRA fusion through three core principles: Linear scalability, Orthogonality, and Norm consistency. First, we analyze the orthogonality of LoRA features in shallow VDM layers, enabling decoupled low-level controllability. Second, norm consistency is enforced across layers to stabilize fusion during complex camera motion combinations. Third, a controllable token is integrated into the diffusion transformer (DiT) to linearly adjust motion amplitudes for both cameras and objects with a modified self-attention mechanism to ensure decoupled control. Additionally, we extend LiON-LoRA to temporal generation by leveraging static-camera videos, unifying spatial and temporal controllability. Experiments demonstrate that LiON-LoRA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in trajectory control accuracy and motion strength adjustment, achieving superior generalization with minimal training data.

| **[FreqCross: A Multi-Modal Frequency-Spatial Fusion Network for Robust Detection of Stable Diffusion 3.5 Generated Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02995v2)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of diffusion models, particularly Stable Diffusion 3.5, has enabled the generation of highly photorealistic synthetic images that pose significant challenges to existing detection methods. This paper presents FreqCross, a novel multi-modal fusion network that combines spatial RGB features, frequency domain artifacts, and radial energy distribution patterns to achieve robust detection of AI-generated images. Our approach leverages a three-branch architecture: (1) a ResNet-18 backbone for spatial feature extraction, (2) a lightweight CNN for processing 2D FFT magnitude spectra, and (3) a multi-layer perceptron for analyzing radial energy profiles. We introduce a novel radial energy distribution analysis that captures characteristic frequency artifacts inherent in diffusion-generated images, and fuse it with spatial and spectral cues via simple feature concatenation followed by a compact classification head. Extensive experiments on a dataset of 10,000 paired real (MS-COCO) and synthetic (Stable Diffusion 3.5) images demonstrate that FreqCross achieves 97.8\% accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines by 5.2\%. The frequency analysis further reveals that synthetic images exhibit distinct spectral signatures in the 0.1--0.4 normalised frequency range, providing theoretical foundation for our approach. Code and pre-trained models are publicly available to facilitate reproducible research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Satellite Object Localization with Dilated Convolutions and Attention-aided Spatial Pooling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05599v3)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object localization in satellite imagery is particularly challenging due to the high variability of objects, low spatial resolution, and interference from noise and dominant features such as clouds and city lights. In this research, we focus on three satellite datasets: upper atmospheric Gravity Waves (GW), mesospheric Bores (Bore), and Ocean Eddies (OE), each presenting its own unique challenges. These challenges include the variability in the scale and appearance of the main object patterns, where the size, shape, and feature extent of objects of interest can differ significantly. To address these challenges, we introduce YOLO-DCAP, a novel enhanced version of YOLOv5 designed to improve object localization in these complex scenarios. YOLO-DCAP incorporates a Multi-scale Dilated Residual Convolution (MDRC) block to capture multi-scale features at scale with varying dilation rates, and an Attention-aided Spatial Pooling (AaSP) module to focus on the global relevant spatial regions, enhancing feature selection. These structural improvements help to better localize objects in satellite imagery. Experimental results demonstrate that YOLO-DCAP significantly outperforms both the YOLO base model and state-of-the-art approaches, achieving an average improvement of 20.95% in mAP50 and 32.23% in IoU over the base model, and 7.35% and 9.84% respectively over state-of-the-art alternatives, consistently across all three satellite datasets. These consistent gains across all three satellite datasets highlight the robustness and generalizability of the proposed approach. Our code is open sourced at https://github.com/AI-4-atmosphere-remote-sensing/satellite-object-localization.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted to IEEE International Conference on Advanced Machine Learning and Data Science (AMLDS) 2025</p></details> |
| **[ZigzagPointMamba: Spatial-Semantic Mamba for Point Cloud Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21381v5)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State Space models (SSMs) such as PointMamba enable efficient feature extraction for point cloud self-supervised learning with linear complexity, outperforming Transformers in computational efficiency. However, existing PointMamba-based methods depend on complex token ordering and random masking, which disrupt spatial continuity and local semantic correlations. We propose ZigzagPointMamba to tackle these challenges. The core of our approach is a simple zigzag scan path that globally sequences point cloud tokens, enhancing spatial continuity by preserving the proximity of spatially adjacent point tokens. Nevertheless, random masking undermines local semantic modeling in self-supervised learning. To address this, we introduce a Semantic-Siamese Masking Strategy (SMS), which masks semantically similar tokens to facilitate reconstruction by integrating local features of original and similar tokens. This overcomes the dependence on isolated local features and enables robust global semantic modeling. Our pre-trained ZigzagPointMamba weights significantly improve downstream tasks, achieving a 1.59% mIoU gain on ShapeNetPart for part segmentation, a 0.4% higher accuracy on ModelNet40 for classification, and 0.19%, 1.22%, and 0.72% higher accuracies respectively for the classification tasks on the OBJ-BG, OBJ-ONLY, and PB-T50-RS subsets of ScanObjectNN.</p></details> |  |
| **[SEE-2-SOUND: Zero-Shot Spatial Environment-to-Spatial Sound](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06612v2)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating combined visual and auditory sensory experiences is critical for the consumption of immersive content. Recent advances in neural generative models have enabled the creation of high-resolution content across multiple modalities such as images, text, speech, and videos. Despite these successes, there remains a significant gap in the generation of high-quality spatial audio that complements generated visual content. Furthermore, current audio generation models excel in either generating natural audio or speech or music but fall short in integrating spatial audio cues necessary for immersive experiences. In this work, we introduce SEE-2-SOUND, a zero-shot approach that decomposes the task into (1) identifying visual regions of interest; (2) locating these elements in 3D space; (3) generating mono-audio for each; and (4) integrating them into spatial audio. Using our framework, we demonstrate compelling results for generating spatial audio for high-quality videos, images, and dynamic images from the internet, as well as media generated by learned approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://see2sound.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[LAID: Lightweight AI-Generated Image Detection in Spatial and Spectral Domains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05162v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent proliferation of photorealistic AI-generated images (AIGI) has raised urgent concerns about their potential misuse, particularly on social media platforms. Current state-of-the-art AIGI detection methods typically rely on large, deep neural architectures, creating significant computational barriers to real-time, large-scale deployment on platforms like social media. To challenge this reliance on computationally intensive models, we introduce LAID, the first framework -- to our knowledge -- that benchmarks and evaluates the detection performance and efficiency of off-the-shelf lightweight neural networks. In this framework, we comprehensively train and evaluate selected models on a representative subset of the GenImage dataset across spatial, spectral, and fusion image domains. Our results demonstrate that lightweight models can achieve competitive accuracy, even under adversarial conditions, while incurring substantially lower memory and computation costs compared to current state-of-the-art methods. This study offers valuable insight into the trade-off between efficiency and performance in AIGI detection and lays a foundation for the development of practical, scalable, and trustworthy detection systems.

| **[3D SA-UNet: 3D Spatial Attention UNet with 3D Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling for White Matter Hyperintensities Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08402v4)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>White Matter Hyperintensity (WMH) is an imaging feature related to various diseases such as dementia and stroke. Accurately segmenting WMH using computer technology is crucial for early disease diagnosis. However, this task remains challenging due to the small lesions with low contrast and high discontinuity in the images, which contain limited contextual and spatial information. To address this challenge, we propose a deep learning model called 3D Spatial Attention U-Net (3D SA-UNet) for automatic WMH segmentation using only Fluid Attenuation Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) scans. The 3D SA-UNet introduces a 3D Spatial Attention Module that highlights important lesion features, such as WMH, while suppressing unimportant regions. Additionally, to capture features at different scales, we extend the Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) module to a 3D version, enhancing the segmentation performance of the network. We evaluate our method on publicly available dataset and demonstrate the effectiveness of 3D spatial attention module and 3D ASPP in WMH segmentation. Through experimental results, it has been demonstrated that our proposed 3D SA-UNet model achieves higher accuracy compared to other state-of-the-art 3D convolutional neural networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Extended SONICOM HRTF Dataset and Spatial Audio Metrics Toolbox](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05053v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Headphone-based spatial audio uses head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) to simulate real-world acoustic environments. HRTFs are unique to everyone, due to personal morphology, shaping how sound waves interact with the body before reaching the eardrums. Here we present the extended SONICOM HRTF dataset which expands on the previous version released in 2023. The total number of measured subjects has now been increased to 300, with demographic information for a subset of the participants, providing context for the dataset's population and relevance. The dataset incorporates synthesised HRTFs for 200 of the 300 subjects, generated using Mesh2HRTF, alongside pre-processed 3D scans of the head and ears, optimised for HRTF synthesis. This rich dataset facilitates rapid and iterative optimisation of HRTF synthesis algorithms, allowing the automatic generation of large data. The optimised scans enable seamless morphological modifications, providing insights into how anatomical changes impact HRTFs, and the larger sample size enhances the effectiveness of machine learning approaches. To support analysis, we also introduce the Spatial Audio Metrics (SAM) Toolbox, a Python package designed for efficient analysis and visualisation of HRTF data, offering customisable tools for advanced research. Together, the extended dataset and toolbox offer a comprehensive resource for advancing personalised spatial audio research and development.</p></details> | <details><summary>For d...</summary><p>For dataset: https://www.axdesign.co.uk/tools-and-devices/sonicom-hrtf-dataset.

| **[HGNet: High-Order Spatial Awareness Hypergraph and Multi-Scale Context Attention Network for Colorectal Polyp Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04880v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is closely linked to the malignant transformation of colorectal polyps, making early detection essential. However, current models struggle with detecting small lesions, accurately localizing boundaries, and providing interpretable decisions. To address these issues, we propose HGNet, which integrates High-Order Spatial Awareness Hypergraph and Multi-Scale Context Attention. Key innovations include: (1) an Efficient Multi-Scale Context Attention (EMCA) module to enhance lesion feature representation and boundary modeling; (2) the deployment of a spatial hypergraph convolution module before the detection head to capture higher-order spatial relationships between nodes; (3) the application of transfer learning to address the scarcity of medical image data; and (4) Eigen Class Activation Map (Eigen-CAM) for decision visualization. Experimental results show that HGNet achieves 94% accuracy, 90.6% recall, and 90% mAP@0.5, significantly improving small lesion differentiation and clinical interpretability. The source code will be made publicly available upon publication of this paper.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial and Semantic Embedding Integration for Stereo Sound Event Localization and Detection in Regular Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04845v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This report presents our systems submitted to the audio-only and audio-visual tracks of the DCASE2025 Task 3 Challenge: Stereo Sound Event Localization and Detection (SELD) in Regular Video Content. SELD is a complex task that combines temporal event classification with spatial localization, requiring reasoning across spatial, temporal, and semantic dimensions. The last is arguably the most challenging to model. Traditional SELD architectures rely on multichannel input, which limits their ability to leverage large-scale pre-training due to data constraints. To address this, we enhance standard SELD architectures with semantic information by integrating pre-trained, contrastive language-aligned models: CLAP for audio and OWL-ViT for visual inputs. These embeddings are incorporated into a modified Conformer module tailored for multimodal fusion, which we refer to as the Cross-Modal Conformer. Additionally, we incorporate autocorrelation-based acoustic features to improve distance estimation. We pre-train our models on curated synthetic audio and audio-visual datasets and apply a left-right channel swapping augmentation to further increase the training data. Both our audio-only and audio-visual systems substantially outperform the challenge baselines on the development set, demonstrating the effectiveness of our strategy. Performance is further improved through model ensembling and a visual post-processing step based on human keypoints. Future work will investigate the contribution of each modality and explore architectural variants to further enhance results.</p></details> |  |

GWR and MGWR provide simple implementation yet powerful frameworks that could be extended to various disciplines that handle spatial data. This bibliography aims to serve as a comprehensive compilation of peer-reviewed papers that have utilized GWR or MGWR as a primary analytical method to conduct spatial analyses and acts as a useful guide to anyone searching the literature for previous examples of local statistical modeling in a wide variety of application fields.</p></details> | 482 pages |

We study a toy localization task with a convolutional architecture and show that normalization layers enable an iterative message passing procedure, allowing information aggregation from well outside the local receptive field. Our results suggest that normalization layers should be employed with caution in applications such as diffusion-based trajectory generation, where maintaining a spatially limited receptive field is crucial.</p></details> |  |
| **[Identity-Preserving Text-to-Video Generation Guided by Simple yet Effective Spatial-Temporal Decoupled Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04705v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identity-preserving text-to-video (IPT2V) generation, which aims to create high-fidelity videos with consistent human identity, has become crucial for downstream applications. However, current end-to-end frameworks suffer a critical spatial-temporal trade-off: optimizing for spatially coherent layouts of key elements (e.g., character identity preservation) often compromises instruction-compliant temporal smoothness, while prioritizing dynamic realism risks disrupting the spatial coherence of visual structures. To tackle this issue, we propose a simple yet effective spatial-temporal decoupled framework that decomposes representations into spatial features for layouts and temporal features for motion dynamics. Specifically, our paper proposes a semantic prompt optimization mechanism and stage-wise decoupled generation paradigm. The former module decouples the prompt into spatial and temporal components. Aligned with the subsequent stage-wise decoupled approach, the spatial prompts guide the text-to-image (T2I) stage to generate coherent spatial features, while the temporal prompts direct the sequential image-to-video (I2V) stage to ensure motion consistency. Experimental results validate that our approach achieves excellent spatiotemporal consistency, demonstrating outstanding performance in identity preservation, text relevance, and video quality. By leveraging this simple yet robust mechanism, our algorithm secures the runner-up position in 2025 ACM MultiMedia Challenge.</p></details> |  |
| **[SPATIA: Multimodal Model for Prediction and Generation of Spatial Cell Phenotypes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04704v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding how cellular morphology, gene expression, and spatial organization jointly shape tissue function is a central challenge in biology. Image-based spatial transcriptomics technologies now provide high-resolution measurements of cell images and gene expression profiles, but machine learning methods typically analyze these modalities in isolation or at limited resolution. We address the problem of learning unified, spatially aware representations that integrate cell morphology, gene expression, and spatial context across biological scales. This requires models that can operate at single-cell resolution, reason across spatial neighborhoods, and generalize to whole-slide tissue organization. Here, we introduce SPATIA, a multi-scale generative and predictive model for spatial transcriptomics. SPATIA learns cell-level embeddings by fusing image-derived morphological tokens and transcriptomic vector tokens using cross-attention and then aggregates them at niche and tissue levels using transformer modules to capture spatial dependencies. SPATIA incorporates token merging in its generative diffusion decoder to synthesize high-resolution cell images conditioned on gene expression. We assembled a multi-scale dataset consisting of 17 million cell-gene pairs, 1 million niche-gene pairs, and 10,000 tissue-gene pairs across 49 donors, 17 tissue types, and 12 disease states. We benchmark SPATIA against 13 existing models across 12 individual tasks, which span several categories including cell annotation, cell clustering, gene imputation, cross-modal prediction, and image generation. SPATIA achieves improved performance over all baselines and generates realistic cell morphologies that reflect transcriptomic perturbations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bio-Inspired Hybrid Map: Spatial Implicit Local Frames and Topological Map for Mobile Cobot Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04649v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Navigation is a fundamental capacity for mobile robots, enabling them to operate autonomously in complex and dynamic environments. Conventional approaches use probabilistic models to localize robots and build maps simultaneously using sensor observations. Recent approaches employ human-inspired learning, such as imitation and reinforcement learning, to navigate robots more effectively. However, these methods suffer from high computational costs, global map inconsistency, and poor generalization to unseen environments. This paper presents a novel method inspired by how humans perceive and navigate themselves effectively in novel environments. Specifically, we first build local frames that mimic how humans represent essential spatial information in the short term. Points in local frames are hybrid representations, including spatial information and learned features, so-called spatial-implicit local frames. Then, we integrate spatial-implicit local frames into the global topological map represented as a factor graph. Lastly, we developed a novel navigation algorithm based on Rapid-Exploring Random Tree Star (RRT*) that leverages spatial-implicit local frames and the topological map to navigate effectively in environments. To validate our approach, we conduct extensive experiments in real-world datasets and in-lab environments. We open our source code at https://github.com/tuantdang/simn}{https://github.com/tuantdang/simn.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial-Temporal Conditional Random Field for Human Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18198v2)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is of significant importance in computer vision. Accurate pedestrian trajectory prediction benefits autonomous vehicles and robots in planning their motion. Pedestrians' trajectories are greatly influenced by their intentions. Prior studies having introduced various deep learning methods only pay attention to the spatial and temporal information of trajectory, overlooking the explicit intention information. In this study, we introduce a novel model, termed the \textbf{S-T CRF}: \textbf{S}patial-\textbf{T}emporal \textbf{C}onditional \textbf{R}andom \textbf{F}ield, which judiciously incorporates intention information besides spatial and temporal information of trajectory. This model uses a Conditional Random Field (CRF) to generate a representation of future intentions, greatly improving the prediction of subsequent trajectories when combined with spatial-temporal representation. Furthermore, the study innovatively devises a space CRF loss and a time CRF loss, meticulously designed to enhance interaction constraints and temporal dynamics, respectively. Extensive experimental evaluations on dataset ETH/UCY and SDD demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses existing baseline approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[S$^2$Edit: Text-Guided Image Editing with Precise Semantic and Spatial Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04584v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in diffusion models have enabled high-quality generation and manipulation of images guided by texts, as well as concept learning from images. However, naive applications of existing methods to editing tasks that require fine-grained control, e.g., face editing, often lead to suboptimal solutions with identity information and high-frequency details lost during the editing process, or irrelevant image regions altered due to entangled concepts. In this work, we propose S$^2$Edit, a novel method based on a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model that enables personalized editing with precise semantic and spatial control. We first fine-tune our model to embed the identity information into a learnable text token. During fine-tuning, we disentangle the learned identity token from attributes to be edited by enforcing an orthogonality constraint in the textual feature space. To ensure that the identity token only affects regions of interest, we apply object masks to guide the cross-attention maps. At inference time, our method performs localized editing while faithfully preserving the original identity with semantically disentangled and spatially focused identity token learned. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of S$^2$Edit over state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively. Additionally, we showcase several compositional image editing applications of S$^2$Edit such as makeup transfer.</p></details> |  |

While existing deep learning models predominantly utilize CYGNSS data with four-channel information, they often adopt single-channel inputs or simple channel concatenation without leveraging the benefits of cross-channel information interaction during training. To address this limitation, a novel spatial-channel attention-based network, namely SCAWaveNet, is proposed for SWH retrieval. Specifically, features from each channel of the DDMs are modeled as independent attention heads, enabling the fusion of spatial and channel-wise information. For auxiliary parameters, a lightweight attention mechanism is designed to assign weights along the spatial and channel dimensions. The final feature integrates both spatial and channel-level characteristics. Model performance is evaluated using four-channel CYGNSS data. When ERA5 is used as a reference, SCAWaveNet achieves an average RMSE of 0.438 m. When using buoy data from NDBC, the average RMSE reaches 0.432 m. Compared to state-of-the-art models, SCAWaveNet reduces the average RMSE by at least 3.52% on the ERA5 dataset and by 5.68% on the NDBC buoy observations.

We investigate the PCA of the sample spatial-sign covariance matrix in both nonsparse and sparse contexts, referring to them as SPCA and SSPCA, respectively. We present both nonasymptotic and asymptotic analyses to quantify the theoretical performance of SPCA and SSPCA. In sparse settings, we demonstrate that SSPCA, implemented through a combinatoric program, achieves the optimal rate of convergence. Our proposed SSPCA method is computationally efficient and exhibits robustness against heavy-tailed distributions compared to existing methods. Simulation studies and real-world data applications further validate the superiority of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Spatially-Varying Gain and Binning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04190v1)** | 2025-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pixels in image sensors have progressively become smaller, driven by the goal of producing higher-resolution imagery. However, ceteris paribus, a smaller pixel accumulates less light, making image quality worse. This interplay of resolution, noise, and the dynamic range of the sensor and their impact on the eventual quality of acquired imagery is a fundamental concept in photography. In this paper, we propose spatially-varying gain and binning to enhance the noise performance and dynamic range of image sensors. First, we show that by varying gain spatially to local scene brightness, the read noise can be made negligible, and the dynamic range of a sensor is expanded by an order of magnitude. Second, we propose a simple analysis to find a binning size that best balances resolution and noise for a given light level; this analysis predicts a spatially-varying binning strategy, again based on local scene brightness, to effectively increase the overall signal-to-noise ratio. % without sacrificing resolution. We discuss analog and digital binning modes and, perhaps surprisingly, show that digital binning outperforms its analog counterparts when a larger gain is allowed. Finally, we demonstrate that combining spatially-varying gain and binning in various applications, including high dynamic range imaging, vignetting, and lens distortion.</p></details> |  |
| **[Flux-Sculptor: Text-Driven Rich-Attribute Portrait Editing through Decomposed Spatial Flow Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03979v1)** | 2025-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-driven portrait editing holds significant potential for various applications but also presents considerable challenges. An ideal text-driven portrait editing approach should achieve precise localization and appropriate content modification, yet existing methods struggle to balance reconstruction fidelity and editing flexibility. To address this issue, we propose Flux-Sculptor, a flux-based framework designed for precise text-driven portrait editing. Our framework introduces a Prompt-Aligned Spatial Locator (PASL) to accurately identify relevant editing regions and a Structure-to-Detail Edit Control (S2D-EC) strategy to spatially guide the denoising process through sequential mask-guided fusion of latent representations and attention values. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Flux-Sculptor surpasses existing methods in rich-attribute editing and facial information preservation, making it a strong candidate for practical portrait editing applications.

However, to maintain this performance in dynamic scenarios, resource-intensive data-driven tracking algorithms become necessary to provide precise spatial guidance conditioned on the initial direction of a target speaker. As this additional computational overhead hinders application in resource-constrained scenarios such as real-time speech enhancement, we present a novel strategy utilizing a low-complexity tracking algorithm in the form of a particle filter instead. Assuming a causal, sequential processing style, we introduce temporal feedback to leverage the enhanced speech signal of the spatially selective filter to compensate for the limited modeling capabilities of the particle filter. Evaluation on a synthetic dataset illustrates how the autoregressive interplay between both algorithms drastically improves tracking accuracy and leads to strong enhancement performance. A listening test with real-world recordings complements these findings by indicating a clear trend towards our proposed self-steering pipeline as preferred choice over comparable methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE Workshop on Applications of Signal Processing to Audio and Acoustics (WASPAA) 2025.

| **[Agentic 3D Scene Generation with Spatially Contextualized VLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20129v3)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent advances in multimodal content generation enabled by vision-language models (VLMs), their ability to reason about and generate structured 3D scenes remains largely underexplored. This limitation constrains their utility in spatially grounded tasks such as embodied AI, immersive simulations, and interactive 3D applications. We introduce a new paradigm that enables VLMs to generate, understand, and edit complex 3D environments by injecting a continually evolving spatial context. Constructed from multimodal input, this context consists of three components: a scene portrait that provides a high-level semantic blueprint, a semantically labeled point cloud capturing object-level geometry, and a scene hypergraph that encodes rich spatial relationships, including unary, binary, and higher-order constraints. Together, these components provide the VLM with a structured, geometry-aware working memory that integrates its inherent multimodal reasoning capabilities with structured 3D understanding for effective spatial reasoning. Building on this foundation, we develop an agentic 3D scene generation pipeline in which the VLM iteratively reads from and updates the spatial context. The pipeline features high-quality asset generation with geometric restoration, environment setup with automatic verification, and ergonomic adjustment guided by the scene hypergraph. Experiments show that our framework can handle diverse and challenging inputs, achieving a level of generalization not observed in prior work. Further results demonstrate that injecting spatial context enables VLMs to perform downstream tasks such as interactive scene editing and path planning, suggesting strong potential for spatially intelligent systems in computer graphics, 3D vision, and embodied applications.

We propose a novel Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning-based RDSN (PPFL-RDSN) framework specifically tailored for lossy image reconstruction. PPFL-RDSN integrates Federated Learning (FL), local differential privacy, and robust model watermarking techniques, ensuring data remains secure on local devices, safeguarding sensitive information, and maintaining model authenticity without revealing underlying data. Empirical evaluations show that PPFL-RDSN achieves comparable performance to the state-of-the-art centralized methods while reducing computational burdens, and effectively mitigates security and privacy vulnerabilities, making it a practical solution for secure and privacy-preserving collaborative computer vision applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>One o...</summary><p>One of the co-authors strongly wants to withdraw it due to a funding issue</p></details> |

Therefore, the upcoming IEEE 802.11bn amendment introduces multi-access point coordination (MAPC) methods. This paper addresses a variant of MAPC called coordinated spatial reuse (C-SR), where devices transmit simultaneously on the same channel, with the power adjusted to minimize interference. The C-SR scheduling problem is selecting which devices transmit concurrently and with what settings. We provide a theoretical upper bound model, optimized for either throughput or fairness, which finds the best possible transmission schedule using mixed-integer linear programming. Then, a practical, probing-based approach is proposed which uses multi-armed bandits (MABs), a type of reinforcement learning, to solve the C-SR scheduling problem. We validate both classical (flat) MAB and hierarchical MAB (H-MAB) schemes with simulations and in a testbed. Using H-MABs for C-SR improves aggregate throughput over legacy IEEE 802.11 (on average by 80% in random scenarios), without reducing the number of transmission opportunities per station. Finally, our framework is lightweight and ready for implementation in Wi-Fi devices.</p></details> |  |

In this work, using an independent multi-agent Q-learning algorithm, we study the effects of dilution and mobility in the spatial version of the prisoner's dilemma. Within this setting, different possible actions for the algorithm are defined, connecting with previous results on the classical, non-reinforcement learning spatial prisoner's dilemma, showcasing the versatility of the algorithm in modeling different game-theoretical scenarios and the benchmarking potential of this approach. As a result, a range of effects is observed, including evidence that games with fixed update rules can be qualitatively equivalent to those with learned ones, as well as the emergence of a symbiotic mutualistic effect between populations that forms when multiple actions are defined.</p></details> | <details><summary>Re-su...</summary><p>Re-submitted to fix typos</p></details> |

Drawing on Henri Lefebvre's spatial triad, this study proposes a conceptual and methodological framework to quantify street-level exercise deprivation through the dimensions of conceived (planning and structure), perceived (visual and sensory), and lived (practice and experiential) urban spaces. We integrate multi-source spatial data-including street networks, street-view imagery, and social media-using explainable machine learning (SHAP analysis) to classify streets by their dominant deprivation modes, forming a novel typology of spatial inequity. Results highlight significant differences across urban contexts: older city cores predominantly experience infrastructural constraints (conceived space), whereas new development areas suffer from experiential disengagement (lived space). Furthermore, by identifying spatial mismatches between population distribution and exercise intensity, our study reveals localized clusters of latent deprivation. Simulation experiments demonstrate that targeted improvements across spatial dimensions can yield up to 14% increases in exercise supportiveness. This research not only operationalizes Lefebvre's spatial theory at the street scale but also provides actionable insights and intervention guidelines, contributing to the broader goals of spatial justice and urban health equity.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 3 tables and 11 figures</p></details> |

While CLIP-ViT works well for capturing global image features, it struggles to model local relationships between adjacent patches, leading to weaker visual representation, which in turn affects the detailed understanding ability of MLLMs. To solve this, we propose LLaVA-SP, which only adds six spatial visual tokens to the original visual tokens to enhance the visual representation. Our approach offers three key advantages: 1) We propose a novel Projector, which uses convolutional kernels to derive visual spatial tokens from ViT patch features, simulating two visual spatial ordering approaches: "from central region to global" and "from abstract to specific". Then, a cross-attention mechanism is applied to fuse fine-grained visual information, enriching the overall visual representation. 2) We present two model variants: LLaVA-SP-Cropping, which focuses on detail features through progressive cropping, and LLaVA-SP-Pooling, which captures global semantics through adaptive pooling, enabling the model to handle diverse visual understanding tasks. 3) Extensive experiments show that LLaVA-SP, fine-tuned with LoRA, achieves significant performance improvements across various multimodal benchmarks, outperforming the state-of-the-art LLaVA-1.5 model in multiple tasks with nearly identical inference latency.

It is one of few locations that provide directly observable responses, and its physiology serves as model or reference for almost all other TMS targets, e.g., through the motor threshold and spatial targeting relative to its position. It furthermore sets the safety limits for the entire brain. Its easily detectable responses have led to closed-loop methods for a range of aspects, e.g., for automated thresholding, amplitude tracking, and targeting. The high variability of brain stimulation methods would substantially benefit from fast unbiased closed-loop methods. However, the development of more potent methods would early on in the design phase require proper models that allowed tuning and testing with sufficient without a high number of experiments, which are time-consuming and expensive or even impossible at the needed scale. On the one hand, theoretical researchers without access to experiments miss realistic spatial response models of brain stimulation to develop better methods. On the other hand, subjects should potentially not be exposed to early closed-loop-methods without sufficient prior testing as not yet well tuned feed-back as needed for closed-loop operation is known to erratic behavior. To bridge this gap, we developed a digital-twin-style population model that generates motor evoked potentials in response to virtual stimuli and includes statistical information on spatial (coil position and orientation) as well as recruitment in the population to represent inter- and intra-individual variability. The model allows users to simulate different subjects and millions of runs for software-in-the loop testing. The model includes all code to stimulate further development.</p></details> | 14 pages, 1 figure |

Both tasks are solved by a two-step hierarchical algorithm. The first step differs for the two tasks generating either a piecewise-affine or a Dubins reference path. The second step leverages a transformation of vehicle dynamics from the time domain into the spatial domain and linear programming. Benefits, such as a hyperparameter-free objective function and spatial constraints useful for area coverage gaps avoidance and precision path planning, are discussed. The method, which is a deterministic optimisation-based method, is evaluated on 5 real-world fields solving 19 instances of the first task and 84 instances of the second task.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 12 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Following the paradigm introduced by DUSt3R, which unifies an image pair densely into a shared coordinate system, subsequent methods maintain an implicit memory to achieve dense 3D reconstruction from more images. However, such implicit memory is limited in capacity and may suffer from information loss of earlier frames. We propose Point3R, an online framework targeting dense streaming 3D reconstruction. To be specific, we maintain an explicit spatial pointer memory directly associated with the 3D structure of the current scene. Each pointer in this memory is assigned a specific 3D position and aggregates scene information nearby in the global coordinate system into a changing spatial feature. Information extracted from the latest frame interacts explicitly with this pointer memory, enabling dense integration of the current observation into the global coordinate system. We design a 3D hierarchical position embedding to promote this interaction and design a simple yet effective fusion mechanism to ensure that our pointer memory is uniform and efficient. Our method achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance on various tasks with low training costs.

It extends Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) by integrating team welfare objectives specifically for spatial public goods games. Unlike conventional approaches where cooperation emerges indirectly from individual rewards, TUC-PPO instead optimizes a bi-level objective integrating policy gradients and team utility constraints. Consequently, all policy updates explicitly incorporate collective payoff thresholds. The framework preserves PPO's policy gradient core while incorporating constrained optimization through adaptive Lagrangian multipliers. Therefore, decentralized agents dynamically balance selfish and cooperative incentives. The comparative analysis demonstrates superior performance of this constrained deep reinforcement learning approach compared to unmodified PPO and evolutionary game theory baselines. It achieves faster convergence to cooperative equilibria and greater stability against invasion by defectors. The framework formally integrates team objectives into policy updates. This work advances multi-agent deep reinforcement learning for social dilemmas while providing new computational tools for evolutionary game theory research.</p></details> |  |

Joint spatial division and multiplexing (JSDM) emerges as a low-overhead transmission scheme for multi-user equipment (UE) scenarios, typically requiring complex matrix decomposition to achieve block-diagonalization of the effective channel matrix. In this study, we introduce an innovative JSDM design that leverages RISs to customize channels, thereby streamlining the overall procedures. By strategically positioning RISs at the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) directions of the base station (BS), we establish orthogonal line-of-sight links within the BS-RIS channel, enabling a straightforward pre-beamforming design. Based on UE grouping, we devise reflected beams of the RIS with optimized directions to mitigate inter-group interference in the RISs-UEs channel. An approximation of the channel cross-correlation coefficient is derived and serves as a foundation for the RISs-UEs association, further diminishing inter-group interference. Numerical results substantiate the efficacy of our RIS-customized JSDM in not only achieving effective channel block-diagonalization but also in significantly enhancing the sum spectral efficiency for multi-UE transmissions.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Current research addresses subgraph-FL only from the structural perspective, neglecting the propagation of graph signals on spatial and spectral domains of the structure. From a spatial perspective, subgraph-FL introduces edge disconnections between clients, leading to disruptions in label signals and a degradation in the class knowledge of the global GNN. From a spectral perspective, spectral heterogeneity causes inconsistencies in signal frequencies across subgraphs, which makes local GNNs overfit the local signal propagation schemes. As a result, spectral client drifts occur, undermining global generalizability. To tackle the challenges, we propose a global knowledge repository to mitigate label signal disruption and a frequency alignment to address spectral client drifts. The combination of spatial and spectral strategies forms our framework S2FGL. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the superiority of S2FGL.

Traditional detectors represent temporal information merely by stacking spatial frequency spectra across frames, resulting in the failure to detect temporal artifacts in the pixel plane. Our approach performs a 1D Fourier transform on the time axis for each pixel, extracting features highly sensitive to temporal inconsistencies, especially in areas prone to unnatural movements. To precisely locate regions containing the temporal artifacts, we introduce an attention proposal module trained in an end-to-end manner. Additionally, our joint transformer module effectively integrates pixel-wise temporal frequency features with spatio-temporal context features, expanding the range of detectable forgery artifacts. Our framework represents a significant advancement in deepfake video detection, providing robust performance across diverse and challenging detection scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by iccv 2025. code is will be available at https://github.com/rama0126/PwTF-DVD</p></details> |

Different from the conventional SC-TCs, the proposed codes have simpler and deterministic coupling structures. Most notably, the coupling of HSC-BCCs is performed by re-encoding the whole coupling sequence in the component encoder of one time instant, rather than spreading the coupling bits to component encoders of multiple time instants. This simplification not only addresses the window decoding threshold loss issue in existing BCCs, but also allows the proposed codes to attain very close-to-capacity performance with a coupling memory as small as 2. Both theoretical and numerical results are provided to demonstrate the performance advantages of the proposed codes over existing spatially coupled codes.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is an extended version of conference paper "Half Spatially Coupled Turbo-Like Codes" accepted by 2025 IEEE Information Theory Workshop</p></details> |

However, prevalent AR models predominantly rely on the transformer architectures, which are beset by quadratic computational complexity concerning input sequence length and substantial memory overhead due to the necessity of maintaining key-value caches. Although linear attention mechanisms have successfully reduced this burden in language models, our initial experiments reveal that they significantly degrade image generation quality because of their inability to capture critical long-range dependencies in visual data. We propose Linear Attention with Spatial-Aware Decay (LASAD), a novel attention mechanism that explicitly preserves genuine 2D spatial relationships within the flattened image sequences by computing position-dependent decay factors based on true 2D spatial location rather than 1D sequence positions. Based on this mechanism, we present LASADGen, an autoregressive image generator that enables selective attention to relevant spatial contexts with linear complexity. Experiments on ImageNet show LASADGen achieves state-of-the-art image generation performance and computational efficiency, bridging the gap between linear attention's efficiency and spatial understanding needed for high-quality generation.</p></details> |  |

Using this high resolution data, we generate spatially distributed contact angle maps that reveal previously hidden wettability heterogeneity. Our analysis of mixed-wet systems demonstrates the severe limitations of averaged metrics: a sample with a mean contact angle of 64.7 degrees, conventionally classified as uniformly weakly water-wet, exhibits 40% of its pore space in the intermediate-wetting regime (70-110 degrees). This heterogeneity explains the presence of minimal surface interfaces and fundamentally different pore-filling mechanisms operating within the same sample. By providing open-source tools for spatially-resolved wettability characterization, this work enables more accurate predictions of multiphase flow behavior in heterogeneous porous materials, essential for optimizing subsurface energy storage and recovery processes.</p></details> |  |

A novel deep reinforcement learning framework, Proximal Policy Optimization with Adversarial Curriculum Transfer (PPO-ACT), is proposed to model agent strategy optimization in dynamic environments. Traditional evolutionary game models frequently exhibit limitations in modeling long-term decision-making processes. Deep reinforcement learning effectively addresses this limitation by bridging policy gradient methods with evolutionary game theory. Our study pioneers the application of proximal policy optimization's continuous strategy optimization capability to public goods games through a two-stage adversarial curriculum transfer training paradigm. The experimental results show that PPO-ACT performs better in critical enhancement factor regimes. Compared to conventional standard proximal policy optimization methods, Q-learning and Fermi update rules, achieve earlier cooperation phase transitions and maintain stable cooperative equilibria. This framework exhibits better robustness when handling challenging scenarios like all-defector initial conditions. Systematic comparisons reveal the unique advantage of policy gradient methods in population-scale cooperation, i.e., achieving spatiotemporal payoff coordination through value function propagation. Our work provides a new computational framework for studying cooperation emergence in complex systems, algorithmically validating the punishment promotes cooperation hypothesis while offering methodological insights for multi-agent system strategy design.</p></details> |  |

In particular, the network structure, which incorporates a flexible sparse deviation that can be regarded either as a latent component or as a misspecification of a predetermined adjacency matrix, is estimated using a debiased machine learning approach. The theoretical analysis establishes the consistency and asymptotic normality of our proposed estimator, taking into account general temporal and spatial dependencies inherent in the data-generating processes. A primary contribution of our study is the development of a uniform inference theory, which enables hypothesis testing on the parameters of interest, including zero or non-zero elements in the network structure. Additionally, the asymptotic properties of the estimator are derived for both linear and nonlinear moments. Simulations demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed approach. Finally, we apply our methodology to investigate the spatial network effects of stock returns.</p></details> |  |

A fundamental question, however, remains: What is the maximum spatial degree of freedom (DoF) of spatial multiplexing in the distance domain? In this paper, we address this open problem by investigating the spatial DoF of a line-of-sight (LoS) channel between a large two-dimensional transmit aperture and a linear receive array with collinearly-aligned elements (i.e., at the same angular direction) but located at different distances from the transmit aperture. We assume that both the aperture and linear array are continuous-aperture (CAP) arrays with an infinite number of elements and infinitesimal spacing, which establishes an upper bound for the spatial degrees of freedom (DoF) in the case of finite elements. First, we assume an ideal case where the transmit array is a single piece and the linear array is on the broad side of the transmit array. By reformulating the channel as an integral operator with a Hermitian convolution kernel, we derive a closed-form expression for the spatial DoF via the Fourier transform. Our analysis shows that the spatial DoF in the distance domain is predominantly determined by the extreme boundaries of the array rather than its detailed interior structure. We further extend the framework to non-broadside configurations by employing a projection method, which effectively converts the spatial DoF to an equivalent broadside case. Finally, we extend our analytical framework to the modular array, which shows the spatial DoF gain over the single-piece array given the constraint of the physical length of the array.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages and 13 figures.

Existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for MIG often rely on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with large amounts of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning annotations, which are expensive and time-consuming to acquire. Recently, DeepSeek-R1 demonstrated that Large Language Models (LLMs) can acquire reasoning abilities through Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) without requiring CoT annotations. In this paper, we adapt the GRPO reinforcement learning framework to VLMs for Medical Image Grounding. We propose the Spatial-Semantic Rewarded Group Relative Policy Optimization to train the model without CoT reasoning annotations. Specifically, we introduce Spatial-Semantic Rewards, which combine spatial accuracy reward and semantic consistency reward to provide nuanced feedback for both spatially positive and negative completions. Additionally, we propose to use the Chain-of-Box template, which integrates visual information of referring bounding boxes into the <think> reasoning process, enabling the model to explicitly reason about spatial regions during intermediate steps.

However, this memory mechanism is very sensitive to even small imperfections, such as noise or heterogeneity, which are both common in biological systems. Previous work has shown that discretising the continuum into a finite set of discrete attractor states provides robustness to these imperfections, but necessarily reduces the resolution of the represented variable, creating a dilemma between stability and resolution. We show that this stability-resolution dilemma is most severe for CANs using unimodal bump-like codes, as in traditional models. To overcome this, we investigate sparse binary distributed codes based on random feature embeddings, in which neurons have spatially-periodic receptive fields. We demonstrate theoretically and with simulations that such grid-cell-like codes enable CANs to achieve both high stability and high resolution simultaneously. The model extends to embedding arbitrary nonlinear manifolds into a CAN, such as spheres or tori, and generalises linear path integration to integration along freely-programmable on-manifold vector fields. Together, this work provides a theory of how the brain could robustly represent continuous variables with high resolution and perform flexible computations over task-relevant manifolds.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 4 figures.

We provide uniform stability estimates that grant spectral convergence of the (spatially) semi-discretized solutions towards the corresponding continuous solution provided that the underlying system satisfies some suitable structural assumptions. We consider a setting with sharp low-pass filters and a setting with smooth low-pass filters and argue that - at least theoretically - smooth low-pass filters are operable on a larger class of systems. While our theoretical results are supported with numerical evidence, we also pinpoint some behavior of the numerical method that currently has no theoretical explanation.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 7 figures.

| **[ATSTrack: Enhancing Visual-Language Tracking by Aligning Temporal and Spatial Scales](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00454v1)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A main challenge of Visual-Language Tracking (VLT) is the misalignment between visual inputs and language descriptions caused by target movement. Previous trackers have explored many effective feature modification methods to preserve more aligned features. However, an important yet unexplored factor ultimately hinders their capability, which is the inherent differences in the temporal and spatial scale of information between visual and language inputs. To address this issue, we propose a novel visual-language tracker that enhances the effect of feature modification by \textbf{A}ligning \textbf{T}emporal and \textbf{S}patial scale of different input components, named as \textbf{ATSTrack}. Specifically, we decompose each language description into phrases with different attributes based on their temporal and spatial correspondence with visual inputs, and modify their features in a fine-grained manner. Moreover, we introduce a Visual-Language token that comprises modified linguistic information from the previous frame to guide the model to extract visual features that are more relevant to language description, thereby reducing the impact caused by the differences in spatial scale. Experimental results show that our proposed ATSTrack achieves performance comparable to existing methods. Our code will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evo-0: Vision-Language-Action Model with Implicit Spatial Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00416v1)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a promising framework for enabling generalist robots capable of perceiving, reasoning, and acting in the real world. These models usually build upon pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which excel at semantic understanding due to large-scale text pretraining. However, VLMs typically lack precise spatial understanding capabilities, as they are primarily tuned on 2D image-text pairs without 3D supervision. To address this limitation, recent approaches have incorporated explicit 3D inputs such as point clouds or depth maps, but this necessitates additional depth sensors or defective estimation. In contrast, our work introduces a plug-and-play module that implicitly injects 3D geometry features into VLA models by leveraging an off-the-shelf visual geometry foundation models. We design five spatially challenging tasks that require precise spatial understanding ability to validate effectiveness of our method. Extensive evaluations show that our method significantly improves the performance of state-of-the-art VLA models across diverse scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ascending the Infinite Ladder: Benchmarking Spatial Deformation Reasoning in Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02978v1)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans naturally possess the spatial reasoning ability to form and manipulate images and structures of objects in space. There is an increasing effort to endow Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with similar spatial reasoning capabilities. However, it remains unclear whether these models truly understand and manipulate spatial objects or not. To address this question, we propose a new evaluation framework aimed at assessing the performance of VLMs in spatial deformation reasoning tasks. Specifically, we construct a benchmark for spatial deformation reasoning from 2D to 3D. Leveraging our data engine, we can generate unlimited evaluation problem pairs with infinite steps, without any data leakage. We explore whether the model can effectively perform spatial deformation reasoning from two directions: forward reasoning (given the operations, find the final state) and reverse reasoning (given the final state, determine the operations). We adopt a ladder competition format, using the number of deformation steps as the level classification criterion, with the goal of exploring the boundaries of the model's deformation reasoning capabilities. Interestingly, the benchmarking results reveal that almost no model demonstrates plausible spatial deformation reasoning abilities. Furthermore, even after applying targeted training and mainstream reasoning enhancement methods, the models are still unable to perform well on 3D spatial deformation reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Depth- and Spatially-Varying Image Simulation for Defocus Deblur](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00372v1)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern cameras with large apertures often suffer from a shallow depth of field, resulting in blurry images of objects outside the focal plane. This limitation is particularly problematic for fixed-focus cameras, such as those used in smart glasses, where adding autofocus mechanisms is challenging due to form factor and power constraints. Due to unmatched optical aberrations and defocus properties unique to each camera system, deep learning models trained on existing open-source datasets often face domain gaps and do not perform well in real-world settings. In this paper, we propose an efficient and scalable dataset synthesis approach that does not rely on fine-tuning with real-world data. Our method simultaneously models depth-dependent defocus and spatially varying optical aberrations, addressing both computational complexity and the scarcity of high-quality RGB-D datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that a network trained on our low resolution synthetic images generalizes effectively to high resolution (12MP) real-world images across diverse scenes.</p></details> |  |

Motivated by the rising popularity of virtual and augmented reality experiences as well as potential applications to accessibility, we investigate how well existing music source separation (MSS) models perform on binaural audio. Although these models process two-channel inputs, it is unclear how effectively they retain spatial information. In this work, we evaluate how several popular MSS models preserve spatial information on both standard stereo and novel binaural datasets. Our binaural data is synthesized using stems from MUSDB18-HQ and open-source head-related transfer functions by positioning instrument sources randomly along the horizontal plane. We then assess the spatial quality of the separated stems using signal processing and interaural cue-based metrics. Our results show that stereo MSS models fail to preserve the spatial information critical for maintaining the immersive quality of binaural audio, and that the degradation depends on model architecture as well as the target instrument. Finally, we highlight valuable opportunities for future work at the intersection of MSS and immersive audio.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages + references, 4 figures, 2 tables, 26th International Society for Music Information Retrieval (ISMIR) Conference</p></details> |

As the SPIM can represent Ising problems with rank-one coupling matrices, multiplexed versions have been proposed to enhance the applicability to higher-rank interactions. However, the multiplexing cost reduces the implementation efficiency, and even without multiplexing, the SPIM is known to represent coupling matrices beyond rank-one. In this paper, to clarify the intrinsic representation power of the original SPIM, we propose spatial QUBO (spQUBO), a formulation of Ising problems with spatially convolutional structures. We prove that any spQUBO reduces to a two-dimensional spQUBO, with the convolutional structure preserved, and that any two-dimensional spQUBO can be efficiently implemented on the SPIM without multiplexing. We further demonstrate its practical applicability to distance-based combinatorial optimization, such as placement problems and clustering problems. These results advance our understanding of the class of optimization problems where SPIMs exhibit superior efficiency and scalability. Furthermore, spQUBO's efficiency is not limited to the SPIM architecture; we show that its convolutional structure allows efficient computation using Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT).</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 6 figures (including supplementary information, 7 pages, 1 figure)</p></details> |
| **[Bayesian Strategies for Repulsive Spatial Point Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15133v2)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There is increasing interest to develop Bayesian inferential algorithms for point process models with intractable likelihoods. A purpose of this paper is to illustrate the utility of using simulation based strategies, including approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for this task. Shirota and Gelfand (2017) proposed an extended version of an ABC approach for repulsive spatial point processes, including the Strauss point process and the determinantal point process, but their algorithm was not correctly detailed. We explain that is, in general, intractable and therefore impractical to use, except in some restrictive situations. This motivates us to instead consider an ABC-MCMC algorithm developed by Fearnhead and Prangle (2012). We further explore the use of the exchange algorithm, together with the recently proposed noisy Metropolis-Hastings algorithm (Alquier et al., 2016). As an extension of the exchange algorithm, which requires a single simulation from the likelihood at each iteration, the noisy Metropolis-Hastings algorithm considers multiple draws from the same likelihood function. We find that both of these inferential approaches yield good performance for repulsive spatial point processes in both simulated and real data applications and should be considered as viable approaches for the analysis of these models.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 7 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

As an alternative, predicting gene expression from pathology whole slide images (WSI) is gaining increasing attention. However, existing methods typically rely on single patches or a single pathology modality, neglecting the complex spatial and molecular interactions between target and neighboring information (e.g., gene co-expression). This leads to a failure in establishing connections among adjacent regions and capturing intricate cross-modal relationships. To address these issues, we propose NH2ST, a framework that integrates spatial context and both pathology and gene modalities for gene expression prediction. Our model comprises a query branch and a neighbor branch to process paired target patch and gene data and their neighboring regions, where cross-attention and contrastive learning are employed to capture intrinsic associations and ensure alignments between pathology and gene expression. Extensive experiments on six datasets demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving over 20% in PCC metrics.

Nonstationary spatially varying kernels (see, e.g., Paciorek, 2003) offer flexibility and richness, but computation is impeded by high-dimensional parameter spaces resulting from spatially varying process parameters. Matters are exacerbated if the number of locations recording measurements is massive. With limited theoretical tractability, obviating computational bottlenecks requires synergy between model construction and algorithm development. We build a class of scalable nonstationary spatial process models using spatially varying covariance kernels. We implement a Bayesian modeling framework using Hybrid Monte Carlo with nested interweaving. We conduct experiments on synthetic data sets to explore model selection and parameter identifiability, and assess inferential improvements accrued from nonstationary modeling. We illustrate strengths and pitfalls with a data set on remote sensed normalized difference vegetation index.</p></details> |  |
| **[RegionGCN: Spatial-Heterogeneity-Aware Graph Convolutional Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17599v2)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling spatial heterogeneity in the data generation process is essential for understanding and predicting geographical phenomena. Despite their prevalence in geospatial tasks, neural network models usually assume spatial stationarity, which could limit their performance in the presence of spatial process heterogeneity. By allowing model parameters to vary over space, several approaches have been proposed to incorporate spatial heterogeneity into neural networks. However, current geographically weighting approaches are ineffective on graph neural networks, yielding no significant improvement in prediction accuracy. We assume the crux lies in the over-fitting risk brought by a large number of local parameters. Accordingly, we propose to model spatial process heterogeneity at the regional level rather than at the individual level, which largely reduces the number of spatially varying parameters. We further develop a heuristic optimization procedure to learn the region partition adaptively in the process of model training. Our proposed spatial-heterogeneity-aware graph convolutional network, named RegionGCN, is applied to the spatial prediction of county-level vote share in the 2016 US presidential election based on socioeconomic attributes. Results show that RegionGCN achieves significant improvement over the basic and geographically weighted GCNs. We also offer an exploratory analysis tool for the spatial variation of non-linear relationships through ensemble learning of regional partitions from RegionGCN. Our work contributes to the practice of Geospatial Artificial Intelligence (GeoAI) in tackling spatial heterogeneity.</p></details> | 29 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Disentangled Diffusion-Based 3D Human Pose Estimation with Hierarchical Spatial and Temporal Denoiser](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04444v2)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, diffusion-based methods for monocular 3D human pose estimation have achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance by directly regressing the 3D joint coordinates from the 2D pose sequence. Although some methods decompose the task into bone length and bone direction prediction based on the human anatomical skeleton to explicitly incorporate more human body prior constraints, the performance of these methods is significantly lower than that of the SOTA diffusion-based methods. This can be attributed to the tree structure of the human skeleton. Direct application of the disentangled method could amplify the accumulation of hierarchical errors, propagating through each hierarchy. Meanwhile, the hierarchical information has not been fully explored by the previous methods. To address these problems, a Disentangled Diffusion-based 3D Human Pose Estimation method with Hierarchical Spatial and Temporal Denoiser is proposed, termed DDHPose. In our approach: (1) We disentangle the 3D pose and diffuse the bone length and bone direction during the forward process of the diffusion model to effectively model the human pose prior. A disentanglement loss is proposed to supervise diffusion model learning. (2) For the reverse process, we propose Hierarchical Spatial and Temporal Denoiser (HSTDenoiser) to improve the hierarchical modeling of each joint. Our HSTDenoiser comprises two components: the Hierarchical-Related Spatial Transformer (HRST) and the Hierarchical-Related Temporal Transformer (HRTT). HRST exploits joint spatial information and the influence of the parent joint on each joint for spatial modeling, while HRTT utilizes information from both the joint and its hierarchical adjacent joints to explore the hierarchical temporal correlations among joints.

We hypothesize that one key factor limiting accuracy is the difficulty of capturing interactions that span distinct spatial and temporal scales, ranging from high-frequency local vibrations to low-frequency global conformational changes. To address these limitations, we propose Graph Fourier Neural ODEs (GF-NODE), integrating a graph Fourier transform for spatial frequency decomposition with a Neural ODE framework for continuous-time evolution. Specifically, GF-NODE first decomposes molecular configurations into multiple spatial frequency modes using the graph Laplacian, then evolves the frequency components in time via a learnable Neural ODE module that captures both local and global dynamics, and finally reconstructs the updated molecular geometry through an inverse graph Fourier transform. By explicitly modeling high- and low-frequency phenomena in this unified pipeline, GF-NODE captures long-range correlations and local fluctuations more effectively. We provide theoretical insight through heat equation analysis on a simplified diffusion model, demonstrating how graph Laplacian eigenvalues can determine temporal dynamics scales, and crucially validate this correspondence through comprehensive empirical analysis on real molecular dynamics trajectories showing quantitative spatial-temporal correlations across diverse molecular systems. Experimental results on challenging MD benchmarks demonstrate that GF-NODE achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while preserving essential geometrical features over extended simulations. These findings highlight the promise of bridging spectral decomposition with continuous-time modeling to improve the robustness and predictive power of MD simulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (06/2025)</p></details> |

A prevalent issue in compositional generation is the misalignment of spatial relationships, as models often fail to faithfully generate images that reflect the spatial configurations specified between objects in the input prompts. To address this challenge, we propose a novel probabilistic framework for modeling the relative spatial positioning of objects in a scene, leveraging the concept of Probability of Superiority (PoS). Building on this insight, we make two key contributions. First, we introduce a novel evaluation metric, PoS-based Evaluation (PSE), designed to assess the alignment of 2D and 3D spatial relationships between text and image, with improved adherence to human judgment. Second, we propose PoS-based Generation (PSG), an inference-time method that improves the alignment of 2D and 3D spatial relationships in T2I models without requiring fine-tuning. PSG employs a Part-of-Speech PoS-based reward function that can be utilized in two distinct ways: (1) as a gradient-based guidance mechanism applied to the cross-attention maps during the denoising steps, or (2) as a search-based strategy that evaluates a set of initial noise vectors to select the best one. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the PSE metric exhibits stronger alignment with human judgment compared to traditional center-based metrics, providing a more nuanced and reliable measure of complex spatial relationship accuracy in text-image alignment. Furthermore, PSG significantly enhances the ability of text-to-image models to generate images with specified spatial configurations, outperforming state-of-the-art methods across multiple evaluation metrics and benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 ma...</summary><p>12 main pages, 18 figures, and 16 tables</p></details> |

But existing clustering methods do not work well for community detection of CosMx ST data, and the commonly used kNN compositional data method shows lack of informative neighboring cell patterns for huge CosMx data. In this article, we propose a novel and more informative disk compositional data (DCD) method, which identifies neighboring patterns of each cell via taking into account of ST data features from recent new technologies. After initial processing ST data into DCD matrix, a new innovative and interpretable DCD-TMHC community detection method is proposed here. Extensive simulation studies and CosMx breast cancer data analysis clearly show that our proposed DCD-TMHC method is superior to other methods. Based on the communities detected by DCD-TMHC method for CosMx breast cancer data, the logistic regression analysis results demonstrate that DCD-TMHC method is clearly interpretable and superior, especially in terms of assessment for different stages of cancer. These suggest that our proposed novel, innovative, informative and interpretable DCD-TMHC method here will be helpful and have impact to future cancer research based on ST data, which can improve cancer diagnosis and monitor cancer treatment progress.</p></details> |  |

Current methods often focus on specific data types and lack a unified framework in urban field for processing them comprehensively. The recent success of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) presents a promising opportunity to overcome this limitation. In this paper, we introduce $\textit{UrbanLLaVA}$, a multi-modal large language model designed to process these four types of data simultaneously and achieve strong performance across diverse urban tasks compared with general MLLMs. In $\textit{UrbanLLaVA}$, we first curate a diverse urban instruction dataset encompassing both single-modal and cross-modal urban data, spanning from location view to global view of urban environment. Additionally, we propose a multi-stage training framework that decouples spatial reasoning enhancement from domain knowledge learning, thereby improving the compatibility and downstream performance of $\textit{UrbanLLaVA}$ across diverse urban tasks. Finally, we also extend existing benchmark for urban research to assess the performance of MLLMs across a wide range of urban tasks. Experimental results from three cities demonstrate that $\textit{UrbanLLaVA}$ outperforms open-source and proprietary MLLMs in both single-modal tasks and complex cross-modal tasks and shows robust generalization abilities across cities.

The motivation stems from the observation that images exhibit local structures, and spatially distant regions tend to have minimal interdependence. Given a partially decoded set of visual tokens, in addition to the original next-token prediction scheme in the row dimension, the tokens corresponding to spatially adjacent regions in the column dimension can be decoded in parallel, enabling the ``next-set prediction'' paradigm. By decoding multiple tokens simultaneously in a single forward pass, the number of forward passes required to generate an image is significantly reduced, resulting in a substantial improvement in generation efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that ZipAR can reduce the number of model forward passes by up to 91% on the Emu3-Gen model without requiring any additional retraining.

However, existing methods may still encounter challenges in handling complex instructions that require accurate spatial reasoning, even if the 3D point cloud data provides detailed spatial cues such as size and position for identifying the targets. To tackle this issue, we propose Relevant Reasoning Segmentation (R$^2$S), a reasoning-based segmentation framework. The framework emulates human cognitive processes by decomposing spatial reasoning into two sequential stages: first identifying relevant elements, then processing instructions guided by their associated visual priors. Furthermore, acknowledging the inadequacy of existing datasets in complex reasoning tasks, we introduce 3D ReasonSeg, a reasoning-based segmentation dataset comprising 25,185 training samples and 3,966 validation samples with precise annotations. Both quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that the R$^2$S and 3D ReasonSeg effectively endow 3D point cloud perception with stronger spatial reasoning capabilities, and we hope that they can serve as a new baseline and benchmark for future work.</p></details> |  |

However, existing reasoning benchmarks focus on text-only reasoning, or employ multimodal questions that can be answered by directly retrieving information from a non-text modality. Thus, complex reasoning remains poorly understood in multimodal domains. Here, we present MARBLE, a challenging multimodal reasoning benchmark that is designed to scrutinize multimodal language models (MLLMs) in their ability to carefully reason step-by-step through complex multimodal problems and environments. MARBLE is composed of two highly challenging tasks, M-Portal and M-Cube, that require the crafting and understanding of multistep plans under spatial, visual, and physical constraints. We find that current MLLMs perform poorly on MARBLE -- all the 12 advanced models obtain near-random performance on M-Portal and 0% accuracy on M-Cube. Only in simplified subtasks some models outperform the random baseline, indicating that complex reasoning is still a challenge for existing MLLMs. Moreover, we show that perception remains a bottleneck, where MLLMs occasionally fail to extract information from the visual inputs. By shedding a light on the limitations of MLLMs, we hope that MARBLE will spur the development of the next generation of models with the ability to reason and plan across many, multimodal reasoning steps.</p></details> |  |
| **[SPI-BoTER: Error Compensation for Industrial Robots via Sparse Attention Masking and Hybrid Loss with Spatial-Physical Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22788v1)** | 2025-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread application of industrial robots in fields such as cutting and welding has imposed increasingly stringent requirements on the trajectory accuracy of end-effectors. However, current error compensation methods face several critical challenges, including overly simplified mechanism modeling, a lack of physical consistency in data-driven approaches, and substantial data requirements. These issues make it difficult to achieve both high accuracy and strong generalization simultaneously. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Spatial-Physical Informed Attention Residual Network (SPI-BoTER). This method integrates the kinematic equations of the robotic manipulator with a Transformer architecture enhanced by sparse self-attention masks. A parameter-adaptive hybrid loss function incorporating spatial and physical information is employed to iteratively optimize the network during training, enabling high-precision error compensation under small-sample conditions. Additionally, inverse joint angle compensation is performed using a gradient descent-based optimization method. Experimental results on a small-sample dataset from a UR5 robotic arm (724 samples, with a train:test:validation split of 8:1:1) demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method. It achieves a 3D absolute positioning error of 0.2515 mm with a standard deviation of 0.15 mm, representing a 35.16\% reduction in error compared to conventional deep neural network (DNN) methods. Furthermore, the inverse angle compensation algorithm converges to an accuracy of 0.01 mm within an average of 147 iterations. This study presents a solution that combines physical interpretability with data adaptability for high-precision control of industrial robots, offering promising potential for the reliable execution of precision tasks in intelligent manufacturing.</p></details> |  |

Such hybrid interfaces combine both traditional and immersive displays to facilitate the exploration of 2D and 3D data representations in the environment in which they are best displayed. One key aspect is to introduce transitional animations that change between the different dimensionalities to illustrate the connection between the different representations and to reduce the potential cognitive load on the user. The specific transitions to be used depend on the type of data, the needs of the application domain, and other factors. We summarize these as a transition design space to simplify the decision-making process and provide inspiration for future designs. First, we discuss 3D visualizations from a spatial perspective: a spatial encoding pipeline, where 3D data sampled from the physical world goes through various transformations, being mapped to visual representations, and then being integrated into a hybrid AR-desktop environment. The transition design then focuses on interpolating between two spatial encoding pipelines to provide a smooth experience. To illustrate the use of our design space, we apply it to three case studies that focus on applications in astronomy, radiology, and chemistry; we then discuss lessons learned from these applications.</p></details> | 14 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Spatial Degradation-Aware and Temporal Consistent Diffusion Model for Compressed Video Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07381v3)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to storage and bandwidth limitations, videos transmitted over the Internet often exhibit low quality, characterized by low-resolution and compression artifacts. Although video super-resolution (VSR) is an efficient video enhancing technique, existing VSR methods focus less on compressed videos. Consequently, directly applying general VSR approaches fails to improve practical videos with compression artifacts, especially when frames are highly compressed at a low bit rate. The inevitable quantization information loss complicates the reconstruction of texture details. Recently, diffusion models have shown superior performance in low-level visual tasks. Leveraging the high-realism generation capability of diffusion models, we propose a novel method that exploits the priors of pre-trained diffusion models for compressed VSR. To mitigate spatial distortions and refine temporal consistency, we introduce a Spatial Degradation-Aware and Temporal Consistent (SDATC) diffusion model. Specifically, we incorporate a distortion control module (DCM) to modulate diffusion model inputs, thereby minimizing the impact of noise from low-quality frames on the generation stage. Subsequently, the diffusion model performs a denoising process to generate details, guided by a fine-tuned compression-aware prompt module (CAPM) and a spatio-temporal attention module (STAM). CAPM dynamically encodes compression-related information into prompts, enabling the sampling process to adapt to different degradation levels. Meanwhile, STAM extends the spatial attention mechanism into the spatio-temporal dimension, effectively capturing temporal correlations. Additionally, we utilize optical flow-based alignment during each denoising step to enhance the smoothness of output videos. Extensive experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed modules in restoring compressed videos.</p></details> |  |

| **[Bridging Sequential Deep Operator Network and Video Diffusion: Residual Refinement of Spatio-Temporal PDE Solutions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06133v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video-diffusion models have recently set the standard in video generation, inpainting, and domain translation thanks to their training stability and high perceptual fidelity. Building on these strengths, we repurpose conditional video diffusion as a physics surrogate for spatio-temporal fields governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). Our two-stage surrogate first applies a Sequential Deep Operator Network (S-DeepONet) to produce a coarse, physics-consistent prior from the prescribed boundary or loading conditions. The prior is then passed to a conditional video diffusion model that learns only the residual: the point-wise difference between the ground truth and the S-DeepONet prediction. By shifting the learning burden from the full solution to its much smaller residual space, diffusion can focus on sharpening high-frequency structures without sacrificing global coherence. The framework is assessed on two disparate benchmarks: (i) vortex-dominated lid-driven cavity flow and (ii) tensile plastic deformation of dogbone specimens. Across these data sets the hybrid surrogate consistently outperforms its single-stage counterpart, cutting the mean relative L2 error from 4.57% to 0.83% for the flow problem and from 4.42% to 2.94% for plasticity, a relative improvements of 81.8% and 33.5% respectively. The hybrid approach not only lowers quantitative errors but also improves visual quality, visibly recovering fine spatial details. These results show that (i) conditioning diffusion on a physics-aware prior enables faithful reconstruction of localized features, (ii) residual learning reduces the problem, accelerating convergence and enhancing accuracy, and (iii) the same architecture transfers seamlessly from incompressible flow to nonlinear elasto-plasticity without problem-specific architectural modifications, highlighting its broad applicability to nonlinear, time-dependent continua.</p></details> |  |
| **[DRAN: A Distribution and Relation Adaptive Network for Spatio-temporal Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01531v2)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate predictions of spatio-temporal systems are crucial for tasks such as system management, control, and crisis prevention. However, the inherent time variance of many spatio-temporal systems poses challenges to achieving accurate predictions whenever stationarity is not granted. In order to address non-stationarity, we propose a Distribution and Relation Adaptive Network (DRAN) capable of dynamically adapting to relation and distribution changes over time. While temporal normalization and de-normalization are frequently used techniques to adapt to distribution shifts, this operation is not suitable for the spatio-temporal context as temporal normalization scales the time series of nodes and possibly disrupts the spatial relations among nodes. In order to address this problem, a Spatial Factor Learner (SFL) module is developed that enables the normalization and de-normalization process. To adapt to dynamic changes in spatial relationships among sensors, we propose a Dynamic-Static Fusion Learner (DSFL) module that effectively integrates features learned from both dynamic and static relations through an adaptive fusion ratio mechanism. Furthermore, we introduce a Stochastic Learner to capture the noisy components of spatio-temporal representations. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on weather prediction and traffic flow forecasting tasks.Experimental results show that our SFL efficiently preserves spatial relationships across various temporal normalization operations. Visualizations of the learned dynamic and static relations demonstrate that DSFL can capture both local and distant relationships between nodes.</p></details> | 15 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Distributionally Robust Predictive Runtime Verification under Spatio-Temporal Logic Specifications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02964v2)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cyber-physical systems (CPS) designed in simulators, often consisting of multiple interacting agents (e.g. in multi-agent formations), behave differently in the real-world. We want to verify these systems during runtime when they are deployed. We thus propose robust predictive runtime verification (RPRV) algorithms for: (1) general stochastic CPS under signal temporal logic (STL) tasks, and (2) stochastic multi-agent systems (MAS) under spatio-temporal logic tasks. The RPRV problem presents the following challenges: (1) there may not be sufficient data on the behavior of the deployed CPS, (2) predictive models based on design phase system trajectories may encounter distribution shift during real-world deployment, and (3) the algorithms need to scale to the complexity of MAS and be applicable to spatio-temporal logic tasks. To address the challenges, we assume knowledge of an upper bound on the statistical distance between the trajectory distributions of the system at deployment and design time. We are motivated by our prior work [1, 2] where we proposed an accurate and an interpretable RPRV algorithm for general CPS, which we here extend to the MAS setting and spatio-temporal logic tasks. Specifically, we use a learned predictive model to estimate the system behavior at runtime and robust conformal prediction to obtain probabilistic guarantees by accounting for distribution shifts. Building on [1], we perform robust conformal prediction over the robust semantics of spatio-temporal reach and escape logic (STREL) to obtain centralized RPRV algorithms for MAS. We empirically validate our results in a drone swarm simulator, where we show the scalability of our RPRV algorithms to MAS and analyze the impact of different trajectory predictors on the verification result. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first statistically valid algorithms for MAS under distribution shift.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2311.09482</p></details> |
| **[Spatio-Temporal LLM: Reasoning about Environments and Actions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05258v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the significant recent progress of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), MLLMs still struggle to correctly answer prompts that require a holistic spatio-temporal understanding. Specifically, it is challenging to address prompts that refer to 1) the entirety of an environment that an agent equipped with an MLLM can operate in; and simultaneously also refer to 2) recent actions that just happened and are encoded in a video clip. However, such a holistic spatio-temporal understanding is important for agents operating in the real world. To address this issue, we first develop a framework to collect a large-scale dataset. Using the collected "Reasoning about Environments and Actions" (REA) dataset, we show that recent methods indeed struggle to correctly answer the prompts. To improve, we develop a "spatio-temporal LLM" (ST-LLM), a model equipped with projectors to improve both spatial understanding of an environment and temporal understanding of recent observations. On the collected REA data, we show that the proposed method significantly improves results compared to prior work.

| **[ST-LoRA: Low-rank Adaptation for Spatio-Temporal Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07919v2)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal forecasting is essential for understanding future dynamics within real-world systems by leveraging historical data from multiple locations. Existing methods often prioritize the development of intricate neural networks to capture the complex dependencies of the data. These methods neglect node-level heterogeneity and face over-parameterization when attempting to model node-specific characteristics. In this paper, we present a novel low-rank adaptation framework for existing spatio-temporal prediction models, termed \model, which alleviates the aforementioned problems through node-level adjustments. Specifically, we introduce the node-adaptive low-rank layer and node-specific predictor, capturing the complex functional characteristics of nodes while maintaining computational efficiency. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that our method consistently achieves superior performance across various forecasting models with minimal computational overhead, improving performance by 7% with only 1% additional parameter cost.

| **[VideoMolmo: Spatio-Temporal Grounding Meets Pointing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05336v2)** | 2025-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal localization is vital for precise interactions across diverse domains, from biological research to autonomous navigation and interactive interfaces. Current video-based approaches, while proficient in tracking, lack the sophisticated reasoning capabilities of large language models, limiting their contextual understanding and generalization. We introduce VideoMolmo, a large multimodal model tailored for fine-grained spatio-temporal pointing conditioned on textual descriptions. Building upon the Molmo architecture, VideoMolmo incorporates a temporal module utilizing an attention mechanism to condition each frame on preceding frames, ensuring temporal consistency. Additionally, our novel temporal mask fusion pipeline employs SAM2 for bidirectional point propagation, significantly enhancing coherence across video sequences. This two-step decomposition, i.e., first using the LLM to generate precise pointing coordinates, then relying on a sequential mask-fusion module to produce coherent segmentation, not only simplifies the task for the language model but also enhances interpretability. Due to the lack of suitable datasets, we curate a comprehensive dataset comprising 72k video-caption pairs annotated with 100k object points. To evaluate the generalization of VideoMolmo, we introduce VPoS-Bench, a challenging out-of-distribution benchmark spanning five real-world scenarios: Cell Tracking, Egocentric Vision, Autonomous Driving, Video-GUI Interaction, and Robotics. We also evaluate our model on Referring Video Object Segmentation (Refer-VOS) and Reasoning VOS tasks. In comparison to existing models, VideoMolmo substantially improves spatio-temporal pointing accuracy and reasoning capability. Our code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/mbzuai-oryx/VideoMolmo.</p></details> | 20 pages, 13 figures |
| **[USAD: An Unsupervised Data Augmentation Spatio-Temporal Attention Diffusion Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02827v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The primary objective of human activity recognition (HAR) is to infer ongoing human actions from sensor data, a task that finds broad applications in health monitoring, safety protection, and sports analysis. Despite proliferating research, HAR still faces key challenges, including the scarcity of labeled samples for rare activities, insufficient extraction of high-level features, and suboptimal model performance on lightweight devices. To address these issues, this paper proposes a comprehensive optimization approach centered on multi-attention interaction mechanisms. First, an unsupervised, statistics-guided diffusion model is employed to perform data augmentation, thereby alleviating the problems of labeled data scarcity and severe class imbalance. Second, a multi-branch spatio-temporal interaction network is designed, which captures multi-scale features of sequential data through parallel residual branches with 3*3, 5*5, and 7*7 convolutional kernels. Simultaneously, temporal attention mechanisms are incorporated to identify critical time points, while spatial attention enhances inter-sensor interactions. A cross-branch feature fusion unit is further introduced to improve the overall feature representation capability. Finally, an adaptive multi-loss function fusion strategy is integrated, allowing for dynamic adjustment of loss weights and overall model optimization. Experimental results on three public datasets, WISDM, PAMAP2, and OPPORTUNITY, demonstrate that the proposed unsupervised data augmentation spatio-temporal attention diffusion network (USAD) achieves accuracies of 98.84%, 93.81%, and 80.92% respectively, significantly outperforming existing approaches. Furthermore, practical deployment on embedded devices verifies the efficiency and feasibility of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-temporal smoothing, interpolation and prediction of income distributions based on grouped data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08384v3)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Housing and Land Survey (HLS) of Japan provides municipality-level grouped data on household incomes. Although these data can be used for effective local policymaking, their analyses are hindered by several challenges, such as limited information attributed to grouping, the presence of non-sampled areas, and the very low frequency of implementing surveys. To address these challenges, we propose a novel grouped-data-based spatio-temporal finite mixture model for estimating the income distributions of multiple spatial units at multiple time points. A unique feature of the proposed method is that all the areas share common latent distributions and that the mixing proportions, including spatial and temporal effects, capture the potential area-wise heterogeneity. Thus, incorporating these effects can smooth out the quantities of interest over time and space, impute missing values, and predict future values. By treating the HLS data with the proposed method, we obtain complete maps of the income and inequality measures at an arbitrary time, which can facilitate rapid and efficient policymaking with fine granularity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Representation Decoupling and Enhancement for Federated Instrument Segmentation in Surgical Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23759v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Surgical instrument segmentation under Federated Learning (FL) is a promising direction, which enables multiple surgical sites to collaboratively train the model without centralizing datasets. However, there exist very limited FL works in surgical data science, and FL methods for other modalities do not consider inherent characteristics in surgical domain: i) different scenarios show diverse anatomical backgrounds while highly similar instrument representation; ii) there exist surgical simulators which promote large-scale synthetic data generation with minimal efforts. In this paper, we propose a novel Personalized FL scheme, Spatio-Temporal Representation Decoupling and Enhancement (FedST), which wisely leverages surgical domain knowledge during both local-site and global-server training to boost segmentation. Concretely, our model embraces a Representation Separation and Cooperation (RSC) mechanism in local-site training, which decouples the query embedding layer to be trained privately, to encode respective backgrounds. Meanwhile, other parameters are optimized globally to capture the consistent representations of instruments, including the temporal layer to capture similar motion patterns. A textual-guided channel selection is further designed to highlight site-specific features, facilitating model adapta tion to each site. Moreover, in global-server training, we propose Synthesis-based Explicit Representation Quantification (SERQ), which defines an explicit representation target based on synthetic data to synchronize the model convergence during fusion for improving model generalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[D$^2$ST-Adapter: Disentangled-and-Deformable Spatio-Temporal Adapter for Few-shot Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01431v4)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adapting pre-trained image models to video modality has proven to be an effective strategy for robust few-shot action recognition. In this work, we explore the potential of adapter tuning in image-to-video model adaptation and propose a novel video adapter tuning framework, called Disentangled-and-Deformable Spatio-Temporal Adapter (D$^2$ST-Adapter). It features a lightweight design, low adaptation overhead and powerful spatio-temporal feature adaptation capabilities. D$^2$ST-Adapter is structured with an internal dual-pathway architecture that enables built-in disentangled encoding of spatial and temporal features within the adapter, seamlessly integrating into the single-stream feature learning framework of pre-trained image models. In particular, we develop an efficient yet effective implementation of the D$^2$ST-Adapter, incorporating the specially devised anisotropic Deformable Spatio-Temporal Attention as its pivotal operation. This mechanism can be individually tailored for two pathways with anisotropic sampling densities along the spatial and temporal domains in 3D spatio-temporal space, enabling disentangled encoding of spatial and temporal features while maintaining a lightweight design. Extensive experiments by instantiating our method on both pre-trained ResNet and ViT demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art methods. Our method is particularly well-suited to challenging scenarios where temporal dynamics are critical for action recognition.

We propose the Intervention-Aware Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network (IA-STGNN), a novel framework that closes the causal loop from tactical input to strategic delay output. The model integrates graph attention mechanisms, counterfactual simulation units, and spatial intervention node reconstruction to enable dynamic simulations of strike configurations and synchronization strategies. Training data are generated from a multi-physics simulation platform (GEANT4 + COMSOL) under NIST SP 800-160 standards, ensuring structural traceability and policy-level validation. Experimental results demonstrate that IA-STGNN significantly outperforms baseline models (ST-GNN, GCN-LSTM, XGBoost), achieving a 12.8 percent reduction in MAE and 18.4 percent increase in Top-5 percent accuracy, while improving causal path consistency and intervention stability. IA-STGNN enables interpretable prediction of strategic delay and supports applications such as nuclear deterrence simulation, diplomatic window assessment, and multi-strategy optimization, providing a structured and transparent AI decision-support mechanism for high-level policy modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper proposes the first closed-loop causal modeling framework (IA-STGNN) that links tactical strike variables to strategic delay outcomes via graph neural networks with counterfactual reasoning</p></details> |
| **[Linking climate and dengue in the Philippines using a two-stage Bayesian spatio-temporal model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22334v1)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dengue is an infectious disease which poses significant socioeconomic and disease burden in many tropical and subtropical regions of the world. This work aims to provide additional insight into the association between dengue and climate in the Philippines. We employ a two-stage modelling framework: the first stage fits climate models, while the second stage fits a health model that uses the climate predictions from the first stage as inputs. We postulate a Bayesian spatio-temporal model and use the integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) approach for inference. To account for the uncertainty in the climate models, we perform posterior sampling and then perform Bayesian model averaging to compute the final posterior estimates of second-stage model parameters. The results indicate that temperature is positively associated with dengue, although extremely hot conditions tend to have a negative effect. Moreover, the relationship between rainfall and dengue varies in space. In areas with uniform amounts of rainfall all year round, rainfall is negatively associated with dengue. In contrast, in regions with pronounced dry and wet season, rainfall shows a positive association with dengue. Finally, there remains unexplained structured variation in space and time after accounting for the impact of climate variables and other covariates.</p></details> |  |
| **[VideoFusion: A Spatio-Temporal Collaborative Network for Multi-modal Video Fusion and Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23359v2)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Compared to images, videos better align with real-world acquisition scenarios and possess valuable temporal cues. However, existing multi-sensor fusion research predominantly integrates complementary context from multiple images rather than videos. This primarily stems from two factors: 1) the scarcity of large-scale multi-sensor video datasets, limiting research in video fusion, and 2) the inherent difficulty of jointly modeling spatial and temporal dependencies in a unified framework. This paper proactively compensates for the dilemmas. First, we construct M3SVD, a benchmark dataset with $220$ temporally synchronized and spatially registered infrared-visible video pairs comprising 153,797 frames, filling the data gap for the video fusion community. Secondly, we propose VideoFusion, a multi-modal video fusion model that fully exploits cross-modal complementarity and temporal dynamics to generate spatio-temporally coherent videos from (potentially degraded) multi-modal inputs. Specifically, 1) a differential reinforcement module is developed for cross-modal information interaction and enhancement, 2) a complete modality-guided fusion strategy is employed to adaptively integrate multi-modal features, and 3) a bi-temporal co-attention mechanism is devised to dynamically aggregate forward-backward temporal contexts to reinforce cross-frame feature representations. Extensive experiments reveal that VideoFusion outperforms existing image-oriented fusion paradigms in sequential scenarios, effectively mitigating temporal inconsistency and interference.</p></details> |  |
| **[CAST: Cross-Attentive Spatio-Temporal feature fusion for Deepfake detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21711v1)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deepfakes have emerged as a significant threat to digital media authenticity, increasing the need for advanced detection techniques that can identify subtle and time-dependent manipulations. CNNs are effective at capturing spatial artifacts, and Transformers excel at modeling temporal inconsistencies. However, many existing CNN-Transformer models process spatial and temporal features independently. In particular, attention-based methods often use separate attention mechanisms for spatial and temporal features and combine them using naive approaches like averaging, addition, or concatenation, which limits the depth of spatio-temporal interaction. To address this challenge, we propose a unified CAST model that leverages cross-attention to effectively fuse spatial and temporal features in a more integrated manner. Our approach allows temporal features to dynamically attend to relevant spatial regions, enhancing the model's ability to detect fine-grained, time-evolving artifacts such as flickering eyes or warped lips. This design enables more precise localization and deeper contextual understanding, leading to improved performance across diverse and challenging scenarios. We evaluate the performance of our model using the FaceForensics++, Celeb-DF, and DeepfakeDetection datasets in both intra- and cross-dataset settings to affirm the superiority of our approach. Our model achieves strong performance with an AUC of 99.49 percent and an accuracy of 97.57 percent in intra-dataset evaluations. In cross-dataset testing, it demonstrates impressive generalization by achieving a 93.31 percent AUC on the unseen DeepfakeDetection dataset. These results highlight the effectiveness of cross-attention-based feature fusion in enhancing the robustness of deepfake video detection.</p></details> | 50 pages, 6 figures |
| **[A Modular Multitask Reasoning Framework Integrating Spatio-temporal Models and LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20073v1)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal data mining plays a pivotal role in informed decision making across diverse domains. However, existing models are often restricted to narrow tasks, lacking the capacity for multi-task inference and complex long-form reasoning that require generation of in-depth, explanatory outputs. These limitations restrict their applicability to real-world, multi-faceted decision scenarios. In this work, we introduce STReason, a novel framework that integrates the reasoning strengths of large language models (LLMs) with the analytical capabilities of spatio-temporal models for multi-task inference and execution. Without requiring task-specific finetuning, STReason leverages in-context learning to decompose complex natural language queries into modular, interpretable programs, which are then systematically executed to generate both solutions and detailed rationales. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we construct a new benchmark dataset and propose a unified evaluation framework with metrics specifically designed for long-form spatio-temporal reasoning. Experimental results show that STReason significantly outperforms advanced LLM baselines across all metrics, particularly excelling in complex, reasoning-intensive spatio-temporal scenarios. Human evaluations further validate STReason's credibility and practical utility, demonstrating its potential to reduce expert workload and broaden the applicability to real-world spatio-temporal tasks. We believe STReason provides a promising direction for developing more capable and generalizable spatio-temporal reasoning systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Spatio-Temporal Point Process for Fine-Grained Modeling of Reading Behavior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19999v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reading is a process that unfolds across space and time, alternating between fixations where a reader focuses on a specific point in space, and saccades where a reader rapidly shifts their focus to a new point. An ansatz of psycholinguistics is that modeling a reader's fixations and saccades yields insight into their online sentence processing. However, standard approaches to such modeling rely on aggregated eye-tracking measurements and models that impose strong assumptions, ignoring much of the spatio-temporal dynamics that occur during reading. In this paper, we propose a more general probabilistic model of reading behavior, based on a marked spatio-temporal point process, that captures not only how long fixations last, but also where they land in space and when they take place in time. The saccades are modeled using a Hawkes process, which captures how each fixation excites the probability of a new fixation occurring near it in time and space. The duration time of fixation events is modeled as a function of fixation-specific predictors convolved across time, thus capturing spillover effects. Empirically, our Hawkes process model exhibits a better fit to human saccades than baselines. With respect to fixation durations, we observe that incorporating contextual surprisal as a predictor results in only a marginal improvement in the model's predictive accuracy. This finding suggests that surprisal theory struggles to explain fine-grained eye movements.</p></details> | ACL 2025 |
| **[RePST: Language Model Empowered Spatio-Temporal Forecasting via Semantic-Oriented Reprogramming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14505v3)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal forecasting is pivotal in numerous real-world applications, including transportation planning, energy management, and climate monitoring. In this work, we aim to harness the reasoning and generalization abilities of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) for more effective spatio-temporal forecasting, particularly in data-scarce scenarios. However, recent studies uncover that PLMs, which are primarily trained on textual data, often falter when tasked with modeling the intricate correlations in numerical time series, thereby limiting their effectiveness in comprehending spatio-temporal data. To bridge the gap, we propose RePST, a semantic-oriented PLM reprogramming framework tailored for spatio-temporal forecasting. Specifically, we first propose a semantic-oriented decomposer that adaptively disentangles spatially correlated time series into interpretable sub-components, which facilitates PLM to understand sophisticated spatio-temporal dynamics via a divide-and-conquer strategy. Moreover, we propose a selective discrete reprogramming scheme, which introduces an expanded spatio-temporal vocabulary space to project spatio-temporal series into discrete representations. This scheme minimizes the information loss during reprogramming and enriches the representations derived by PLMs. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that the proposed RePST outperforms twelve state-of-the-art baseline methods, particularly in data-scarce scenarios, highlighting the effectiveness and superior generalization capabilities of PLMs for spatio-temporal forecasting.

Thyroid nodules are frequently detected through ultrasound (US) imaging, and some require further evaluation via fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy. Despite its effectiveness, FNA often leads to unnecessary biopsies of benign nodules, causing patient discomfort and anxiety. To address this, the American College of Radiology Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TI-RADS) has been developed to reduce benign biopsies. However, such systems are limited by interobserver variability. Recent deep learning approaches have sought to improve risk stratification, but they often fail to utilize the rich temporal and spatial context provided by US cine clips, which contain dynamic global information and surrounding structural changes across various views. In this work, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Cross Attention for Cine Thyroid Ultrasound Time Series Classification (STACT-Time) model, a novel representation learning framework that integrates imaging features from US cine clips with features from segmentation masks automatically generated by a pretrained model. By leveraging self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms, our model captures the rich temporal and spatial context of US cine clips while enhancing feature representation through segmentation-guided learning. Our model improves malignancy prediction compared to state-of-the-art models, achieving a cross-validation precision of 0.91 (plus or minus 0.02) and an F1 score of 0.89 (plus or minus 0.02). By reducing unnecessary biopsies of benign nodules while maintaining high sensitivity for malignancy detection, our model has the potential to enhance clinical decision-making and improve patient outcomes.</p></details> |  |

However, existing Geographic Information Systems (GIS)-based systems struggle to integrate and manage of such large-scale and diverse data sources. To address these challenges, this paper proposes G-SEED (GeoSOT-based Scalable Encoding and Extraction for Forest and Grassland Spatio-temporal Data), a unified encoding and management framework based on the hierarchical GeoSOT (Geographical coordinate global Subdivision grid with One dimension integer on 2n tree) grid system. G-SEED integrates spatial, temporal, and type information into a composite code, enabling consistent encoding of both structured and unstructured data, including remote sensing imagery, vector maps, sensor records, documents, and multimedia content. The framework incorporates adaptive grid-level selection, center-cell-based indexing, and full-coverage grid arrays to optimize spatial querying and compression. Through extensive experiments on a real-world dataset from Shennongjia National Park (China), G-SEED demonstrates superior performance in spatial precision control, cross-source consistency, query efficiency, and compression compared to mainstream methods such as Geohash and H3. This study provides a scalable and reusable paradigm for the unified organization of forest and grassland big data, supporting dynamic monitoring and intelligent decision-making in these domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 2 figures.

| **[Damba-ST: Domain-Adaptive Mamba for Efficient Urban Spatio-Temporal Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18939v1)** | 2025-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training urban spatio-temporal foundation models that generalize well across diverse regions and cities is critical for deploying urban services in unseen or data-scarce regions. Recent studies have typically focused on fusing cross-domain spatio-temporal data to train unified Transformer-based models. However, these models suffer from quadratic computational complexity and high memory overhead, limiting their scalability and practical deployment. Inspired by the efficiency of Mamba, a state space model with linear time complexity, we explore its potential for efficient urban spatio-temporal prediction. However, directly applying Mamba as a spatio-temporal backbone leads to negative transfer and severe performance degradation. This is primarily due to spatio-temporal heterogeneity and the recursive mechanism of Mamba's hidden state updates, which limit cross-domain generalization. To overcome these challenges, we propose Damba-ST, a novel domain-adaptive Mamba-based model for efficient urban spatio-temporal prediction. Damba-ST retains Mamba's linear complexity advantage while significantly enhancing its adaptability to heterogeneous domains. Specifically, we introduce two core innovations: (1) a domain-adaptive state space model that partitions the latent representation space into a shared subspace for learning cross-domain commonalities and independent, domain-specific subspaces for capturing intra-domain discriminative features; (2) three distinct Domain Adapters, which serve as domain-aware proxies to bridge disparate domain distributions and facilitate the alignment of cross-domain commonalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate the generalization and efficiency of Damba-ST. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on prediction tasks and demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization, enabling seamless deployment in new urban environments without extensive retraining or fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |
| **[ASTER: Adaptive Spatio-Temporal Early Decision Model for Dynamic Resource Allocation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17929v1)** | 2025-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Supporting decision-making has long been a central vision in the field of spatio-temporal intelligence. While prior work has improved the timeliness and accuracy of spatio-temporal forecasting, converting these forecasts into actionable strategies remains a key challenge. A main limitation is the decoupling of the prediction and the downstream decision phases, which can significantly degrade the downstream efficiency. For example, in emergency response, the priority is successful resource allocation and intervention, not just incident prediction. To this end, it is essential to propose an Adaptive Spatio-Temporal Early Decision model (ASTER) that reforms the forecasting paradigm from event anticipation to actionable decision support. This framework ensures that information is directly used for decision-making, thereby maximizing overall effectiveness. Specifically, ASTER introduces a new Resource-aware Spatio-Temporal interaction module (RaST) that adaptively captures long- and short-term dependencies under dynamic resource conditions, producing context-aware spatiotemporal representations. To directly generate actionable decisions, we further design a Preference-oriented decision agent (Poda) based on multi-objective reinforcement learning, which transforms predictive signals into resource-efficient intervention strategies by deriving optimal actions under specific preferences and dynamic constraints. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of ASTER in improving both early prediction accuracy and resource allocation outcomes across six downstream metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>ASTER...</summary><p>ASTER: Adaptive Spatio-Temporal Early Decision Model for Dynamic Resource Allocation</p></details> |
| **[On the PM2.5 -- Mortality Relationship: A Bayesian Model for Spatio-Temporal Confounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16106v2)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial confounding, often regarded as a major concern in epidemiological studies, relates to the difficulty of recovering the effect of an exposure on an outcome when these variables are associated with unobserved factors. This issue is particularly challenging in spatio-temporal analyses, where it has been less explored so far. To study the effects of air pollution on mortality in Italy, we argue that a model that simultaneously accounts for spatio-temporal confounding and for the non-linear form of the effect of interest is needed. To this end, we propose a Bayesian spatial dynamic generalized linear model, which allows for a non-linear association and for a decomposition of the exposure effect into two components. This decomposition accommodates associations with the outcome at fine and coarse temporal and spatial scales of variation. These features, when combined, allow reducing the spatio-temporal confounding bias and recovering the true shape of the association, as demonstrated through simulation studies. The results from the real-data application indicate that the exposure effect seems to have different magnitudes in different seasons, with peaks in the summer. We hypothesize that this could be due to possible interactions between the exposure variable with air temperature and unmeasured confounders.</p></details> | 46 pages, 11 figures |

Genesis employs a two-stage architecture that integrates a DiT-based video diffusion model with 3D-VAE encoding, and a BEV-aware LiDAR generator with NeRF-based rendering and adaptive sampling. Both modalities are directly coupled through a shared latent space, enabling coherent evolution across visual and geometric domains. To guide the generation with structured semantics, we introduce DataCrafter, a captioning module built on vision-language models that provides scene-level and instance-level supervision. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that Genesis achieves state-of-the-art performance across video and LiDAR metrics (FVD 16.95, FID 4.24, Chamfer 0.611), and benefits downstream tasks including segmentation and 3D detection, validating the semantic fidelity and practical utility of the generated data.</p></details> |  |

However, modeling real-world environments presents unique challenges as they dynamically change across both space and, crucially, time. To capture these composed dynamics, we introduce a Spatio-Temporal Road Image Dataset for Exploration (STRIDE) permuting 360-degree panoramic imagery into rich interconnected observation, state and action nodes. Leveraging this structure, we can simultaneously model the relationship between egocentric views, positional coordinates, and movement commands across both space and time. We benchmark this dataset via TARDIS, a transformer-based generative world model that integrates spatial and temporal dynamics through a unified autoregressive framework trained on STRIDE. We demonstrate robust performance across a range of agentic tasks such as controllable photorealistic image synthesis, instruction following, autonomous self-control, and state-of-the-art georeferencing. These results suggest a promising direction towards sophisticated generalist agents--capable of understanding and manipulating the spatial and temporal aspects of their material environments--with enhanced embodied reasoning capabilities.

The proposed system requires neither access to multi-channel training data nor prior knowledge about the number or placement of microphones. It works for both a compact microphone array and distributed microphones, with minor adjustments. Due to its superior handling of overlapping speech during segmentation, the proposed pipeline significantly outperforms the single-channel pyannote approach, both in a scenario with a compact microphone array and in a setup with distributed microphones. Additionally, we show that, unlike fully spatial diarization pipelines, the proposed system can correctly track speakers when they change positions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Interspeech 2025</p></details> |

In order to summarise information encompassed in such data, we combine two well known statistical modelling methods. To account for the spatial dimension, we use the intrinsic modification of the conditional autoregression, and incorporate it with the hidden Markov model, allowing the spatial patterns to vary over time. We apply our method into parish register data considering deaths caused by measles in Finland in 1750-1850, and gain novel insight of previously undiscovered infection dynamics. Five distinctive, reoccurring states describing spatially and temporally differing infection burden and potential routes of spread are identified. We also find that there is a change in the occurrences of the most typical spatial patterns circa 1812, possibly due to changes in communication routes after major administrative transformations in Finland.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we leverage a large-scale spatio-temporal dataset collected from Peru's national Digital Contact Tracing (DCT) application during the COVID-19 pandemic to forecast mobility flows across urban regions. A key challenge lies in the spatial sparsity of hourly mobility counts across hexagonal grid cells, which limits the predictive power of conventional time series models. To address this, we propose a lightweight and model-agnostic Spatial Neighbourhood Fusion (SPN) technique that augments each cell's features with aggregated signals from its immediate H3 neighbors. We evaluate this strategy on three forecasting backbones: NLinear, PatchTST, and K-U-Net, under various historical input lengths. Experimental results show that SPN consistently improves forecasting performance, achieving up to 9.85 percent reduction in test MSE. Our findings demonstrate that spatial smoothing of sparse mobility signals provides a simple yet effective path toward robust spatio-temporal forecasting during public health crises.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we utilise statistical spatio-temporal methods to combine data from various sources and resolutions, aiming to model krill abundance. Our focus lies in fitting the model to a dataset comprising acoustic measurements of krill biomass. To achieve this, we integrate climate covariates obtained from satellite imagery and from drifting surface buoys (also known as drifters). Additionally, we use sparsely collected krill biomass data obtained from net fishing efforts (KRILLBASE) for validation. However, integrating these multiple heterogeneous data sources presents significant modelling challenges, including spatio-temporal misalignment and inflated zeros in the observed data. To address these challenges, we fit a Hurdle-Gamma model to jointly describe the occurrence of zeros and the krill biomass for the non-zero observations, while also accounting for misaligned and heterogeneous data sources, including drifters. Therefore, our work presents a comprehensive framework for analysing and predicting krill abundance in the Southern Ocean, leveraging information from various sources and formats. This is crucial due to the impact of krill fishing, as understanding their distribution is essential for informed management decisions and fishing regulations aimed at protecting the species.</p></details> |  |

While recent data-driven methods like deep reinforcement learning improve microscopic realism, they often overlook critical macroscopic features such as crowd density and flow, which are governed by spatio-temporal spawn dynamics, namely, when and where agents enter a scene. Traditional methods, like random spawn rates, stochastic processes, or fixed schedules, are not guaranteed to capture the underlying complexity or lack diversity and realism. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach called nTPP-GMM that models spatio-temporal spawn dynamics using Neural Temporal Point Processes (nTPPs) that are coupled with a spawn-conditional Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for agent spawn and goal positions. We evaluate our approach by orchestrating crowd simulations of three diverse real-world datasets with nTPP-GMM. Our experiments demonstrate the orchestration with nTPP-GMM leads to realistic simulations that reflect real-world crowd scenarios and allow crowd analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Using Deep Operators to Create Spatio-temporal Surrogates for Dynamical Systems under Uncertainty](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11761v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal data, which consists of responses or measurements gathered at different times and positions, is ubiquitous across diverse applications of civil infrastructure. While SciML methods have made significant progress in tackling the issue of response prediction for individual time histories, creating a full spatial-temporal surrogate remains a challenge. This study proposes a novel variant of deep operator networks (DeepONets), namely the full-field Extended DeepONet (FExD), to serve as a spatial-temporal surrogate that provides multi-output response predictions for dynamical systems. The proposed FExD surrogate model effectively learns the full solution operator across multiple degrees of freedom by enhancing the expressiveness of the branch network and expanding the predictive capabilities of the trunk network. The proposed FExD surrogate is deployed to simultaneously capture the dynamics at several sensing locations along a testbed model of a cable-stayed bridge subjected to stochastic ground motions. The ensuing response predictions from the FExD are comprehensively compared against both a vanilla DeepONet and a modified spatio-temporal Extended DeepONet. The results demonstrate the proposed FExD can achieve both superior accuracy and computational efficiency, representing a significant advancement in operator learning for structural dynamics applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[FAME: A Lightweight Spatio-Temporal Network for Model Attribution of Face-Swap Deepfakes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11477v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread emergence of face-swap Deepfake videos poses growing risks to digital security, privacy, and media integrity, necessitating effective forensic tools for identifying the source of such manipulations. Although most prior research has focused primarily on binary Deepfake detection, the task of model attribution -- determining which generative model produced a given Deepfake -- remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce FAME (Fake Attribution via Multilevel Embeddings), a lightweight and efficient spatio-temporal framework designed to capture subtle generative artifacts specific to different face-swap models. FAME integrates spatial and temporal attention mechanisms to improve attribution accuracy while remaining computationally efficient. We evaluate our model on three challenging and diverse datasets: Deepfake Detection and Manipulation (DFDM), FaceForensics++, and FakeAVCeleb. Results show that FAME consistently outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and runtime, highlighting its potential for deployment in real-world forensic and information security applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Attention-based Spatio-Temporal Neural Operator for Evolving Physics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11328v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In scientific machine learning (SciML), a key challenge is learning unknown, evolving physical processes and making predictions across spatio-temporal scales. For example, in real-world manufacturing problems like additive manufacturing, users adjust known machine settings while unknown environmental parameters simultaneously fluctuate. To make reliable predictions, it is desired for a model to not only capture long-range spatio-temporal interactions from data but also adapt to new and unknown environments; traditional machine learning models excel at the first task but often lack physical interpretability and struggle to generalize under varying environmental conditions. To tackle these challenges, we propose the Attention-based Spatio-Temporal Neural Operator (ASNO), a novel architecture that combines separable attention mechanisms for spatial and temporal interactions and adapts to unseen physical parameters. Inspired by the backward differentiation formula (BDF), ASNO learns a transformer for temporal prediction and extrapolation and an attention-based neural operator for handling varying external loads, enhancing interpretability by isolating historical state contributions and external forces, enabling the discovery of underlying physical laws and generalizability to unseen physical environments. Empirical results on SciML benchmarks demonstrate that ASNO outperforms over existing models, establishing its potential for engineering applications, physics discovery, and interpretable machine learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[CINeMA: Conditional Implicit Neural Multi-Modal Atlas for a Spatio-Temporal Representation of the Perinatal Brain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09668v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Magnetic resonance imaging of fetal and neonatal brains reveals rapid neurodevelopment marked by substantial anatomical changes unfolding within days. Studying this critical stage of the developing human brain, therefore, requires accurate brain models-referred to as atlases-of high spatial and temporal resolution. To meet these demands, established traditional atlases and recently proposed deep learning-based methods rely on large and comprehensive datasets. This poses a major challenge for studying brains in the presence of pathologies for which data remains scarce. We address this limitation with CINeMA (Conditional Implicit Neural Multi-Modal Atlas), a novel framework for creating high-resolution, spatio-temporal, multimodal brain atlases, suitable for low-data settings. Unlike established methods, CINeMA operates in latent space, avoiding compute-intensive image registration and reducing atlas construction times from days to minutes. Furthermore, it enables flexible conditioning on anatomical features including GA, birth age, and pathologies like ventriculomegaly (VM) and agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC). CINeMA supports downstream tasks such as tissue segmentation and age prediction whereas its generative properties enable synthetic data creation and anatomically informed data augmentation. Surpassing state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, efficiency, and versatility, CINeMA represents a powerful tool for advancing brain research. We release the code and atlases at https://github.com/m-dannecker/CINeMA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work currently under revision for IEEE TMI</p></details> |

However, existing time-to-space sequential methods often fail to effectively extract features in block-wise missing data scenarios. Meanwhile, the static graph structure for spatial feature propagation significantly constrains the models flexibility in handling the distribution shift issue for the nonstationary traffic data. To address these issues, this paper proposes a SpatioTemporal Attention Mixture of experts network named STAMImputer for traffic data imputation. Specifically, we introduce a Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework to capture latent spatio-temporal features and their influence weights, effectively imputing block missing. A novel Low-rank guided Sampling Graph ATtention (LrSGAT) mechanism is designed to dynamically balance the local and global correlations across road networks. The sampled attention vectors are utilized to generate dynamic graphs that capture real-time spatial correlations. Extensive experiments are conducted on four traffic datasets for evaluation. The result shows STAMImputer achieves significantly performance improvement compared with existing SOTA approaches.

Current memory systems often grapple with fundamental limitations in structural flexibility, temporal awareness, and the ability to synthesize higher-level insights from raw interaction data. This paper introduces Cognitive Weave, a novel memory framework centered around a multi-layered spatio-temporal resonance graph (STRG). This graph manages information as semantically rich insight particles (IPs), which are dynamically enriched with resonance keys, signifiers, and situational imprints via a dedicated semantic oracle interface (SOI). These IPs are interconnected through typed relational strands, forming an evolving knowledge tapestry. A key component of Cognitive Weave is the cognitive refinement process, an autonomous mechanism that includes the synthesis of insight aggregates (IAs) condensed, higher-level knowledge structures derived from identified clusters of related IPs. We present comprehensive experimental results demonstrating Cognitive Weave's marked enhancement over existing approaches in long-horizon planning tasks, evolving question-answering scenarios, and multi-session dialogue coherence. The system achieves a notable 34% average improvement in task completion rates and a 42% reduction in mean query latency when compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, this paper explores the ethical considerations inherent in such advanced memory systems, discusses the implications for long-term memory in LLMs, and outlines promising future research trajectories.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal State Space Model For Efficient Event-Based Optical Flow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07878v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event cameras unlock new frontiers that were previously unthinkable with standard frame-based cameras. One notable example is low-latency motion estimation (optical flow), which is critical for many real-time applications. In such applications, the computational efficiency of algorithms is paramount. Although recent deep learning paradigms such as CNN, RNN, or ViT have shown remarkable performance, they often lack the desired computational efficiency. Conversely, asynchronous event-based methods including SNNs and GNNs are computationally efficient; however, these approaches fail to capture sufficient spatio-temporal information, a powerful feature required to achieve better performance for optical flow estimation. In this work, we introduce Spatio-Temporal State Space Model (STSSM) module along with a novel network architecture to develop an extremely efficient solution with competitive performance. Our STSSM module leverages state-space models to effectively capture spatio-temporal correlations in event data, offering higher performance with lower complexity compared to ViT, CNN-based architectures in similar settings. Our model achieves 4.5x faster inference and 8x lower computations compared to TMA and 2x lower computations compared to EV-FlowNet with competitive performance on the DSEC benchmark.

In this work, we introduce ST-GraphNet, a spatio-temporal graph neural network framework designed to model and predict AV crash severity by using both fine-grained and region-aggregated spatial graphs. Using a balanced dataset of 2,352 real-world AV-related crash reports from Texas (2024), including geospatial coordinates, crash timestamps, SAE automation levels, and narrative descriptions, we construct two complementary graph representations: (1) a fine-grained graph with individual crash events as nodes, where edges are defined via spatio-temporal proximity; and (2) a coarse-grained graph where crashes are aggregated into Hexagonal Hierarchical Spatial Indexing (H3)-based spatial cells, connected through hexagonal adjacency. Each node in the graph is enriched with multimodal data, including semantic, spatial, and temporal attributes, including textual embeddings from crash narratives using a pretrained Sentence-BERT model. We evaluate various graph neural network (GNN) architectures, such as Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), Graph Attention Networks (GAT), and Dynamic Spatio-Temporal GCN (DSTGCN), to classify crash severity and predict high-risk regions. Our proposed ST-GraphNet, which utilizes a DSTGCN backbone on the coarse-grained H3 graph, achieves a test accuracy of 97.74\%, substantially outperforming the best fine-grained model (64.7\% test accuracy). These findings highlight the effectiveness of spatial aggregation, dynamic message passing, and multi-modal feature integration in capturing the complex spatio-temporal patterns underlying AV crash severity.</p></details> |  |

The framework automatically mines pre-defined traffic scenarios from any dataset using ground-truth annotations, provides an intuitive user interface for efficient human verification, and generates multiple-choice questions for model evaluation. Applied to the NuScenes dataset, we present STSnu, the first benchmark that evaluates the spatio-temporal reasoning capabilities of VLMs based on comprehensive 3D perception. Existing benchmarks typically target off-the-shelf or fine-tuned VLMs for images or videos from a single viewpoint and focus on semantic tasks such as object recognition, dense captioning, risk assessment, or scene understanding. In contrast, STSnu evaluates driving expert VLMs for end-to-end driving, operating on videos from multi-view cameras or LiDAR. It specifically assesses their ability to reason about both ego-vehicle actions and complex interactions among traffic participants, a crucial capability for autonomous vehicles. The benchmark features 43 diverse scenarios spanning multiple views and frames, resulting in 971 human-verified multiple-choice questions. A thorough evaluation uncovers critical shortcomings in existing models' ability to reason about fundamental traffic dynamics in complex environments. These findings highlight the urgent need for architectural advances that explicitly model spatio-temporal reasoning. By addressing a core gap in spatio-temporal evaluation, STSBench enables the development of more robust and explainable VLMs for autonomous driving.</p></details> | <details><summary>Datas...</summary><p>Dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/ivc-lrp/STSBench, Code: https://github.com/LRP-IVC/STSBench</p></details> |

However, the spatial correlation inherent to environmental monitoring has been mostly neglected in the recent literature, due to the significant modeling complexity it introduces. In this work, we address this gap by presenting a model of spatio-temporal information freshness, considering the conditional entropy of the system state in a remote monitoring scenario, such as a low-orbit satellite collecting information from a wide geographical area. Our analytical results show that purely age-oriented schemes tend to select an overly broad communication range, leading to inaccurate estimates and energy inefficiency, both of which can be mitigated by adopting a spatio-temporal approach.</p></details> |  |

Although spatio-temporal graph neural networks have achieved success in modeling various static spatio-temporal forecasting scenarios, real-world spatio-temporal data are typically received in a streaming manner, and the network continuously expands with the installation of new sensors. Thus, spatio-temporal forecasting in streaming scenarios faces dual challenges: the inefficiency of retraining models over newly arrived data and the detrimental effects of catastrophic forgetting over long-term history. To address these challenges, we propose a novel prompt tuning-based continuous forecasting method, following two fundamental tuning principles guided by empirical and theoretical analysis: expand and compress, which effectively resolve the aforementioned problems with lightweight tuning parameters. Specifically, we integrate the base spatio-temporal graph neural network with a continuous prompt pool, utilizing stored prompts (i.e., few learnable parameters) in memory, and jointly optimize them with the base spatio-temporal graph neural network. This method ensures that the model sequentially learns from the spatio-temporal data stream to accomplish tasks for corresponding periods. Extensive experimental results on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the multi-faceted superiority of our method over the state-of-the-art baselines, including effectiveness, efficiency, universality, etc.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> |

However, existing methods typically rely on transformer-based architectures, which often face challenges related to scalability and efficiency. To address these issues, we propose a novel, efficient human-human interaction generation method based on the Mamba framework, designed to meet the demands of effectively capturing long-sequence dependencies while providing real-time feedback. Specifically, we introduce an adaptive spatio-temporal Mamba framework that utilizes two parallel SSM branches with an adaptive mechanism to integrate the spatial and temporal features of motion sequences. To further enhance the model's ability to capture dependencies within individual motion sequences and the interactions between different individual sequences, we develop two key modules: the self-adaptive spatio-temporal Mamba module and the cross-adaptive spatio-temporal Mamba module, enabling efficient feature learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results on two interaction datasets with remarkable quality and efficiency. Compared to the baseline method InterGen, our approach not only improves accuracy but also requires a minimal parameter size of just 66M ,only 36% of InterGen's, while achieving an average inference speed of 0.57 seconds, which is 46% of InterGen's execution time.</p></details> |  |

Many end-to-end approaches rely on human annotations to learn intermediate perception and prediction tasks, while purely self-supervised approaches--which directly learn from sensor inputs to generate planning trajectories without human annotations often underperform the state of the art. We observe a key gap in the input representation space: end-to-end approaches built on MLLMs are often pretrained with reasoning tasks in 2D image space rather than the native 3D space in which autonomous vehicles plan. To this end, we propose S4-Driver, a scalable self-supervised motion planning algorithm with spatio-temporal visual representation, based on the popular PaLI multimodal large language model. S4-Driver uses a novel sparse volume strategy to seamlessly transform the strong visual representation of MLLMs from perspective view to 3D space without the need to finetune the vision encoder. This representation aggregates multi-view and multi-frame visual inputs and enables better prediction of planning trajectories in 3D space. To validate our method, we run experiments on both nuScenes and Waymo Open Motion Dataset (with in-house camera data). Results show that S4-Driver performs favorably against existing supervised multi-task approaches while requiring no human annotations. It also demonstrates great scalability when pretrained on large volumes of unannotated driving logs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR2025; Project website: s4-driver.github.io</p></details> |

However, existing FER methods face three key challenges in real-world applications: (i) they rely on large amounts of continuously annotated data to ensure accuracy since emotions are complex and ambiguous in reality, which is costly and time-consuming; (ii) they cannot capture the temporal heterogeneity caused by changing emotion patterns, because they usually assume that the temporal correlation within sampling periods is the same; (iii) they do not consider the spatial heterogeneity of different FER scenarios, that is, the distribution of emotion information in different data may have bias or interference. To address these challenges, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Fuzzy-oriented Multi-modal Meta-learning framework (ST-F2M). Specifically, ST-F2M first divides the multi-modal videos into multiple views, and each view corresponds to one modality of one emotion. Multiple randomly selected views for the same emotion form a meta-training task. Next, ST-F2M uses an integrated module with spatial and temporal convolutions to encode the data of each task, reflecting the spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Then it adds fuzzy semantic information to each task based on generalized fuzzy rules, which helps handle the complexity and ambiguity of emotions. Finally, ST-F2M learns emotion-related general meta-knowledge through meta-recurrent neural networks to achieve fast and robust fine-grained emotion recognition. Extensive experiments show that ST-F2M outperforms various state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and model efficiency. In addition, we construct ablation studies and further analysis to explore why ST-F2M performs well.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

They provide policymakers with the granular information needed to identify, target, and implement effective interventions and allocate resources appropriately. Traditional disease mapping methods typically rely on Poisson regression, modeling observed counts while adjusting for local covariates that are treated as fixed and known. However, these methods may fail to capture the complexities and uncertainties in areas with sparse or absent data. To address this challenge, we developed a Bayesian hierarchical spatio-temporal top-down approach designed to estimate county-level OUD rates when direct small-area (county) data is unavailable. This method allows us to infer small-area OUD rates and quantify associated uncertainties, even in data-sparse environments using observed state-level OUD rates and a combination of state and county level informative covariates. We applied our approach to estimate OUD rates for 3,143 counties in the United States between 2010 and 2025. Model performance was assessed through simulation studies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unraveling Spatio-Temporal Foundation Models via the Pipeline Lens: A Comprehensive Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01364v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal deep learning models aims to utilize useful patterns in such data to support tasks like prediction. However, previous deep learning models designed for specific tasks typically require separate training for each use case, leading to increased computational and storage costs. To address this issue, spatio-temporal foundation models have emerged, offering a unified framework capable of solving multiple spatio-temporal tasks. These foundation models achieve remarkable success by learning general knowledge with spatio-temporal data or transferring the general capabilities of pre-trained language models. While previous surveys have explored spatio-temporal data and methodologies separately, they have ignored a comprehensive examination of how foundation models are designed, selected, pre-trained, and adapted. As a result, the overall pipeline for spatio-temporal foundation models remains unclear. To bridge this gap, we innovatively provide an up-to-date review of previous spatio-temporal foundation models from the pipeline perspective. The pipeline begins with an introduction to different types of spatio-temporal data, followed by details of data preprocessing and embedding techniques. The pipeline then presents a novel data property taxonomy to divide existing methods according to data sources and dependencies, providing efficient and effective model design and selection for researchers. On this basis, we further illustrate the training objectives of primitive models, as well as the adaptation techniques of transferred models. Overall, our survey provides a clear and structured pipeline to understand the connection between core elements of spatio-temporal foundation models while guiding researchers to get started quickly. Additionally, we introduce emerging opportunities such as multi-objective training in the field of spatio-temporal foundation models.</p></details> | 21 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Decoupled Learning for Spiking Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01117v1)** | 2025-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have gained significant attention for their potential to enable energy-efficient artificial intelligence. However, effective and efficient training of SNNs remains an unresolved challenge. While backpropagation through time (BPTT) achieves high accuracy, it incurs substantial memory overhead. In contrast, biologically plausible local learning methods are more memory-efficient but struggle to match the accuracy of BPTT. To bridge this gap, we propose spatio-temporal decouple learning (STDL), a novel training framework that decouples the spatial and temporal dependencies to achieve both high accuracy and training efficiency for SNNs. Specifically, to achieve spatial decoupling, STDL partitions the network into smaller subnetworks, each of which is trained independently using an auxiliary network. To address the decreased synergy among subnetworks resulting from spatial decoupling, STDL constructs each subnetwork's auxiliary network by selecting the largest subset of layers from its subsequent network layers under a memory constraint. Furthermore, STDL decouples dependencies across time steps to enable efficient online learning. Extensive evaluations on seven static and event-based vision datasets demonstrate that STDL consistently outperforms local learning methods and achieves comparable accuracy to the BPTT method with considerably reduced GPU memory cost. Notably, STDL achieves 4x reduced GPU memory than BPTT on the ImageNet dataset. Therefore, this work opens up a promising avenue for memory-efficient SNN training.

In this paper, we propose a noise-robust real-world VSR framework by incorporating self-supervised learning and Mamba into pre-trained latent diffusion models. To ensure content consistency across adjacent frames, we enhance the diffusion model with a global spatio-temporal attention mechanism using the Video State-Space block with a 3D Selective Scan module, which reinforces coherence at an affordable computational cost. To further reduce artifacts in generated details, we introduce a self-supervised ControlNet that leverages HR features as guidance and employs contrastive learning to extract degradation-insensitive features from LR videos. Finally, a three-stage training strategy based on a mixture of HR-LR videos is proposed to stabilize VSR training. The proposed Self-supervised ControlNet with Spatio-Temporal Continuous Mamba based VSR algorithm achieves superior perceptual quality than state-of-the-arts on real-world VSR benchmark datasets, validating the effectiveness of the proposed model design and training strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 10 figures, accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Fixed Variables: Expanding-variate Time Series Forecasting via Flat Scheme and Spatio-temporal Focal Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15296v2)** | 2025-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate Time Series Forecasting (MTSF) has long been a key research focus. Traditionally, these studies assume a fixed number of variables, but in real-world applications, Cyber-Physical Systems often expand as new sensors are deployed, increasing variables in MTSF. In light of this, we introduce a novel task, Expanding-variate Time Series Forecasting (EVTSF). This task presents unique challenges, specifically (1) handling inconsistent data shapes caused by adding new variables, and (2) addressing imbalanced spatio-temporal learning, where expanding variables have limited observed data due to the necessity for timely operation. To address these challenges, we propose STEV, a flexible spatio-temporal forecasting framework. STEV includes a new Flat Scheme to tackle the inconsistent data shape issue, which extends the graph-based spatio-temporal modeling architecture into 1D space by flattening the 2D samples along the variable dimension, making the model variable-scale-agnostic while still preserving dynamic spatial correlations through a holistic graph. We introduce a novel Spatio-temporal Focal Learning strategy that incorporates a negative filter to resolve potential conflicts between contrastive learning and graph representation, and a focal contrastive loss as its core to guide the framework to focus on optimizing the expanding variables. We benchmark EVTSF performance using three real-world datasets and compare it against three potential solutions employing SOTA MTSF models tailored for EVSTF. Experimental results show that STEV significantly outperforms its competitors, particularly on expanding variables. Notably, STEV, with only 5% of observations from the expanding period, is on par with SOTA MTSF models trained with complete observations. Further exploration of various expanding strategies underscores the generalizability of STEV in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

However, the interpretable spatio-temporal features extraction by soft sensors remains a challenge. In this light, this work introduces a novel method termed spatio-temporal consistent and interpretable model (STCIM). First, temporal and spatial features are captured and aligned by a far topological spatio-temporal consistency extraction block. Then, the features are mapped into an interpretable latent space for further prediction by explicitly giving physical meanings to latent variables. The efficacy of the proposed STCIM is demonstrated through the modeling of two generated datasets and a real-life dataset of coal-fired power plants. The corresponding experiments show: 1) The generalization of STCIM outperforms other methods, especially in different operation situations. 2) The far topological spatio-temporal consistency is vital for feature alignment. 3) The hyper-parameters of physics-informed interpretable latent space loss decide the performance of STCIM.</p></details> |  |

However, accurately forecasting STTS is challenging due to complex dynamic correlations in both time and space dimensions. Existing graph neural networks struggle to balance effectiveness and efficiency in modeling dynamic spatio-temporal relations. To address this problem, we propose the Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Stiefel Graph Neural Network (DST-SGNN) to efficiently process STTS. For DST-SGNN, we first introduce the novel Stiefel Graph Spectral Convolution (SGSC) and Stiefel Graph Fourier Transform (SGFT). The SGFT matrix in SGSC is constrained to lie on the Stiefel manifold, and SGSC can be regarded as a filtered graph spectral convolution. We also propose the Linear Dynamic Graph Optimization on Stiefel Manifold (LDGOSM), which can efficiently learn the SGFT matrix from the dynamic graph and significantly reduce the computational complexity. Finally, we propose a multi-layer SGSC (MSGSC) that efficiently captures complex spatio-temporal correlations. Extensive experiments on seven spatio-temporal datasets show that DST-SGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods while maintaining relatively low computational costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IJCAI 2025</p></details> |

While Graph Attention Networks (GATs) are popular for modeling spatial dependencies, they rely on predefined adjacency structures and dynamic attention scores, introducing inductive biases and computational overhead that can obscure interpretability. We propose InterGAT, a simplified alternative to GAT that replaces masked attention with a fully learnable, symmetric node interaction matrix, capturing latent spatial relationships without relying on fixed graph topologies. Our framework, InterGAT-GRU, which incorporates a GRU-based temporal decoder, outperforms the baseline GAT-GRU in forecasting accuracy, achieving at least a 21% improvement on the SZ-Taxi dataset and a 6% improvement on the Los-Loop dataset across all forecasting horizons (15 to 60 minutes). Additionally, we observed reduction in training time by 60-70% compared to GAT-GRU baseline. Crucially, the learned interaction matrix reveals interpretable structure: it recovers sparse, topology-aware attention patterns that align with community structure. Spectral and clustering analyses show that the model captures both localized and global dynamics, offering insights into the functional topology driving predictions. This highlights how structure learning can simultaneously support prediction, computational efficiency, and topological interpretabil-ity in dynamic graph-based domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 10 figures, workshop</p></details> |

However, real-world scenarios frequently present challenges such as signal anomalies, noise, and distributional shifts. Existing solutions primarily enhance robustness by modifying network architectures or training procedures. Nevertheless, these approaches are computationally intensive and resource-demanding, especially for large-scale applications. In this paper, we explore a novel test-time computing paradigm, namely learning with calibration, ST-TTC, for spatio-temporal forecasting. Through learning with calibration, we aim to capture periodic structural biases arising from non-stationarity during the testing phase and perform real-time bias correction on predictions to improve accuracy. Specifically, we first introduce a spectral-domain calibrator with phase-amplitude modulation to mitigate periodic shift and then propose a flash updating mechanism with a streaming memory queue for efficient test-time computation. ST-TTC effectively bypasses complex training-stage techniques, offering an efficient and generalizable paradigm. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness, universality, flexibility and efficiency of our proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 9 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

It provides a systematic approach to quantifying resource consumption, emissions, and waste, enabling industries, researchers, and policymakers to identify hotspots for sustainability improvements. By providing a comprehensive assessment of systems, from raw material extraction to end-of-life disposal, LCA facilitates the development of environmentally sound strategies, thereby contributing significantly to sustainable engineering and informed decision-making. Despite its strengths and ubiquitous use, life cycle analysis has not been reconciled with the broader literature in model-based systems engineering and analysis, thus hindering its integration into the design of complex systems more generally. This lack of reconciliation poses a significant problem, as it hinders the seamless integration of environmental sustainability into the design and optimization of complex systems. Without alignment between life cycle analysis (LCA) and model-based systems engineering (MBSE), sustainability remains an isolated consideration rather than an inherent part of the system's architecture and design. The original contribution of this paper is twofold. First, the paper reconciles process-based life cycle analysis with the broader literature and vocabulary of model-based systems engineering and hetero-functional graph theory. It ultimately proves that model-based systems engineering and hetero-functional graph theory are a formal generalization of process-based life cycle analysis. Secondly, the paper demonstrates how model-based systems engineering and hetero-functional graph theory may be used to enhance the spatio-temporal resolution of process-based life cycle analysis in a manner that aligns with system design objectives.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |

Hence, analyzing and clustering spatio-temporal air quality data is crucial for understanding pollution dynamics and guiding policy interventions. This work provides a review of Bayesian nonparametric clustering methods, with a particular focus on their application to spatio-temporal data, which are ubiquitous in environmental sciences. We first introduce key modeling approaches for point-referenced spatio-temporal data, highlighting their flexibility in capturing complex spatial and temporal dependencies. We then review recent advancements in Bayesian clustering, focusing on spatial product partition models, which incorporate spatial structure into the clustering process. We illustrate the proposed methods on PM10 monitoring data from Northern Italy, demonstrating their ability to identify meaningful pollution patterns. This review highlights the potential of Bayesian nonparametric methods for environmental risk assessment and offers insights into future research directions in spatio-temporal clustering for public health and environmental science.</p></details> |  |

While spatial super-resolution and spectral super-resolution have been extensively studied, joint spatio-spectral super-resolution remains relatively explored. We propose an end-to-end model-driven framework that explicitly decomposes the joint spatio-spectral super-resolution problem into spatial super-resolution, spectral super-resolution and fusion tasks. Each sub-task is addressed by unfolding a variational-based approach, where the operators involved in the proximal gradient iterative scheme are replaced with tailored learnable modules. In particular, we design an upsampling operator for spatial super-resolution based on classical back-projection algorithms, adapted to handle arbitrary scaling factors. Spectral reconstruction is performed using learnable cluster-based upsampling and downsampling operators. For image fusion, we integrate low-frequency estimation and high-frequency injection modules to combine the spatial and spectral information from spatial super-resolution and spectral super-resolution outputs. Additionally, we introduce an efficient nonlocal post-processing step that leverages image self-similarity by combining a multi-head attention mechanism with residual connections. Extensive evaluations on several datasets and sampling factors demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Such data show dependence across several dimensions of space as well as in time, and can easily involve hundreds of thousands of observations. Many spatio-temporal models result in a dependence structure across all observations and can be fit only at a substantial computational cost, arising from dense matrix inversion, high dimensional parameter spaces, poor mixing in Markov Chain Monte Carlo, or the impossibility of utilizing parallel computing due to a lack of independence anywhere in the model fitting process. These computational challenges are exacerbated when the response variable is ordinal, and especially as the number of ordered categories grows. Some spatio-temporal models achieve computational feasibility for large datasets but only through overly restrictive model simplifications, which we seek to avoid here. In this paper we demonstrate a two-stage algorithm to fit a Bayesian spatio-temporal model to large datasets when the response variable is ordinal. The first stage models locations independently in space, capturing temporal dependence, and can be run in parallel. The second stage resamples from the first stage posterior distributions with an acceptance probability computed to impose spatial dependence from the full spatio-temporal model. The result is fast Bayesian inference which samples from the full spatio-temporal posterior and is computationally feasible even for large datasets. We quantify the substantial computational gains our approach achieves, and demonstrate the preservation of the posterior distribution as compared to the more costly single-stage model fit. We apply our approach to a large spatio-temporal drought dataset in the United States, a dataset too large for many existing spatio-temporal methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing the Accuracy of Spatio-Temporal Models for Wind Speed Prediction by Incorporating Bias-Corrected Crowdsourced Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24506v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate high-resolution spatial and temporal wind speed data is critical for estimating the wind energy potential of a location. For real-time wind speed prediction, statistical models typically depend on high-quality (near) real-time data from official meteorological stations to improve forecasting accuracy. Personal weather stations (PWS) offer an additional source of real-time data and broader spatial coverage than offical stations. However, they are not subject to rigorous quality control and may exhibit bias or measurement errors. This paper presents a framework for incorporating PWS data into statistical models for validated official meteorological station data via a two-stage approach. First, bias correction is performed on PWS wind speed data using reanalysis data. Second, we implement a Bayesian hierarchical spatio-temporal model that accounts for varying measurement error in the PWS data. This enables wind speed prediction across a target area, and is particularly beneficial for improving predictions in regions sparse in official monitoring stations. Our results show that including bias-corrected PWS data improves prediction accuracy compared to using meteorological station data alone, with a 7% reduction in prediction error on average across all sites. The results are comparable with popular reanalysis products, but unlike these numerical weather models our approach is available in real-time and offers improved uncertainty quantification.</p></details> |  |

However, most current systems assume a static environment, which limits the system's applicability in real-world scenarios where environments frequently change due to human intervention or the robot's own actions. In this work, we present DynaMem, a new approach to open-world mobile manipulation that uses a dynamic spatio-semantic memory to represent a robot's environment. DynaMem constructs a 3D data structure to maintain a dynamic memory of point clouds, and answers open-vocabulary object localization queries using multimodal LLMs or open-vocabulary features generated by state-of-the-art vision-language models. Powered by DynaMem, our robots can explore novel environments, search for objects not found in memory, and continuously update the memory as objects move, appear, or disappear in the scene. We run extensive experiments on the Stretch SE3 robots in three real and nine offline scenes, and achieve an average pick-and-drop success rate of 70% on non-stationary objects, which is more than a 2x improvement over state-of-the-art static systems.

However, existing 3DGS-based methods for dynamic reconstruction often suffer from \textit{spatio-temporal incoherence} during initialization, where canonical Gaussians are constructed by aggregating observations from multiple frames without temporal distinction. This results in spatio-temporally entangled representations, making it difficult to model dynamic motion accurately. To overcome this limitation, we propose \textbf{STDR} (Spatio-Temporal Decoupling for Real-time rendering), a plug-and-play module that learns spatio-temporal probability distributions for each Gaussian. STDR introduces a spatio-temporal mask, a separated deformation field, and a consistency regularization to jointly disentangle spatial and temporal patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that incorporating our module into existing 3DGS-based dynamic scene reconstruction frameworks leads to notable improvements in both reconstruction quality and spatio-temporal consistency across synthetic and real-world benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we adapt and specialise the robust and conjugate GP (RCGP) framework of Altamirano et al. (2024) to the spatio-temporal setting. In doing so, we obtain an outlier-robust spatio-temporal GP with a computational cost comparable to classical spatio-temporal GPs. We also overcome the three main drawbacks of RCGPs: their unreliable performance when the prior mean is chosen poorly, their lack of reliable uncertainty quantification, and the need to carefully select a hyperparameter by hand. We study our method extensively in finance and weather forecasting applications, demonstrating that it provides a reliable approach to spatio-temporal modelling in the presence of outliers.</p></details> |  |

Recently, advancements in monitoring technology have facilitated the effective recording of nuclear radiation levels and related factors, such as weather conditions. The abundance of monitoring data enables the development of accurate and reliable nuclear radiation forecasting models, which play a crucial role in informing decision-making for individuals and governments. However, this task is challenging due to the imbalanced distribution of monitoring stations over a wide spatial range and the non-stationary radiation variation patterns. In this study, we introduce NRFormer, a novel framework tailored for the nationwide prediction of nuclear radiation variations. By integrating a non-stationary temporal attention module, an imbalance-aware spatial attention module, and a radiation propagation prompting module, NRFormer collectively captures complex spatio-temporal dynamics of nuclear radiation.

To make profits, prosumers equipped with photovoltaic (PV) panels and even the energy storage system (ESS) can actively participate in the real-time P2P energy market and trade energy. However, in real situations, system states such as energy demands and renewable energy power generation are highly uncertain, making it difficult for prosumers to make optimal real-time decisions. Moreover, severe problems with the physical network can arise from the real-time P2P energy trading, such as bus voltage violations and line overload. To handle these problems, this work first formulates the real-time P2P energy trading problem as a spatio-temporally constrained stochastic optimization problem by considering ESS and the spatial physical network constraints. To deal with the uncertainties online, a modified Lyapunov optimization method is innovatively proposed to approximately reformulate the stochastic optimization problem into an online one by relaxing the time-coupling constraints. Compared with the state-of-the-art online methods, the proposed one renders more flexibility and better performance for the real-time P2P energy market operation. Additionally, to protect the prosumers' privacy, an online distributed algorithm based on the consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is developed to solve the reformulated online problem by decoupling the spatial constraints. The theoretical near-optimal performance guarantee of the proposed online distributed algorithm is derived, and its performance can be further improved by minimizing the performance gap. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed online distributed algorithm can guarantee the fast, stable, and safe long-term operation of the real-time P2P energy market.</p></details> |  |

Spatio-temporal deep learning models, while scalable, typically assume a simplistic independent covariance matrix for the response, failing to capture the underlying correlation structure. However, spatio-temporal GPs suffer from issues of scalability and various forms of approximation bias resulting from restrictive assumptions of the covariance kernel function. We propose STACI, a novel framework consisting of a variational Bayesian neural network approximation of non-stationary spatio-temporal GP along with a novel spatio-temporal conformal inference algorithm. STACI is highly scalable, taking advantage of GPU training capabilities for neural network models, and provides statistically valid prediction intervals for uncertainty quantification. STACI outperforms competing GPs and deep methods in accurately approximating spatio-temporal processes and we show it easily scales to datasets with millions of observations.</p></details> |  |

However, they often fail to generalize in Spatio-Temporal Out-of-Distribution (STOOD) scenarios, where both temporal dynamics and spatial structures evolve beyond the training distribution. To address this problem, we propose an innovative Spatio-Temporal Retrieval-Augmented Pattern Learning framework,STRAP, which enhances model generalization by integrating retrieval-augmented learning into the STGNN continue learning pipeline. The core of STRAP is a compact and expressive pattern library that stores representative spatio-temporal patterns enriched with historical, structural, and semantic information, which is obtained and optimized during the training phase. During inference, STRAP retrieves relevant patterns from this library based on similarity to the current input and injects them into the model via a plug-and-play prompting mechanism. This not only strengthens spatio-temporal representations but also mitigates catastrophic forgetting. Moreover, STRAP introduces a knowledge-balancing objective to harmonize new information with retrieved knowledge. Extensive experiments across multiple real-world streaming graph datasets show that STRAP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art STGNN baselines on STOOD tasks, demonstrating its robustness, adaptability, and strong generalization capability without task-specific fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |

To tackle these challenges, we propose STH-SepNet (Spatio-Temporal Hypergraph Separation Networks), a novel framework that decouples temporal and spatial modeling to enhance both efficiency and precision. Therein, the temporal dimension is modeled using lightweight large language models, which effectively capture low-rank temporal dynamics. Concurrently, the spatial dimension is addressed through an adaptive hypergraph neural network, which dynamically constructs hyperedges to model intricate, higher-order interactions. A carefully designed gating mechanism is integrated to seamlessly fuse temporal and spatial representations. By leveraging the fundamental principles of low-rank temporal dynamics and spatial interactions, STH-SepNet offers a pragmatic and scalable solution for spatio-temporal prediction in real-world applications. Extensive experiments on large-scale real-world datasets across multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of STH-SepNet in boosting predictive performance while maintaining computational efficiency. This work may provide a promising lightweight framework for spatio-temporal prediction, aiming to reduce computational demands and while enhancing predictive performance.

However, existing VLMs typically utilize discrete text Chain-of-Thought (CoT) tailored to the current scenario, which essentially represents highly abstract and symbolic compression of visual information, potentially leading to spatio-temporal relationship ambiguity and fine-grained information loss. Is autonomous driving better modeled on real-world simulation and imagination than on pure symbolic logic? In this paper, we propose a spatio-temporal CoT reasoning method that enables models to think visually. First, VLM serves as a world model to generate unified image frame for predicting future world states: where perception results (e.g., lane divider and 3D detection) represent the future spatial relationships, and ordinary future frame represent the temporal evolution relationships. This spatio-temporal CoT then serves as intermediate reasoning steps, enabling the VLM to function as an inverse dynamics model for trajectory planning based on current observations and future predictions. To implement visual generation in VLMs, we propose a unified pretraining paradigm integrating visual generation and understanding, along with a progressive visual CoT enhancing autoregressive image generation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, advancing autonomous driving towards visual reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal Spatio-Temporal Prediction: An Effective and Efficient Multi-Modal Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17637v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal prediction plays a crucial role in intelligent transportation, weather forecasting, and urban planning. While integrating multi-modal data has shown potential for enhancing prediction accuracy, key challenges persist: (i) inadequate fusion of multi-modal information, (ii) confounding factors that obscure causal relations, and (iii) high computational complexity of prediction models. To address these challenges, we propose E^2-CSTP, an Effective and Efficient Causal multi-modal Spatio-Temporal Prediction framework. E^2-CSTP leverages cross-modal attention and gating mechanisms to effectively integrate multi-modal data. Building on this, we design a dual-branch causal inference approach: the primary branch focuses on spatio-temporal prediction, while the auxiliary branch mitigates bias by modeling additional modalities and applying causal interventions to uncover true causal dependencies. To improve model efficiency, we integrate GCN with the Mamba architecture for accelerated spatio-temporal encoding. Extensive experiments on 4 real-world datasets show that E^2-CSTP significantly outperforms 9 state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 9.66% improvements in accuracy as well as 17.37%-56.11% reductions in computational overhead.</p></details> |  |
| **[FLEX: A Backbone for Diffusion-Based Modeling of Spatio-temporal Physical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17351v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce FLEX (FLow EXpert), a backbone architecture for generative modeling of spatio-temporal physical systems using diffusion models. FLEX operates in the residual space rather than on raw data, a modeling choice that we motivate theoretically, showing that it reduces the variance of the velocity field in the diffusion model, which helps stabilize training. FLEX integrates a latent Transformer into a U-Net with standard convolutional ResNet layers and incorporates a redesigned skip connection scheme. This hybrid design enables the model to capture both local spatial detail and long-range dependencies in latent space. To improve spatio-temporal conditioning, FLEX uses a task-specific encoder that processes auxiliary inputs such as coarse or past snapshots. Weak conditioning is applied to the shared encoder via skip connections to promote generalization, while strong conditioning is applied to the decoder through both skip and bottleneck features to ensure reconstruction fidelity. FLEX achieves accurate predictions for super-resolution and forecasting tasks using as few as two reverse diffusion steps. It also produces calibrated uncertainty estimates through sampling. Evaluations on high-resolution 2D turbulence data show that FLEX outperforms strong baselines and generalizes to out-of-distribution settings, including unseen Reynolds numbers, physical observables (e.g., fluid flow velocity fields), and boundary conditions.</p></details> |  |

This paper explores a more practical and challenging FCL setting, where clients may have unrelated or even conflicting data and tasks. In this scenario, statistical heterogeneity and data noise can create spurious correlations, leading to biased feature learning and catastrophic forgetting. Existing FCL approaches often use generative replay to create pseudo-datasets of previous tasks. However, generative replay itself suffers from catastrophic forgetting and task divergence among clients, leading to overfitting in FCL. Existing FCL approaches often use generative replay to create pseudo-datasets of previous tasks. However, generative replay itself suffers from catastrophic forgetting and task divergence among clients, leading to overfitting in FCL. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach called Spatio-Temporal grAdient Matching with network-free Prototype (STAMP). Our contributions are threefold: 1) We develop a model-agnostic method to determine subset of samples that effectively form prototypes when using a prototypical network, making it resilient to continual learning challenges; 2) We introduce a spatio-temporal gradient matching approach, applied at both the client-side (temporal) and server-side (spatial), to mitigate catastrophic forgetting and data heterogeneity; 3) We leverage prototypes to approximate task-wise gradients, improving gradient matching on the client-side.

| **[Remote Sensing Spatio-Temporal Vision-Language Models: A Comprehensive Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02573v2)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The interpretation of multi-temporal remote sensing imagery is critical for monitoring Earth's dynamic processes-yet previous change detection methods, which produce binary or semantic masks, fall short of providing human-readable insights into changes. Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have opened a new frontier by fusing visual and linguistic modalities, enabling spatio-temporal vision-language understanding: models that not only capture spatial and temporal dependencies to recognize changes but also provide a richer interactive semantic analysis of temporal images (e.g., generate descriptive captions and answer natural-language queries). In this survey, we present the first comprehensive review of RS-STVLMs. The survey covers the evolution of models from early task-specific models to recent general foundation models that leverage powerful large language models. We discuss progress in representative tasks, such as change captioning, change question answering, and change grounding. Moreover, we systematically dissect the fundamental components and key technologies underlying these models, and review the datasets and evaluation metrics that have driven the field. By synthesizing task-level insights with a deep dive into shared architectural patterns, we aim to illuminate current achievements and chart promising directions for future research in spatio-temporal vision-language understanding for remote sensing. We will keep tracing related works at https://github.com/Chen-Yang-Liu/Awesome-RS-SpatioTemporal-VLMs</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Spatio-Temporal Vessel Behavior using AIS Trajectory Data and Markovian Models in the Gulf of St. Lawrence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00025v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Maritime Mobility is at the center of the global economy, and analyzing and understanding such data at scale is critical for ocean conservation and governance. Accordingly, this work introduces a spatio-temporal analytical framework based on discrete-time Markov chains to analyze vessel movement patterns in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, emphasizing changes induced during the COVID-19 pandemic. We discretize the ocean space into hexagonal cells and construct mobility signatures for individual vessel types using the frequency of cell transitions and the dwell time within each cell. These features are used to build origin-destination matrices and spatial transition probability models that characterize vessel dynamics at different temporal resolutions. Under multiple vessel types, we contribute with a temporal evolution analysis of mobility patterns during pandemic times, highlighting significant but transient changes to recurring transportation behaviors. Our findings indicate vessel-specific mobility signatures consistent across spatially disjoint regions, suggesting that those are latent behavioral invariants. Besides, we observe significant temporal deviations among passenger and fishing vessels during the pandemic, indicating a strong influence of social isolation policies and operational limitations imposed on non-essential maritime activity in this region.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semi-decentralized Training of Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks for Traffic Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03188v2)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In smart mobility, large networks of geographically distributed sensors produce vast amounts of high-frequency spatio-temporal data that must be processed in real time to avoid major disruptions. Traditional centralized approaches are increasingly unsuitable to this task, as they struggle to scale with expanding sensor networks, and reliability issues in central components can easily affect the whole deployment. To address these challenges, we explore and adapt semi-decentralized training techniques for Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (ST-GNNs) in smart mobility domain. We implement a simulation framework where sensors are grouped by proximity into multiple cloudlets, each handling a subgraph of the traffic graph, fetching node features from other cloudlets to train its own local ST-GNN model, and exchanging model updates with other cloudlets to ensure consistency, enhancing scalability and removing reliance on a centralized aggregator. We perform extensive comparative evaluation of four different ST-GNN training setups -- centralized, traditional FL, server-free FL, and Gossip Learning -- on large-scale traffic datasets, the METR-LA and PeMS-BAY datasets, for short-, mid-, and long-term vehicle speed predictions. Experimental results show that semi-decentralized setups are comparable to centralized approaches in performance metrics, while offering advantages in terms of scalability and fault tolerance. In addition, we highlight often overlooked issues in existing literature for distributed ST-GNNs, such as the variation in model performance across different geographical areas due to region-specific traffic patterns, and the significant communication overhead and computational costs that arise from the large receptive field of GNNs, leading to substantial data transfers and increased computation of partial embeddings.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables, conference</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Spatio-Temporal Signal Recognition on Edge Devices Using PointLCA-Net](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14585v3)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in machine learning, particularly through deep learning architectures like PointNet, have transformed the processing of three-dimensional (3D) point clouds, significantly improving 3D object classification and segmentation tasks. While 3D point clouds provide detailed spatial information, spatio-temporal signals introduce a dynamic element that accounts for changes over time. However, applying deep learning techniques to spatio-temporal signals and deploying them on edge devices presents challenges, including real-time processing, memory capacity, and power consumption. To address these issues, this paper presents a novel approach that combines PointNet's feature extraction with the in-memory computing capabilities and energy efficiency of neuromorphic systems for spatio-temporal signal recognition. The proposed method consists of a two-stage process: in the first stage, PointNet extracts features from the spatio-temporal signals, which are then stored in non-volatile memristor crossbar arrays. In the second stage, these features are processed by a single-layer spiking neural encoder-decoder that employs the Locally Competitive Algorithm (LCA) for efficient encoding and classification. This work integrates the strengths of both PointNet and LCA, enhancing computational efficiency and energy performance on edge devices. PointLCA-Net achieves high recognition accuracy for spatio-temporal data with substantially lower energy burden during both inference and training than comparable approaches, thus advancing the deployment of advanced neural architectures in energy-constrained environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to International Joint Conference on Neural Networks(IJCNN), 2015</p></details> |
| **[Learning Spatio-Temporal Dynamics for Trajectory Recovery via Time-Aware Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13857v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In real-world applications, GPS trajectories often suffer from low sampling rates, with large and irregular intervals between consecutive GPS points. This sparse characteristic presents challenges for their direct use in GPS-based systems. This paper addresses the task of map-constrained trajectory recovery, aiming to enhance trajectory sampling rates of GPS trajectories. Previous studies commonly adopt a sequence-to-sequence framework, where an encoder captures the trajectory patterns and a decoder reconstructs the target trajectory. Within this framework, effectively representing the road network and extracting relevant trajectory features are crucial for overall performance. Despite advancements in these models, they fail to fully leverage the complex spatio-temporal dynamics present in both the trajectory and the road network. To overcome these limitations, we categorize the spatio-temporal dynamics of trajectory data into two distinct aspects: spatial-temporal traffic dynamics and trajectory dynamics. Furthermore, We propose TedTrajRec, a novel method for trajectory recovery. To capture spatio-temporal traffic dynamics, we introduce PD-GNN, which models periodic patterns and learns topologically aware dynamics concurrently for each road segment. For spatio-temporal trajectory dynamics, we present TedFormer, a time-aware Transformer that incorporates temporal dynamics for each GPS location by integrating closed-form neural ordinary differential equations into the attention mechanism. This allows TedFormer to effectively handle irregularly sampled data. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of TedTrajRec. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/ysygMhdxw/TEDTrajRec/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a journal paper in IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems (T-ITS)</p></details> |

Exploring a Differentiable Sparse Soft-Vector Quantization Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03406v4)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal forecasting is crucial in various fields and requires a careful balance between identifying subtle patterns and filtering out noise. Vector quantization (VQ) appears well-suited for this purpose, as it quantizes input vectors into a set of codebook vectors or patterns. Although VQ has shown promise in various computer vision tasks, it surprisingly falls short in enhancing the accuracy of spatio-temporal forecasting. We attribute this to two main issues: inaccurate optimization due to non-differentiability and limited representation power in hard-VQ. To tackle these challenges, we introduce Differentiable Sparse Soft-Vector Quantization (SVQ), the first VQ method to enhance spatio-temporal forecasting. SVQ balances detail preservation with noise reduction, offering full differentiability and a solid foundation in sparse regression. Our approach employs a two-layer MLP and an extensive codebook to streamline the sparse regression process, significantly cutting computational costs while simplifying training and improving performance. Empirical studies on five spatio-temporal benchmark datasets show SVQ achieves state-of-the-art results, including a 7.9% improvement on the WeatherBench-S temperature dataset and an average mean absolute error reduction of 9.4% in video prediction benchmarks (Human3.6M, KTH, and KittiCaltech), along with a 17.3% enhancement in image quality (LPIPS).

| **[AFCL: Analytic Federated Continual Learning for Spatio-Temporal Invariance of Non-IID Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12245v1)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Continual Learning (FCL) enables distributed clients to collaboratively train a global model from online task streams in dynamic real-world scenarios. However, existing FCL methods face challenges of both spatial data heterogeneity among distributed clients and temporal data heterogeneity across online tasks. Such data heterogeneity significantly degrades the model performance with severe spatial-temporal catastrophic forgetting of local and past knowledge. In this paper, we identify that the root cause of this issue lies in the inherent vulnerability and sensitivity of gradients to non-IID data. To fundamentally address this issue, we propose a gradient-free method, named Analytic Federated Continual Learning (AFCL), by deriving analytical (i.e., closed-form) solutions from frozen extracted features. In local training, our AFCL enables single-epoch learning with only a lightweight forward-propagation process for each client. In global aggregation, the server can recursively and efficiently update the global model with single-round aggregation. Theoretical analyses validate that our AFCL achieves spatio-temporal invariance of non-IID data. This ideal property implies that, regardless of how heterogeneous the data are distributed across local clients and online tasks, the aggregated model of our AFCL remains invariant and identical to that of centralized joint learning. Extensive experiments show the consistent superiority of our AFCL over state-of-the-art baselines across various benchmark datasets and settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Recent research on traffic forecasting has mainly focused on combining graph neural networks (GNNs) with other models. However, GNNs only consider short-range spatial information. In this study, we present a novel model termed LSTAN-GERPE (Lightweight Spatio-Temporal Attention Network with Graph Embedding and Rotational Position Encoding). This model leverages both Temporal and Spatial Attention mechanisms to effectively capture long-range traffic dynamics. Additionally, the optimal frequency for rotational position encoding is determined through a grid search approach in both the spatial and temporal attention mechanisms. This systematic optimization enables the model to effectively capture complex traffic patterns. The model also enhances feature representation by incorporating geographical location maps into the spatio-temporal embeddings. Without extensive feature engineering, the proposed method in this paper achieves advanced accuracy on the real-world traffic forecasting datasets PeMS04 and PeMS08.</p></details> |  |
| **[ListenNet: A Lightweight Spatio-Temporal Enhancement Nested Network for Auditory Attention Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10348v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Auditory attention detection (AAD) aims to identify the direction of the attended speaker in multi-speaker environments from brain signals, such as Electroencephalography (EEG) signals. However, existing EEG-based AAD methods overlook the spatio-temporal dependencies of EEG signals, limiting their decoding and generalization abilities. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Lightweight Spatio-Temporal Enhancement Nested Network (ListenNet) for AAD. The ListenNet has three key components: Spatio-temporal Dependency Encoder (STDE), Multi-scale Temporal Enhancement (MSTE), and Cross-Nested Attention (CNA). The STDE reconstructs dependencies between consecutive time windows across channels, improving the robustness of dynamic pattern extraction. The MSTE captures temporal features at multiple scales to represent both fine-grained and long-range temporal patterns. In addition, the CNA integrates hierarchical features more effectively through novel dynamic attention mechanisms to capture deep spatio-temporal correlations. Experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate the superiority of ListenNet over state-of-the-art methods in both subject-dependent and challenging subject-independent settings, while reducing the trainable parameter count by approximately 7 times.

In the human language system, experimental studies have observed clusters for syntactic and semantic categories, but the mechanisms underlying this functional organization remain unclear. Here, building on work from the vision literature, we develop TopoLM, a transformer language model with an explicit two-dimensional spatial representation of model units. By combining a next-token prediction objective with a spatial smoothness loss, representations in this model assemble into clusters that correspond to semantically interpretable groupings of text and closely match the functional organization in the brain's language system. TopoLM successfully predicts the emergence of the spatio-functional organization of a cortical language system as well as the organization of functional clusters selective for fine-grained linguistic features empirically observed in human cortex. Our results suggest that the functional organization of the human language system is driven by a unified spatial objective, and provide a functionally and spatially aligned model of language processing in the brain.</p></details> |  |

In this regard, covariance properties with respect to geometric image transformations in the earliest layers of the visual hierarchy are essential for expressing robust image operations, and for formulating invariant visual operations at higher levels. This paper defines and proves a set of joint covariance properties for spatio-temporal receptive fields in terms of spatio-temporal derivative operators applied to spatio-temporally smoothed image data under compositions of spatial scaling transformations, spatial affine transformations, Galilean transformations and temporal scaling transformations. Specifically, the derived relations show how the parameters of the receptive fields need to be transformed, in order to match the output from spatio-temporal receptive fields under composed spatio-temporal image transformations. For this purpose, we also fundamentally extend the notion of scale-normalized derivatives to affine-normalized derivatives, that are computed based on spatial smoothing with affine Gaussian kernels, and analyze the covariance properties of the resulting affine-normalized derivatives for the affine group as well as for important subgroups thereof. We conclude with a geometric analysis, showing how the derived joint covariance properties make it possible to relate or match spatio-temporal receptive field responses, when observing, possibly moving, local surface patches from different views, under locally linearized perspective or projective transformations, as well as when observing different instances of spatio-temporal events, that may occur either faster or slower between different views of similar spatio-temporal events.</p></details> | <details><summary>46 pa...</summary><p>46 pages, 19 figures.

However, when operated in the high-recall, low-precision regime required for exhaustive event coverage in soccer analytics, their lack of contextual understanding becomes apparent: many false positives could be resolved by considering a broader sequence of actions and game-state information. In this work, we address this limitation by reasoning at the game level and improving STAD through the addition of a denoising sequence transduction task. Sequences of noisy, context-free player-centric predictions are processed alongside clean game state information using a Transformer-based encoder-decoder model. By modeling extended temporal context and reasoning jointly over team-level dynamics, our method leverages the "language of soccer" - its tactical regularities and inter-player dependencies - to generate "denoised" sequences of actions. This approach improves both precision and recall in low-confidence regimes, enabling more reliable event extraction from broadcast video and complementing existing pixel-based methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, submitted to Advanced Concepts for Intelligent Vision Systems 2025</p></details> |

OFOS platforms offer dynamic allocation incentives to users and merchants through diverse marketing campaigns to encourage payments while maintaining the platforms' budget efficiency. Despite significant progress, the marketing domain continues to face two primary challenges: (i) how to allocate a limited budget with greater efficiency, demanding precision in predicting users' monotonic response (i.e. sensitivity) to incentives, and (ii) ensuring spatio-temporal adaptability and robustness in diverse marketing campaigns across different times and locations. To address these issues, we propose a Constrained Monotonic Adaptive Network (CoMAN) method for spatio-temporal perception within marketing pricing. Specifically, we capture spatio-temporal preferences within attribute features through two foundational spatio-temporal perception modules. To further enhance catching the user sensitivity differentials to incentives across varied times and locations, we design modules for learning spatio-temporal convexity and concavity as well as for expressing sensitivity functions. CoMAN can achieve a more efficient allocation of incentive investments during pricing, thus increasing the conversion rate and orders while maintaining budget efficiency. Extensive offline and online experimental results within our diverse marketing campaigns demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach while outperforming the monotonic state-of-the-art method.</p></details> | 12 pages |
| **[USTEP: Spatio-Temporal Predictive Learning under A Unified View](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05829v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal predictive learning plays a crucial role in self-supervised learning, with wide-ranging applications across a diverse range of fields. Previous approaches for temporal modeling fall into two categories: recurrent-based and recurrent-free methods. The former, while meticulously processing frames one by one, neglect short-term spatio-temporal information redundancies, leading to inefficiencies. The latter naively stack frames sequentially, overlooking the inherent temporal dependencies. In this paper, we re-examine the two dominant temporal modeling approaches within the realm of spatio-temporal predictive learning, offering a unified perspective. Building upon this analysis, we introduce USTEP (Unified Spatio-TEmporal Predictive learning), an innovative framework that reconciles the recurrent-based and recurrent-free methods by integrating both micro-temporal and macro-temporal scales. Extensive experiments on a wide range of spatio-temporal predictive learning demonstrate that USTEP achieves significant improvements over existing temporal modeling approaches, thereby establishing it as a robust solution for a wide range of spatio-temporal applications.</p></details> | Accepted by TPAMI |

However, most existing learning-based methods for event-based optical flow adopt frame-based techniques, ignoring the spatio-temporal characteristics of events. Additionally, these methods assume linear motion between consecutive events within the loss time window, which increases optical flow errors in long-time sequences. In this work, we observe that rich spatio-temporal information and accurate nonlinear motion between events are crucial for event-based optical flow estimation. Therefore, we propose E-NMSTFlow, a novel unsupervised event-based optical flow network focusing on long-time sequences. We propose a Spatio-Temporal Motion Feature Aware (STMFA) module and an Adaptive Motion Feature Enhancement (AMFE) module, both of which utilize rich spatio-temporal information to learn spatio-temporal data associations. Meanwhile, we propose a nonlinear motion compensation loss that utilizes the accurate nonlinear motion between events to improve the unsupervised learning of our network. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method. Remarkably, our method ranks first among unsupervised learning methods on the MVSEC and DSEC-Flow datasets.

This examination is intended to offer to the reader a comprehensive collection of proposed models, links to related source code, available datasets, benchmark models, and fitting results. All this information is hoped to assist researchers in future studies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic literature review presenting a detailed comparison of the results of current spatio-temporal GNN models in different domains. In addition, in its final part this review discusses current limitations and challenges in the application of spatio-temporal GNNs, such as comparability, reproducibility, explainability, poor information capacity, and scalability.</p></details> |  |

Existing diffusion models are adept at creating images from text or image prompts, yet they often fall short in real-time interaction. This limitation becomes particularly evident in scenarios involving continuous input, such as Metaverse, live video streaming, and broadcasting, where high throughput is imperative. To address this, we present a novel approach that transforms the original sequential denoising into the batching denoising process. Stream Batch eliminates the conventional wait-and-interact approach and enables fluid and high throughput streams. To handle the frequency disparity between data input and model throughput, we design a novel input-output queue for parallelizing the streaming process. Moreover, the existing diffusion pipeline uses classifier-free guidance(CFG), which requires additional U-Net computation. To mitigate the redundant computations, we propose a novel residual classifier-free guidance (RCFG) algorithm that reduces the number of negative conditional denoising steps to only one or even zero. Besides, we introduce a stochastic similarity filter(SSF) to optimize power consumption. Our Stream Batch achieves around 1.5x speedup compared to the sequential denoising method at different denoising levels. The proposed RCFG leads to speeds up to 2.05x higher than the conventional CFG. Combining the proposed strategies and existing mature acceleration tools makes the image-to-image generation achieve up-to 91.07fps on one RTX4090, improving the throughputs of AutoPipline developed by Diffusers over 59.56x. Furthermore, our proposed StreamDiffusion also significantly reduces the energy consumption by 2.39x on one RTX3060 and 1.99x on one RTX4090, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>tech ...</summary><p>tech report, the code is available at https://github.com/cumulo-autumn/StreamDiffusion</p></details> |

Effective performance in this domain requires coordinating a multi-robot inspection team to prioritize inspecting locations more likely to need immediate response, while also minimizing travel time. This is particularly challenging because robots must directly observe the locations to determine which ones require additional attention. This work introduces a multi-robot planning framework for coordinated time-critical multi-robot search under uncertainty. Our approach uses a graph neural network to estimate the likelihood of PoIs needing attention from noisy sensor data and then uses those predictions to guide a multi-robot model-based planner to determine the cost-effective plan. Simulated experiments demonstrate that our planner improves performance at least by 16.3\%, 26.7\%, and 26.2\% for 1, 3, and 5 robots, respectively, compared to non-learned and learned baselines. We also validate our approach on real-world platforms using quad-copters.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 6 figures, CASE 2025</p></details> |

But these efforts can be undone by compilers, whose optimizations may silently reintroduce leaks. While recent works have measured the extent of such leakage, they leave developers without actionable insights: which optimization passes are responsible, and how to disable them without modifying the compiler remains unclear. In this paper, we conduct a qualitative analysis of how compiler optimizations break constant-time code. We construct a dataset of compiler-introduced constant-time violations and analyze the internals of two widely used compilers, GCC and LLVM, to identify the specific optimization passes responsible. Our key insight is that a small set of passes are at the root of most leaks. To the best of our knowledge, we are also the first to characterize how the interactions between these passes contribute to leakage. Based on this analysis, we propose an original and practical mitigation that requires no source code modification or custom compiler: disabling selected optimization passes via compiler flags. We show that this approach significantly reduces leakage with minimal performance overhead, offering an immediately deployable defense for developers.</p></details> | 11 pages |

In this paper, we propose an efficient FL approach that capitalizes on additional downlink bandwidth resources to ensure timely update dissemination. Initially, we implement this strategy within an asynchronous framework, introducing the Asynchronous Staleness-aware Model Update (FedASMU), which integrates both server-side and device-side methodologies. On the server side, we present an asynchronous FL system model that employs a dynamic model aggregation technique, which harmonizes local model updates with the global model to enhance both accuracy and efficiency. Concurrently, on the device side, we propose an adaptive model adjustment mechanism that integrates the latest global model with local models during training to further elevate accuracy. Subsequently, we extend this approach to a synchronous context, referred to as FedSSMU. Theoretical analyses substantiate the convergence of our proposed methodologies. Extensive experiments, encompassing six models and five public datasets, demonstrate that FedASMU and FedSSMU significantly surpass baseline methods in terms of both accuracy (up to 145.87%) and efficiency (up to 97.59%).</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, to appear in Knowledge and Information Systems (KAIS)</p></details> |

| **[Bridging Sequential Deep Operator Network and Video Diffusion: Residual Refinement of Spatio-Temporal PDE Solutions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06133v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video-diffusion models have recently set the standard in video generation, inpainting, and domain translation thanks to their training stability and high perceptual fidelity. Building on these strengths, we repurpose conditional video diffusion as a physics surrogate for spatio-temporal fields governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). Our two-stage surrogate first applies a Sequential Deep Operator Network (S-DeepONet) to produce a coarse, physics-consistent prior from the prescribed boundary or loading conditions. The prior is then passed to a conditional video diffusion model that learns only the residual: the point-wise difference between the ground truth and the S-DeepONet prediction. By shifting the learning burden from the full solution to its much smaller residual space, diffusion can focus on sharpening high-frequency structures without sacrificing global coherence. The framework is assessed on two disparate benchmarks: (i) vortex-dominated lid-driven cavity flow and (ii) tensile plastic deformation of dogbone specimens. Across these data sets the hybrid surrogate consistently outperforms its single-stage counterpart, cutting the mean relative L2 error from 4.57% to 0.83% for the flow problem and from 4.42% to 2.94% for plasticity, a relative improvements of 81.8% and 33.5% respectively. The hybrid approach not only lowers quantitative errors but also improves visual quality, visibly recovering fine spatial details. These results show that (i) conditioning diffusion on a physics-aware prior enables faithful reconstruction of localized features, (ii) residual learning reduces the problem, accelerating convergence and enhancing accuracy, and (iii) the same architecture transfers seamlessly from incompressible flow to nonlinear elasto-plasticity without problem-specific architectural modifications, highlighting its broad applicability to nonlinear, time-dependent continua.</p></details> |  |
| **[DRAN: A Distribution and Relation Adaptive Network for Spatio-temporal Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01531v2)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate predictions of spatio-temporal systems are crucial for tasks such as system management, control, and crisis prevention. However, the inherent time variance of many spatio-temporal systems poses challenges to achieving accurate predictions whenever stationarity is not granted. In order to address non-stationarity, we propose a Distribution and Relation Adaptive Network (DRAN) capable of dynamically adapting to relation and distribution changes over time. While temporal normalization and de-normalization are frequently used techniques to adapt to distribution shifts, this operation is not suitable for the spatio-temporal context as temporal normalization scales the time series of nodes and possibly disrupts the spatial relations among nodes. In order to address this problem, a Spatial Factor Learner (SFL) module is developed that enables the normalization and de-normalization process. To adapt to dynamic changes in spatial relationships among sensors, we propose a Dynamic-Static Fusion Learner (DSFL) module that effectively integrates features learned from both dynamic and static relations through an adaptive fusion ratio mechanism. Furthermore, we introduce a Stochastic Learner to capture the noisy components of spatio-temporal representations. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on weather prediction and traffic flow forecasting tasks.Experimental results show that our SFL efficiently preserves spatial relationships across various temporal normalization operations. Visualizations of the learned dynamic and static relations demonstrate that DSFL can capture both local and distant relationships between nodes.</p></details> | 15 pages, 10 figures |

Still, their reliance on floating-point computations leads to high energy consumption, limiting their applicability in battery-powered devices. While energy-efficient, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) struggle to model skeleton dynamics, leading to suboptimal solutions. We propose Signal-SGN (Spiking Graph Convolutional Network), which utilizes the temporal dimension of skeleton sequences as the spike time steps and represents features as multi-dimensional discrete stochastic signals for temporal-frequency domain feature extraction. It combines the 1D Spiking Graph Convolution (1D-SGC) module and the Frequency Spiking Convolution (FSC) module to extract features from the skeleton represented as spiking form. Additionally, the Multi-Scale Wavelet Transform Feature Fusion (MWTF) module is proposed to extract dynamic spiking features and capture frequency-specific characteristics, enhancing classification performance. Experiments across three large-scale datasets reveal Signal-SGN exceeding state-of-the-art SNN-based methods in accuracy and computational efficiency while attaining comparable performance with GCN methods and significantly reducing theoretical energy consumption.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Generalization of Spiking Neural Networks Through Temporal Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19256v2)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have received widespread attention due to their event-driven and low-power characteristics, making them particularly effective for processing event-based neuromorphic data. Recent studies have shown that directly trained SNNs suffer from severe overfitting issues due to the limited scale of neuromorphic datasets and the gradient mismatching problem, which fundamentally constrain their generalization performance. In this paper, we propose a temporal regularization training (TRT) method by introducing a time-dependent regularization mechanism to enforce stronger constraints on early timesteps. We compare the performance of TRT with other state-of-the-art methods performance on datasets including CIFAR10/100, ImageNet100, DVS-CIFAR10, and N-Caltech101. To validate the effectiveness of TRT, we conducted ablation studies and analyses including loss landscape visualization and learning curve analysis, demonstrating that TRT can effectively mitigate overfitting and flatten the training loss landscape, thereby enhancing generalizability. Furthermore, we establish a theoretical interpretation of TRT's temporal regularization mechanism based on the results of Fisher information analysis. We analyze the temporal information dynamics inside SNNs by tracking Fisher information during the TRT training process, revealing the Temporal Information Concentration (TIC) phenomenon, where Fisher information progressively concentrates in early timesteps. The time-decaying regularization mechanism implemented in TRT effectively guides the network to learn robust features in early timesteps with rich information, thereby leading to significant improvements in model generalization.

| **[Parameterized Restless Temporal Path](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05760v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Bumpus and Meeks introduced a purely temporal parameter, called vertex-interval-membership-width, which is promising for the design of fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) algorithms for vertex reachability problems in temporal graphs. We study this newly introduced parameter for the problem of restless temporal paths, in which the waiting time at each node is restricted. In this article, we prove that, in the interval model, where arcs are present for entire time intervals, finding a restless temporal path is NP-hard even if the vertex-interval-membership-width is equal to three. We exhibit FPT algorithms for the point model, where arcs are present at specific points in time, both with uniform delay one and arbitrary positive delays. In the latter case, this comes with a slight additional computational cost.</p></details> |  |

Although vanilla Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) can learn specific spatial or temporal movement to driven VDMs with constrained data, achieving precise control over both camera trajectories and object motion remains challenging due to the unstable fusion and non-linear scalability. To address these issues, we propose LiON-LoRA, a novel framework that rethinks LoRA fusion through three core principles: Linear scalability, Orthogonality, and Norm consistency. First, we analyze the orthogonality of LoRA features in shallow VDM layers, enabling decoupled low-level controllability. Second, norm consistency is enforced across layers to stabilize fusion during complex camera motion combinations. Third, a controllable token is integrated into the diffusion transformer (DiT) to linearly adjust motion amplitudes for both cameras and objects with a modified self-attention mechanism to ensure decoupled control. Additionally, we extend LiON-LoRA to temporal generation by leveraging static-camera videos, unifying spatial and temporal controllability. Experiments demonstrate that LiON-LoRA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in trajectory control accuracy and motion strength adjustment, achieving superior generalization with minimal training data.

| **[Distributionally Robust Predictive Runtime Verification under Spatio-Temporal Logic Specifications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02964v2)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cyber-physical systems (CPS) designed in simulators, often consisting of multiple interacting agents (e.g. in multi-agent formations), behave differently in the real-world. We want to verify these systems during runtime when they are deployed. We thus propose robust predictive runtime verification (RPRV) algorithms for: (1) general stochastic CPS under signal temporal logic (STL) tasks, and (2) stochastic multi-agent systems (MAS) under spatio-temporal logic tasks. The RPRV problem presents the following challenges: (1) there may not be sufficient data on the behavior of the deployed CPS, (2) predictive models based on design phase system trajectories may encounter distribution shift during real-world deployment, and (3) the algorithms need to scale to the complexity of MAS and be applicable to spatio-temporal logic tasks. To address the challenges, we assume knowledge of an upper bound on the statistical distance between the trajectory distributions of the system at deployment and design time. We are motivated by our prior work [1, 2] where we proposed an accurate and an interpretable RPRV algorithm for general CPS, which we here extend to the MAS setting and spatio-temporal logic tasks. Specifically, we use a learned predictive model to estimate the system behavior at runtime and robust conformal prediction to obtain probabilistic guarantees by accounting for distribution shifts. Building on [1], we perform robust conformal prediction over the robust semantics of spatio-temporal reach and escape logic (STREL) to obtain centralized RPRV algorithms for MAS. We empirically validate our results in a drone swarm simulator, where we show the scalability of our RPRV algorithms to MAS and analyze the impact of different trajectory predictors on the verification result. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first statistically valid algorithms for MAS under distribution shift.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2311.09482</p></details> |

TCP integrates quantile regression with a conformal calibration layer that adapts online via a decaying learning rate. This hybrid design bridges statistical and machine learning paradigms, enabling TCP to accommodate non-stationarity, volatility clustering, and regime shifts which are hallmarks of real-world asset returns, without relying on rigid parametric assumptions. We benchmark TCP against established methods including GARCH, Historical Simulation, and static Quantile Regression across equities (S&P 500), cryptocurrency (Bitcoin), and commodities (Gold). Empirical results show that TCP consistently delivers sharper intervals with competitive or superior coverage, particularly in high-volatility regimes. Our study underscores TCP's strength in navigating the coverage-sharpness tradeoff, a central challenge in modern risk forecasting. Overall, TCP offers a distribution-free, adaptive, and interpretable alternative for financial uncertainty quantification, advancing the interface between statistical inference and machine learning in finance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal LLM: Reasoning about Environments and Actions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05258v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the significant recent progress of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), MLLMs still struggle to correctly answer prompts that require a holistic spatio-temporal understanding. Specifically, it is challenging to address prompts that refer to 1) the entirety of an environment that an agent equipped with an MLLM can operate in; and simultaneously also refer to 2) recent actions that just happened and are encoded in a video clip. However, such a holistic spatio-temporal understanding is important for agents operating in the real world. To address this issue, we first develop a framework to collect a large-scale dataset. Using the collected "Reasoning about Environments and Actions" (REA) dataset, we show that recent methods indeed struggle to correctly answer the prompts. To improve, we develop a "spatio-temporal LLM" (ST-LLM), a model equipped with projectors to improve both spatial understanding of an environment and temporal understanding of recent observations. On the collected REA data, we show that the proposed method significantly improves results compared to prior work.

Existing methods often prioritize the development of intricate neural networks to capture the complex dependencies of the data. These methods neglect node-level heterogeneity and face over-parameterization when attempting to model node-specific characteristics. In this paper, we present a novel low-rank adaptation framework for existing spatio-temporal prediction models, termed \model, which alleviates the aforementioned problems through node-level adjustments. Specifically, we introduce the node-adaptive low-rank layer and node-specific predictor, capturing the complex functional characteristics of nodes while maintaining computational efficiency. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that our method consistently achieves superior performance across various forecasting models with minimal computational overhead, improving performance by 7% with only 1% additional parameter cost.

| **[Can Local Representation Alignment RNNs Solve Temporal Tasks?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13531v2)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are commonly used for real-time processing, streaming data, and cases where the amount of training samples is limited. Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) is the predominant algorithm for training RNNs; however, it is frequently criticized for being prone to exploding and vanishing gradients and being biologically implausible. In this paper, we present and evaluate a target propagation-based method for RNNs, which uses local updates and seeks to reduce the said instabilities. Having stable RNN models increases their practical use in a wide range of fields such as natural language processing, time-series forecasting, anomaly detection, control systems, and robotics. The proposed solution uses local representation alignment (LRA). We thoroughly analyze the performance of this method, experiment with normalization and different local error functions, and invalidate certain assumptions about the behavior of this type of learning. Namely, we demonstrate that despite the decomposition of the network into sub-graphs, the model still suffers from vanishing gradients. We also show that gradient clipping as proposed in LRA has little to no effect on network performance. This results in an LRA RNN model that is very difficult to train due to vanishing gradients. We address this by introducing gradient regularization in the direction of the update and demonstrate that this modification promotes gradient flow and meaningfully impacts convergence. We compare and discuss the performance of the algorithm, and we show that the regularized LRA RNN considerably outperforms the unregularized version on three landmark tasks: temporal order, 3-bit temporal order, and random permutation.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the version of the paper presented at ICCSM 2025 (July 2025 in Rome, Italy).

| **[Role of scrambling and noise in temporal information processing with quantum systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10080v2)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scrambling quantum systems have attracted attention as effective substrates for temporal information processing. Here we consider a quantum reservoir processing framework that captures a broad range of physical computing models with quantum systems. We examine the scalability and memory retention of the model with scrambling reservoirs modelled by high-order unitary designs in both noiseless and noisy settings. In the former regime, we show that measurement readouts become exponentially concentrated with increasing reservoir size, yet strikingly do not worsen with the reservoir iterations. Thus, while repeatedly reusing a small scrambling reservoir with quantum data might be viable, scaling up the problem size deteriorates generalization unless one can afford an exponential shot overhead. In contrast, the memory of early inputs and initial states decays exponentially in both reservoir size and reservoir iterations. In the noisy regime, we also prove that memory decays exponentially in time for local noisy channels. These results required us to introduce new proof techniques for bounding concentration in temporal quantum models.</p></details> | <details><summary>11+41...</summary><p>11+41 pages, 6+6 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[TLB-VFI: Temporal-Aware Latent Brownian Bridge Diffusion for Video Frame Interpolation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04984v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) aims to predict the intermediate frame $I_n$ (we use n to denote time in videos to avoid notation overload with the timestep $t$ in diffusion models) based on two consecutive neighboring frames $I_0$ and $I_1$. Recent approaches apply diffusion models (both image-based and video-based) in this task and achieve strong performance. However, image-based diffusion models are unable to extract temporal information and are relatively inefficient compared to non-diffusion methods. Video-based diffusion models can extract temporal information, but they are too large in terms of training scale, model size, and inference time. To mitigate the above issues, we propose Temporal-Aware Latent Brownian Bridge Diffusion for Video Frame Interpolation (TLB-VFI), an efficient video-based diffusion model. By extracting rich temporal information from video inputs through our proposed 3D-wavelet gating and temporal-aware autoencoder, our method achieves 20% improvement in FID on the most challenging datasets over recent SOTA of image-based diffusion models. Meanwhile, due to the existence of rich temporal information, our method achieves strong performance while having 3times fewer parameters. Such a parameter reduction results in 2.3x speed up. By incorporating optical flow guidance, our method requires 9000x less training data and achieves over 20x fewer parameters than video-based diffusion models.

| **[Boosting Temporal Sentence Grounding via Causal Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04958v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal Sentence Grounding (TSG) aims to identify relevant moments in an untrimmed video that semantically correspond to a given textual query. Despite existing studies having made substantial progress, they often overlook the issue of spurious correlations between video and textual queries. These spurious correlations arise from two primary factors: (1) inherent biases in the textual data, such as frequent co-occurrences of specific verbs or phrases, and (2) the model's tendency to overfit to salient or repetitive patterns in video content. Such biases mislead the model into associating textual cues with incorrect visual moments, resulting in unreliable predictions and poor generalization to out-of-distribution examples. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel TSG framework, causal intervention and counterfactual reasoning that utilizes causal inference to eliminate spurious correlations and enhance the model's robustness. Specifically, we first formulate the TSG task from a causal perspective with a structural causal model. Then, to address unobserved confounders reflecting textual biases toward specific verbs or phrases, a textual causal intervention is proposed, utilizing do-calculus to estimate the causal effects. Furthermore, visual counterfactual reasoning is performed by constructing a counterfactual scenario that focuses solely on video features, excluding the query and fused multi-modal features. This allows us to debias the model by isolating and removing the influence of the video from the overall effect. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.

| **[Training-free Generation of Temporally Consistent Rewards from VLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04789v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have significantly improved performance in embodied tasks such as goal decomposition and visual comprehension. However, providing accurate rewards for robotic manipulation without fine-tuning VLMs remains challenging due to the absence of domain-specific robotic knowledge in pre-trained datasets and high computational costs that hinder real-time applicability. To address this, we propose $\mathrm{T}^2$-VLM, a novel training-free, temporally consistent framework that generates accurate rewards through tracking the status changes in VLM-derived subgoals. Specifically, our method first queries the VLM to establish spatially aware subgoals and an initial completion estimate before each round of interaction. We then employ a Bayesian tracking algorithm to update the goal completion status dynamically, using subgoal hidden states to generate structured rewards for reinforcement learning (RL) agents. This approach enhances long-horizon decision-making and improves failure recovery capabilities with RL. Extensive experiments indicate that $\mathrm{T}^2$-VLM achieves state-of-the-art performance in two robot manipulation benchmarks, demonstrating superior reward accuracy with reduced computation consumption. We believe our approach not only advances reward generation techniques but also contributes to the broader field of embodied AI. Project website: https://t2-vlm.github.io/.</p></details> |  |
| **[Identity-Preserving Text-to-Video Generation Guided by Simple yet Effective Spatial-Temporal Decoupled Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04705v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identity-preserving text-to-video (IPT2V) generation, which aims to create high-fidelity videos with consistent human identity, has become crucial for downstream applications. However, current end-to-end frameworks suffer a critical spatial-temporal trade-off: optimizing for spatially coherent layouts of key elements (e.g., character identity preservation) often compromises instruction-compliant temporal smoothness, while prioritizing dynamic realism risks disrupting the spatial coherence of visual structures. To tackle this issue, we propose a simple yet effective spatial-temporal decoupled framework that decomposes representations into spatial features for layouts and temporal features for motion dynamics. Specifically, our paper proposes a semantic prompt optimization mechanism and stage-wise decoupled generation paradigm. The former module decouples the prompt into spatial and temporal components. Aligned with the subsequent stage-wise decoupled approach, the spatial prompts guide the text-to-image (T2I) stage to generate coherent spatial features, while the temporal prompts direct the sequential image-to-video (I2V) stage to ensure motion consistency. Experimental results validate that our approach achieves excellent spatiotemporal consistency, demonstrating outstanding performance in identity preservation, text relevance, and video quality. By leveraging this simple yet robust mechanism, our algorithm secures the runner-up position in 2025 ACM MultiMedia Challenge.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tempo-R0: A Video-MLLM for Temporal Video Grounding through Efficient Temporal Sensing Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04702v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal Video Grounding (TVG), which requires pinpointing relevant temporal segments from video based on language query, has always been a highly challenging task in the field of video understanding. Videos often have a larger volume of information and redundancy than texts or images. Models should present comprehensive understanding of the whole video to accurately retrieve query-relevant clips. We thus propose Tempo-R0: a Video Multimodal Large Language Model (Video-MLLM) for the temporal video grounding task via multimodal temporal sensing reinforcement. Specifically, during the preprocessing stage of our pipeline, we employ Self-adaptive Attention Allocation (SAA) method based on frame content variation to efficiently use the MLLM's limited attention. The Explicit Timestamp-modal Aligned (ETA) method is also utilized to strengthen our model's capability to perceive the boundaries of events in the video. In the fine-tuning part of our pipeline, we creatively apply Partial Irrelevance Refusing-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (PIR-GRPO) in TVG area to foster model's temporal reasoning from not only accepting relevant video-query pairs but also refusing irrelevant ones. Experiments demonstrate that our method accomplishes a notable advantage over SOTA solutions by around 3.5% on both the original QVHighlights testbench and its corrected version with more reasonable ground truth annotations.</p></details> |  |

Accurate pedestrian trajectory prediction benefits autonomous vehicles and robots in planning their motion. Pedestrians' trajectories are greatly influenced by their intentions. Prior studies having introduced various deep learning methods only pay attention to the spatial and temporal information of trajectory, overlooking the explicit intention information. In this study, we introduce a novel model, termed the \textbf{S-T CRF}: \textbf{S}patial-\textbf{T}emporal \textbf{C}onditional \textbf{R}andom \textbf{F}ield, which judiciously incorporates intention information besides spatial and temporal information of trajectory. This model uses a Conditional Random Field (CRF) to generate a representation of future intentions, greatly improving the prediction of subsequent trajectories when combined with spatial-temporal representation. Furthermore, the study innovatively devises a space CRF loss and a time CRF loss, meticulously designed to enhance interaction constraints and temporal dynamics, respectively. Extensive experimental evaluations on dataset ETH/UCY and SDD demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses existing baseline approaches.</p></details> |  |

Following the simplified linear-motion hypothesis, existing approaches adopt optical flow-based models to interpolate intermediate frames. However, realistic respiratory motions should be nonlinear and quasi-periodic with specific frequencies. Intuited by this property, we resolve the temporal interpolation task from the frequency perspective, and propose a Fourier basis-guided Diffusion model, termed FB-Diff. Specifically, due to the regular motion discipline of respiration, physiological motion priors are introduced to describe general characteristics of temporal data distributions. Then a Fourier motion operator is elaborately devised to extract Fourier bases by incorporating physiological motion priors and case-specific spectral information in the feature space of Variational Autoencoder. Well-learned Fourier bases can better simulate respiratory motions with motion patterns of specific frequencies. Conditioned on starting and ending frames, the diffusion model further leverages well-learned Fourier bases via the basis interaction operator, which promotes the temporal interpolation task in a generative manner. Extensive results demonstrate that FB-Diff achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) perceptual performance with better temporal consistency while maintaining promising reconstruction metrics.

Recent RSFMs including SatMAE, DoFA, primarily rely on masked autoencoding(MAE), contrastive learning or some combination of them. However, these pretext tasks often overlook the unique temporal characteristics of agricultural landscape, namely nature's cycle. Motivated by this gap, we propose three novel agriculture-specific pretext tasks, namely Time-Difference Prediction(TD), Temporal Frequency Prediction(FP), and Future-Frame Prediction(FF). Comprehensive evaluation on SICKLE dataset shows FF achieves 69.6% IoU on crop mapping and FP reduces yield prediction error to 30.7% MAPE, outperforming all baselines, and TD remains competitive on most tasks. Further, we also scale FF to the national scale of India, achieving 54.2% IoU outperforming all baselines on field boundary delineation on FTW India dataset.</p></details> |  |

However, the high computational complexity hinders its wide application on edge devices. Quantization has emerged as a promising technique for inference acceleration and memory reduction. However, existing quantization methods do not generalize well under extremely low-bit (2-4 bit) quantization. Directly applying these methods will cause severe performance degradation. We identify that the existing quantization framework suffers from the outlier-unfriendly quantizer design, suboptimal initialization, and optimization strategy. We present MPQ-DMv2, an improved \textbf{M}ixed \textbf{P}recision \textbf{Q}uantization framework for extremely low-bit \textbf{D}iffusion \textbf{M}odels. For the quantization perspective, the imbalanced distribution caused by salient outliers is quantization-unfriendly for uniform quantizer. We propose \textit{Flexible Z-Order Residual Mixed Quantization} that utilizes an efficient binary residual branch for flexible quant steps to handle salient error. For the optimization framework, we theoretically analyzed the convergence and optimality of the LoRA module and propose \textit{Object-Oriented Low-Rank Initialization} to use prior quantization error for informative initialization. We then propose \textit{Memory-based Temporal Relation Distillation} to construct an online time-aware pixel queue for long-term denoising temporal information distillation, which ensures the overall temporal consistency between quantized and full-precision model. Comprehensive experiments on various generation tasks show that our MPQ-DMv2 surpasses current SOTA methods by a great margin on different architectures, especially under extremely low-bit widths.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Continual Learning with Prior Compensation for Human Motion Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04060v1)** | 2025-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human Motion Prediction (HMP) aims to predict future poses at different moments according to past motion sequences. Previous approaches have treated the prediction of various moments equally, resulting in two main limitations: the learning of short-term predictions is hindered by the focus on long-term predictions, and the incorporation of prior information from past predictions into subsequent predictions is limited. In this paper, we introduce a novel multi-stage training framework called Temporal Continual Learning (TCL) to address the above challenges. To better preserve prior information, we introduce the Prior Compensation Factor (PCF). We incorporate it into the model training to compensate for the lost prior information. Furthermore, we derive a more reasonable optimization objective through theoretical derivation. It is important to note that our TCL framework can be easily integrated with different HMP backbone models and adapted to various datasets and applications. Extensive experiments on four HMP benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of TCL.

Current video-based approaches, while proficient in tracking, lack the sophisticated reasoning capabilities of large language models, limiting their contextual understanding and generalization. We introduce VideoMolmo, a large multimodal model tailored for fine-grained spatio-temporal pointing conditioned on textual descriptions. Building upon the Molmo architecture, VideoMolmo incorporates a temporal module utilizing an attention mechanism to condition each frame on preceding frames, ensuring temporal consistency. Additionally, our novel temporal mask fusion pipeline employs SAM2 for bidirectional point propagation, significantly enhancing coherence across video sequences. This two-step decomposition, i.e., first using the LLM to generate precise pointing coordinates, then relying on a sequential mask-fusion module to produce coherent segmentation, not only simplifies the task for the language model but also enhances interpretability. Due to the lack of suitable datasets, we curate a comprehensive dataset comprising 72k video-caption pairs annotated with 100k object points. To evaluate the generalization of VideoMolmo, we introduce VPoS-Bench, a challenging out-of-distribution benchmark spanning five real-world scenarios: Cell Tracking, Egocentric Vision, Autonomous Driving, Video-GUI Interaction, and Robotics. We also evaluate our model on Referring Video Object Segmentation (Refer-VOS) and Reasoning VOS tasks. In comparison to existing models, VideoMolmo substantially improves spatio-temporal pointing accuracy and reasoning capability. Our code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/mbzuai-oryx/VideoMolmo.</p></details> | 20 pages, 13 figures |

To address these challenges, we propose a novel probabilistic model of data-driven temporal propositional reasoning. Unlike conventional probabilistic models where data is a product of domain knowledge encoded in the probabilistic model, we explore the reverse direction where domain knowledge is a product of data encoded in the probabilistic model. This more data-driven perspective suggests no distinction between maximum likelihood parameter learning and temporal propositional reasoning. We show that our probabilistic model is equivalent to a highest-order, i.e., full-memory, Markov chain, and our model requires no distinction between hidden and observable variables. We discuss that limits provide a natural and mathematically rigorous way to handle data scarcity, including the zero-frequency problem. We also discuss that a probability distribution over data generated by our probabilistic model helps data transparency by revealing influential data used in predictions. The reproducibility of this theoretical work is fully demonstrated by the included proofs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Masked Temporal Interpolation Diffusion for Procedure Planning in Instructional Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03393v1)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we address the challenge of procedure planning in instructional videos, aiming to generate coherent and task-aligned action sequences from start and end visual observations. Previous work has mainly relied on text-level supervision to bridge the gap between observed states and unobserved actions, but it struggles with capturing intricate temporal relationships among actions. Building on these efforts, we propose the Masked Temporal Interpolation Diffusion (MTID) model that introduces a latent space temporal interpolation module within the diffusion model. This module leverages a learnable interpolation matrix to generate intermediate latent features, thereby augmenting visual supervision with richer mid-state details. By integrating this enriched supervision into the model, we enable end-to-end training tailored to task-specific requirements, significantly enhancing the model's capacity to predict temporally coherent action sequences. Additionally, we introduce an action-aware mask projection mechanism to restrict the action generation space, combined with a task-adaptive masked proximity loss to prioritize more accurate reasoning results close to the given start and end states over those in intermediate steps. Simultaneously, it filters out task-irrelevant action predictions, leading to contextually aware action sequences. Experimental results across three widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that our MTID achieves promising action planning performance on most metrics. The code is available at https://github.com/WiserZhou/MTID.</p></details> |  |
| **[LTLCrit: A Temporal Logic-based LLM Critic for Safe and Efficient Embodied Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03293v1)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promise in reasoning tasks and general decision-making in static environments. In long-term planning tasks, however, errors tend to accumulate, often leading to unsafe or inefficient behavior, limiting their use in general-purpose settings. We propose a modular actor-critic architecture in which an LLM actor is guided by LTLCrit, a trajectory-level LLM critic that communicates via linear temporal logic (LTL). Our setup combines the reasoning strengths of language models with the guarantees of formal logic. The actor selects high-level actions from natural language observations, while the critic analyzes full trajectories and proposes new LTL constraints that shield the actor from future unsafe or inefficient behavior. The architecture supports both fixed, hand-specified safety constraints and adaptive, learned soft constraints that promote long-term efficiency. Our architecture is model-agnostic: any LLM-based planner can serve as the actor, and LTLCrit serves as a logic-generating wrapper. We formalize planning as graph traversal under symbolic constraints, allowing LTLCrit to analyze failed or suboptimal trajectories and generate new temporal logic rules that improve future behavior. We evaluate our system on the Minecraft diamond-mining benchmark, achieving 100% completion rates and improving efficiency compared to baseline LLM planners. Our results suggest that enabling LLMs to supervise each other through logic is a powerful and flexible paradigm for safe, generalizable decision making.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing works in visual self-supervised learning focus on static images or artificial data streams. Towards exploring a more realistic learning substrate, we investigate streaming self-supervised learning from long-form real-world egocentric video streams. Inspired by the event segmentation mechanism in human perception and memory, we propose "Memory Storyboard" that groups recent past frames into temporal segments for more effective summarization of the past visual streams for memory replay. To accommodate efficient temporal segmentation, we propose a two-tier memory hierarchy: the recent past is stored in a short-term memory, and the storyboard temporal segments are then transferred to a long-term memory. Experiments on real-world egocentric video datasets including SAYCam and KrishnaCam show that contrastive learning objectives on top of storyboard frames result in semantically meaningful representations that outperform those produced by state-of-the-art unsupervised continual learning methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Fourt...</summary><p>Fourth Conference on Lifelong Learning Agents - CoLLAs 2025 (Oral)</p></details> |
| **[USAD: An Unsupervised Data Augmentation Spatio-Temporal Attention Diffusion Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02827v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The primary objective of human activity recognition (HAR) is to infer ongoing human actions from sensor data, a task that finds broad applications in health monitoring, safety protection, and sports analysis. Despite proliferating research, HAR still faces key challenges, including the scarcity of labeled samples for rare activities, insufficient extraction of high-level features, and suboptimal model performance on lightweight devices. To address these issues, this paper proposes a comprehensive optimization approach centered on multi-attention interaction mechanisms. First, an unsupervised, statistics-guided diffusion model is employed to perform data augmentation, thereby alleviating the problems of labeled data scarcity and severe class imbalance. Second, a multi-branch spatio-temporal interaction network is designed, which captures multi-scale features of sequential data through parallel residual branches with 3*3, 5*5, and 7*7 convolutional kernels. Simultaneously, temporal attention mechanisms are incorporated to identify critical time points, while spatial attention enhances inter-sensor interactions. A cross-branch feature fusion unit is further introduced to improve the overall feature representation capability. Finally, an adaptive multi-loss function fusion strategy is integrated, allowing for dynamic adjustment of loss weights and overall model optimization. Experimental results on three public datasets, WISDM, PAMAP2, and OPPORTUNITY, demonstrate that the proposed unsupervised data augmentation spatio-temporal attention diffusion network (USAD) achieves accuracies of 98.84%, 93.81%, and 80.92% respectively, significantly outperforming existing approaches. Furthermore, practical deployment on embedded devices verifies the efficiency and feasibility of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modality-agnostic, patient-specific digital twins modeling temporally varying digestive motion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01909v2)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Objective: Clinical implementation of deformable image registration (DIR) requires voxel-based spatial accuracy metrics such as manually identified landmarks, which are challenging to implement for highly mobile gastrointestinal (GI) organs. To address this, patient-specific digital twins (DT) modeling temporally varying motion were created to assess the accuracy of DIR methods. Approach: 21 motion phases simulating digestive GI motion as 4D sequences were generated from static 3D patient scans using published analytical GI motion models through a semi-automated pipeline. Eleven datasets, including six T2w FSE MRI (T2w MRI), two T1w 4D golden-angle stack-of-stars, and three contrast-enhanced CT scans. The motion amplitudes of the DTs were assessed against real patient stomach motion amplitudes extracted from independent 4D MRI datasets. The generated DTs were then used to assess six different DIR methods using target registration error, Dice similarity coefficient, and the 95th percentile Hausdorff distance using summary metrics and voxel-level granular visualizations. Finally, for a subset of T2w MRI scans from patients treated with MR-guided radiation therapy, dose distributions were warped and accumulated to assess dose warping errors, including evaluations of DIR performance in both low- and high-dose regions for patient-specific error estimation. Main results: Our proposed pipeline synthesized DTs modeling realistic GI motion, achieving mean and maximum motion amplitudes and a mean log Jacobian determinant within 0.8 mm and 0.01, respectively, similar to published real-patient gastric motion data. It also enables the extraction of detailed quantitative DIR performance metrics and rigorous validation of dose mapping accuracy. Significance: The pipeline enables rigorously testing DIR tools for dynamic, anatomically complex regions enabling granular spatial and dosimetric accuracies.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 Pag...</summary><p>7 Pages, 6 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

It can estimate spatially accurate and temporally consistent disparities without relying on auxiliary information such as camera poses or optical flow. The strong capability is driven by rich priors from monocular video depth models, which are integrated with convolutional features to produce stable representations. To further enhance performance, key architectural innovations are introduced: all-to-all-pairs correlation, which constructs smooth and robust matching cost volumes, and temporal convex upsampling, which improves temporal coherence. These components collectively ensure robustness, accuracy, and temporal consistency, setting a new standard in video stereo matching. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets both qualitatively and quantitatively in zero-shot settings, as well as strong generalization to real-world indoor and outdoor scenarios.</p></details> | Accepted at ICCV2025 |
| **[Counterfactual Tuning for Temporal Sensitivity Enhancement in Large Language Model-based Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03047v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances have applied large language models (LLMs) to sequential recommendation, leveraging their pre-training knowledge and reasoning capabilities to provide more personalized user experiences. However, existing LLM-based methods fail to sufficiently leverage the rich temporal information inherent in users' historical interaction sequences, stemming from fundamental architectural constraints: LLMs process information through self-attention mechanisms that lack inherent sequence ordering and rely on position embeddings designed primarily for natural language rather than user interaction sequences. This limitation significantly impairs their ability to capture the evolution of user preferences over time and predict future interests accurately. To address this critical gap, we propose Counterfactual Enhanced Temporal Framework for LLM-Based Recommendation (CETRec). CETRec is grounded in causal inference principles, which allow it to isolate and measure the specific impact of temporal information on recommendation outcomes. By conceptualizing temporal order as an independent causal factor distinct from item content, we can quantify its unique contribution through counterfactual reasoning--comparing what recommendations would be made with and without temporal information while keeping all other factors constant. This causal framing enables CETRec to design a novel counterfactual tuning objective that directly optimizes the model's temporal sensitivity, teaching LLMs to recognize both absolute timestamps and relative ordering patterns in user histories. Combined with our counterfactual tuning task derived from causal analysis, CETRec effectively enhances LLMs' awareness of both absolute order (how recently items were interacted with) and relative order (the sequential relationships between items).</p></details> |  |

Counting polyps in a procedure involves detecting and tracking polyps, and then clustering tracklets that belong to the same polyp entity. Existing methods for polyp counting rely on self-supervised learning and primarily leverage visual appearance, neglecting temporal relationships in both tracklet feature learning and clustering stages. In this work, we introduce a paradigm shift by proposing a supervised contrastive loss that incorporates temporally-aware soft targets. Our approach captures intra-polyp variability while preserving inter-polyp discriminability, leading to more robust clustering. Additionally, we improve tracklet clustering by integrating a temporal adjacency constraint, reducing false positive re-associations between visually similar but temporally distant tracklets. We train and validate our method on publicly available datasets and evaluate its performance with a leave-one-out cross-validation strategy. Results demonstrate a 2.2x reduction in fragmentation rate compared to prior approaches. Our results highlight the importance of temporal awareness in polyp counting, establishing a new state-of-the-art.

Traditional detectors represent temporal information merely by stacking spatial frequency spectra across frames, resulting in the failure to detect temporal artifacts in the pixel plane. Our approach performs a 1D Fourier transform on the time axis for each pixel, extracting features highly sensitive to temporal inconsistencies, especially in areas prone to unnatural movements. To precisely locate regions containing the temporal artifacts, we introduce an attention proposal module trained in an end-to-end manner. Additionally, our joint transformer module effectively integrates pixel-wise temporal frequency features with spatio-temporal context features, expanding the range of detectable forgery artifacts. Our framework represents a significant advancement in deepfake video detection, providing robust performance across diverse and challenging detection scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by iccv 2025. code is will be available at https://github.com/rama0126/PwTF-DVD</p></details> |

However, forecasting multivariate time series with Transformer presents a unique challenge as it requires modeling both temporal (cross-time) and variate (cross-variate) dependencies. While Transformer-based models have gained popularity for their flexibility in capturing both sequential and cross-variate relationships, it is unclear how to best integrate these two sources of information in the context of the Transformer architecture while optimizing for both performance and efficiency. We re-purpose the Transformer architecture to effectively model both cross-time and cross-variate dependencies. Our approach begins by embedding each variate independently into a variate-wise representation that captures its cross-time dynamics, and then models cross-variate dependencies through attention mechanisms on these learned embeddings. Gating operations in both cross-time and cross-variate modeling phases regulate information flow, allowing the model to focus on the most relevant features for accurate predictions. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across 13 real-world datasets and can be seamlessly integrated into other Transformer-based and LLM-based forecasters, delivering performance improvements up to 20.7\% over original models.

Koopman Autoencoders (KAEs) harness the expressivity of deep neural networks (DNNs), the dimension reduction capabilities of autoencoders, and the spectral properties of the Koopman operator to learn a reduced-order feature space with simpler, linear dynamics. However, the effectiveness of KAEs is hindered by limited and noisy training datasets, leading to poor generalizability. To address this, we introduce the temporally consistent Koopman autoencoder (tcKAE), designed to generate accurate long-term predictions even with limited and noisy training data. This is achieved through a consistency regularization term that enforces prediction coherence across different time steps, thus enhancing the robustness and generalizability of tcKAE over existing models. We provide analytical justification for this approach based on Koopman spectral theory and empirically demonstrate tcKAE's superior performance over state-of-the-art KAE models across a variety of test cases, including simple pendulum oscillations, kinetic plasma, and fluid flow data.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods predominantly focus on static graphs, neglecting the evolving nature of real-world graphs. Temporal dependencies in graph structure, node attributes, and ground truth labels violate the fundamental exchangeability assumption of standard conformal prediction methods, limiting their applicability. To address these challenges, in this paper, we introduce NCPNET, a novel end-to-end conformal prediction framework tailored for temporal graphs. Our approach extends conformal prediction to dynamic settings, mitigating statistical coverage violations induced by temporal dependencies. To achieve this, we propose a diffusion-based non-conformity score that captures both topological and temporal uncertainties within evolving networks. Additionally, we develop an efficiency-aware optimization algorithm that improves the conformal prediction process, enhancing computational efficiency and reducing coverage violations. Extensive experiments on diverse real-world temporal graphs, including WIKI, REDDIT, DBLP, and IBM Anti-Money Laundering dataset, demonstrate NCPNET's capability to ensure guaranteed coverage in temporal graphs, achieving up to a 31% reduction in prediction set size on the WIKI dataset, significantly improving efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Existing techniques generatively re-render the input video to realize the transfer, such as video relighting models and conditioned world generation models. Nevertheless, these models are predominantly limited to the domain of training data (e.g., portrait) or fall into the bottleneck of temporal consistency and computation efficiency, especially when the input video involves complex dynamics and long durations. In this paper, we propose TC-Light, a novel generative renderer to overcome these problems. Starting from the video preliminarily relighted by an inflated video relighting model, it optimizes appearance embedding in the first stage to align global illumination. Then it optimizes the proposed canonical video representation, i.e., Unique Video Tensor (UVT), to align fine-grained texture and lighting in the second stage. To comprehensively evaluate performance, we also establish a long and highly dynamic video benchmark.

Most research on TKG reasoning (TKGR) focuses on modelling the repetition of global facts and designing patterns of local historical facts. However, they face two significant challenges: inadequate modeling of the event distribution shift between training and test samples, and reliance on random entity substitution for generating negative samples, which often results in low-quality sampling. To this end, we propose a novel distributional feature modeling approach for training TKGR models, Test-Time Training-guided Distribution shift Modelling (T3DM), to adjust the model based on distribution shift and ensure the global consistency of model reasoning. In addition, we design a negative-sampling strategy to generate higher-quality negative quadruples based on adversarial training. Extensive experiments show that T3DM provides better and more robust results than the state-of-the-art baselines in most cases.</p></details> |  |

Micro-expression recognition is crucial in many fields, including criminal analysis and psychotherapy. However, micro-expression recognition is challenging since micro-expressions have low intensity and public datasets are small in size. To this end, a three-stream temporal-shift attention network based on self-knowledge distillation is proposed in this paper. Firstly, to address the low intensity of muscle movements, we utilize learning-based motion magnification modules to enhance the intensity of muscle movements. Secondly, we employ efficient channel attention modules in the local-spatial stream to make the network focus on facial regions that are highly relevant to micro-expressions. In addition, temporal shift modules are used in the dynamic-temporal stream, which enables temporal modeling with no additional parameters by mixing motion information from two different temporal domains. Furthermore, we introduce self-knowledge distillation into the micro-expression recognition task by introducing auxiliary classifiers and using the deepest section of the network for supervision, encouraging all blocks to fully explore the features of the training set. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted on five publicly available micro-expression datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our network outperforms other existing methods and achieves new state-of-the-art performance.

Although state-of-the-art long-context VLMs can process around 1000 input frames, they still struggle to effectively leverage this sequence length, and succumb to irrelevant distractors within the context window. We present Temporal Chain of Thought, an inference strategy for video question-answering that curates the model's input context. We use the VLM itself to iteratively identify and extract the most relevant frames from the video, which are then used for answering. We demonstrate how leveraging more computation at inference-time to select the most relevant context leads to improvements in accuracy, in agreement with recent work on inference-time scaling of LLMs. Moreover, we achieve state-of-the-art results on 4 diverse video question-answering datasets, showing consistent improvements with 3 different VLMs. In particular, our method shines on longer videos which would not otherwise fit within the model's context window: On longer videos of more than 1 hour on LVBench, our approach using a context window of 32K outperforms the same VLM using standard inference with a 700K context window by 2.8 points.</p></details> |  |

The framework of temporal hypergraphs makes it possible to represent them by taking into account the higher-order and temporal nature of the interactions. However, the corresponding datasets are often incomplete and/or limited in size and duration, and surrogate time-varying hypergraphs able to reproduce their statistical features constitute interesting substitutions, especially to understand how dynamical processes unfold on group interactions. Here, we present a new temporal hypergraph model, the Emerging Activity Temporal Hypergraph (EATH), which can be fed by parameters measured in a dataset and create synthetic datasets with similar properties. In the model, each node has an independent underlying activity dynamic and the overall system activity emerges from the nodes dynamics, with temporal group interactions resulting from both the activity of the nodes and memory mechanisms. We first show that the EATH model can generate surrogate hypergraphs of several empirical datasets of face-to-face interactions, mimicking temporal and topological properties at the node and hyperedge level. We also showcase the possibility to use the resulting synthetic data in simulations of higher-order contagion dynamics, comparing the outcome of such process on original and surrogate datasets. Finally, we illustrate the flexibility of the model, which can generate synthetic hypergraphs with tunable properties: as an example, we generate "hybrid" temporal hypergraphs, which mix properties of different empirical datasets. Our work opens several perspectives, from the generation of synthetic realistic hypergraphs describing contexts where data collection is difficult to a deeper understanding of dynamical processes on temporal hypergraphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main document: 19 pages, 10 figures; Supplementary Material: 37 pages, 54 figures</p></details> |

Consequently, most NL-to-TL translation frameworks propose their own bespoke dataset in which the correct grounding is known a-priori, inflating performance metrics and neglecting the need for extensible, domain-general systems. In this paper, we introduce the Verifiable Linear Temporal Logic Benchmark ( VLTL-Bench), a unifying benchmark that measures verification and verifiability of automated NL-to-LTL translation. The dataset consists of three unique state spaces and thousands of diverse natural language specifications and corresponding formal specifications in temporal logic. Moreover, the benchmark contains sample traces to validate the temporal logic expressions. While the benchmark directly supports end-to-end evaluation, we observe that many frameworks decompose the process into i) lifting, ii) grounding, iii) translation, and iv) verification. The benchmark provides ground truths after each of these steps to enable researches to improve and evaluate different substeps of the overall problem. To encourage methodologically sound advances in verifiable NL-to-LTL translation approaches, we release VLTL-Bench here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dubascudes/vltl bench.</p></details> |  |

Although these data can be used for effective local policymaking, their analyses are hindered by several challenges, such as limited information attributed to grouping, the presence of non-sampled areas, and the very low frequency of implementing surveys. To address these challenges, we propose a novel grouped-data-based spatio-temporal finite mixture model for estimating the income distributions of multiple spatial units at multiple time points. A unique feature of the proposed method is that all the areas share common latent distributions and that the mixing proportions, including spatial and temporal effects, capture the potential area-wise heterogeneity. Thus, incorporating these effects can smooth out the quantities of interest over time and space, impute missing values, and predict future values. By treating the HLS data with the proposed method, we obtain complete maps of the income and inequality measures at an arbitrary time, which can facilitate rapid and efficient policymaking with fine granularity.</p></details> |  |

However, current methods suffer from limited anatomical fidelity, restricted axial length, and substantial computational cost, placing them beyond reach for regions with limited resources and infrastructure. We introduce TRACE, a framework that generates 3D medical images with spatiotemporal alignment using a 2D multimodal-conditioned diffusion approach. TRACE models sequential 2D slices as video frame pairs, combining segmentation priors and radiology reports for anatomical alignment, incorporating optical flow to sustain temporal coherence. During inference, an overlapping-frame strategy links frame pairs into a flexible length sequence, reconstructed into a spatiotemporally and anatomically aligned 3D volume. Experimental results demonstrate that TRACE effectively balances computational efficiency with preserving anatomical fidelity and spatiotemporal consistency.

Yet, achieving scalable, low-power end-to-end on-chip learning, especially from real-world sequential data with a limited number of examples, is an open challenge. Indeed, accelerators supporting error backpropagation optimize for learning performance at the expense of inference efficiency, while simplified learning algorithms often fail to reach acceptable accuracy targets. In this work, we present Chameleon, leveraging three key contributions to solve these challenges. (i) A unified learning and inference architecture supports few-shot learning (FSL), continual learning (CL) and inference at only 0.5% area overhead to the inference logic. (ii) Long temporal dependencies are efficiently captured with temporal convolutional networks (TCNs), enabling the first demonstration of end-to-end on-chip FSL and CL on sequential data and inference on 16-kHz raw audio. (iii) A dual-mode, matrix-multiplication-free compute array allows either matching the power consumption of state-of-the-art inference-only keyword spotting (KWS) accelerators or enabling $4.3\times$ higher peak GOPS. Fabricated in 40-nm CMOS, Chameleon sets new accuracy records on Omniglot for end-to-end on-chip FSL (96.8%, 5-way 1-shot, 98.8%, 5-way 5-shot) and CL (82.2% final accuracy for learning 250 classes with 10 shots), while maintaining an inference accuracy of 93.3% on the 12-class Google Speech Commands dataset at an extreme-edge power budget of 3.1 $\mu$W.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 7 figures; added FSL power consumption measurements at 100 kHz clock speed, fixed typos</p></details> |
| **[Temporal Orienteering with Changing Fuel Costs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00728v1)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The problem Orienteering asks whether there exists a walk which visits a number of sites without exceeding some fuel budget. In the variant of the problem we consider, the cost of each edge in the walk is dependent on the time we depart one endpoint and the time we arrive at the other endpoint. This mirrors applications such as travel between orbiting objects where fuel costs are dependent on both the departure time and the length of time spent travelling. In defining this problem, we introduce a natural generalisation of the standard notion of temporal graphs: the pair consisting of the graph of the sites and a cost function, in which costs as well as shortest travel times between pairs of objects change over time. We believe this model is likely to be of independent interest. The problem of deciding whether a stated goal is feasible is easily seen to be NP-complete; we investigate three different ways to restrict the input which lead to efficient algorithms. These include the number of times an edge can be used, an analogue of vertex-interval-membership width, and the number of sites to be visited.</p></details> | 23 pages, 2 figures |
| **[TopoStreamer: Temporal Lane Segment Topology Reasoning in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00709v1)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lane segment topology reasoning constructs a comprehensive road network by capturing the topological relationships between lane segments and their semantic types. This enables end-to-end autonomous driving systems to perform road-dependent maneuvers such as turning and lane changing. However, the limitations in consistent positional embedding and temporal multiple attribute learning in existing methods hinder accurate roadnet reconstruction. To address these issues, we propose TopoStreamer, an end-to-end temporal perception model for lane segment topology reasoning. Specifically, TopoStreamer introduces three key improvements: streaming attribute constraints, dynamic lane boundary positional encoding, and lane segment denoising. The streaming attribute constraints enforce temporal consistency in both centerline and boundary coordinates, along with their classifications. Meanwhile, dynamic lane boundary positional encoding enhances the learning of up-to-date positional information within queries, while lane segment denoising helps capture diverse lane segment patterns, ultimately improving model performance. Additionally, we assess the accuracy of existing models using a lane boundary classification metric, which serves as a crucial measure for lane-changing scenarios in autonomous driving. On the OpenLane-V2 dataset, TopoStreamer demonstrates significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, achieving substantial performance gains of +3.4% mAP in lane segment perception and +2.1% OLS in centerline perception tasks.</p></details> |  |

Conventional Modified Look-Locker Inversion Recovery (MOLLI) acquires 11 breath-hold baseline images with interleaved rest periods to ensure mapping accuracy. However, prolonged scanning can be challenging for patients with poor breathholds, often leading to motion artifacts that degrade image quality. In addition, $T_1$ mapping requires voxel-wise nonlinear fitting to a signal recovery model involving an iterative estimation process. Recent studies have proposed deep-learning approaches for rapid $T_1$ mapping using shortened sequences to reduce acquisition time for patient comfort. Nevertheless, existing methods overlook important physics constraints, limiting interpretability and generalization. In this work, we present an accelerated, end-to-end $T_1$ mapping framework leveraging Physics-Informed Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) to model temporal dynamics and address these challenges. Our method achieves high-accuracy $T_1$ estimation from a sparse subset of baseline images and ensures efficient null index estimation at test time. Specifically, we develop a continuous-time LSTM-ODE model to enable selective Look-Locker (LL) data acquisition with arbitrary time lags. Experimental results show superior performance in $T_1$ estimation for both native and post-contrast sequences and demonstrate the strong benefit of our physics-based formulation over direct data-driven $T_1$ priors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted version.

Previous trackers have explored many effective feature modification methods to preserve more aligned features. However, an important yet unexplored factor ultimately hinders their capability, which is the inherent differences in the temporal and spatial scale of information between visual and language inputs. To address this issue, we propose a novel visual-language tracker that enhances the effect of feature modification by \textbf{A}ligning \textbf{T}emporal and \textbf{S}patial scale of different input components, named as \textbf{ATSTrack}. Specifically, we decompose each language description into phrases with different attributes based on their temporal and spatial correspondence with visual inputs, and modify their features in a fine-grained manner. Moreover, we introduce a Visual-Language token that comprises modified linguistic information from the previous frame to guide the model to extract visual features that are more relevant to language description, thereby reducing the impact caused by the differences in spatial scale. Experimental results show that our proposed ATSTrack achieves performance comparable to existing methods. Our code will be released.</p></details> |  |

DynaCLR integrates single-cell tracking and time-aware contrastive sampling to learn robust, temporally regularized representations of cell dynamics. DynaCLR embeddings generalize effectively to in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets, and can be used for several downstream tasks with sparse human annotations. We demonstrate efficient annotations of cell states with a human-in-the-loop using fluorescence and label-free imaging channels. DynaCLR method enables diverse downstream biological analyses: classification of cell division and infection, clustering heterogeneous cell migration patterns, cross-modal distillation of cell states from fluorescence to label-free channel, alignment of asynchronous cellular responses and broken cell tracks, and discovering organelle response due to infection. DynaCLR is a flexible method for comparative analyses of dynamic cellular responses to pharmacological, microbial, and genetic perturbations.

However, automated lesion correspondence across exams remains a challenges in computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems, limiting their effectiveness. We propose MammoTracker, a mask-guided lesion tracking framework that automates lesion localization across consecutively exams. Our approach follows a coarse-to-fine strategy incorporating three key modules: global search, local search, and score refinement. To support large-scale training and evaluation, we introduce a new dataset with curated prior-exam annotations for 730 mass and calcification cases from the public EMBED mammogram dataset, yielding over 20000 lesion pairs, making it the largest known resource for temporal lesion tracking in mammograms. Experimental results demonstrate that MammoTracker achieves 0.455 average overlap and 0.509 accuracy, surpassing baseline models by 8%, highlighting its potential to enhance CAD-based lesion progression analysis.

Existing approaches, depending on the domain they operate, suffer from several issues (e.g. geometric distortions, excessive cropping, poor generalization) that degrade the user experience. To address these issues, we introduce \textbf{GaVS}, a novel 3D-grounded approach that reformulates video stabilization as a temporally-consistent `local reconstruction and rendering' paradigm. Given 3D camera poses, we augment a reconstruction model to predict Gaussian Splatting primitives, and finetune it at test-time, with multi-view dynamics-aware photometric supervision and cross-frame regularization, to produce temporally-consistent local reconstructions. The model are then used to render each stabilized frame. We utilize a scene extrapolation module to avoid frame cropping. Our method is evaluated on a repurposed dataset, instilled with 3D-grounded information, covering samples with diverse camera motions and scene dynamics. Quantitatively, our method is competitive with or superior to state-of-the-art 2D and 2.5D approaches in terms of conventional task metrics and new geometry consistency. Qualitatively, our method produces noticeably better results compared to alternatives, validated by the user study.</p></details> | <details><summary>siggr...</summary><p>siggraph 2025, project website: https://sinoyou.github.io/gavs</p></details> |

In the context of malware, TESSERACT highlighted the impact of concept drift on detection performance and suggested temporal and spatial constraints to be enforced to ensure realistic time-aware evaluations, which have been adopted by the community. In this paper, we demonstrate striking discrepancies in the performance of learning-based malware detection across the same time frame when evaluated on two representative Android malware datasets used in top-tier security conferences, both adhering to established sampling and evaluation guidelines. This questions our ability to understand how current state-of-the-art approaches would perform in realistic scenarios. To address this, we identify five novel temporal and spatial bias factors that affect realistic evaluations. We thoroughly evaluate the impact of these factors in the Android malware domain on two representative datasets and five Android malware classifiers used or proposed in top-tier security conferences. For each factor, we provide practical and actionable recommendations that the community should integrate in their methodology for more realistic and reproducible settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning World Models With Hierarchical Temporal Abstractions: A Probabilistic Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16078v3)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machines that can replicate human intelligence with type 2 reasoning capabilities should be able to reason at multiple levels of spatio-temporal abstractions and scales using internal world models. Devising formalisms to develop such internal world models, which accurately reflect the causal hierarchies inherent in the dynamics of the real world, is a critical research challenge in the domains of artificial intelligence and machine learning. This thesis identifies several limitations with the prevalent use of state space models (SSMs) as internal world models and propose two new probabilistic formalisms namely Hidden-Parameter SSMs and Multi-Time Scale SSMs to address these drawbacks. The structure of graphical models in both formalisms facilitates scalable exact probabilistic inference using belief propagation, as well as end-to-end learning via backpropagation through time. This approach permits the development of scalable, adaptive hierarchical world models capable of representing nonstationary dynamics across multiple temporal abstractions and scales. Moreover, these probabilistic formalisms integrate the concept of uncertainty in world states, thus improving the system's capacity to emulate the stochastic nature of the real world and quantify the confidence in its predictions. The thesis also discuss how these formalisms are in line with related neuroscience literature on Bayesian brain hypothesis and predicitive processing. Our experiments on various real and simulated robots demonstrate that our formalisms can match and in many cases exceed the performance of contemporary transformer variants in making long-range future predictions. We conclude the thesis by reflecting on the limitations of our current models and suggesting directions for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Docto...</summary><p>Doctoral Dissertation, Department of Computer Science, Karlsruhe Institute Of Technology, 2024</p></details> |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Representation Decoupling and Enhancement for Federated Instrument Segmentation in Surgical Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23759v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Surgical instrument segmentation under Federated Learning (FL) is a promising direction, which enables multiple surgical sites to collaboratively train the model without centralizing datasets. However, there exist very limited FL works in surgical data science, and FL methods for other modalities do not consider inherent characteristics in surgical domain: i) different scenarios show diverse anatomical backgrounds while highly similar instrument representation; ii) there exist surgical simulators which promote large-scale synthetic data generation with minimal efforts. In this paper, we propose a novel Personalized FL scheme, Spatio-Temporal Representation Decoupling and Enhancement (FedST), which wisely leverages surgical domain knowledge during both local-site and global-server training to boost segmentation. Concretely, our model embraces a Representation Separation and Cooperation (RSC) mechanism in local-site training, which decouples the query embedding layer to be trained privately, to encode respective backgrounds. Meanwhile, other parameters are optimized globally to capture the consistent representations of instruments, including the temporal layer to capture similar motion patterns. A textual-guided channel selection is further designed to highlight site-specific features, facilitating model adapta tion to each site. Moreover, in global-server training, we propose Synthesis-based Explicit Representation Quantification (SERQ), which defines an explicit representation target based on synthetic data to synchronize the model convergence during fusion for improving model generalization.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we explore the potential of adapter tuning in image-to-video model adaptation and propose a novel video adapter tuning framework, called Disentangled-and-Deformable Spatio-Temporal Adapter (D$^2$ST-Adapter). It features a lightweight design, low adaptation overhead and powerful spatio-temporal feature adaptation capabilities. D$^2$ST-Adapter is structured with an internal dual-pathway architecture that enables built-in disentangled encoding of spatial and temporal features within the adapter, seamlessly integrating into the single-stream feature learning framework of pre-trained image models. In particular, we develop an efficient yet effective implementation of the D$^2$ST-Adapter, incorporating the specially devised anisotropic Deformable Spatio-Temporal Attention as its pivotal operation. This mechanism can be individually tailored for two pathways with anisotropic sampling densities along the spatial and temporal domains in 3D spatio-temporal space, enabling disentangled encoding of spatial and temporal features while maintaining a lightweight design. Extensive experiments by instantiating our method on both pre-trained ResNet and ViT demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art methods. Our method is particularly well-suited to challenging scenarios where temporal dynamics are critical for action recognition.

| **[Disentangled Diffusion-Based 3D Human Pose Estimation with Hierarchical Spatial and Temporal Denoiser](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04444v2)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, diffusion-based methods for monocular 3D human pose estimation have achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance by directly regressing the 3D joint coordinates from the 2D pose sequence. Although some methods decompose the task into bone length and bone direction prediction based on the human anatomical skeleton to explicitly incorporate more human body prior constraints, the performance of these methods is significantly lower than that of the SOTA diffusion-based methods. This can be attributed to the tree structure of the human skeleton. Direct application of the disentangled method could amplify the accumulation of hierarchical errors, propagating through each hierarchy. Meanwhile, the hierarchical information has not been fully explored by the previous methods. To address these problems, a Disentangled Diffusion-based 3D Human Pose Estimation method with Hierarchical Spatial and Temporal Denoiser is proposed, termed DDHPose. In our approach: (1) We disentangle the 3D pose and diffuse the bone length and bone direction during the forward process of the diffusion model to effectively model the human pose prior. A disentanglement loss is proposed to supervise diffusion model learning. (2) For the reverse process, we propose Hierarchical Spatial and Temporal Denoiser (HSTDenoiser) to improve the hierarchical modeling of each joint. Our HSTDenoiser comprises two components: the Hierarchical-Related Spatial Transformer (HRST) and the Hierarchical-Related Temporal Transformer (HRTT). HRST exploits joint spatial information and the influence of the parent joint on each joint for spatial modeling, while HRTT utilizes information from both the joint and its hierarchical adjacent joints to explore the hierarchical temporal correlations among joints.

| **[Lightweight Temporal Transformer Decomposition for Federated Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23523v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional vision-based autonomous driving systems often face difficulties in navigating complex environments when relying solely on single-image inputs. To overcome this limitation, incorporating temporal data such as past image frames or steering sequences, has proven effective in enhancing robustness and adaptability in challenging scenarios. While previous high-performance methods exist, they often rely on resource-intensive fusion networks, making them impractical for training and unsuitable for federated learning. To address these challenges, we propose lightweight temporal transformer decomposition, a method that processes sequential image frames and temporal steering data by breaking down large attention maps into smaller matrices. This approach reduces model complexity, enabling efficient weight updates for convergence and real-time predictions while leveraging temporal information to enhance autonomous driving performance. Intensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms recent approaches by a clear margin while achieving real-time performance.

| **[Graph Fourier Neural ODEs: Modeling Spatial-temporal Multi-scales in Molecular Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01600v3)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately predicting long-horizon molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories remains a significant challenge, as existing deep learning methods often struggle to retain fidelity over extended simulations. We hypothesize that one key factor limiting accuracy is the difficulty of capturing interactions that span distinct spatial and temporal scales, ranging from high-frequency local vibrations to low-frequency global conformational changes. To address these limitations, we propose Graph Fourier Neural ODEs (GF-NODE), integrating a graph Fourier transform for spatial frequency decomposition with a Neural ODE framework for continuous-time evolution. Specifically, GF-NODE first decomposes molecular configurations into multiple spatial frequency modes using the graph Laplacian, then evolves the frequency components in time via a learnable Neural ODE module that captures both local and global dynamics, and finally reconstructs the updated molecular geometry through an inverse graph Fourier transform. By explicitly modeling high- and low-frequency phenomena in this unified pipeline, GF-NODE captures long-range correlations and local fluctuations more effectively. We provide theoretical insight through heat equation analysis on a simplified diffusion model, demonstrating how graph Laplacian eigenvalues can determine temporal dynamics scales, and crucially validate this correspondence through comprehensive empirical analysis on real molecular dynamics trajectories showing quantitative spatial-temporal correlations across diverse molecular systems. Experimental results on challenging MD benchmarks demonstrate that GF-NODE achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while preserving essential geometrical features over extended simulations. These findings highlight the promise of bridging spectral decomposition with continuous-time modeling to improve the robustness and predictive power of MD simulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (06/2025)</p></details> |

They also rely on static exploration rates, which do not dynamically adjust to changing conditions. To overcome these limitations, we propose LNUCB-TA, a hybrid bandit model integrating a novel nonlinear component (adaptive k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)) for reducing time complexity, alongside a global-and-local attention-based exploration mechanism. Our approach uniquely combines linear and nonlinear estimation techniques, with the nonlinear module dynamically adjusting k based on reward variance to enhance spatiotemporal pattern recognition. This reduces the likelihood of selecting suboptimal arms while improving reward estimation accuracy and computational efficiency. The attention-based mechanism ranks arms by past performance and selection frequency, dynamically adjusting exploration and exploitation in real time without requiring manual tuning of exploration rates. By integrating global attention (assessing all arms collectively) and local attention (focusing on individual arms), LNUCB-TA efficiently adapts to temporal and spatial complexities. Empirical results show LNUCB-TA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art linear, nonlinear, and hybrid bandits in cumulative and mean reward, convergence, and robustness across different exploration rates. Theoretical analysis further confirms its reliability with a sub-linear regret bound.</p></details> |  |

While recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown early promise in tackling TVG through supervised fine-tuning (SFT), their abilities to generalize remain limited. To address this, we propose a novel post-training framework that enhances the generalization capabilities of LVLMs via reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, our contributions span three key directions: (1) Time-R1: we introduce a reasoning-guided post-training framework via RL with verifiable reward to enhance the capabilities of LVLMs on the TVG task. (2) TimeRFT: we explore data-efficient post-training strategies on our curated RL-friendly dataset, which trains the model to progressively comprehend difficult samples, leading to better generalization. (3) TVGBench: we carefully construct a small yet comprehensive benchmark for LVLM evaluation, assessing 11 types of queries and featuring balanced distributions across both videos and queries. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Time-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple downstream datasets using only 2.5K training data, while improving its general video understanding capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://xuboshen.github.io/Time-R1/</p></details> |

However, they continue to struggle with long-form videos because of an inefficient perception of temporal intervals. Unlike humans, who can dynamically adjust their temporal focus to locate query-relevant moments, current MLLMs often rely on dense, uniform sampling across the video timeline, leading to high memory consumption and a risk of missing crucial information. To address this challenge, we introduce Temporal Search, a training-free framework that enables MLLMs to explore temporal regions for improved long video understanding iteratively. TS is based on a key observation: the model's generation confidence across different temporal intervals is highly correlated with prediction accuracy. TS operates through two main iterative stages. First, the MLLM proposes a temporal interval that is likely to contain task-relevant information. Then, it samples a fixed number of frames from the interval, regardless of length, and feeds them into the model to produce a refined response and confidence score. TS refines the focus of the model by iteratively shifting attention to more fine-grained temporal intervals, improving its understanding of long videos. Additionally, keyframe-level descriptions are collected to facilitate cross-interval perception throughout the video. To further improve efficiency, we introduce TS-BFS, a best-first search strategy over a tree. Each node represents a candidate interval and is expanded via two methods: self-driven proposals and uniform partitioning. Nodes are scored based on confidence and self-evaluation, and the most promising one is selected for continued exploration.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Flexible Accumulation Model for High Density Temporal Exposures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22805v1)** | 2025-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Emerging technologies enable continuous monitoring of temporal exposures to disease risk factors, leading to complex structures in the exposure process that consists of a subject-specific number and duration of exposure episodes. A key scientific question is how does the number and duration of episodic exposure affect disease risk. We address this question by introducing the FLexible Accumulation ModEl (FLAME) and the associated inferential tools, whose finite sample performance is evaluated through comprehensive simulations. FLAME is motivated by and applied to quantifying the association between hypotensive exposure during cardiac surgery and acute kidney injury (AKI). Our results characterize the AKI risk accumulation pattern as a function of hypotensive duration and shows that while 60 one-minute episodes is associated with an AKI probability of 0.23, a single sustained sixty-minute hypotensive episode raises that probability to 0.32, a 37\% increase despite the same total duration. These results offer direct guidance for improving hemodynamics risk management strategies during intraoperative care. Our method is accompanied by the R package flame.</p></details> |  |

Building upon earlier work on long-sequence Hopfield memory models, we propose a temporal kernal $K(m, k)$ to incorporate temporal dependencies, enabling efficient sequential retrieval of patterns over extended sequences. We demonstrate the successful application of this technique for the storage and sequential retrieval of movies frames which are well suited for this because of the high dimensional vectors that make up each frame creating enough variation between even sequential frames in the high dimensional space. The technique has applications in modern transformer architectures, including efficient long-sequence modeling, memory augmentation, improved attention with temporal bias, and enhanced handling of long-term dependencies in time-series data. Our model offers a promising approach to address the limitations of transformers in long-context tasks, with potential implications for natural language processing, forecasting, and beyond.</p></details> |  |

This work aims to provide additional insight into the association between dengue and climate in the Philippines. We employ a two-stage modelling framework: the first stage fits climate models, while the second stage fits a health model that uses the climate predictions from the first stage as inputs. We postulate a Bayesian spatio-temporal model and use the integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) approach for inference. To account for the uncertainty in the climate models, we perform posterior sampling and then perform Bayesian model averaging to compute the final posterior estimates of second-stage model parameters. The results indicate that temperature is positively associated with dengue, although extremely hot conditions tend to have a negative effect. Moreover, the relationship between rainfall and dengue varies in space. In areas with uniform amounts of rainfall all year round, rainfall is negatively associated with dengue. In contrast, in regions with pronounced dry and wet season, rainfall shows a positive association with dengue. Finally, there remains unexplained structured variation in space and time after accounting for the impact of climate variables and other covariates.</p></details> |  |

| **[VideoFusion: A Spatio-Temporal Collaborative Network for Multi-modal Video Fusion and Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23359v2)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Compared to images, videos better align with real-world acquisition scenarios and possess valuable temporal cues. However, existing multi-sensor fusion research predominantly integrates complementary context from multiple images rather than videos. This primarily stems from two factors: 1) the scarcity of large-scale multi-sensor video datasets, limiting research in video fusion, and 2) the inherent difficulty of jointly modeling spatial and temporal dependencies in a unified framework. This paper proactively compensates for the dilemmas. First, we construct M3SVD, a benchmark dataset with $220$ temporally synchronized and spatially registered infrared-visible video pairs comprising 153,797 frames, filling the data gap for the video fusion community. Secondly, we propose VideoFusion, a multi-modal video fusion model that fully exploits cross-modal complementarity and temporal dynamics to generate spatio-temporally coherent videos from (potentially degraded) multi-modal inputs. Specifically, 1) a differential reinforcement module is developed for cross-modal information interaction and enhancement, 2) a complete modality-guided fusion strategy is employed to adaptively integrate multi-modal features, and 3) a bi-temporal co-attention mechanism is devised to dynamically aggregate forward-backward temporal contexts to reinforce cross-frame feature representations. Extensive experiments reveal that VideoFusion outperforms existing image-oriented fusion paradigms in sequential scenarios, effectively mitigating temporal inconsistency and interference.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial Degradation-Aware and Temporal Consistent Diffusion Model for Compressed Video Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07381v3)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to storage and bandwidth limitations, videos transmitted over the Internet often exhibit low quality, characterized by low-resolution and compression artifacts. Although video super-resolution (VSR) is an efficient video enhancing technique, existing VSR methods focus less on compressed videos. Consequently, directly applying general VSR approaches fails to improve practical videos with compression artifacts, especially when frames are highly compressed at a low bit rate. The inevitable quantization information loss complicates the reconstruction of texture details. Recently, diffusion models have shown superior performance in low-level visual tasks. Leveraging the high-realism generation capability of diffusion models, we propose a novel method that exploits the priors of pre-trained diffusion models for compressed VSR. To mitigate spatial distortions and refine temporal consistency, we introduce a Spatial Degradation-Aware and Temporal Consistent (SDATC) diffusion model. Specifically, we incorporate a distortion control module (DCM) to modulate diffusion model inputs, thereby minimizing the impact of noise from low-quality frames on the generation stage. Subsequently, the diffusion model performs a denoising process to generate details, guided by a fine-tuned compression-aware prompt module (CAPM) and a spatio-temporal attention module (STAM). CAPM dynamically encodes compression-related information into prompts, enabling the sampling process to adapt to different degradation levels. Meanwhile, STAM extends the spatial attention mechanism into the spatio-temporal dimension, effectively capturing temporal correlations. Additionally, we utilize optical flow-based alignment during each denoising step to enhance the smoothness of output videos. Extensive experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed modules in restoring compressed videos.</p></details> |  |

Traditional statistical TPPs have a long-standing history, with numerous models proposed and successfully applied across diverse domains. In recent years, advances in deep learning have spurred the development of neural TPPs, enabling greater flexibility and expressiveness in capturing complex temporal dynamics. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has further sparked excitement, offering new possibilities for modeling and analyzing event sequences by leveraging their rich contextual understanding. This survey presents a comprehensive review of recent research on TPPs from three perspectives: Bayesian, deep learning, and LLM approaches. We begin with a review of the fundamental concepts of TPPs, followed by an in-depth discussion of model design and parameter estimation techniques in these three frameworks. We also revisit classic application areas of TPPs to highlight their practical relevance. Finally, we outline challenges and promising directions for future research.</p></details> |  |

However, these models are susceptible to hallucinations and errors on particularly temporal understanding tasks involving multiple entities in answers. In such tasks, they fail to associate entities with accurate time intervals, generate a complete list of entities in answers or reason about events associated with specific temporal bounds. Existing works do not extensively evaluate the abilities of the model to perform implicit and explicit temporal understanding in a list answer construction setup. To bridge this gap, we propose the Time referenced List based Question Answering or TLQA benchmark that requires structured answers in list format aligned with corresponding time periods. Our TLQA benchmark, requires both list construction and temporal understanding simultaneously, which to the best of our knowledge has not been explored in prior benchmarks. We investigate the temporal understanding and list construction capabilities of state-of-the-art generative models on TLQA in closed-book and open-domain settings. Our findings reveal significant shortcomings in current models, particularly their inability to provide complete answers and temporally align facts in a closed-book setup and the need to improve retrieval in open-domain setup, providing clear future directions for research on TLQA.

| **[CAST: Cross-Attentive Spatio-Temporal feature fusion for Deepfake detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21711v1)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deepfakes have emerged as a significant threat to digital media authenticity, increasing the need for advanced detection techniques that can identify subtle and time-dependent manipulations. CNNs are effective at capturing spatial artifacts, and Transformers excel at modeling temporal inconsistencies. However, many existing CNN-Transformer models process spatial and temporal features independently. In particular, attention-based methods often use separate attention mechanisms for spatial and temporal features and combine them using naive approaches like averaging, addition, or concatenation, which limits the depth of spatio-temporal interaction. To address this challenge, we propose a unified CAST model that leverages cross-attention to effectively fuse spatial and temporal features in a more integrated manner. Our approach allows temporal features to dynamically attend to relevant spatial regions, enhancing the model's ability to detect fine-grained, time-evolving artifacts such as flickering eyes or warped lips. This design enables more precise localization and deeper contextual understanding, leading to improved performance across diverse and challenging scenarios. We evaluate the performance of our model using the FaceForensics++, Celeb-DF, and DeepfakeDetection datasets in both intra- and cross-dataset settings to affirm the superiority of our approach. Our model achieves strong performance with an AUC of 99.49 percent and an accuracy of 97.57 percent in intra-dataset evaluations. In cross-dataset testing, it demonstrates impressive generalization by achieving a 93.31 percent AUC on the unseen DeepfakeDetection dataset. These results highlight the effectiveness of cross-attention-based feature fusion in enhancing the robustness of deepfake video detection.</p></details> | 50 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Temporal-Aware Graph Attention Network for Cryptocurrency Transaction Fraud Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21382v1)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cryptocurrency transaction fraud detection faces the dual challenges of increasingly complex transaction patterns and severe class imbalance. Traditional methods rely on manual feature engineering and struggle to capture temporal and structural dependencies in transaction networks. This paper proposes an Augmented Temporal-aware Graph Attention Network (ATGAT) that enhances detection performance through three modules: (1) designing an advanced temporal embedding module that fuses multi-scale time difference features with periodic position encoding; (2) constructing a temporal-aware triple attention mechanism that jointly optimizes structural, temporal, and global context attention; (3) employing weighted BCE loss to address class imbalance. Experiments on the Elliptic++ cryptocurrency dataset demonstrate that ATGAT achieves an AUC of 0.9130, representing a 9.2% improvement over the best traditional method XGBoost, 12.0% over GCN, and 10.0% over standard GAT. This method not only validates the enhancement effect of temporal awareness and triple attention mechanisms on graph neural networks, but also provides financial institutions with more reliable fraud detection tools, with its design principles generalizable to other temporal graph anomaly detection tasks.</p></details> |  |

While MLLMs have been extensively studied for visual semantic understanding tasks, their ability to perform precise and quantitative spatial-temporal understanding in real-world applications remains largely unexamined, leading to uncertain prospects. To evaluate models' Spatial-Temporal Intelligence, we introduce STI-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' spatial-temporal understanding through challenging tasks such as estimating and predicting the appearance, pose, displacement, and motion of objects. Our benchmark encompasses a wide range of robot and vehicle operations across desktop, indoor, and outdoor scenarios. The extensive experiments reveals that the state-of-the-art MLLMs still struggle in real-world spatial-temporal understanding, especially in tasks requiring precise distance estimation and motion analysis.</p></details> |  |

Despite its promising potential, developing subject-invariant and session-invariant BCI systems remains a significant challenge due to the inherent complexity and variability of neural activity across individuals and over time, compounded by EEG hardware constraints. While prior studies have sought to develop robust BCI systems, existing approaches remain ineffective in capturing the intricate spatiotemporal dependencies within multichannel EEG signals. This study addresses this gap by introducing the attentive graph-temporal convolutional network (AGTCNet), a novel graph-temporal model for motor imagery EEG (MI-EEG) classification. Specifically, AGTCNet leverages the topographic configuration of EEG electrodes as an inductive bias and integrates graph convolutional attention network (GCAT) to jointly learn expressive spatiotemporal EEG representations. The proposed model significantly outperformed existing MI-EEG classifiers, achieving state-of-the-art performance while utilizing a compact architecture, underscoring its effectiveness and practicality for BCI deployment. With a 49.87% reduction in model size, 64.65% faster inference time, and shorter input EEG signal, AGTCNet achieved a moving average accuracy of 66.82% for subject-independent classification on the BCI Competition IV Dataset 2a, which further improved to 82.88% when fine-tuned for subject-specific classification. On the EEG Motor Movement/Imagery Dataset, AGTCNet achieved moving average accuracies of 64.14% and 85.22% for 4-class and 2-class subject-independent classifications, respectively, with further improvements to 72.13% and 90.54% for subject-specific classifications.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Existing approaches for HMS are mainly dominated by subspace clustering methods, which are grounded on the assumption that high-dimensional temporal data align with a Union-of-Subspaces (UoS) distribution. However, the frames in video capturing complex human motions with cluttered backgrounds may not align well with the UoS distribution. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for HMS, named Temporal Rate Reduction Clustering ($\text{TR}^2\text{C}$), which jointly learns structured representations and affinity to segment the frame sequences in video. Specifically, the structured representations learned by $\text{TR}^2\text{C}$ maintain temporally consistent and align well with a UoS structure, which is favorable for the HMS task. We conduct extensive experiments on five benchmark HMS datasets and achieve state-of-the-art performances with different feature extractors.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper is accepted by ICCV 2025.

| **[GroundFlow: A Plug-in Module for Temporal Reasoning on 3D Point Cloud Sequential Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21188v1)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential grounding in 3D point clouds (SG3D) refers to locating sequences of objects by following text instructions for a daily activity with detailed steps. Current 3D visual grounding (3DVG) methods treat text instructions with multiple steps as a whole, without extracting useful temporal information from each step. However, the instructions in SG3D often contain pronouns such as "it", "here" and "the same" to make language expressions concise. This requires grounding methods to understand the context and retrieve relevant information from previous steps to correctly locate object sequences. Due to the lack of an effective module for collecting related historical information, state-of-the-art 3DVG methods face significant challenges in adapting to the SG3D task. To fill this gap, we propose GroundFlow -- a plug-in module for temporal reasoning on 3D point cloud sequential grounding. Firstly, we demonstrate that integrating GroundFlow improves the task accuracy of 3DVG baseline methods by a large margin (+7.5\% and +10.2\%) in the SG3D benchmark, even outperforming a 3D large language model pre-trained on various datasets. Furthermore, we selectively extract both short-term and long-term step information based on its relevance to the current instruction, enabling GroundFlow to take a comprehensive view of historical information and maintain its temporal understanding advantage as step counts increase. Overall, our work introduces temporal reasoning capabilities to existing 3DVG models and achieves state-of-the-art performance in the SG3D benchmark across five datasets.</p></details> |  |

Therefore, estimating the counterfactual outcomes with spatial-temporal attributes is a crucial problem. However, previous methods are based on classical statistical models, which still have limitations in performance and generalization. This paper proposes a novel framework for estimating counterfactual outcomes with spatial-temporal attributes using the Transformer, exhibiting stronger estimation ability. Under mild assumptions, the proposed estimator within this framework is consistent and asymptotically normal. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct simulation experiments and real data experiments. Simulation experiments show that our estimator has a stronger estimation capability than baseline methods. Real data experiments provide a valuable conclusion to the causal effect of conflicts on forest loss in Colombia.

To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that more accurately reflects human cognition. This paper introduces HERMES: temporal-coHERent long-forM understanding with Episodes and Semantics, featuring two versatile modules that can enhance existing video-language models or operate as a standalone system. Our Episodic COmpressor (ECO) efficiently aggregates representations from micro to semi-macro levels, reducing computational overhead while preserving temporal dependencies. Our Semantics ReTRiever (SeTR) enriches these representations with semantic information by focusing on broader context, dramatically reducing feature dimensionality while preserving relevant macro-level information. We demonstrate that these modules can be seamlessly integrated into existing SOTA models, consistently improving their performance while reducing inference latency by up to 43% and memory usage by 46%. As a standalone system, HERMES achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple long-video understanding benchmarks in both zero-shot and fully-supervised settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for ICCV 2025.

| **[CodecSlime: Temporal Redundancy Compression of Neural Speech Codec via Dynamic Frame Rate](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21074v1)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural speech codecs have been widely used in audio compression and various downstream tasks. Current mainstream codecs are fixed-frame-rate (FFR), which allocate the same number of tokens to every equal-duration slice. However, speech is inherently non-uniform in temporal information density. As a result, many tokens are wasted on steady-state segments like long vowels and silences. To address this mismatch, we present CodecSlime, a plugin-style method for compressing temporal redundancy through supporting dynamic frame rate (DFR) on neural speech codecs for the first time. Our method is unsupervised and architecture-agnostic, combining two key innovations, ScheDFR and Melt-and-Cool, for adapting inference and training, respectively. When integrated into a typical VQ-GAN codec backbone and operating at 40 Hz DFR ($\approx$ 600 bps), the reconstruction WER of CodecSlime is reduced by up to 46% relative to conventional FFR baselines with the same model architecture and similar bitrates, while other metrics are also competitive. CodecSlime also enables flexible trade-offs between reconstruction quality and bitrate: a single model supports inference at multiple frame rates and consistently outperforms FFR models at the corresponding frame rates.

The stability of predictions through the captured videos is paramount to their reliability and, by extension, to the trustworthiness of the agents. In this paper, we propose a lightweight video semantic segmentation approach-suited to onboard real-time inference-achieving high temporal consistency on aerial data through Semantic Similarity Propagation across frames. SSP temporally propagates the predictions of an efficient image segmentation model with global registration alignment to compensate for camera movements. It combines the current estimation and the prior prediction with linear interpolation using weights computed from the features similarities of the two frames. Because data availability is a challenge in this domain, we propose a consistency-aware Knowledge Distillation training procedure for sparsely labeled datasets with few annotations. Using a large image segmentation model as a teacher to train the efficient SSP, we leverage the strong correlations between labeled and unlabeled frames in the same training videos to obtain high-quality supervision on all frames. KD-SSP obtains a significant temporal consistency increase over the base image segmentation model of 12.5% and 6.7% TC on UAVid and RuralScapes respectively, with higher accuracy and comparable inference speed. On these aerial datasets, KD-SSP provides a superior segmentation quality and inference speed trade-off than other video methods proposed for general applications and shows considerably higher consistency.

However, complex spatiotemporal relationships in traffic systems continue to limit the performance of demand forecasting models. To improve the accuracy of spatiotemporal traffic demand prediction, we propose a new graph convolutional network structure called DKGCM. Specifically, we first consider the spatial flow distribution of different traffic nodes and propose a novel temporal similarity-based clustering graph convolution method, DK-GCN. This method utilizes Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and K-means clustering to group traffic nodes and more effectively capture spatial dependencies. On the temporal scale, we integrate the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) within the bidirectional Mamba deep learning framework to capture temporal dependencies in traffic demand. To further optimize model training, we incorporate the GRPO reinforcement learning strategy to enhance the loss function feedback mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms several advanced methods and achieves strong results on three public datasets.</p></details> | 39 pages, 14 figures |

Meanwhile, recent advancements in video generation models have demonstrated remarkable success in achieving temporally consistent videos. In this paper, we introduce VideoTex, a novel framework for seamless texture synthesis that leverages video generation models to address both spatial and temporal inconsistencies in 3D textures. Our approach incorporates geometry-aware conditions, enabling precise utilization of 3D mesh structures. Additionally, we propose a structure-wise UV diffusion strategy, which enhances the generation of occluded areas by preserving semantic information, resulting in smoother and more coherent textures. VideoTex not only achieves smoother transitions across UV boundaries but also ensures high-quality, temporally stable textures across video frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VideoTex outperforms existing methods in texture fidelity, seam blending, and stability, paving the way for dynamic real-time applications that demand both visual quality and temporal coherence.</p></details> |  |

The inherent sparsity, burstiness, and overdispersion of such data cause standard deep learning models, including the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT), to produce unreliable long-horizon predictions. We introduce STFT-VNNGP, a hybrid architecture that won the 2023 Algorithms for Threat Detection (ATD) competition by overcoming these limitations. Designed to bridge this gap, our model employs a two-stage process: first, a TFT captures complex temporal dynamics to generate multi-quantile forecasts. These quantiles then serve as informed inputs for a Variational Nearest Neighbor Gaussian Process (VNNGP), which performs principled spatiotemporal smoothing and uncertainty quantification. In a case study forecasting conflict dynamics in the Middle East and the U.S., STFT-VNNGP consistently outperforms a standalone TFT, showing a superior ability to predict the timing and magnitude of bursty event periods, particularly at long-range horizons. This work offers a robust framework for generating more reliable and actionable intelligence from challenging event data, with all code and workflows made publicly available to ensure reproducibility.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches typically rely on paired ground truth, which limits their practicality and often fails to maintain temporal consistency. To overcome these obstacles, this paper introduces a novel zero-shot learning approach named Zero-TIG, leveraging the Retinex theory and optical flow techniques. The proposed network consists of an enhancement module and a temporal feedback module. The enhancement module comprises three subnetworks: low-light image denoising, illumination estimation, and reflection denoising. The temporal enhancement module ensures temporal consistency by incorporating histogram equalization, optical flow computation, and image warping to align the enhanced previous frame with the current frame, thereby maintaining continuity. Additionally, we address color distortion in underwater data by adaptively balancing RGB channels. The experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves low-light video enhancement without the need for paired training data, making it a promising and applicable method for real-world scenario enhancement.</p></details> |  |

Here, we explore the strength of Temporal Fusion Transformers (TFTs) over Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks in rainfall-runoff modeling. We train ten randomly initialized models, TFT and LSTM, for 531 CAMELS catchments in the US. We repeat the experiment with five subsets of the Caravan dataset, each representing catchments in the US, Australia, Brazil, Great Britain, and Chile. Then, the performance of the models, their variability regarding the catchment attributes, and the difference according to the datasets are assessed. Our findings show that TFT slightly outperforms LSTM, especially in simulating the midsection and peak of hydrographs. Furthermore, we show the ability of TFT to handle longer sequences and why it can be a better candidate for higher or larger catchments. Being an explainable AI technique, TFT identifies the key dynamic and static variables, providing valuable scientific insights. However, both TFT and LSTM exhibit a considerable drop in performance with the Caravan dataset, indicating possible data quality issues.

However, many state-of-the-art methods depend heavily either on supervised annotations or on attention-based models, which are computationally expensive and brittle in the face of distribution shifts that hinder cross-domain applicability across datasets. We introduce a pioneering self-supervised video summarization model that captures both spatial and temporal dependencies without the overhead of attention, RNNs, or transformers. Our framework integrates a novel set of Markov process-driven loss metrics and a two-stage self supervised learning paradigm that ensures both performance and efficiency. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the SUMME and TVSUM datasets, outperforming all existing unsupervised methods. It also rivals the best supervised models, demonstrating the potential for efficient, annotation-free architectures. This paves the way for more generalizable video summarization techniques and challenges the prevailing reliance on complex architectures.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances highlight that temporal transaction evolution reveals more attack signatures than static graphs. However, current methods either fail to model continuous transaction dynamics or incur high computational costs that limit scalability to large-scale transaction networks. Furthermore, current methods fail to consider two higher-order behavioral fingerprints: (1) direction in temporal transaction flows, which encodes money movement trajectories, and (2) account clustering, which reveals coordinated behavior of organized malicious collectives. To address these challenges, we propose DiT-SGCR, an unsupervised graph encoder for malicious account detection. Specifically, DiT-SGCR employs directional temporal aggregation to capture dynamic account interactions, then coupled with differentiable clustering and graph Laplacian regularization to generate high-quality, low-dimensional embeddings. Our approach simultaneously encodes directional temporal dynamics, global topology, and cluster-specific behavioral patterns, thereby enhancing the discriminability and robustness of account representations. Furthermore, DiT-SGCR bypasses conventional graph propagation mechanisms, yielding significant scalability advantages. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that DiT-SGCR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across all benchmarks, achieving F1-score improvements ranging from 3.62% to 10.83%.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods excel at view interpolation along recorded paths but struggle to generalize to novel trajectories due to limited viewpoints in driving videos. To tackle this challenge, we propose DriveX, a novel free-form driving view synthesis framework, that progressively distills generative prior into the 3D Gaussian model during its optimization. Within this framework, we utilize a video diffusion model to refine the degraded novel trajectory renderings from the in-training Gaussian model, while the restored videos in turn serve as additional supervision for optimizing the 3D Gaussian. Concretely, we craft an inpainting-based video restoration task, which can disentangle the identification of degraded regions from the generative capability of the diffusion model and remove the need of simulating specific degraded pattern in the training of the diffusion model. To further enhance the consistency and fidelity of generated contents, the pseudo ground truth is progressively updated with gradually improved novel trajectory rendering, allowing both components to co-adapt and reinforce each other while minimizing the disruption on the optimization. By tightly integrating 3D scene representation with generative prior, DriveX achieves high-quality view synthesis beyond recorded trajectories in real time--unlocking new possibilities for flexible and realistic driving simulations on free-form trajectories.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |

The context itself can be static (lanes, regulatory elements, etc) or dynamic (traffic participants). This paper presents a lane graph-based motion prediction model that first predicts graph-based goal proposals and later fuses them with cross attention over multiple contextual elements. We follow the famous encoder-interactor-decoder architecture where the encoder encodes scene context using lightweight Gated Recurrent Units, the interactor applies cross-context attention over encoded scene features and graph goal proposals, and the decoder regresses multimodal trajectories via Laplacian Mixture Density Network from the aggregated encodings. Using cross-attention over graph-based goal proposals gives robust trajectory estimates since the model learns to attend to future goal-relevant scene elements for the intended agent. We evaluate our work on nuScenes motion prediction dataset, achieving state-of-the-art results.</p></details> |  |

However, due to the imbalance between self-consistency and cross-consistency, these CD-based methods inherently suffer from improper conditional guidance, leading to sub-optimal generation results. To address this issue, we present SegmentDreamer, a novel framework designed to fully unleash the potential of consistency models for high-fidelity text-to-3D generation. Specifically, we reformulate SDS through the proposed Segmented Consistency Trajectory Distillation (SCTD), effectively mitigating the imbalance issues by explicitly defining the relationship between self- and cross-consistency. Moreover, SCTD partitions the Probability Flow Ordinary Differential Equation (PF-ODE) trajectory into multiple sub-trajectories and ensures consistency within each segment, which can theoretically provide a significantly tighter upper bound on distillation error. Additionally, we propose a distillation pipeline for a more swift and stable generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our SegmentDreamer outperforms state-of-the-art methods in visual quality, enabling high-fidelity 3D asset creation through 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025, project page: https://zjhjojo.github.io/</p></details> |

Marginal prediction models commonly forecast each agent's future trajectories independently, often leading to sub-optimal planning decisions for an automated vehicle. In contrast, joint prediction models explicitly account for the interactions between agents, yielding socially and physically consistent predictions on a scene level. However, existing approaches differ not only in their problem formulation but also in the model architectures and implementation details used, making it difficult to compare them. In this work, we systematically investigate different approaches to joint motion prediction, including post-processing of the marginal predictions, explicitly training the model for joint predictions, and framing the problem as a generative task. We evaluate each approach in terms of prediction accuracy, multi-modality, and inference efficiency, offering a comprehensive analysis of the strengths and limitations of each approach. Several prediction examples are available at https://frommarginaltojointpred.github.io/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems 2025 (ITSC 2025)</p></details> |

This work systematically examines how feature selection, cross-dataset transfer, and geographic diversity influence trajectory prediction accuracy in multi-agent settings. We evaluate a state-of-the-art model using our novel L4 Motion Forecasting dataset based on our own data recordings in Germany and the US. This includes enhanced map and agent features. We compare our dataset to the US-centric Argoverse 2 benchmark. First, we find that incorporating supplementary map and agent features unique to our dataset, yields no measurable improvement over baseline features, demonstrating that modern architectures do not need extensive feature sets for optimal performance. The limited features of public datasets are sufficient to capture convoluted interactions without added complexity. Second, we perform cross-dataset experiments to evaluate how effective domain knowledge can be transferred between datasets. Third, we group our dataset by country and check the knowledge transfer between different driving cultures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Discrete Diffusion Trajectory Alignment via Stepwise Decomposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04832v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discrete diffusion models have demonstrated great promise in modeling various sequence data, ranging from human language to biological sequences. Inspired by the success of RL in language models, there is growing interest in further improving the models by alignment with a certain reward. In this work, we propose a novel preference optimization method for masked discrete diffusion models through a principled diffusion trajectory alignment. Instead of applying the reward on the final output and backpropagating the gradient to the entire discrete denoising process, we decompose the problem into a set of stepwise alignment objectives. This framework enables efficient diffusion optimization, is compatible with arbitrary reward functions, and importantly, guarantees an equivalent optimal solution under additive factorization of the trajectory reward. Experiments across multiple domains including DNA sequence design, protein inverse folding, and language modeling consistently demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Notably, it achieves an up to 12\% improvement over the most competitive RL-based baseline in terms of predicted activity on DNA sequence design, and further improves the GSM8K score from 78.6 to 80.7 on LLaDA-8B-Instruct for language modeling.</p></details> | 22 pages, 3 figures |

The neural representation of a set is used as the terminal set constraint for a model predictive control (MPC) local planner, resulting in improved recursive feasibility and safety. To achieve real-time performance and desired generalization properties, we employ the idea of hypernetworks. We use the Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis as the source of supervision during the training process, allowing us to consider general nonlinear dynamics and arbitrary constraints. The proposed method is extensively evaluated against relevant baselines in simulations for different environments and robot dynamics. The results show an increase in success rate of up to 52% compared to the best baseline while maintaining comparable execution speed. Additionally, we deploy our proposed method, NTC-MPC, on a physical robot and demonstrate its ability to safely avoid obstacles in scenarios where the baselines fail.</p></details> |  |

The key challenge lies in the significant uncertainty in drag and weight parameters introduced by the collected litter. We propose a dynamical model for the coupled UUV-USV system in the primary plane of motion and a risk-aware optimization approach incorporating parameter uncertainty and noise to ensure safe interactions with the environment. A stochastic optimization problem is solved using a conditional value-at-risk framework. Simulations demonstrate that our approach reduces collision risks and energy consumption, highlighting its reliability compared to existing control methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[LTMSformer: A Local Trend-Aware Attention and Motion State Encoding Transformer for Multi-Agent Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04634v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It has been challenging to model the complex temporal-spatial dependencies between agents for trajectory prediction. As each state of an agent is closely related to the states of adjacent time steps, capturing the local temporal dependency is beneficial for prediction, while most studies often overlook it. Besides, learning the high-order motion state attributes is expected to enhance spatial interaction modeling, but it is rarely seen in previous works. To address this, we propose a lightweight framework, LTMSformer, to extract temporal-spatial interaction features for multi-modal trajectory prediction. Specifically, we introduce a Local Trend-Aware Attention mechanism to capture the local temporal dependency by leveraging a convolutional attention mechanism with hierarchical local time boxes. Next, to model the spatial interaction dependency, we build a Motion State Encoder to incorporate high-order motion state attributes, such as acceleration, jerk, heading, etc. To further refine the trajectory prediction, we propose a Lightweight Proposal Refinement Module that leverages Multi-Layer Perceptrons for trajectory embedding and generates the refined trajectories with fewer model parameters. Experiment results on the Argoverse 1 dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms the baseline HiVT-64, reducing the minADE by approximately 4.35%, the minFDE by 8.74%, and the MR by 20%. We also achieve higher accuracy than HiVT-128 with a 68% reduction in model size.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial-Temporal Conditional Random Field for Human Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18198v2)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is of significant importance in computer vision. Accurate pedestrian trajectory prediction benefits autonomous vehicles and robots in planning their motion. Pedestrians' trajectories are greatly influenced by their intentions. Prior studies having introduced various deep learning methods only pay attention to the spatial and temporal information of trajectory, overlooking the explicit intention information. In this study, we introduce a novel model, termed the \textbf{S-T CRF}: \textbf{S}patial-\textbf{T}emporal \textbf{C}onditional \textbf{R}andom \textbf{F}ield, which judiciously incorporates intention information besides spatial and temporal information of trajectory. This model uses a Conditional Random Field (CRF) to generate a representation of future intentions, greatly improving the prediction of subsequent trajectories when combined with spatial-temporal representation. Furthermore, the study innovatively devises a space CRF loss and a time CRF loss, meticulously designed to enhance interaction constraints and temporal dynamics, respectively. Extensive experimental evaluations on dataset ETH/UCY and SDD demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses existing baseline approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predicting Drivers' Route Trajectories in Last-Mile Delivery Using A Pair-wise Attention-based Pointer Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03802v2)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In last-mile delivery, drivers frequently deviate from planned delivery routes because of their tacit knowledge of the road and curbside infrastructure, customer availability, and other characteristics of the respective service areas. Hence, the actual stop sequences chosen by an experienced human driver may be potentially preferable to the theoretical shortest-distance routing under real-life operational conditions. Thus, being able to predict the actual stop sequence that a human driver would follow can help to improve route planning in last-mile delivery. This paper proposes a pair-wise attention-based pointer neural network for this prediction task using drivers' historical delivery trajectory data. In addition to the commonly used encoder-decoder architecture for sequence-to-sequence prediction, we propose a new attention mechanism based on an alternative specific neural network to capture the local pair-wise information for each pair of stops. To further capture the global efficiency of the route, we propose a new iterative sequence generation algorithm that is used after model training to identify the first stop of a route that yields the lowest operational cost. Results from an extensive case study on real operational data from Amazon's last-mile delivery operations in the US show that our proposed method can significantly outperform traditional optimization-based approaches and other machine learning methods (such as the Long Short-Term Memory encoder-decoder and the original pointer network) in finding stop sequences that are closer to high-quality routes executed by experienced drivers in the field. Compared to benchmark models, the proposed model can increase the average prediction accuracy of the first four stops from around 0.229 to 0.312, and reduce the disparity between the predicted route and the actual route by around 15%.</p></details> |  |
| **[D4orm: Multi-Robot Trajectories with Dynamics-aware Diffusion Denoised Deformations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12204v2)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work presents an optimization method for generating kinodynamically feasible and collision-free multi-robot trajectories that exploits an incremental denoising scheme in diffusion models. Our key insight is that high-quality trajectories can be discovered merely by denoising noisy trajectories sampled from a distribution. This approach has no learning component, relying instead on only two ingredients: a dynamical model of the robots to obtain feasible trajectories via rollout, and a fitness function to guide denoising with Monte Carlo gradient approximation. The proposed framework iteratively optimizes a deformation for the previous trajectory with the current denoising process, allows anytime refinement as time permits, supports different dynamics, and benefits from GPU acceleration. Our evaluations for differential-drive and holonomic teams with up to 16 robots in 2D and 3D worlds show its ability to discover high-quality solutions faster than other black-box optimization methods such as MPPI. In a 2D holonomic case with 16 robots, it is almost twice as fast. As evidence for feasibility, we demonstrate zero-shot deployment of the planned trajectories on eight multirotors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 2025 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)</p></details> |
| **[VLM-TDP: VLM-guided Trajectory-conditioned Diffusion Policy for Robust Long-Horizon Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04524v1)** | 2025-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion policy has demonstrated promising performance in the field of robotic manipulation. However, its effectiveness has been primarily limited in short-horizon tasks, and its performance significantly degrades in the presence of image noise. To address these limitations, we propose a VLM-guided trajectory-conditioned diffusion policy (VLM-TDP) for robust and long-horizon manipulation. Specifically, the proposed method leverages state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) to decompose long-horizon tasks into concise, manageable sub-tasks, while also innovatively generating voxel-based trajectories for each sub-task. The generated trajectories serve as a crucial conditioning factor, effectively steering the diffusion policy and substantially enhancing its performance. The proposed Trajectory-conditioned Diffusion Policy (TDP) is trained on trajectories derived from demonstration data and validated using the trajectories generated by the VLM. Simulation experimental results indicate that our method significantly outperforms classical diffusion policies, achieving an average 44% increase in success rate, over 100% improvement in long-horizon tasks, and a 20% reduction in performance degradation in challenging conditions, such as noisy images or altered environments. These findings are further reinforced by our real-world experiments, where the performance gap becomes even more pronounced in long-horizon tasks.

| **[Rapid and Safe Trajectory Planning over Diverse Scenes through Diffusion Composition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04384v1)** | 2025-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safe trajectory planning remains a significant challenge in complex environments, where traditional methods often trade off computational efficiency for safety. Comprehensive obstacle modeling improves safety but is computationally expensive, while approximate methods are more efficient but may compromise safety. To address this issue, this paper introduces a rapid and safe trajectory planning framework based on state-based diffusion models. Leveraging only low-dimensional vehicle states, the diffusion models achieve notable inference efficiency while ensuring sufficient collision-free characteristics. By composing diffusion models, the proposed framework can safely generalize across diverse scenarios, planning collision-free trajectories even in unseen scenes. To further ensure the safety of the generated trajectories, an efficient, rule-based safety filter is proposed, which selects optimal trajectories that satisfy both sufficient safety and control feasibility from among candidate trajectories. Both in seen and unseen scenarios, the proposed method achieves efficient inference time while maintaining high safety and stability. Evaluations on the F1TENTH vehicle further demonstrate that the proposed method is practical in real-world applications.

| **[WebSynthesis: World-Model-Guided MCTS for Efficient WebUI-Trajectory Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04370v1)** | 2025-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved the capabilities of web agents. However, effectively navigating complex and dynamic web environments still requires more advanced trajectory-level planning and execution. Prior studies have addressed self-improving agents by collecting extensive GUI trajectories from real-environment interactions. Despite their effectiveness, these approaches encounter two critical challenges: (1) Uncontrollable environment states, where real or sandboxed web environments often yield unstable and non-deterministic feedback, complicating the reproduction and debugging of agent behaviors; and (2) High API costs, as generating even a single interaction trajectory can involve hundreds of queries, leading to considerable API usage and computational expenses. To address these limitations and enable scalable self-improvement for agents, we propose WebSynthesis, a novel framework for trajectory synthesis and training. WebSynthesis leverages a learned world model to simulate virtual web environments, allowing a policy agent to perform efficient and reversible tree-based planning. This approach supports the large-scale generation of diverse and high-quality trajectories, which are subsequently utilized to refine the agent's policy. Experimental results demonstrate that an agent trained using WebSynthesis on a small-scale synthetic dataset achieves performance comparable to or even surpassing that of models trained on large-scale real-world data.</p></details> |  |
| **[K Nearest Neighbor-Guided Trajectory Similarity Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00285v2)** | 2025-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory similarity is fundamental to many spatio-temporal data mining applications. Recent studies propose deep learning models to approximate conventional trajectory similarity measures, exploiting their fast inference time once trained. Although efficient inference has been reported, challenges remain in similarity approximation accuracy due to difficulties in trajectory granularity modeling and in exploiting similarity signals in the training data. To fill this gap, we propose TSMini, a highly effective trajectory similarity model with a sub-view modeling mechanism capable of learning multi-granularity trajectory patterns and a k nearest neighbor-based loss that guides TSMini to learn not only absolute similarity values between trajectories but also their relative similarity ranks. Together, these two innovations enable highly accurate trajectory similarity approximation. Experiments show that TSMini can outperform the state-of-the-art models by 22% in accuracy on average when learning trajectory similarity measures.</p></details> |  |

Trajectory refinement has emerged as a key strategy to enhance prediction accuracy. However, existing refinement methods often overlook the topological relationships between trajectories, which are vital for improving prediction precision. Inspired by braid theory, we propose a novel trajectory refinement approach, Soft-Braid Refiner (SRefiner), guided by the soft-braid topological structure of trajectories using Soft-Braid Attention. Soft-Braid Attention captures spatio-temporal topological relationships between trajectories by considering both spatial proximity and vehicle motion states at ``soft intersection points". Additionally, we extend this approach to model interactions between trajectories and lanes, further improving the prediction accuracy. SRefiner is a multi-iteration, multi-agent framework that iteratively refines trajectories, incorporating topological information to enhance interactions within traffic scenarios. SRefiner achieves significant performance improvements over four baseline methods across two datasets, establishing a new state-of-the-art in trajectory refinement.

However, due to the inherent imbalance in trajectory distributions, tail data in natural datasets often represents more complex and hazardous scenarios. Existing studies typically rely solely on a base model's prediction error, without considering the diversity and uncertainty of long-tail trajectory patterns. We propose an adaptive momentum and decoupled contrastive learning framework (AMD), which integrates unsupervised and supervised contrastive learning strategies. By leveraging an improved momentum contrast learning (MoCo-DT) and decoupled contrastive learning (DCL) module, our framework enhances the model's ability to recognize rare and complex trajectories. Additionally, we design four types of trajectory random augmentation methods and introduce an online iterative clustering strategy, allowing the model to dynamically update pseudo-labels and better adapt to the distributional shifts in long-tail data. We propose three different criteria to define long-tail trajectories and conduct extensive comparative experiments on the nuScenes and ETH$/$UCY datasets. The results show that AMD not only achieves optimal performance in long-tail trajectory prediction but also demonstrates outstanding overall prediction accuracy.</p></details> |  |

While many promising methods have been developed using online corpora and captioned photographs, their application to scientific domains, where data encodes highly specialized knowledge, remains a challenge. Liquid Argon Time Projection Chambers (LArTPCs) provide high-resolution 3D imaging for fundamental physics, but analysis of their sparse, complex point cloud data often relies on supervised methods trained on large simulations, introducing potential biases. We introduce the Point-based Liquid Argon Masked Autoencoder (PoLAr-MAE), applying masked point modeling to unlabeled LArTPC images using domain-specific volumetric tokenization and energy prediction. We show this SSL approach learns physically meaningful trajectory representations directly from data. This yields remarkable data efficiency: fine-tuning on just 100 labeled events achieves track/shower semantic segmentation performance comparable to the state-of-the-art supervised baseline trained on $>$100,000 events. Furthermore, internal attention maps exhibit emergent instance segmentation of particle trajectories. While challenges remain, particularly for fine-grained features, we make concrete SSL's potential for building a foundation model for LArTPC image analysis capable of serving as a common base for all data reconstruction tasks. To facilitate further progress, we release PILArNet-M, a large dataset of 1M LArTPC events.

In this work, we propose DIVER, an end-to-end driving framework that integrates reinforcement learning with diffusion-based generation to produce diverse and feasible trajectories. At the core of DIVER lies a reinforced diffusion-based generation mechanism. First, the model conditions on map elements and surrounding agents to generate multiple reference trajectories from a single ground-truth trajectory, alleviating the limitations of imitation learning that arise from relying solely on single expert demonstrations. Second, reinforcement learning is employed to guide the diffusion process, where reward-based supervision enforces safety and diversity constraints on the generated trajectories, thereby enhancing their practicality and generalization capability. Furthermore, to address the limitations of L2-based open-loop metrics in capturing trajectory diversity, we propose a novel Diversity metric to evaluate the diversity of multi-mode predictions.Extensive experiments on the closed-loop NAVSIM and Bench2Drive benchmarks, as well as the open-loop nuScenes dataset, demonstrate that DIVER significantly improves trajectory diversity, effectively addressing the mode collapse problem inherent in imitation learning.</p></details> | 16 pages, 6 figures |

Coordination between heterogeneous units is paramount for precision tasks -- whether in manipulation, legged locomotion, or multi-robot interaction. Such modular systems introduce challenges far exceeding those in monolithic robot architectures. This study presents a robust method for synchronizing the trajectories of multiple heterogeneous actuators, adapting dynamically to system variations with minimal system knowledge. This design makes it inherently robot-agnostic, thus highly suited for modularity. To ensure smooth trajectory adherence, the multidimensional state is constrained within a hypersphere representing the allowable deviation. The distance metric can be adapted hence, depending on the task and system under control, deformation of the constraint region is possible. This approach is compatible with a wide range of robotic platforms and serves as a core interface for Motion-Stack, our new open-source universal framework for limb coordination (available at https://github.com/2lian/Motion-Stack ). The method is validated by synchronizing the end-effectors of six highly heterogeneous robotic limbs, evaluating both trajectory adherence and recovery from significant external disturbances.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 15 figures.

Their high agility and unpredictable motion make drones difficult to track and intercept. While existing methods focus on detecting current positions, many counter-drone strategies rely on forecasting future trajectories and thus require more than reactive detection to be effective. To address this critical gap, we propose an unsupervised vision-based method for predicting the three-dimensional trajectories of drones. Our approach first uses an unsupervised technique to extract drone trajectories from raw LiDAR point clouds, then aligns these trajectories with camera images through motion consistency to generate reliable pseudo-labels. We then combine kinematic estimation with a visual Mamba neural network in a self-supervised manner to predict future drone trajectories. We evaluate our method on the challenging MMAUD dataset, including the V2 sequences that feature wide-field-of-view multimodal sensors and dynamic UAV motion in urban scenes. Extensive experiments show that our framework outperforms supervised image-only and audio-visual baselines in long-horizon trajectory prediction, reducing 5-second 3D error by around 40 percent without using any manual 3D labels. The proposed system offers a cost-effective, scalable alternative for real-time counter-drone deployment. All code will be released upon acceptance to support reproducible research in the robotics community.</p></details> |  |

However, existing trajectory-based methods primarily focus on individual object motion and struggle to capture multi-object interaction crucial in complex robotic manipulation. This limitation arises from multi-feature entanglement in overlapping regions, which leads to degraded visual fidelity. To address this, we present RoboMaster, a novel framework that models inter-object dynamics through a collaborative trajectory formulation. Unlike prior methods that decompose objects, our core is to decompose the interaction process into three sub-stages: pre-interaction, interaction, and post-interaction. Each stage is modeled using the feature of the dominant object, specifically the robotic arm in the pre- and post-interaction phases and the manipulated object during interaction, thereby mitigating the drawback of multi-object feature fusion present during interaction in prior work. To further ensure subject semantic consistency throughout the video, we incorporate appearance- and shape-aware latent representations for objects. Extensive experiments on the challenging Bridge V2 dataset, as well as in-the-wild evaluation, demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches, establishing new state-of-the-art performance in trajectory-controlled video generation for robotic manipulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://fuxiao0719.github.io/projects/robomaster/ Code: https://github.com/KwaiVGI/RoboMaster</p></details> |

Previous methods on controllable video generation primarily leverage 2D control signals to manipulate object motions and have achieved remarkable synthesis results. However, 2D control signals are inherently limited in expressing the 3D nature of object motions. To overcome this problem, we introduce 3DTrajMaster, a robust controller that regulates multi-entity dynamics in 3D space, given user-desired 6DoF pose (location and rotation) sequences of entities. At the core of our approach is a plug-and-play 3D-motion grounded object injector that fuses multiple input entities with their respective 3D trajectories through a gated self-attention mechanism. In addition, we exploit an injector architecture to preserve the video diffusion prior, which is crucial for generalization ability. To mitigate video quality degradation, we introduce a domain adaptor during training and employ an annealed sampling strategy during inference. To address the lack of suitable training data, we construct a 360-Motion Dataset, which first correlates collected 3D human and animal assets with GPT-generated trajectory and then captures their motion with 12 evenly-surround cameras on diverse 3D UE platforms.

We propose coherent track before detect: A detection approach which is capable of coherently integrating these reflections within a coherent processing interval (CPI) in all these configurations and continuing integration for an arbitrarily long time across consecutive CPIs. {We estimate the complex value of the reflection coefficients for integration while simultaneously estimating the object trajectory. Compounded with these computations is the estimation of the unknown time reference shift of the separated transmitters necessary for coherent processing.} Detection is made by using the resulting integration value in a Neyman-Pearson test against a constant false alarm rate threshold. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in a simulation example with a very low SNR object which cannot be detected with conventional techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This article is based on Chapter 3 in "Reliable detection and characterisation of dim targets via track-before-detect", a PhD Thesis by Kimin Kim, The University of Edinburgh (https://era.ed.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/1842/38091/Kim2021.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y)</p></details> |

The approach linearizes the system with respect to a reference trajectory. In contrast to existing methods rooted in robust linear time-varying synthesis, the approach accurately includes perturbations that drive the system away from the reference trajectory. Hence, the controller obtained in the linear framework provides a significantly more robust nonlinear performance. The calculation of the controller is derived from robust synthesis approaches rooted in the integral quadratic constraints framework.

However, mobility data often suffers from sparsity due to limitations in data collection methods, such as infrequent GPS sampling or call detail record (CDR) data that only capture locations during communication events. To address this challenge, we propose BERT4Traj, a transformer based model that reconstructs complete mobility trajectories by predicting hidden visits in sparse movement sequences. Inspired by BERT's masked language modeling objective and self_attention mechanisms, BERT4Traj leverages spatial embeddings, temporal embeddings, and contextual background features such as demographics and anchor points. We evaluate BERT4Traj on real world CDR and GPS datasets collected in Kampala, Uganda, demonstrating that our approach significantly outperforms traditional models such as Markov Chains, KNN, RNNs, and LSTMs. Our results show that BERT4Traj effectively reconstructs detailed and continuous mobility trajectories, enhancing insights into human movement patterns.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was accepted at GIScience 2025</p></details> |

| **[LATTE: Latent Trajectory Embedding for Diffusion-Generated Image Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03054v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of diffusion-based image generators has made it increasingly difficult to distinguish generated from real images. This can erode trust in digital media, making it critical to develop generalizable detectors for generated images. Recent methods leverage diffusion denoising cues, but mainly focus on single-step reconstruction errors, ignoring the inherent sequential nature of the denoising process. In this work, we propose LATTE - Latent Trajectory Embedding - a novel approach that models the evolution of latent embeddings across several denoising timesteps. By modeling the trajectory of such embeddings rather than single-step errors, LATTE captures subtle, discriminative patterns that distinguish real from generated images. Each latent is refined by employing our latent-visual feature refinement module and aggregated into a unified representation. Afterwards, it is fused with the visual features and finally passed into a lightweight classifier. Our experiments demonstrate that LATTE surpasses the baselines on several established benchmarks, such as GenImage and DiffusionFake. Moreover, it demonstrates strong performance in cross-generator and cross-datasets settings, highlighting the potential of using the trajectory of latent embeddings for generated image detection.

| **[Improving Consistency in Vehicle Trajectory Prediction Through Preference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02406v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is an essential step in the pipeline of an autonomous vehicle. Inaccurate or inconsistent predictions regarding the movement of agents in its surroundings lead to poorly planned maneuvers and potentially dangerous situations for the end-user. Current state-of-the-art deep-learning-based trajectory prediction models can achieve excellent accuracy on public datasets. However, when used in more complex, interactive scenarios, they often fail to capture important interdependencies between agents, leading to inconsistent predictions among agents in the traffic scene. Inspired by the efficacy of incorporating human preference into large language models, this work fine-tunes trajectory prediction models in multi-agent settings using preference optimization. By taking as input automatically calculated preference rankings among predicted futures in the fine-tuning process, our experiments--using state-of-the-art models on three separate datasets--show that we are able to significantly improve scene consistency while minimally sacrificing trajectory prediction accuracy and without adding any excess computational requirements at inference time.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at ITSC 2025</p></details> |
| **[Towards Bio-Inspired Robotic Trajectory Planning via Self-Supervised RNN](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02171v1)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory planning in robotics is understood as generating a sequence of joint configurations that will lead a robotic agent, or its manipulator, from an initial state to the desired final state, thus completing a manipulation task while considering constraints like robot kinematics and the environment. Typically, this is achieved via sampling-based planners, which are computationally intensive. Recent advances demonstrate that trajectory planning can also be performed by supervised sequence learning of trajectories, often requiring only a single or fixed number of passes through a neural architecture, thus ensuring a bounded computation time. Such fully supervised approaches, however, perform imitation learning; they do not learn based on whether the trajectories can successfully reach a goal, but try to reproduce observed trajectories. In our work, we build on this approach and propose a cognitively inspired self-supervised learning scheme based on a recurrent architecture for building a trajectory model. We evaluate the feasibility of the proposed method on a task of kinematic planning for a robotic arm. The results suggest that the model is able to learn to generate trajectories only using given paired forward and inverse kinematics models, and indicate that this novel method could facilitate planning for more complex manipulation tasks requiring adaptive solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables.

| **[Tenure and Research Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10575v2)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tenure is a cornerstone of the US academic system, yet its relationship to faculty research trajectories remains poorly understood. Conceptually, tenure systems may act as a selection mechanism, screening in high-output researchers; a dynamic incentive mechanism, encouraging high output prior to tenure but low output after tenure; and a creative search mechanism, encouraging tenured individuals to undertake high-risk work. Here, we integrate data from seven different sources to trace US tenure-line faculty and their research outputs at an unprecedented scale and scope, covering over 12,000 researchers across 15 disciplines. Our analysis reveals that faculty publication rates typically increase sharply during the tenure track and peak just before obtaining tenure. Post-tenure trends, however, vary across disciplines: in lab-based fields, such as biology and chemistry, research output typically remains high post-tenure, whereas in non-lab-based fields, such as mathematics and sociology, research output typically declines substantially post-tenure. Turning to creative search, faculty increasingly produce novel, high-risk research after securing tenure. However, this shift toward novelty and risk-taking comes with a decline in impact, with post-tenure research yielding fewer highly cited papers. Comparing outcomes across common career ages but different tenure years or comparing research trajectories in tenure-based and non-tenure-based research settings underscores that breaks in the research trajectories are sharply tied to the individual's tenure year. Overall, these findings provide a new empirical basis for understanding the tenure system, individual research trajectories, and the shape of scientific output.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, an efficient, accurate, and widely applicable pseudospectral method is proposed to solve multi-revolution low-thrust trajectory optimization problems with various objective functions and perturbations. The method is based on the Sundman transformation and pseudospectral method, together with a sparse mesh that is monotonic, near-uniformly spaced, and uniformly scattered on the unit circle. Two methods are proposed to construct the mesh: a deterministic method based on rotation mapping; a stochastic method utilizing autocorrelated random sequences. Core mechanisms ensuring the correctness of the method are analyzed, including the dual roles of mesh points as both integration points in the temporal domain and sampling points in the angular domain, the slow dynamics of the system excluding the fast angle variable, and the nearly commutative vector fields generated by applying different control inputs. The method is demonstrated through a multi-revolution low-thrust orbital rendezvous problem. Results show that the proposed method achieves high accuracy with only a few seconds of computational time for challenging problems.</p></details> |  |

Most of the current designs of motion prediction models are based on the major representation of lane centerlines, which limits their capability to capture critical road environments and traffic rules and constraints. In this work, we propose an enhanced motion forecasting model informed by multiple vector map elements, including lane boundaries and road edges, that facilitates a richer and more complete representation of driving environments. An effective feature fusion strategy is developed to merge information in different vector map components, where the model learns holistic information on road structures and their interactions with agents. Since encoding more information about the road environment increases memory usage and is computationally expensive, we developed an effective pruning mechanism that filters the most relevant map connections to the target agent, ensuring computational efficiency while maintaining essential spatial and semantic relationships for accurate trajectory prediction. Overcoming the limitations of lane centerline-based models, our method provides a more informative and efficient representation of the driving environment and advances the state of the art for autonomous vehicle motion forecasting. We verify our approach with extensive experiments on the Argoverse 2 motion forecasting dataset, where our method maintains competitiveness on AV2 while achieving improved performance.

Cluster analysis with longitudinal data further allows for clinical representation of groups of subjects with similar trajectories and identification of unique characteristics, or phenotypes, that can be investigated as risk factors or disease outcomes. Some of the challenges in estimating these clustered trajectories lie in the handling of observations at inconsistent time intervals and the usability of algorithms across programming languages. Methods: We propose longitudinal trajectory clustering using a k-means algorithm with thin-plate regression splines, implemented across multiple platforms, the R package clustra and corresponding \SAS macros. The \SAS macros accommodate flexible clustering approaches, and also include visualization of the clusters, and silhouette plots for diagnostic evaluation of the appropriate cluster number. The R package, designed in parallel, has similar functionality, with additional multi-core processing and Rand-index-based diagnostics. Results: The package and macros achieve comparable results when applied to an example of simulated blood pressure measurements based on real data from Veterans Affairs Healthcare recipients who were initiated on anti-hypertensive medication. Conclusion: The R package clustra and the SAS macros integrate a K-means clustering algorithm for longitudinal trajectories that operates with large electronic health record data. The implementations provide comparable results in both platforms, satisfying the needs of investigators familiar with, or constrained by access to, one or the other platform.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 11 figures, clustra package available in https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/clustra/index.html, SAS macros available in https://github.com/MVP-CHAMPION/clustra-SAS</p></details> |

The state-of-the-art optimal control approaches often rely on numerical methods sensitive to initial guesses. This paper presents an innovative collision-free finite-time formation control scheme for multiple UAVs leveraging the differential flatness of the UAV dynamics, eliminating the need for numerical methods. We formulate a finite-time optimal control problem to plan a formation trajectory for feasible initial states. This optimal control problem in formation trajectory planning involves a collective performance index to meet the formation requirements to achieve relative positions and velocity consensus. It is solved by applying Pontryagin's principle. Subsequently, a collision-constrained regulating problem is addressed to ensure collision-free tracking of the planned formation trajectory. The tracking problem incorporates a directionally aware collision avoidance strategy that prioritizes avoiding UAVs in the forward path and relative approach. It assigns lower priority to those on the sides with an oblique relative approach, disregarding UAVs behind and not in the relative approach. The high-fidelity simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for Journal of the Franklin Institute</p></details> |

The proposed method systematically accounts for gyroscopic effects, rotor dynamics, parametric uncertainties, and external disturbances, ensuring robust performance across varying trajectory speeds. Through novel mathematical manipulation in the error system development, the quadrotor dynamics are expressed in a control-oriented form, which explicitly incorporates the uncertainty in the gyroscopic term and control actuation term. An adaptive modified RISE law is then designed to stabilize both the position and attitude loops of the quadrotor system. A rigorous Lyapunov-based analysis is utilized to prove asymptotic trajectory tracking, where the region of convergence can be made arbitrarily large through judicious control gain selection. Moreover, the stability analysis formally addresses gyroscopic effects and actuator uncertainty. To illustrate the performance of the control law, comparative numerical simulation results are provided, which demonstrate the improved closed-loop performance achieved under varying levels of parametric uncertainty, disturbance magnitudes and trajectory speeds.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is under review</p></details> |

To achieve this goal, the neural network computes the forward kinematics of the robot arm. By integrating it with a generator of joint angles, another neural network was developed and trained on an artificial dataset created from suitable start and end poses of the robotic arm.

While learning-based prediction models have shown success in generating likely human trajectory predictions, integrating these stochastic models into a robot controller presents several challenges. The controller needs to account for interactive coupling between planned robot motion and human predictions while ensuring both predictions and robot actions are safe (i.e. collision-free). To address these challenges, we present a receding horizon crowd navigation method for single-robot multi-human environments. We first propose a diffusion model to generate joint trajectory predictions for all humans in the scene. We then incorporate these multi-modal predictions into a SICNav Bilevel MPC problem that simultaneously solves for a robot plan (upper-level) and acts as a safety filter to refine the predictions for non-collision (lower-level). Combining planning and prediction refinement into one bilevel problem ensures that the robot plan and human predictions are coupled. We validate the open-loop trajectory prediction performance of our diffusion model on the commonly used ETH/UCY benchmark and evaluate the closed-loop performance of our robot navigation method in simulation and extensive real-robot experiments demonstrating safe, efficient, and reactive robot motion.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)</p></details> |

Modeling the environment risk information by field is a promising and effective approach for safe trajectory planning. However, existing risk assessment theories only analyze the risk by current information, ignoring future prediction. This paper proposes a predictive risk analysis and safe trajectory planning framework for intelligent and connected vehicles. This framework first predicts future trajectories of objects by a local risk-aware algorithm, following with a spatiotemporal-discretised predictive risk analysis using the prediction results. Then the safe trajectory is generated based on the predictive risk analysis. Finally, simulation and vehicle experiments confirm the efficacy and real-time practicability of our approach.</p></details> |  |

Principal component analysis (PCA) is applied to trajectory data consisting of $n_s = 4,000,000$ datapoints, of the FPUT $\beta$ model with $N = 32$ coupled oscillators, revealing a critical relationship between $m^{\ast}$ and the model's nonlinear strength. By estimating the intrinsic dimension $m^{\ast}$ using multiple methods (participation ratio, Kaiser rule, and the Kneedle algorithm), it is found that $m^{\ast}$ increases with the model nonlinearity. Interestingly, in the weakly nonlinear regime, for trajectories initialized by exciting the first mode, the participation ratio estimates $m^{\ast} = 2, 3$, strongly suggesting that quasi-periodic motion on a low-dimensional Riemannian manifold underlies the characteristic energy recurrences observed in the FPUT model.</p></details> | 15 pages, 15 figures |
| **[Consistency Trajectory Matching for One-Step Generative Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20349v3)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current diffusion-based super-resolution (SR) approaches achieve commendable performance at the cost of high inference overhead. Therefore, distillation techniques are utilized to accelerate the multi-step teacher model into one-step student model. Nevertheless, these methods significantly raise training costs and constrain the performance of the student model by the teacher model. To overcome these tough challenges, we propose Consistency Trajectory Matching for Super-Resolution (CTMSR), a distillation-free strategy that is able to generate photo-realistic SR results in one step. Concretely, we first formulate a Probability Flow Ordinary Differential Equation (PF-ODE) trajectory to establish a deterministic mapping from low-resolution (LR) images with noise to high-resolution (HR) images. Then we apply the Consistency Training (CT) strategy to directly learn the mapping in one step, eliminating the necessity of pre-trained diffusion model. To further enhance the performance and better leverage the ground-truth during the training process, we aim to align the distribution of SR results more closely with that of the natural images. To this end, we propose to minimize the discrepancy between their respective PF-ODE trajectories from the LR image distribution by our meticulously designed Distribution Trajectory Matching (DTM) loss, resulting in improved realism of our recovered HR images. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods can attain comparable or even superior capabilities on both synthetic and real datasets while maintaining minimal inference latency.</p></details> |  |

To support real-time sensing and conserve the limited energy budget of the HAPs, the proposed framework assumes that the acquired radar data are transmitted in real time to a ground base station for SAR image reconstruction. A dynamic trajectory model is developed, and the power consumption associated with radar sensing, data transmission, and circular flight is comprehensively analyzed. In addition, solar energy harvesting is considered to enhance system sustainability. An energy-aware mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem is formulated to maximize radar beam coverage while satisfying operational constraints. To solve this challenging problem, a sub-optimal successive convex approximation (SCA)-based framework is proposed, incorporating iterative optimization and finite search. Simulation results validate the convergence of the proposed algorithm and demonstrate its effectiveness in balancing SAR performance, communication reliability, and energy efficiency. A final SAR imaging simulation on a 9-target lattice scenario further confirms the practical feasibility of the proposed solution.</p></details> |  |

However, models can suffer from mode collapse, where only the most likely mode is predicted, posing significant safety risks. While existing methods employ various strategies to generate diverse predictions, they often overlook the diversity in interaction modes among agents. Additionally, traditional metrics for evaluating prediction models are dataset-dependent and do not evaluate inter-agent interactions quantitatively. To our knowledge, none of the existing metrics explicitly evaluates mode collapse. In this paper, we propose a novel evaluation framework that assesses mode collapse in joint trajectory predictions, focusing on safety-critical interactions. We introduce metrics for mode collapse, mode correctness, and coverage, emphasizing the sequential dimension of predictions. By testing four multi-agent trajectory prediction models, we demonstrate that mode collapse indeed happens. When looking at the sequential dimension, although prediction accuracy improves closer to interaction events, there are still cases where the models are unable to predict the correct interaction mode, even just before the interaction mode becomes inevitable. We hope that our framework can help researchers gain new insights and advance the development of more consistent and accurate prediction models, thus enhancing the safety of autonomous driving systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 8 figures, submitted to a journal</p></details> |

| **[Aircraft Trajectory Dataset Augmentation in Latent Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07585v2)** | 2025-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aircraft trajectory modeling plays a crucial role in Air Traffic Management (ATM) and is important for various downstream tasks, including conflict detection and landing time prediction. Dataset augmentation through the addition of synthetically generated trajectory data is necessary to develop a more robust aircraft trajectory model and ensure that the trajectory dataset is sufficient and balanced. In this work, we propose a novel framework called ATRADA for aircraft trajectory dataset augmentation. In the proposed framework, a Transformer encoder learns the underlying patterns in the original trajectory dataset and converts each data point into a context vector in the learned latent space. The converted dataset in the latent space is projected into reduced dimensions using principal component analysis (PCA), and a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is applied to fit the probability distribution of the data points in the reduced-dimensional space. Finally, new samples are drawn from the fitted GMM, the dimension of the samples is reverted to the original dimension, and they are decoded with a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). Several experiments demonstrate that the framework effectively generates new, high-quality synthetic aircraft trajectory data, which were compared to the results of several baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Global Optimization of Multi-Flyby Trajectories for Multi-Orbital-Plane Constellations Inspection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02943v1)** | 2025-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid expansion of mega-constellations in low Earth orbits has posed significant challenges to space traffic management, necessitating periodic inspections of satellites to ensure the sustainability of the space environment when economically feasible. This study addresses the orbital design challenge associated with inspecting numerous satellites distributed across multiple orbital planes through flybys by proposing an innovative orbital-plane-based inspection strategy. The proposed methodology reformulates the multi-satellite flyby problem into a multi-rendezvous trajectory planning problem by proposing an analytical approach to determine a maneuver-free inspection orbit that enables flyby of all satellites within a specific orbital plane. Additionally, a three-layer global optimization framework is developed to tackle this problem. The first layer establishes an approximate cost evaluation model for orbital plane visitation sequences, utilizing a genetic algorithm to identify the optimal sequence from a vast array of candidate planes, thereby maximizing inspection targets while minimizing fuel consumption. The second layer constructs a mixed-integer programming model to locally refine the rendezvous epochs and orbital parameters of each inspection orbit to reduce the total velocity increment. The third layer accurately computes the optimal impulsive maneuvers and trajectories between inspection orbits. In contrast to traditional low-Earth orbit rendezvous optimization frameworks, the proposed framework fully leverages the adjustable freedom in inclination and right ascension of the ascending node (RAAN) of inspection orbits, significantly reducing the total velocity increment. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively address the trajectory optimization problem associated with constellation inspection for tens of thousands of satellites.</p></details> |  |

Trajectory enabled Unified Online Detection of Adversarial Examples and Backdoor Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22722v1)** | 2025-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proposed UniGuard is the first unified online detection framework capable of simultaneously addressing adversarial examples and backdoor attacks. UniGuard builds upon two key insights: first, both AE and backdoor attacks have to compromise the inference phase, making it possible to tackle them simultaneously during run-time via online detection. Second, an adversarial input, whether a perturbed sample in AE attacks or a trigger-carrying sample in backdoor attacks, exhibits distinctive trajectory signatures from a benign sample as it propagates through the layers of a DL model in forward inference. The propagation trajectory of the adversarial sample must deviate from that of its benign counterpart; otherwise, the adversarial objective cannot be fulfilled. Detecting these trajectory signatures is inherently challenging due to their subtlety; UniGuard overcomes this by treating the propagation trajectory as a time-series signal, leveraging LSTM and spectrum transformation to amplify differences between adversarial and benign trajectories that are subtle in the time domain. UniGuard exceptional efficiency and effectiveness have been extensively validated across various modalities (image, text, and audio) and tasks (classification and regression), ranging from diverse model architectures against a wide range of AE attacks and backdoor attacks, including challenging partial backdoors and dynamic triggers. When compared to SOTA methods, including ContraNet (NDSS 22) specific for AE detection and TED (IEEE SP 24) specific for backdoor detection, UniGuard consistently demonstrates superior performance, even when matched against each method's strengths in addressing their respective threats-each SOTA fails to parts of attack strategies while UniGuard succeeds for all.</p></details> |  |

However, the demand charge component in the monthly electricity cost, make it difficult to be encapsulated in additive stage costs, and can make solutions violate the principle of optimality if naively introduced in the objective function. Moreover, previous EMPC based works mostly rely on a-priori knowledge of an optimal economic steady state or optimal periodic trajectory for performance guarantees, which are not useful or possibly don't exist respectively, for real-time economical MG dispatch where load/generation forecasts are known only 24-48 h in advance. This paper, first, proposes an EMPC formulation for a generic deterministic discrete non-linear time varying system with hard state and input constraints, without any a-priori requirements of an optimal economic steady state or optimal periodic trajectory. It is proved that under mild assumptions on terminal cost and region, the asymptotic average economic cost of the proposed method is no worse than the asymptotic average economic cost of any other non-fixed arbitrary reference trajectory which is known only until the current time-step. The EMPC framework is then leveraged for optimal MG dispatch by showing that the problem can be reformulated to satisfy the assumptions required for the asymptotic performance guarantee. Realistic simulations at the Port of San Diego MG demonstrated that the proposed method can also reduce monthly electricity costs in closed-loop with respect to reference trajectories generated by directly optimizing the electricity cost function over the prediction horizon or by tracking an ideal grid import curve in a majority of the cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 4 tables, Manuscript under review</p></details> |
| **[Pedestrian Intention and Trajectory Prediction in Unstructured Traffic Using IDD-PeD](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22111v1)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancements in autonomous driving, accurately predicting pedestrian behavior has become essential for ensuring safety in complex and unpredictable traffic conditions. The growing interest in this challenge highlights the need for comprehensive datasets that capture unstructured environments, enabling the development of more robust prediction models to enhance pedestrian safety and vehicle navigation. In this paper, we introduce an Indian driving pedestrian dataset designed to address the complexities of modeling pedestrian behavior in unstructured environments, such as illumination changes, occlusion of pedestrians, unsignalized scene types and vehicle-pedestrian interactions. The dataset provides high-level and detailed low-level comprehensive annotations focused on pedestrians requiring the ego-vehicle's attention. Evaluation of the state-of-the-art intention prediction methods on our dataset shows a significant performance drop of up to $\mathbf{15\%}$, while trajectory prediction methods underperform with an increase of up to $\mathbf{1208}$ MSE, defeating standard pedestrian datasets. Additionally, we present exhaustive quantitative and qualitative analysis of intention and trajectory baselines. We believe that our dataset will open new challenges for the pedestrian behavior research community to build robust models.

While many models have been developed towards this end, effectively capturing and predicting the variability inherent to human behavior still remains an open challenge. This paper proposes TrajFlow - a new approach for probabilistic trajectory prediction based on Normalizing Flows. We reformulate the problem of capturing distributions over trajectories into capturing distributions over abstracted trajectory features using an autoencoder, simplifying the learning task of the Normalizing Flows. TrajFlow outperforms state-of-the-art behavior prediction models in capturing full trajectory distributions in two synthetic benchmarks with known true distributions, and is competitive on the naturalistic datasets ETH/UCY, rounD, and nuScenes. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of TrajFlow in probabilistic prediction of human behavior.</p></details> |  |

However, how to model the representation of trajectory-level data presents a significant challenge that has not been systematically addressed amid explosive trajectory data growth. In this work, we introduce Multimodal Trajectory Retrieval, bridging the gap between universal retrieval and agent-centric trajectory modeling. We construct the Unified Agent Trajectory Dataset (UATD) from annotated demonstrations and states across diverse real-world scenarios. Based on this, we present GAE-Bench, a benchmark containing a large number of trajectory-based retrieval pairs. In addition, we propose GAE-Retriever, a multimodal retrieval framework that adopts vision-language models and incorporates optimized contrastive learning through a token selection and the GradCache mechanism. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple datasets show that GAE-Retriever consistently outperforms strong baselines in retrieval recall, highlighting its effectiveness in advancing multimodal trajectory retrieval.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 3 figures, accepted by Workshop on Computer-use Agents @ ICML 2025</p></details> |

Despite their utility in advancing digital automation, a critical bottleneck persists: collecting high-quality trajectory data for training. Common practices for collecting such data rely on human supervision or synthetic data generation through executing pre-defined tasks, which are either resource-intensive or unable to guarantee data quality. Moreover, these methods suffer from limited data diversity and significant gaps between synthetic data and real-world environments. To address these challenges, we propose OS-Genesis, a novel GUI data synthesis pipeline that reverses the conventional trajectory collection process. Instead of relying on pre-defined tasks, OS-Genesis enables agents first to perceive environments and perform step-wise interactions, then retrospectively derive high-quality tasks to enable trajectory-level exploration. A trajectory reward model is then employed to ensure the quality of the generated trajectories. We demonstrate that training GUI agents with OS-Genesis significantly improves their performance on highly challenging online benchmarks. In-depth analysis further validates OS-Genesis's efficiency and its superior data quality and diversity compared to existing synthesis methods. Our codes, data, and checkpoints are available at https://qiushisun.github.io/OS-Genesis-Home/.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACL 2...</summary><p>ACL 2025 Camera Ready</p></details> |

However, this requires that the dataset be labeled by a reward function. In applied settings such as video game development, the availability of the reward function is not always guaranteed. This paper proposes Trajectory-Ranked OFfline Inverse reinforcement learning (TROFI), a novel approach to effectively learn a policy offline without a pre-defined reward function. TROFI first learns a reward function from human preferences, which it then uses to label the original dataset making it usable for training the policy. In contrast to other approaches, our method does not require optimal trajectories. Through experiments on the D4RL benchmark we demonstrate that TROFI consistently outperforms baselines and performs comparably to using the ground truth reward to learn policies. Additionally, we validate the efficacy of our method in a 3D game environment. Our studies of the reward model highlight the importance of the reward function in this setting: we show that to ensure the alignment of a value function to the actual future discounted reward, it is fundamental to have a well-engineered and easy-to-learn reward function.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at Reinforcement Learning and Video Games Workshop at RLC 2025</p></details> |

This paper proposes a trajectory tracking controller based on Active Disturbance Rejection Control (ADRC) implemented on the DUS V2500. A custom simulation incorporating realistic waves and current disturbances is developed to validate the controller's performance, supported by further validation through field tests in the harbour of Scheveningen, the Netherlands, and at sea. Simulation results demonstrate that ADRC significantly reduces cross-track error across all tested conditions compared to a baseline PID controller but increases control effort and energy consumption. Field trials confirm these findings while revealing a further increase in energy consumption during sea trials compared to the baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at IROS 2025.

Unlike prevailing data-driven methods that primarily rely on supervised learning, in this paper, we introduce a novel Graph-oriented Inverse Reinforcement Learning (GoIRL) framework, which is an IRL-based predictor equipped with vectorized context representations. We develop a feature adaptor to effectively aggregate lane-graph features into grid space, enabling seamless integration with the maximum entropy IRL paradigm to infer the reward distribution and obtain the policy that can be sampled to induce multiple plausible plans. Furthermore, conditioned on the sampled plans, we implement a hierarchical parameterized trajectory generator with a refinement module to enhance prediction accuracy and a probability fusion strategy to boost prediction confidence. Extensive experimental results showcase our approach not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale Argoverse & nuScenes motion forecasting benchmarks but also exhibits superior generalization abilities compared to existing supervised models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **[IMPACT: Behavioral Intention-aware Multimodal Trajectory Prediction with Adaptive Context Trimming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09103v2)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While most prior research has focused on improving the precision of multimodal trajectory predictions, the explicit modeling of multimodal behavioral intentions (e.g., yielding, overtaking) remains relatively underexplored. This paper proposes a unified framework that jointly predicts both behavioral intentions and trajectories to enhance prediction accuracy, interpretability, and efficiency. Specifically, we employ a shared context encoder for both intention and trajectory predictions, thereby reducing structural redundancy and information loss. Moreover, we address the lack of ground-truth behavioral intention labels in mainstream datasets (Waymo, Argoverse) by auto-labeling these datasets, thus advancing the community's efforts in this direction. We further introduce a vectorized occupancy prediction module that infers the probability of each map polyline being occupied by the target vehicle's future trajectory. By leveraging these intention and occupancy prediction priors, our method conducts dynamic, modality-dependent pruning of irrelevant agents and map polylines in the decoding stage, effectively reducing computational overhead and mitigating noise from non-critical elements. Our approach ranks first among LiDAR-free methods on the Waymo Motion Dataset and achieves first place on the Waymo Interactive Prediction Dataset. Remarkably, even without model ensembling, our single-model framework improves the soft mean average precision (softmAP) by 10 percent compared to the second-best method in the Waymo Interactive Prediction Leaderboard. Furthermore, the proposed framework has been successfully deployed on real vehicles, demonstrating its practical effectiveness in real-world applications.</p></details> | under review |

Our approach integrates several novel contributions, including a tailored object detector optimized for high-altitude bird's-eye view perspectives, a unique track stabilization method that uses detected vehicle bounding boxes as exclusion masks during image registration, and an orthophoto and master frame-based georeferencing strategy that enhances consistent alignment across multiple drone viewpoints. Additionally, our framework features robust vehicle dimension estimation and detailed road segmentation, enabling comprehensive traffic analysis. Conducted in the Songdo International Business District, South Korea, the study utilized a multi-drone experiment covering 20 intersections, capturing approximately 12TB of 4K video data over four days. The framework produced two high-quality datasets: the Songdo Traffic dataset, comprising approximately 700,000 unique vehicle trajectories, and the Songdo Vision dataset, containing over 5,000 human-annotated images with about 300,000 vehicle instances in four classes. Comparisons with high-precision sensor data from an instrumented probe vehicle highlight the accuracy and consistency of our extraction pipeline in dense urban environments. The public release of Songdo Traffic and Songdo Vision, and the complete source code for the extraction pipeline, establishes new benchmarks in data quality, reproducibility, and scalability in traffic research. Results demonstrate the potential of integrating drone technology with advanced computer vision for precise and cost-effective urban traffic monitoring, providing valuable resources for developing intelligent transportation systems and enhancing traffic management strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Interpretable and Efficient Feature Selection in Trajectory Datasets: A Taxonomic Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20359v1)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory analysis is not only about obtaining movement data, but it is also of paramount importance in understanding the pattern in which an object moves through space and time, as well as in predicting its next move. Due to the significant interest in the area, data collection has improved substantially, resulting in a large number of features becoming available for training and predicting models. However, this introduces a high-dimensionality-induced feature explosion problem, which reduces the efficiency and interpretability of the data, thereby reducing the accuracy of machine learning models. To overcome this issue, feature selection has become one of the most prevalent tools. Thus, the objective of this paper was to introduce a taxonomy-based feature selection method that categorizes features based on their internal structure. This approach classifies the data into geometric and kinematic features, further categorizing them into curvature, indentation, speed, and acceleration. The comparative analysis indicated that a taxonomy-based approach consistently achieved comparable or superior predictive performance. Furthermore, due to the taxonomic grouping, which reduces combinatorial space, the time taken to select features was drastically reduced. The taxonomy was also used to gain insights into what feature sets each dataset was more sensitive to. Overall, this study provides robust evidence that a taxonomy-based feature selection method can add a layer of interpretability, reduce dimensionality and computational complexity, and contribute to high-level decision-making. It serves as a step toward providing a methodological framework for researchers and practitioners dealing with trajectory datasets and contributing to the broader field of explainable artificial intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[RA-NeRF: Robust Neural Radiance Field Reconstruction with Accurate Camera Pose Estimation under Complex Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15242v2)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have emerged as powerful tools for 3D reconstruction and SLAM tasks. However, their performance depends heavily on accurate camera pose priors. Existing approaches attempt to address this issue by introducing external constraints but fall short of achieving satisfactory accuracy, particularly when camera trajectories are complex. In this paper, we propose a novel method, RA-NeRF, capable of predicting highly accurate camera poses even with complex camera trajectories. Following the incremental pipeline, RA-NeRF reconstructs the scene using NeRF with photometric consistency and incorporates flow-driven pose regulation to enhance robustness during initialization and localization. Additionally, RA-NeRF employs an implicit pose filter to capture the camera movement pattern and eliminate the noise for pose estimation. To validate our method, we conduct extensive experiments on the Tanks\&Temple dataset for standard evaluation, as well as the NeRFBuster dataset, which presents challenging camera pose trajectories. On both datasets, RA-NeRF achieves state-of-the-art results in both camera pose estimation and visual quality, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness in scene reconstruction under complex pose trajectories.</p></details> | IROS 2025 |

The model integrates a learnable component that predicts robot-terrain interaction forces with a neural-symbolic layer that enforces the laws of classical mechanics and consequently improves generalization on out-of-distribution data. The neural-symbolic layer includes a differentiable physics engine that computes the robot's trajectory by querying these forces at the points of contact with the terrain. As the proposed architecture comprises substantial geometrical and physics priors, the resulting model can also be seen as a learnable physics engine conditioned on real sensor data that delivers $10^4$ trajectories per second. We argue and empirically demonstrate that this architecture reduces the sim-to-real gap and mitigates out-of-distribution sensitivity. The differentiability, in conjunction with the rapid simulation speed, makes the model well-suited for various applications including model predictive control, trajectory shooting, supervised and reinforcement learning, or SLAM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/ctu-vras/fusionforce</p></details> |
| **[Pseudo-Kinematic Trajectory Control and Planning of Tracked Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18641v2)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tracked vehicles distribute their weight continuously over a large surface area (the tracks). This distinctive feature makes them the preferred choice for vehicles required to traverse soft and uneven terrain. From a robotics perspective, however, this flexibility comes at a cost: the complexity of modelling the system and the resulting difficulty in designing theoretically sound navigation solutions. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap by proposing a framework for the navigation of tracked vehicles, built upon three key pillars. The first pillar comprises two models: a simulation model and a control-oriented model. The simulation model captures the intricate terramechanics dynamics arising from soil-track interaction and is employed to develop faithful digital twins of the system across a wide range of operating conditions. The control-oriented model is pseudo-kinematic and mathematically tractable, enabling the design of efficient and theoretically robust control schemes. The second pillar is a Lyapunov-based feedback trajectory controller that provides certifiable tracking guarantees. The third pillar is a portfolio of motion planning solutions, each offering different complexity-accuracy trade-offs. The various components of the proposed approach are validated through an extensive set of simulation and experimental data.</p></details> |  |

The study highlights the significant impact of these technologies in automotive and autonomous vehicles, surveillance and security, healthcare, and industrial automation, contributing to safety and efficiency. Despite the progress, challenges such as improved generalization, computational efficiency, reduced data dependency, and ethical considerations still exist.

In this work, we present a reinforcement-learning framework for multi-setpoint and multi-trajectory tracking. Tracking multiple setpoints and time-varying trajectories in reinforcement learning is challenging due to the complexity of balancing multiple objectives, a difficulty further exacerbated by system uncertainties such as uncertain initial conditions and stochastic dynamics. This challenge is relevant, e.g., in bioprocesses involving microbial consortia, where precise control over population compositions is required. We introduce a novel return function based on multiplicative reciprocal saturation functions, which explicitly couples reward gains to the simultaneous satisfaction of multiple references. Through a case study involving light-mediated cybergenetic growth control in microbial consortia, we demonstrate via computational experiments that our approach achieves faster convergence, improved stability, and superior control compliance compared to conventional quadratic-cost-based return functions. Moreover, our method enables tuning of the saturation function's parameters, shaping the learning process and policy updates. By incorporating system uncertainties, our framework also demonstrates robustness, a key requirement in industrial bioprocessing. Overall, this work advances reinforcement-learning-based control strategies in bioprocess engineering, with implications in the broader field of process and systems engineering.</p></details> |  |
| **[Augmenting Multi-Agent Communication with State Delta Trajectory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19209v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent techniques such as role playing or multi-turn debates have been shown to be effective in improving the performance of large language models (LLMs) in downstream tasks. Despite their differences in workflows, existing LLM-based multi-agent systems mostly use natural language for agent communication. While this is appealing for its simplicity and interpretability, it also introduces inevitable information loss as one model must down sample its continuous state vectors to concrete tokens before transferring them to the other model. Such losses are particularly significant when the information to transfer is not simple facts, but reasoning logics or abstractive thoughts. To tackle this problem, we propose a new communication protocol that transfers both natural language tokens and token-wise state transition trajectory from one agent to another. Particularly, compared to the actual state value, we find that the sequence of state changes in LLMs after generating each token can better reflect the information hidden behind the inference process, so we propose a State Delta Encoding (SDE) method to represent state transition trajectories. The experimental results show that multi-agent systems with SDE achieve SOTA performance compared to other communication protocols, particularly in tasks that involve complex reasoning. This shows the potential of communication augmentation for LLM-based multi-agent systems.</p></details> | 22 pages, 5 figures |

While robotic manipulators offer high precision, versatility, and productivity, they exhibit expressionless and monotonous motions that conceal the robot's intention, resulting in a lack of efficiency and transparency with humans. In this work, we use Laban notation, a dance annotation language, to enable robotic manipulators to generate trajectories with functional expressivity, where the robot uses nonverbal cues to communicate its abilities and the likelihood of succeeding at its task. We achieve this by introducing two novel variants of Hesitant expressive motion (Spoke-Like and Arc-Like). We also enhance the emotional expressivity of four existing emotive trajectories (Happy, Sad, Shy, and Angry) by augmenting Laban Effort usage with Laban Shape. The functionally expressive motions are validated via a human-subjects study, where participants equate both variants of Hesitant motion with reduced robot competency. The enhanced emotive trajectories are shown to be viewed as distinct emotions using the Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) spectrum, corroborating the usage of Laban Shape.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at the 2025 IEEE RO-MAN Conference</p></details> |

Previous PRMs are primarily trained on model final output responses and struggle to evaluate intermediate thinking trajectories robustly, especially in the emerging setting of trajectory-response outputs generated by frontier reasoning models like Deepseek-R1. In this work, we introduce ReasonFlux-PRM, a novel trajectory-aware PRM explicitly designed to evaluate the trajectory-response type of reasoning traces. ReasonFlux-PRM incorporates both step-level and trajectory-level supervision, enabling fine-grained reward assignment aligned with structured chain-of-thought data. We adapt ReasonFlux-PRM to support reward supervision under both offline and online settings, including (i) selecting high-quality model distillation data for downstream supervised fine-tuning of smaller models, (ii) providing dense process-level rewards for policy optimization during reinforcement learning, and (iii) enabling reward-guided Best-of-N test-time scaling. Empirical results on challenging downstream benchmarks such as AIME, MATH500, and GPQA-Diamond demonstrate that ReasonFlux-PRM-7B selects higher quality data than strong PRMs (e.g., Qwen2.5-Math-PRM-72B) and human-curated baselines. Furthermore, our derived ReasonFlux-PRM-7B yields consistent performance improvements, achieving average gains of 12.1% in supervised fine-tuning, 4.5% in reinforcement learning, and 6.3% in test-time scaling. We also release our efficient ReasonFlux-PRM-1.5B for resource-constrained applications and edge deployment.

These agents operate by autonomously generating natural language thoughts, invoking external tools, and iteratively refining their solutions. Despite their widespread adoption, the internal decision-making processes of these agents remain largely unexplored, limiting our understanding of their operational dynamics and failure modes. In this paper, we present a large-scale empirical study of the thought-action-result trajectories of three state-of-the-art LLM-based agents: \textsc{RepairAgent}, \textsc{AutoCodeRover}, and \textsc{OpenHands}. We unify their interaction logs into a common format, capturing 120 trajectories and 2822 LLM interactions focused on program repair and issue resolution. Our study combines quantitative analyses of structural properties, action patterns, and token usage with qualitative assessments of reasoning coherence and feedback integration. We identify key trajectory characteristics such as iteration counts and token consumption, recurring action sequences, and the semantic coherence linking thoughts, actions, and their results. Our findings reveal behavioral motifs and anti-patterns that distinguish successful from failed executions, providing actionable insights for improving agent design, including prompting strategies, failure diagnosis, and anti-pattern detection. We release our dataset and annotation framework to support further research on transparent and robust autonomous software engineering agents.</p></details> |  |

While statistically grounded criteria are primarily relied upon, clinical relevance is gradually emphasized in medicine to ensure that the identified trajectory heterogeneity appropriately reflects changes in a disease or symptom over time. However, such considerations are often judged through visual comparisons, without concrete approaches for their application. To address this, the Area Between Trajectories (ABTs) was introduced as insights for quantifying trajectory group differences. Using a simulated sleep quality dataset, GBTM was applied to build and compare models.

Relying on a single predicted path, as in regression-based approaches, usually does not explicitly assess the safety of the predicted trajectory. Selection-based methods address this by generating and scoring multiple trajectory candidates and predicting the safety score for each, but face optimization challenges in precisely selecting the best option from thousands of possibilities and distinguishing subtle but safety-critical differences, especially in rare or underrepresented scenarios. We propose DriveSuprim to overcome these challenges and advance the selection-based paradigm through a coarse-to-fine paradigm for progressive candidate filtering, a rotation-based augmentation method to improve robustness in out-of-distribution scenarios, and a self-distillation framework to stabilize training. DriveSuprim achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching 93.5% PDMS in NAVSIM v1 and 87.1% EPDMS in NAVSIM v2 without extra data, demonstrating superior safetycritical capabilities, including collision avoidance and compliance with rules, while maintaining high trajectory quality in various driving scenarios.</p></details> | 15 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Leveling the Playing Field: Carefully Comparing Classical and Learned Controllers for Quadrotor Trajectory Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17832v1)** | 2025-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning-based control approaches like reinforcement learning (RL) have recently produced a slew of impressive results for tasks like quadrotor trajectory tracking and drone racing. Naturally, it is common to demonstrate the advantages of these new controllers against established methods like analytical controllers. We observe, however, that reliably comparing the performance of such very different classes of controllers is more complicated than might appear at first sight. As a case study, we take up the problem of agile tracking of an end-effector for a quadrotor with a fixed arm. We develop a set of best practices for synthesizing the best-in-class RL and geometric controllers (GC) for benchmarking. In the process, we resolve widespread RL-favoring biases in prior studies that provide asymmetric access to: (1) the task definition, in the form of an objective function, (2) representative datasets, for parameter optimization, and (3) feedforward information, describing the desired future trajectory. The resulting findings are the following: our improvements to the experimental protocol for comparing learned and classical controllers are critical, and each of the above asymmetries can yield misleading conclusions. Prior works have claimed that RL outperforms GC, but we find the gaps between the two controller classes are much smaller than previously published when accounting for symmetric comparisons. Geometric control achieves lower steady-state error than RL, while RL has better transient performance, resulting in GC performing better in relatively slow or less agile tasks, but RL performing better when greater agility is required. Finally, we open-source implementations of geometric and RL controllers for these aerial vehicles, implementing best practices for future development.

| **[Trajectory Prediction for Autonomous Driving: Progress, Limitations, and Future Directions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03262v2)** | 2025-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the potential for autonomous vehicles to be integrated on a large scale into modern traffic systems continues to grow, ensuring safe navigation in dynamic environments is crucial for smooth integration. To guarantee safety and prevent collisions, autonomous vehicles must be capable of accurately predicting the trajectories of surrounding traffic agents. Over the past decade, significant efforts from both academia and industry have been dedicated to designing solutions for precise trajectory forecasting. These efforts have produced a diverse range of approaches, raising questions about the differences between these methods and whether trajectory prediction challenges have been fully addressed. This paper reviews a substantial portion of recent trajectory prediction methods proposing a taxonomy to classify existing solutions. A general overview of the prediction pipeline is also provided, covering input and output modalities, modeling features, and prediction paradigms existing in the literature. In addition, the paper discusses active research areas within trajectory prediction, addresses the posed research questions, and highlights the remaining research gaps and challenges.</p></details> |  |
| **[Physics-informed mixture of experts network for interpretable battery degradation trajectory computation amid second-life complexities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17755v1)** | 2025-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retired electric vehicle batteries offer immense potential to support low-carbon energy systems, but uncertainties in their degradation behavior and data inaccessibilities under second-life use pose major barriers to safe and scalable deployment. This work proposes a Physics-Informed Mixture of Experts (PIMOE) network that computes battery degradation trajectories using partial, field-accessible signals in a single cycle. PIMOE leverages an adaptive multi-degradation prediction module to classify degradation modes using expert weight synthesis underpinned by capacity-voltage and relaxation data, producing latent degradation trend embeddings. These are input to a use-dependent recurrent network for long-term trajectory prediction. Validated on 207 batteries across 77 use conditions and 67,902 cycles, PIMOE achieves an average mean absolute percentage (MAPE) errors of 0.88% with a 0.43 ms inference time. Compared to the state-of-the-art Informer and PatchTST, it reduces computational time and MAPE by 50%, respectively. Compatible with random state of charge region sampling, PIMOE supports 150-cycle forecasts with 1.50% average and 6.26% maximum MAPE, and operates effectively even with pruned 5MB training data. Broadly, PIMOE framework offers a deployable, history-free solution for battery degradation trajectory computation, redefining how second-life energy storage systems are assessed, optimized, and integrated into the sustainable energy landscape.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory tracking control of USV with actuator constraints in the presence of disturbances](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17005v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>All practical systems often pose a problem of finite control capability, which can notably degrade the performance if not properly addressed. Since actuator input bounds are typically known, integrating actuator saturation considerations into the control law design process can lead to enhanced performance and more precise trajectory tracking. Also, the actuators cannot provide the demanded forces or torques instantaneously; hence, there is a limitation on the rate of magnitude. This work proposes nonlinear feedback controller designs developed using the Lyapunov stability and backstepping method while actively considering the actuator magnitude and rate constraints. The system dynamics are augmented with a smooth control input saturation model. Additionally, an observer is incorporated to estimate the disturbance vector. Through Lyapunov stability analysis, we demonstrate the system's stability under the proposed controller for the Uncrewed Surface Vessel (USV), ensuring adherence to actuator constraints provided their initial values fall within the prescribed bounds. Extensive numerical simulations performed by considering various trajectories and multiple initial conditions demonstrate the effectiveness of the controller in maintaining tracking performance without violating actuator constraints. This work also relaxes the assumption of equally capable actuators to be used to control the motion of USVs, affirming the viability of the controller in practical applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[TrajSceneLLM: A Multimodal Perspective on Semantic GPS Trajectory Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16401v1)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>GPS trajectory data reveals valuable patterns of human mobility and urban dynamics, supporting a variety of spatial applications. However, traditional methods often struggle to extract deep semantic representations and incorporate contextual map information. We propose TrajSceneLLM, a multimodal perspective for enhancing semantic understanding of GPS trajectories. The framework integrates visualized map images (encoding spatial context) and textual descriptions generated through LLM reasoning (capturing temporal sequences and movement dynamics). Separate embeddings are generated for each modality and then concatenated to produce trajectory scene embeddings with rich semantic content which are further paired with a simple MLP classifier. We validate the proposed framework on Travel Mode Identification (TMI), a critical task for analyzing travel choices and understanding mobility behavior. Our experiments show that these embeddings achieve significant performance improvement, highlighting the advantage of our LLM-driven method in capturing deep spatio-temporal dependencies and reducing reliance on handcrafted features. This semantic enhancement promises significant potential for diverse downstream applications and future research in geospatial artificial intelligence.

| **[VideoGAN-based Trajectory Proposal for Automated Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16209v1)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Being able to generate realistic trajectory options is at the core of increasing the degree of automation of road vehicles. While model-driven, rule-based, and classical learning-based methods are widely used to tackle these tasks at present, they can struggle to effectively capture the complex, multimodal distributions of future trajectories. In this paper we investigate whether a generative adversarial network (GAN) trained on videos of bird's-eye view (BEV) traffic scenarios can generate statistically accurate trajectories that correctly capture spatial relationships between the agents. To this end, we propose a pipeline that uses low-resolution BEV occupancy grid videos as training data for a video generative model. From the generated videos of traffic scenarios we extract abstract trajectory data using single-frame object detection and frame-to-frame object matching. We particularly choose a GAN architecture for the fast training and inference times with respect to diffusion models. We obtain our best results within 100 GPU hours of training, with inference times under 20\,ms. We demonstrate the physical realism of the proposed trajectories in terms of distribution alignment of spatial and dynamic parameters with respect to the ground truth videos from the Waymo Open Motion Dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhanced Trust Region Sequential Convex Optimization for Multi-Drone Thermal Screening Trajectory Planning in Urban Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06012v2)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid detection of abnormal body temperatures in urban populations is essential for managing public health risks, especially during outbreaks of infectious diseases. Multi-drone thermal screening systems offer promising solutions for fast, large-scale, and non-intrusive human temperature monitoring. However, trajectory planning for multiple drones in complex urban environments poses significant challenges, including collision avoidance, coverage efficiency, and constrained flight environments. In this study, we propose an enhanced trust region sequential convex optimization (TR-SCO) algorithm for optimal trajectory planning of multiple drones performing thermal screening tasks. Our improved algorithm integrates a refined convex optimization formulation within a trust region framework, effectively balancing trajectory smoothness, obstacle avoidance, altitude constraints, and maximum screening coverage. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves trajectory optimality and computational efficiency compared to conventional convex optimization methods. This research provides critical insights and practical contributions toward deploying efficient multi-drone systems for real-time thermal screening in urban areas.

| **[Autonomous Trajectory Optimization for UAVs in Disaster Zone Using Henry Gas Optimization Scheme](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15910v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in a disaster-prone environment plays important role in assisting the rescue services and providing the internet connectivity with the outside world. However, in such a complex environment the selection of optimum trajectory of UAVs is of utmost importance. UAV trajectory optimization deals with finding the shortest path in the minimal possible time. In this paper, a cluster optimization scheme (COS) is proposed using the Henry gas optimization (HGO) metaheuristic algorithm to identify the shortest path having minimal transportation cost and algorithm complexity. The mathematical model is designed for COS using the HGO algorithm and compared with the state-of-the-art metaheuristic algorithms such as particle swarm optimization (PSO), grey wolf optimization (GWO), cuckoo search algorithm (CSA) and barnacles mating optimizer (BMO). In order to prove the robustness of the proposed model, four different scenarios are evaluated that includes ambient environment, constrict environment, tangled environment, and complex environment. In all the aforementioned scenarios, the HGO algorithm outperforms the existing algorithms. Particularly, in the ambient environment, the HGO algorithm achieves a 39.3% reduction in transportation cost and a 16.8% reduction in computational time as compared to the PSO algorithm. Hence, the HGO algorithm can be used for autonomous trajectory optimization of UAVs in smart cities.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figuers |
| **[TrajDiff: Diffusion Bridge Network with Semantic Alignment for Trajectory Similarity Computation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15898v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the proliferation of location-tracking technologies, massive volumes of trajectory data are continuously being collected. As a fundamental task in trajectory data mining, trajectory similarity computation plays a critical role in a wide range of real-world applications. However, existing learning-based methods face three challenges: First, they ignore the semantic gap between GPS and grid features in trajectories, making it difficult to obtain meaningful trajectory embeddings. Second, the noise inherent in the trajectories, as well as the noise introduced during grid discretization, obscures the true motion patterns of the trajectories. Third, existing methods focus solely on point-wise and pair-wise losses, without utilizing the global ranking information obtained by sorting all trajectories according to their similarity to a given trajectory. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose a novel trajectory similarity computation framework, named TrajDiff. Specifically, the semantic alignment module relies on cross-attention and an attention score mask mechanism with adaptive fusion, effectively eliminating semantic discrepancies between data at two scales and generating a unified representation. Additionally, the DDBM-based Noise-robust Pre-Training introduces the transfer patterns between any two trajectories into the model training process, enhancing the model's noise robustness. Finally, the overall ranking-aware regularization shifts the model's focus from a local to a global perspective, enabling it to capture the holistic ordering information among trajectories. Extensive experiments on three publicly available datasets show that TrajDiff consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. In particular, it achieves an average HR@1 gain of 33.38% across all three evaluation metrics and datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[MENSA: A Multi-Event Network for Survival Analysis with Trajectory-based Likelihood Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06525v3)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce MENSA, a novel deep learning model for multi-event survival analysis, which predicts the time until an instance experiences multiple distinct events based on its features. MENSA learns a shared representation of the input features while capturing the complex dependence structures between events. In practice, it optimizes the sum of the traditional negative log-likelihood across events and a novel trajectory-based likelihood, which encourages the model to learn the temporal order in which events occur. Experiments on real-world clinical datasets demonstrate that MENSA improves risk and time-to-event prediction compared to state-of-the-art models across single-event, competing-risk, and multi-event settings. Moreover, MENSA achieves this with fewer parameters and lower computational cost (FLOPs) than several deep learning baselines, particularly in high-dimensional feature spaces (more than 100 features).</p></details> |  |
| **[Probabilistic Trajectory GOSPA: A Metric for Uncertainty-Aware Multi-Object Tracking Performance Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15148v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a generalization of the trajectory general optimal sub-pattern assignment (GOSPA) metric for evaluating multi-object tracking algorithms that provide trajectory estimates with track-level uncertainties. This metric builds on the recently introduced probabilistic GOSPA metric to account for both the existence and state estimation uncertainties of individual object states. Similar to trajectory GOSPA (TGOSPA), it can be formulated as a multidimensional assignment problem, and its linear programming relaxation--also a valid metric--is computable in polynomial time. Additionally, this metric retains the interpretability of TGOSPA, and we show that its decomposition yields intuitive costs terms associated to expected localization error and existence probability mismatch error for properly detected objects, expected missed and false detection error, and track switch error. The effectiveness of the proposed metric is demonstrated through a simulation study.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Joint UAV Trajectory Planning and LEO Satellite Selection for Data Offloading in Space-Air-Ground Integrated Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12750v2)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the development of low earth orbit (LEO) satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), the space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) becomes a major trend in the next-generation networks. However, due to the instability of heterogeneous communication and time-varying characteristics of SAGIN, it is challenging to meet the remote Internet of Things (IoT) demands for data collection and offloading. In this paper, we investigate a two-phase hierarchical data uplink model in SAGIN. Specifically, UAVs optimize trajectories to enable efficient data collection from IoT devices, and then they transmit the data to LEO satellites with computing capabilities for further processing. The problem is formulated to minimize the total energy consumption for IoT devices, UAVs, and LEO satellites. Since the problem is in the form of mixed-integer nonlinear programming and intractable to solve directly, we decompose it into two phases. In the IoT-UAV phase, we design the algorithm to jointly optimize the IoT pairing, power allocation, and UAVs trajectories. Considering the high dynamic characteristics of LEO satellites, a real-time LEO satellite selection mechanism joint with the Satellite Tool Kit is proposed in the UAV-LEO phase. Finally, simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, with about 10% less energy consumption compared with the benchmark algorithm.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods excel at view interpolation along recorded paths but struggle to generalize to novel trajectories due to limited viewpoints in driving videos. To tackle this challenge, we propose DriveX, a novel free-form driving view synthesis framework, that progressively distills generative prior into the 3D Gaussian model during its optimization. Within this framework, we utilize a video diffusion model to refine the degraded novel trajectory renderings from the in-training Gaussian model, while the restored videos in turn serve as additional supervision for optimizing the 3D Gaussian. Concretely, we craft an inpainting-based video restoration task, which can disentangle the identification of degraded regions from the generative capability of the diffusion model and remove the need of simulating specific degraded pattern in the training of the diffusion model. To further enhance the consistency and fidelity of generated contents, the pseudo ground truth is progressively updated with gradually improved novel trajectory rendering, allowing both components to co-adapt and reinforce each other while minimizing the disruption on the optimization. By tightly integrating 3D scene representation with generative prior, DriveX achieves high-quality view synthesis beyond recorded trajectories in real time--unlocking new possibilities for flexible and realistic driving simulations on free-form trajectories.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |
| **[GC-GAT: Multimodal Vehicular Trajectory Prediction using Graph Goal Conditioning and Cross-context Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11150v2)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting future trajectories of surrounding vehicles heavily relies on what contextual information is given to a motion prediction model. The context itself can be static (lanes, regulatory elements, etc) or dynamic (traffic participants). This paper presents a lane graph-based motion prediction model that first predicts graph-based goal proposals and later fuses them with cross attention over multiple contextual elements. We follow the famous encoder-interactor-decoder architecture where the encoder encodes scene context using lightweight Gated Recurrent Units, the interactor applies cross-context attention over encoded scene features and graph goal proposals, and the decoder regresses multimodal trajectories via Laplacian Mixture Density Network from the aggregated encodings. Using cross-attention over graph-based goal proposals gives robust trajectory estimates since the model learns to attend to future goal-relevant scene elements for the intended agent. We evaluate our work on nuScenes motion prediction dataset, achieving state-of-the-art results.</p></details> |  |

However, due to the imbalance between self-consistency and cross-consistency, these CD-based methods inherently suffer from improper conditional guidance, leading to sub-optimal generation results. To address this issue, we present SegmentDreamer, a novel framework designed to fully unleash the potential of consistency models for high-fidelity text-to-3D generation. Specifically, we reformulate SDS through the proposed Segmented Consistency Trajectory Distillation (SCTD), effectively mitigating the imbalance issues by explicitly defining the relationship between self- and cross-consistency. Moreover, SCTD partitions the Probability Flow Ordinary Differential Equation (PF-ODE) trajectory into multiple sub-trajectories and ensures consistency within each segment, which can theoretically provide a significantly tighter upper bound on distillation error. Additionally, we propose a distillation pipeline for a more swift and stable generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our SegmentDreamer outperforms state-of-the-art methods in visual quality, enabling high-fidelity 3D asset creation through 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025, project page: https://zjhjojo.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[From Marginal to Joint Predictions: Evaluating Scene-Consistent Trajectory Prediction Approaches for Automated Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05254v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate motion prediction of surrounding traffic participants is crucial for the safe and efficient operation of automated vehicles in dynamic environments. Marginal prediction models commonly forecast each agent's future trajectories independently, often leading to sub-optimal planning decisions for an automated vehicle. In contrast, joint prediction models explicitly account for the interactions between agents, yielding socially and physically consistent predictions on a scene level. However, existing approaches differ not only in their problem formulation but also in the model architectures and implementation details used, making it difficult to compare them. In this work, we systematically investigate different approaches to joint motion prediction, including post-processing of the marginal predictions, explicitly training the model for joint predictions, and framing the problem as a generative task. We evaluate each approach in terms of prediction accuracy, multi-modality, and inference efficiency, offering a comprehensive analysis of the strengths and limitations of each approach. Several prediction examples are available at https://frommarginaltojointpred.github.io/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems 2025 (ITSC 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Features: How Dataset Design Influences Multi-Agent Trajectory Prediction Performance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05098v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate trajectory prediction is critical for safe autonomous navigation, yet the impact of dataset design on model performance remains understudied. This work systematically examines how feature selection, cross-dataset transfer, and geographic diversity influence trajectory prediction accuracy in multi-agent settings. We evaluate a state-of-the-art model using our novel L4 Motion Forecasting dataset based on our own data recordings in Germany and the US. This includes enhanced map and agent features. We compare our dataset to the US-centric Argoverse 2 benchmark. First, we find that incorporating supplementary map and agent features unique to our dataset, yields no measurable improvement over baseline features, demonstrating that modern architectures do not need extensive feature sets for optimal performance. The limited features of public datasets are sufficient to capture convoluted interactions without added complexity. Second, we perform cross-dataset experiments to evaluate how effective domain knowledge can be transferred between datasets. Third, we group our dataset by country and check the knowledge transfer between different driving cultures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Discrete Diffusion Trajectory Alignment via Stepwise Decomposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04832v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discrete diffusion models have demonstrated great promise in modeling various sequence data, ranging from human language to biological sequences. Inspired by the success of RL in language models, there is growing interest in further improving the models by alignment with a certain reward. In this work, we propose a novel preference optimization method for masked discrete diffusion models through a principled diffusion trajectory alignment. Instead of applying the reward on the final output and backpropagating the gradient to the entire discrete denoising process, we decompose the problem into a set of stepwise alignment objectives. This framework enables efficient diffusion optimization, is compatible with arbitrary reward functions, and importantly, guarantees an equivalent optimal solution under additive factorization of the trajectory reward. Experiments across multiple domains including DNA sequence design, protein inverse folding, and language modeling consistently demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Notably, it achieves an up to 12\% improvement over the most competitive RL-based baseline in terms of predicted activity on DNA sequence design, and further improves the GSM8K score from 78.6 to 80.7 on LLaDA-8B-Instruct for language modeling.</p></details> | 22 pages, 3 figures |

The neural representation of a set is used as the terminal set constraint for a model predictive control (MPC) local planner, resulting in improved recursive feasibility and safety. To achieve real-time performance and desired generalization properties, we employ the idea of hypernetworks. We use the Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis as the source of supervision during the training process, allowing us to consider general nonlinear dynamics and arbitrary constraints. The proposed method is extensively evaluated against relevant baselines in simulations for different environments and robot dynamics. The results show an increase in success rate of up to 52% compared to the best baseline while maintaining comparable execution speed. Additionally, we deploy our proposed method, NTC-MPC, on a physical robot and demonstrate its ability to safely avoid obstacles in scenarios where the baselines fail.</p></details> |  |
| **[Risk-Aware Trajectory Optimization and Control for an Underwater Suspended Robotic System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04640v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper focuses on the trajectory optimization of an underwater suspended robotic system comprising an uncrewed surface vessel (USV) and an uncrewed underwater vehicle (UUV) for autonomous litter collection. The key challenge lies in the significant uncertainty in drag and weight parameters introduced by the collected litter. We propose a dynamical model for the coupled UUV-USV system in the primary plane of motion and a risk-aware optimization approach incorporating parameter uncertainty and noise to ensure safe interactions with the environment. A stochastic optimization problem is solved using a conditional value-at-risk framework. Simulations demonstrate that our approach reduces collision risks and energy consumption, highlighting its reliability compared to existing control methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[LTMSformer: A Local Trend-Aware Attention and Motion State Encoding Transformer for Multi-Agent Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04634v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It has been challenging to model the complex temporal-spatial dependencies between agents for trajectory prediction. As each state of an agent is closely related to the states of adjacent time steps, capturing the local temporal dependency is beneficial for prediction, while most studies often overlook it. Besides, learning the high-order motion state attributes is expected to enhance spatial interaction modeling, but it is rarely seen in previous works. To address this, we propose a lightweight framework, LTMSformer, to extract temporal-spatial interaction features for multi-modal trajectory prediction. Specifically, we introduce a Local Trend-Aware Attention mechanism to capture the local temporal dependency by leveraging a convolutional attention mechanism with hierarchical local time boxes. Next, to model the spatial interaction dependency, we build a Motion State Encoder to incorporate high-order motion state attributes, such as acceleration, jerk, heading, etc. To further refine the trajectory prediction, we propose a Lightweight Proposal Refinement Module that leverages Multi-Layer Perceptrons for trajectory embedding and generates the refined trajectories with fewer model parameters. Experiment results on the Argoverse 1 dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms the baseline HiVT-64, reducing the minADE by approximately 4.35%, the minFDE by 8.74%, and the MR by 20%. We also achieve higher accuracy than HiVT-128 with a 68% reduction in model size.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial-Temporal Conditional Random Field for Human Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18198v2)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is of significant importance in computer vision. Accurate pedestrian trajectory prediction benefits autonomous vehicles and robots in planning their motion. Pedestrians' trajectories are greatly influenced by their intentions. Prior studies having introduced various deep learning methods only pay attention to the spatial and temporal information of trajectory, overlooking the explicit intention information. In this study, we introduce a novel model, termed the \textbf{S-T CRF}: \textbf{S}patial-\textbf{T}emporal \textbf{C}onditional \textbf{R}andom \textbf{F}ield, which judiciously incorporates intention information besides spatial and temporal information of trajectory. This model uses a Conditional Random Field (CRF) to generate a representation of future intentions, greatly improving the prediction of subsequent trajectories when combined with spatial-temporal representation. Furthermore, the study innovatively devises a space CRF loss and a time CRF loss, meticulously designed to enhance interaction constraints and temporal dynamics, respectively. Extensive experimental evaluations on dataset ETH/UCY and SDD demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses existing baseline approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predicting Drivers' Route Trajectories in Last-Mile Delivery Using A Pair-wise Attention-based Pointer Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03802v2)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In last-mile delivery, drivers frequently deviate from planned delivery routes because of their tacit knowledge of the road and curbside infrastructure, customer availability, and other characteristics of the respective service areas. Hence, the actual stop sequences chosen by an experienced human driver may be potentially preferable to the theoretical shortest-distance routing under real-life operational conditions. Thus, being able to predict the actual stop sequence that a human driver would follow can help to improve route planning in last-mile delivery. This paper proposes a pair-wise attention-based pointer neural network for this prediction task using drivers' historical delivery trajectory data. In addition to the commonly used encoder-decoder architecture for sequence-to-sequence prediction, we propose a new attention mechanism based on an alternative specific neural network to capture the local pair-wise information for each pair of stops. To further capture the global efficiency of the route, we propose a new iterative sequence generation algorithm that is used after model training to identify the first stop of a route that yields the lowest operational cost. Results from an extensive case study on real operational data from Amazon's last-mile delivery operations in the US show that our proposed method can significantly outperform traditional optimization-based approaches and other machine learning methods (such as the Long Short-Term Memory encoder-decoder and the original pointer network) in finding stop sequences that are closer to high-quality routes executed by experienced drivers in the field. Compared to benchmark models, the proposed model can increase the average prediction accuracy of the first four stops from around 0.229 to 0.312, and reduce the disparity between the predicted route and the actual route by around 15%.</p></details> |  |
| **[D4orm: Multi-Robot Trajectories with Dynamics-aware Diffusion Denoised Deformations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12204v2)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work presents an optimization method for generating kinodynamically feasible and collision-free multi-robot trajectories that exploits an incremental denoising scheme in diffusion models. Our key insight is that high-quality trajectories can be discovered merely by denoising noisy trajectories sampled from a distribution. This approach has no learning component, relying instead on only two ingredients: a dynamical model of the robots to obtain feasible trajectories via rollout, and a fitness function to guide denoising with Monte Carlo gradient approximation. The proposed framework iteratively optimizes a deformation for the previous trajectory with the current denoising process, allows anytime refinement as time permits, supports different dynamics, and benefits from GPU acceleration. Our evaluations for differential-drive and holonomic teams with up to 16 robots in 2D and 3D worlds show its ability to discover high-quality solutions faster than other black-box optimization methods such as MPPI. In a 2D holonomic case with 16 robots, it is almost twice as fast. As evidence for feasibility, we demonstrate zero-shot deployment of the planned trajectories on eight multirotors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 2025 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)</p></details> |
| **[VLM-TDP: VLM-guided Trajectory-conditioned Diffusion Policy for Robust Long-Horizon Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04524v1)** | 2025-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion policy has demonstrated promising performance in the field of robotic manipulation. However, its effectiveness has been primarily limited in short-horizon tasks, and its performance significantly degrades in the presence of image noise. To address these limitations, we propose a VLM-guided trajectory-conditioned diffusion policy (VLM-TDP) for robust and long-horizon manipulation. Specifically, the proposed method leverages state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) to decompose long-horizon tasks into concise, manageable sub-tasks, while also innovatively generating voxel-based trajectories for each sub-task. The generated trajectories serve as a crucial conditioning factor, effectively steering the diffusion policy and substantially enhancing its performance. The proposed Trajectory-conditioned Diffusion Policy (TDP) is trained on trajectories derived from demonstration data and validated using the trajectories generated by the VLM. Simulation experimental results indicate that our method significantly outperforms classical diffusion policies, achieving an average 44% increase in success rate, over 100% improvement in long-horizon tasks, and a 20% reduction in performance degradation in challenging conditions, such as noisy images or altered environments. These findings are further reinforced by our real-world experiments, where the performance gap becomes even more pronounced in long-horizon tasks.

| **[Rapid and Safe Trajectory Planning over Diverse Scenes through Diffusion Composition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04384v1)** | 2025-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safe trajectory planning remains a significant challenge in complex environments, where traditional methods often trade off computational efficiency for safety. Comprehensive obstacle modeling improves safety but is computationally expensive, while approximate methods are more efficient but may compromise safety. To address this issue, this paper introduces a rapid and safe trajectory planning framework based on state-based diffusion models. Leveraging only low-dimensional vehicle states, the diffusion models achieve notable inference efficiency while ensuring sufficient collision-free characteristics. By composing diffusion models, the proposed framework can safely generalize across diverse scenarios, planning collision-free trajectories even in unseen scenes. To further ensure the safety of the generated trajectories, an efficient, rule-based safety filter is proposed, which selects optimal trajectories that satisfy both sufficient safety and control feasibility from among candidate trajectories. Both in seen and unseen scenarios, the proposed method achieves efficient inference time while maintaining high safety and stability. Evaluations on the F1TENTH vehicle further demonstrate that the proposed method is practical in real-world applications.

| **[WebSynthesis: World-Model-Guided MCTS for Efficient WebUI-Trajectory Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04370v1)** | 2025-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved the capabilities of web agents. However, effectively navigating complex and dynamic web environments still requires more advanced trajectory-level planning and execution. Prior studies have addressed self-improving agents by collecting extensive GUI trajectories from real-environment interactions. Despite their effectiveness, these approaches encounter two critical challenges: (1) Uncontrollable environment states, where real or sandboxed web environments often yield unstable and non-deterministic feedback, complicating the reproduction and debugging of agent behaviors; and (2) High API costs, as generating even a single interaction trajectory can involve hundreds of queries, leading to considerable API usage and computational expenses. To address these limitations and enable scalable self-improvement for agents, we propose WebSynthesis, a novel framework for trajectory synthesis and training. WebSynthesis leverages a learned world model to simulate virtual web environments, allowing a policy agent to perform efficient and reversible tree-based planning. This approach supports the large-scale generation of diverse and high-quality trajectories, which are subsequently utilized to refine the agent's policy. Experimental results demonstrate that an agent trained using WebSynthesis on a small-scale synthetic dataset achieves performance comparable to or even surpassing that of models trained on large-scale real-world data.</p></details> |  |
| **[K Nearest Neighbor-Guided Trajectory Similarity Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00285v2)** | 2025-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory similarity is fundamental to many spatio-temporal data mining applications. Recent studies propose deep learning models to approximate conventional trajectory similarity measures, exploiting their fast inference time once trained. Although efficient inference has been reported, challenges remain in similarity approximation accuracy due to difficulties in trajectory granularity modeling and in exploiting similarity signals in the training data. To fill this gap, we propose TSMini, a highly effective trajectory similarity model with a sub-view modeling mechanism capable of learning multi-granularity trajectory patterns and a k nearest neighbor-based loss that guides TSMini to learn not only absolute similarity values between trajectories but also their relative similarity ranks. Together, these two innovations enable highly accurate trajectory similarity approximation. Experiments show that TSMini can outperform the state-of-the-art models by 22% in accuracy on average when learning trajectory similarity measures.</p></details> |  |

Trajectory refinement has emerged as a key strategy to enhance prediction accuracy. However, existing refinement methods often overlook the topological relationships between trajectories, which are vital for improving prediction precision. Inspired by braid theory, we propose a novel trajectory refinement approach, Soft-Braid Refiner (SRefiner), guided by the soft-braid topological structure of trajectories using Soft-Braid Attention. Soft-Braid Attention captures spatio-temporal topological relationships between trajectories by considering both spatial proximity and vehicle motion states at ``soft intersection points". Additionally, we extend this approach to model interactions between trajectories and lanes, further improving the prediction accuracy. SRefiner is a multi-iteration, multi-agent framework that iteratively refines trajectories, incorporating topological information to enhance interactions within traffic scenarios. SRefiner achieves significant performance improvements over four baseline methods across two datasets, establishing a new state-of-the-art in trajectory refinement.

However, due to the inherent imbalance in trajectory distributions, tail data in natural datasets often represents more complex and hazardous scenarios. Existing studies typically rely solely on a base model's prediction error, without considering the diversity and uncertainty of long-tail trajectory patterns. We propose an adaptive momentum and decoupled contrastive learning framework (AMD), which integrates unsupervised and supervised contrastive learning strategies. By leveraging an improved momentum contrast learning (MoCo-DT) and decoupled contrastive learning (DCL) module, our framework enhances the model's ability to recognize rare and complex trajectories. Additionally, we design four types of trajectory random augmentation methods and introduce an online iterative clustering strategy, allowing the model to dynamically update pseudo-labels and better adapt to the distributional shifts in long-tail data. We propose three different criteria to define long-tail trajectories and conduct extensive comparative experiments on the nuScenes and ETH$/$UCY datasets. The results show that AMD not only achieves optimal performance in long-tail trajectory prediction but also demonstrates outstanding overall prediction accuracy.</p></details> |  |

While many promising methods have been developed using online corpora and captioned photographs, their application to scientific domains, where data encodes highly specialized knowledge, remains a challenge. Liquid Argon Time Projection Chambers (LArTPCs) provide high-resolution 3D imaging for fundamental physics, but analysis of their sparse, complex point cloud data often relies on supervised methods trained on large simulations, introducing potential biases. We introduce the Point-based Liquid Argon Masked Autoencoder (PoLAr-MAE), applying masked point modeling to unlabeled LArTPC images using domain-specific volumetric tokenization and energy prediction. We show this SSL approach learns physically meaningful trajectory representations directly from data. This yields remarkable data efficiency: fine-tuning on just 100 labeled events achieves track/shower semantic segmentation performance comparable to the state-of-the-art supervised baseline trained on $>$100,000 events. Furthermore, internal attention maps exhibit emergent instance segmentation of particle trajectories. While challenges remain, particularly for fine-grained features, we make concrete SSL's potential for building a foundation model for LArTPC image analysis capable of serving as a common base for all data reconstruction tasks. To facilitate further progress, we release PILArNet-M, a large dataset of 1M LArTPC events.

In this work, we propose DIVER, an end-to-end driving framework that integrates reinforcement learning with diffusion-based generation to produce diverse and feasible trajectories. At the core of DIVER lies a reinforced diffusion-based generation mechanism. First, the model conditions on map elements and surrounding agents to generate multiple reference trajectories from a single ground-truth trajectory, alleviating the limitations of imitation learning that arise from relying solely on single expert demonstrations. Second, reinforcement learning is employed to guide the diffusion process, where reward-based supervision enforces safety and diversity constraints on the generated trajectories, thereby enhancing their practicality and generalization capability. Furthermore, to address the limitations of L2-based open-loop metrics in capturing trajectory diversity, we propose a novel Diversity metric to evaluate the diversity of multi-mode predictions.Extensive experiments on the closed-loop NAVSIM and Bench2Drive benchmarks, as well as the open-loop nuScenes dataset, demonstrate that DIVER significantly improves trajectory diversity, effectively addressing the mode collapse problem inherent in imitation learning.</p></details> | 16 pages, 6 figures |

Coordination between heterogeneous units is paramount for precision tasks -- whether in manipulation, legged locomotion, or multi-robot interaction. Such modular systems introduce challenges far exceeding those in monolithic robot architectures. This study presents a robust method for synchronizing the trajectories of multiple heterogeneous actuators, adapting dynamically to system variations with minimal system knowledge. This design makes it inherently robot-agnostic, thus highly suited for modularity. To ensure smooth trajectory adherence, the multidimensional state is constrained within a hypersphere representing the allowable deviation. The distance metric can be adapted hence, depending on the task and system under control, deformation of the constraint region is possible. This approach is compatible with a wide range of robotic platforms and serves as a core interface for Motion-Stack, our new open-source universal framework for limb coordination (available at https://github.com/2lian/Motion-Stack ). The method is validated by synchronizing the end-effectors of six highly heterogeneous robotic limbs, evaluating both trajectory adherence and recovery from significant external disturbances.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 15 figures.

Their high agility and unpredictable motion make drones difficult to track and intercept. While existing methods focus on detecting current positions, many counter-drone strategies rely on forecasting future trajectories and thus require more than reactive detection to be effective. To address this critical gap, we propose an unsupervised vision-based method for predicting the three-dimensional trajectories of drones. Our approach first uses an unsupervised technique to extract drone trajectories from raw LiDAR point clouds, then aligns these trajectories with camera images through motion consistency to generate reliable pseudo-labels. We then combine kinematic estimation with a visual Mamba neural network in a self-supervised manner to predict future drone trajectories. We evaluate our method on the challenging MMAUD dataset, including the V2 sequences that feature wide-field-of-view multimodal sensors and dynamic UAV motion in urban scenes. Extensive experiments show that our framework outperforms supervised image-only and audio-visual baselines in long-horizon trajectory prediction, reducing 5-second 3D error by around 40 percent without using any manual 3D labels. The proposed system offers a cost-effective, scalable alternative for real-time counter-drone deployment. All code will be released upon acceptance to support reproducible research in the robotics community.</p></details> |  |

However, existing trajectory-based methods primarily focus on individual object motion and struggle to capture multi-object interaction crucial in complex robotic manipulation. This limitation arises from multi-feature entanglement in overlapping regions, which leads to degraded visual fidelity. To address this, we present RoboMaster, a novel framework that models inter-object dynamics through a collaborative trajectory formulation. Unlike prior methods that decompose objects, our core is to decompose the interaction process into three sub-stages: pre-interaction, interaction, and post-interaction. Each stage is modeled using the feature of the dominant object, specifically the robotic arm in the pre- and post-interaction phases and the manipulated object during interaction, thereby mitigating the drawback of multi-object feature fusion present during interaction in prior work. To further ensure subject semantic consistency throughout the video, we incorporate appearance- and shape-aware latent representations for objects. Extensive experiments on the challenging Bridge V2 dataset, as well as in-the-wild evaluation, demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches, establishing new state-of-the-art performance in trajectory-controlled video generation for robotic manipulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://fuxiao0719.github.io/projects/robomaster/ Code: https://github.com/KwaiVGI/RoboMaster</p></details> |

Previous methods on controllable video generation primarily leverage 2D control signals to manipulate object motions and have achieved remarkable synthesis results. However, 2D control signals are inherently limited in expressing the 3D nature of object motions. To overcome this problem, we introduce 3DTrajMaster, a robust controller that regulates multi-entity dynamics in 3D space, given user-desired 6DoF pose (location and rotation) sequences of entities. At the core of our approach is a plug-and-play 3D-motion grounded object injector that fuses multiple input entities with their respective 3D trajectories through a gated self-attention mechanism. In addition, we exploit an injector architecture to preserve the video diffusion prior, which is crucial for generalization ability. To mitigate video quality degradation, we introduce a domain adaptor during training and employ an annealed sampling strategy during inference. To address the lack of suitable training data, we construct a 360-Motion Dataset, which first correlates collected 3D human and animal assets with GPT-generated trajectory and then captures their motion with 12 evenly-surround cameras on diverse 3D UE platforms. Extensive experiments show that 3DTrajMaster sets a new state-of-the-art in both accuracy and generalization for controlling multi-entity 3D motions.

Such objects induce low signal to noise ratio (SNR) reflections in the received signal. We consider both co-located and separated transmitter/receiver pairs, i.e., mono-static and bi-static configurations, respectively, as well as multi-static settings involving both types. We propose coherent track before detect: A detection approach which is capable of coherently integrating these reflections within a coherent processing interval (CPI) in all these configurations and continuing integration for an arbitrarily long time across consecutive CPIs. {We estimate the complex value of the reflection coefficients for integration while simultaneously estimating the object trajectory. Compounded with these computations is the estimation of the unknown time reference shift of the separated transmitters necessary for coherent processing.} Detection is made by using the resulting integration value in a Neyman-Pearson test against a constant false alarm rate threshold. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in a simulation example with a very low SNR object which cannot be detected with conventional techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This article is based on Chapter 3 in "Reliable detection and characterisation of dim targets via track-before-detect", a PhD Thesis by Kimin Kim, The University of Edinburgh (https://era.ed.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/1842/38091/Kim2021.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y)</p></details> |

However, mobility data often suffers from sparsity due to limitations in data collection methods, such as infrequent GPS sampling or call detail record (CDR) data that only capture locations during communication events. To address this challenge, we propose BERT4Traj, a transformer based model that reconstructs complete mobility trajectories by predicting hidden visits in sparse movement sequences. Inspired by BERT's masked language modeling objective and self_attention mechanisms, BERT4Traj leverages spatial embeddings, temporal embeddings, and contextual background features such as demographics and anchor points. We evaluate BERT4Traj on real world CDR and GPS datasets collected in Kampala, Uganda, demonstrating that our approach significantly outperforms traditional models such as Markov Chains, KNN, RNNs, and LSTMs. Our results show that BERT4Traj effectively reconstructs detailed and continuous mobility trajectories, enhancing insights into human movement patterns.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was accepted at GIScience 2025</p></details> |

This can erode trust in digital media, making it critical to develop generalizable detectors for generated images. Recent methods leverage diffusion denoising cues, but mainly focus on single-step reconstruction errors, ignoring the inherent sequential nature of the denoising process. In this work, we propose LATTE - Latent Trajectory Embedding - a novel approach that models the evolution of latent embeddings across several denoising timesteps. By modeling the trajectory of such embeddings rather than single-step errors, LATTE captures subtle, discriminative patterns that distinguish real from generated images. Each latent is refined by employing our latent-visual feature refinement module and aggregated into a unified representation. Afterwards, it is fused with the visual features and finally passed into a lightweight classifier. Our experiments demonstrate that LATTE surpasses the baselines on several established benchmarks, such as GenImage and DiffusionFake. Moreover, it demonstrates strong performance in cross-generator and cross-datasets settings, highlighting the potential of using the trajectory of latent embeddings for generated image detection.

| **[Improving Consistency in Vehicle Trajectory Prediction Through Preference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02406v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is an essential step in the pipeline of an autonomous vehicle. Inaccurate or inconsistent predictions regarding the movement of agents in its surroundings lead to poorly planned maneuvers and potentially dangerous situations for the end-user. Current state-of-the-art deep-learning-based trajectory prediction models can achieve excellent accuracy on public datasets. However, when used in more complex, interactive scenarios, they often fail to capture important interdependencies between agents, leading to inconsistent predictions among agents in the traffic scene. Inspired by the efficacy of incorporating human preference into large language models, this work fine-tunes trajectory prediction models in multi-agent settings using preference optimization. By taking as input automatically calculated preference rankings among predicted futures in the fine-tuning process, our experiments--using state-of-the-art models on three separate datasets--show that we are able to significantly improve scene consistency while minimally sacrificing trajectory prediction accuracy and without adding any excess computational requirements at inference time.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at ITSC 2025</p></details> |

Typically, this is achieved via sampling-based planners, which are computationally intensive. Recent advances demonstrate that trajectory planning can also be performed by supervised sequence learning of trajectories, often requiring only a single or fixed number of passes through a neural architecture, thus ensuring a bounded computation time. Such fully supervised approaches, however, perform imitation learning; they do not learn based on whether the trajectories can successfully reach a goal, but try to reproduce observed trajectories. In our work, we build on this approach and propose a cognitively inspired self-supervised learning scheme based on a recurrent architecture for building a trajectory model. We evaluate the feasibility of the proposed method on a task of kinematic planning for a robotic arm. The results suggest that the model is able to learn to generate trajectories only using given paired forward and inverse kinematics models, and indicate that this novel method could facilitate planning for more complex manipulation tasks requiring adaptive solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables.

| **[Tenure and Research Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10575v2)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tenure is a cornerstone of the US academic system, yet its relationship to faculty research trajectories remains poorly understood. Conceptually, tenure systems may act as a selection mechanism, screening in high-output researchers; a dynamic incentive mechanism, encouraging high output prior to tenure but low output after tenure; and a creative search mechanism, encouraging tenured individuals to undertake high-risk work. Here, we integrate data from seven different sources to trace US tenure-line faculty and their research outputs at an unprecedented scale and scope, covering over 12,000 researchers across 15 disciplines. Our analysis reveals that faculty publication rates typically increase sharply during the tenure track and peak just before obtaining tenure. Post-tenure trends, however, vary across disciplines: in lab-based fields, such as biology and chemistry, research output typically remains high post-tenure, whereas in non-lab-based fields, such as mathematics and sociology, research output typically declines substantially post-tenure. Turning to creative search, faculty increasingly produce novel, high-risk research after securing tenure. However, this shift toward novelty and risk-taking comes with a decline in impact, with post-tenure research yielding fewer highly cited papers. Comparing outcomes across common career ages but different tenure years or comparing research trajectories in tenure-based and non-tenure-based research settings underscores that breaks in the research trajectories are sharply tied to the individual's tenure year. Overall, these findings provide a new empirical basis for understanding the tenure system, individual research trajectories, and the shape of scientific output.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, an efficient, accurate, and widely applicable pseudospectral method is proposed to solve multi-revolution low-thrust trajectory optimization problems with various objective functions and perturbations. The method is based on the Sundman transformation and pseudospectral method, together with a sparse mesh that is monotonic, near-uniformly spaced, and uniformly scattered on the unit circle. Two methods are proposed to construct the mesh: a deterministic method based on rotation mapping; a stochastic method utilizing autocorrelated random sequences. Core mechanisms ensuring the correctness of the method are analyzed, including the dual roles of mesh points as both integration points in the temporal domain and sampling points in the angular domain, the slow dynamics of the system excluding the fast angle variable, and the nearly commutative vector fields generated by applying different control inputs. The method is demonstrated through a multi-revolution low-thrust orbital rendezvous problem. Results show that the proposed method achieves high accuracy with only a few seconds of computational time for challenging problems.</p></details> |  |

Most of the current designs of motion prediction models are based on the major representation of lane centerlines, which limits their capability to capture critical road environments and traffic rules and constraints. In this work, we propose an enhanced motion forecasting model informed by multiple vector map elements, including lane boundaries and road edges, that facilitates a richer and more complete representation of driving environments. An effective feature fusion strategy is developed to merge information in different vector map components, where the model learns holistic information on road structures and their interactions with agents. Since encoding more information about the road environment increases memory usage and is computationally expensive, we developed an effective pruning mechanism that filters the most relevant map connections to the target agent, ensuring computational efficiency while maintaining essential spatial and semantic relationships for accurate trajectory prediction. Overcoming the limitations of lane centerline-based models, our method provides a more informative and efficient representation of the driving environment and advances the state of the art for autonomous vehicle motion forecasting. We verify our approach with extensive experiments on the Argoverse 2 motion forecasting dataset, where our method maintains competitiveness on AV2 while achieving improved performance.

Cluster analysis with longitudinal data further allows for clinical representation of groups of subjects with similar trajectories and identification of unique characteristics, or phenotypes, that can be investigated as risk factors or disease outcomes. Some of the challenges in estimating these clustered trajectories lie in the handling of observations at inconsistent time intervals and the usability of algorithms across programming languages.

The state-of-the-art optimal control approaches often rely on numerical methods sensitive to initial guesses. This paper presents an innovative collision-free finite-time formation control scheme for multiple UAVs leveraging the differential flatness of the UAV dynamics, eliminating the need for numerical methods. We formulate a finite-time optimal control problem to plan a formation trajectory for feasible initial states. This optimal control problem in formation trajectory planning involves a collective performance index to meet the formation requirements to achieve relative positions and velocity consensus. It is solved by applying Pontryagin's principle. Subsequently, a collision-constrained regulating problem is addressed to ensure collision-free tracking of the planned formation trajectory. The tracking problem incorporates a directionally aware collision avoidance strategy that prioritizes avoiding UAVs in the forward path and relative approach. It assigns lower priority to those on the sides with an oblique relative approach, disregarding UAVs behind and not in the relative approach. The high-fidelity simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for Journal of the Franklin Institute</p></details> |

The proposed method systematically accounts for gyroscopic effects, rotor dynamics, parametric uncertainties, and external disturbances, ensuring robust performance across varying trajectory speeds. Through novel mathematical manipulation in the error system development, the quadrotor dynamics are expressed in a control-oriented form, which explicitly incorporates the uncertainty in the gyroscopic term and control actuation term. An adaptive modified RISE law is then designed to stabilize both the position and attitude loops of the quadrotor system. A rigorous Lyapunov-based analysis is utilized to prove asymptotic trajectory tracking, where the region of convergence can be made arbitrarily large through judicious control gain selection.

To highlight the potential of this novel method, we describe the design and implementation of the technique and show its application in an experimental setting of cognitive robotics. In this scenario, the NICO robot was characterized by the ability to point to specific points in space with precise linear movements, increasing the predictability of the robotic action during its interaction with humans. To achieve this goal, the neural network computes the forward kinematics of the robot arm. By integrating it with a generator of joint angles, another neural network was developed and trained on an artificial dataset created from suitable start and end poses of the robotic arm. Through the computation of angular velocities, the robot was characterized by its ability to perform the movement, and the quality of its action was evaluated in terms of shape and accuracy. Thanks to its broad applicability, our approach successfully generates precise trajectories that could be customized in their shape and adapted to different settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code is released at https://github.com/andylucny/nico2/tree/main/generate</p></details> |

While learning-based prediction models have shown success in generating likely human trajectory predictions, integrating these stochastic models into a robot controller presents several challenges. The controller needs to account for interactive coupling between planned robot motion and human predictions while ensuring both predictions and robot actions are safe (i.e. collision-free). To address these challenges, we present a receding horizon crowd navigation method for single-robot multi-human environments. We first propose a diffusion model to generate joint trajectory predictions for all humans in the scene. We then incorporate these multi-modal predictions into a SICNav Bilevel MPC problem that simultaneously solves for a robot plan (upper-level) and acts as a safety filter to refine the predictions for non-collision (lower-level). Combining planning and prediction refinement into one bilevel problem ensures that the robot plan and human predictions are coupled. We validate the open-loop trajectory prediction performance of our diffusion model on the commonly used ETH/UCY benchmark and evaluate the closed-loop performance of our robot navigation method in simulation and extensive real-robot experiments demonstrating safe, efficient, and reactive robot motion.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)</p></details> |
| **[Predictive Risk Analysis and Safe Trajectory Planning for Intelligent and Connected Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23999v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The safe trajectory planning of intelligent and connected vehicles is a key component in autonomous driving technology. Modeling the environment risk information by field is a promising and effective approach for safe trajectory planning. However, existing risk assessment theories only analyze the risk by current information, ignoring future prediction. This paper proposes a predictive risk analysis and safe trajectory planning framework for intelligent and connected vehicles. This framework first predicts future trajectories of objects by a local risk-aware algorithm, following with a spatiotemporal-discretised predictive risk analysis using the prediction results. Then the safe trajectory is generated based on the predictive risk analysis. Finally, simulation and vehicle experiments confirm the efficacy and real-time practicability of our approach.</p></details> |  |

Principal component analysis (PCA) is applied to trajectory data consisting of $n_s = 4,000,000$ datapoints, of the FPUT $\beta$ model with $N = 32$ coupled oscillators, revealing a critical relationship between $m^{\ast}$ and the model's nonlinear strength. By estimating the intrinsic dimension $m^{\ast}$ using multiple methods (participation ratio, Kaiser rule, and the Kneedle algorithm), it is found that $m^{\ast}$ increases with the model nonlinearity. Interestingly, in the weakly nonlinear regime, for trajectories initialized by exciting the first mode, the participation ratio estimates $m^{\ast} = 2, 3$, strongly suggesting that quasi-periodic motion on a low-dimensional Riemannian manifold underlies the characteristic energy recurrences observed in the FPUT model.</p></details> | 15 pages, 15 figures |
| **[Consistency Trajectory Matching for One-Step Generative Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20349v3)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current diffusion-based super-resolution (SR) approaches achieve commendable performance at the cost of high inference overhead. Therefore, distillation techniques are utilized to accelerate the multi-step teacher model into one-step student model. Nevertheless, these methods significantly raise training costs and constrain the performance of the student model by the teacher model. To overcome these tough challenges, we propose Consistency Trajectory Matching for Super-Resolution (CTMSR), a distillation-free strategy that is able to generate photo-realistic SR results in one step. Concretely, we first formulate a Probability Flow Ordinary Differential Equation (PF-ODE) trajectory to establish a deterministic mapping from low-resolution (LR) images with noise to high-resolution (HR) images. Then we apply the Consistency Training (CT) strategy to directly learn the mapping in one step, eliminating the necessity of pre-trained diffusion model. To further enhance the performance and better leverage the ground-truth during the training process, we aim to align the distribution of SR results more closely with that of the natural images. To this end, we propose to minimize the discrepancy between their respective PF-ODE trajectories from the LR image distribution by our meticulously designed Distribution Trajectory Matching (DTM) loss, resulting in improved realism of our recovered HR images. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods can attain comparable or even superior capabilities on both synthetic and real datasets while maintaining minimal inference latency.</p></details> |  |

To support real-time sensing and conserve the limited energy budget of the HAPs, the proposed framework assumes that the acquired radar data are transmitted in real time to a ground base station for SAR image reconstruction. A dynamic trajectory model is developed, and the power consumption associated with radar sensing, data transmission, and circular flight is comprehensively analyzed. In addition, solar energy harvesting is considered to enhance system sustainability. An energy-aware mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem is formulated to maximize radar beam coverage while satisfying operational constraints. To solve this challenging problem, a sub-optimal successive convex approximation (SCA)-based framework is proposed, incorporating iterative optimization and finite search. Simulation results validate the convergence of the proposed algorithm and demonstrate its effectiveness in balancing SAR performance, communication reliability, and energy efficiency. A final SAR imaging simulation on a 9-target lattice scenario further confirms the practical feasibility of the proposed solution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mode Collapse Happens: Evaluating Critical Interactions in Joint Trajectory Prediction Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23164v1)** | 2025-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous Vehicle decisions rely on multimodal prediction models that account for multiple route options and the inherent uncertainty in human behavior. However, models can suffer from mode collapse, where only the most likely mode is predicted, posing significant safety risks. While existing methods employ various strategies to generate diverse predictions, they often overlook the diversity in interaction modes among agents. Additionally, traditional metrics for evaluating prediction models are dataset-dependent and do not evaluate inter-agent interactions quantitatively. To our knowledge, none of the existing metrics explicitly evaluates mode collapse. In this paper, we propose a novel evaluation framework that assesses mode collapse in joint trajectory predictions, focusing on safety-critical interactions. We introduce metrics for mode collapse, mode correctness, and coverage, emphasizing the sequential dimension of predictions. By testing four multi-agent trajectory prediction models, we demonstrate that mode collapse indeed happens. When looking at the sequential dimension, although prediction accuracy improves closer to interaction events, there are still cases where the models are unable to predict the correct interaction mode, even just before the interaction mode becomes inevitable. We hope that our framework can help researchers gain new insights and advance the development of more consistent and accurate prediction models, thus enhancing the safety of autonomous driving systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 8 figures, submitted to a journal</p></details> |

In this study, we present ASPILin, which manually selects interacting agents and replaces the attention scores in Transformer with a newly computed physical correlation coefficient, enhancing the interpretability of interaction modeling. Surprisingly, these simple modifications can significantly improve prediction performance and substantially reduce computational costs. We intentionally simplified our model in other aspects, such as map encoding. Remarkably, experiments conducted on the INTERACTION, highD, and CitySim datasets demonstrate that our method is efficient and straightforward, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Aircraft Trajectory Dataset Augmentation in Latent Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07585v2)** | 2025-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aircraft trajectory modeling plays a crucial role in Air Traffic Management (ATM) and is important for various downstream tasks, including conflict detection and landing time prediction. Dataset augmentation through the addition of synthetically generated trajectory data is necessary to develop a more robust aircraft trajectory model and ensure that the trajectory dataset is sufficient and balanced. In this work, we propose a novel framework called ATRADA for aircraft trajectory dataset augmentation. In the proposed framework, a Transformer encoder learns the underlying patterns in the original trajectory dataset and converts each data point into a context vector in the learned latent space. The converted dataset in the latent space is projected into reduced dimensions using principal component analysis (PCA), and a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is applied to fit the probability distribution of the data points in the reduced-dimensional space. Finally, new samples are drawn from the fitted GMM, the dimension of the samples is reverted to the original dimension, and they are decoded with a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). Several experiments demonstrate that the framework effectively generates new, high-quality synthetic aircraft trajectory data, which were compared to the results of several baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Global Optimization of Multi-Flyby Trajectories for Multi-Orbital-Plane Constellations Inspection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02943v1)** | 2025-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid expansion of mega-constellations in low Earth orbits has posed significant challenges to space traffic management, necessitating periodic inspections of satellites to ensure the sustainability of the space environment when economically feasible. This study addresses the orbital design challenge associated with inspecting numerous satellites distributed across multiple orbital planes through flybys by proposing an innovative orbital-plane-based inspection strategy. The proposed methodology reformulates the multi-satellite flyby problem into a multi-rendezvous trajectory planning problem by proposing an analytical approach to determine a maneuver-free inspection orbit that enables flyby of all satellites within a specific orbital plane. Additionally, a three-layer global optimization framework is developed to tackle this problem. The first layer establishes an approximate cost evaluation model for orbital plane visitation sequences, utilizing a genetic algorithm to identify the optimal sequence from a vast array of candidate planes, thereby maximizing inspection targets while minimizing fuel consumption. The second layer constructs a mixed-integer programming model to locally refine the rendezvous epochs and orbital parameters of each inspection orbit to reduce the total velocity increment. The third layer accurately computes the optimal impulsive maneuvers and trajectories between inspection orbits. In contrast to traditional low-Earth orbit rendezvous optimization frameworks, the proposed framework fully leverages the adjustable freedom in inclination and right ascension of the ascending node (RAAN) of inspection orbits, significantly reducing the total velocity increment. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively address the trajectory optimization problem associated with constellation inspection for tens of thousands of satellites.</p></details> |  |
| **[Kill Two Birds with One Stone! Trajectory enabled Unified Online Detection of Adversarial Examples and Backdoor Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22722v1)** | 2025-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proposed UniGuard is the first unified online detection framework capable of simultaneously addressing adversarial examples and backdoor attacks. UniGuard builds upon two key insights: first, both AE and backdoor attacks have to compromise the inference phase, making it possible to tackle them simultaneously during run-time via online detection. Second, an adversarial input, whether a perturbed sample in AE attacks or a trigger-carrying sample in backdoor attacks, exhibits distinctive trajectory signatures from a benign sample as it propagates through the layers of a DL model in forward inference. The propagation trajectory of the adversarial sample must deviate from that of its benign counterpart; otherwise, the adversarial objective cannot be fulfilled. Detecting these trajectory signatures is inherently challenging due to their subtlety; UniGuard overcomes this by treating the propagation trajectory as a time-series signal, leveraging LSTM and spectrum transformation to amplify differences between adversarial and benign trajectories that are subtle in the time domain. UniGuard exceptional efficiency and effectiveness have been extensively validated across various modalities (image, text, and audio) and tasks (classification and regression), ranging from diverse model architectures against a wide range of AE attacks and backdoor attacks, including challenging partial backdoors and dynamic triggers. When compared to SOTA methods, including ContraNet (NDSS 22) specific for AE detection and TED (IEEE SP 24) specific for backdoor detection, UniGuard consistently demonstrates superior performance, even when matched against each method's strengths in addressing their respective threats-each SOTA fails to parts of attack strategies while UniGuard succeeds for all.</p></details> |  |
| **[Economic Model Predictive Control with a Non-Fixed Reference Trajectory for Optimal Microgrid Dispatch](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22406v1)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Economic Model Predictive Control (EMPC), instead of stabilizing a reference trajectory/state in the objective function like a Tracking MPC, optimizes the economic performance over the prediction horizon, making it attractive for economical microgrid (MG) dispatch. However, the demand charge component in the monthly electricity cost, make it difficult to be encapsulated in additive stage costs, and can make solutions violate the principle of optimality if naively introduced in the objective function. Moreover, previous EMPC based works mostly rely on a-priori knowledge of an optimal economic steady state or optimal periodic trajectory for performance guarantees, which are not useful or possibly don't exist respectively, for real-time economical MG dispatch where load/generation forecasts are known only 24-48 h in advance. This paper, first, proposes an EMPC formulation for a generic deterministic discrete non-linear time varying system with hard state and input constraints, without any a-priori requirements of an optimal economic steady state or optimal periodic trajectory. It is proved that under mild assumptions on terminal cost and region, the asymptotic average economic cost of the proposed method is no worse than the asymptotic average economic cost of any other non-fixed arbitrary reference trajectory which is known only until the current time-step. The EMPC framework is then leveraged for optimal MG dispatch by showing that the problem can be reformulated to satisfy the assumptions required for the asymptotic performance guarantee. Realistic simulations at the Port of San Diego MG demonstrated that the proposed method can also reduce monthly electricity costs in closed-loop with respect to reference trajectories generated by directly optimizing the electricity cost function over the prediction horizon or by tracking an ideal grid import curve in a majority of the cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 4 tables, Manuscript under review</p></details> |

The growing interest in this challenge highlights the need for comprehensive datasets that capture unstructured environments, enabling the development of more robust prediction models to enhance pedestrian safety and vehicle navigation. In this paper, we introduce an Indian driving pedestrian dataset designed to address the complexities of modeling pedestrian behavior in unstructured environments, such as illumination changes, occlusion of pedestrians, unsignalized scene types and vehicle-pedestrian interactions. The dataset provides high-level and detailed low-level comprehensive annotations focused on pedestrians requiring the ego-vehicle's attention. Evaluation of the state-of-the-art intention prediction methods on our dataset shows a significant performance drop of up to $\mathbf{15\%}$, while trajectory prediction methods underperform with an increase of up to $\mathbf{1208}$ MSE, defeating standard pedestrian datasets. Additionally, we present exhaustive quantitative and qualitative analysis of intention and trajectory baselines. We believe that our dataset will open new challenges for the pedestrian behavior research community to build robust models.

While many models have been developed towards this end, effectively capturing and predicting the variability inherent to human behavior still remains an open challenge. This paper proposes TrajFlow - a new approach for probabilistic trajectory prediction based on Normalizing Flows. We reformulate the problem of capturing distributions over trajectories into capturing distributions over abstracted trajectory features using an autoencoder, simplifying the learning task of the Normalizing Flows. TrajFlow outperforms state-of-the-art behavior prediction models in capturing full trajectory distributions in two synthetic benchmarks with known true distributions, and is competitive on the naturalistic datasets ETH/UCY, rounD, and nuScenes. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of TrajFlow in probabilistic prediction of human behavior.</p></details> |  |

Based on this, we present GAE-Bench, a benchmark containing a large number of trajectory-based retrieval pairs. In addition, we propose GAE-Retriever, a multimodal retrieval framework that adopts vision-language models and incorporates optimized contrastive learning through a token selection and the GradCache mechanism. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple datasets show that GAE-Retriever consistently outperforms strong baselines in retrieval recall, highlighting its effectiveness in advancing multimodal trajectory retrieval.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 3 figures, accepted by Workshop on Computer-use Agents @ ICML 2025</p></details> |

Despite their utility in advancing digital automation, a critical bottleneck persists: collecting high-quality trajectory data for training. Common practices for collecting such data rely on human supervision or synthetic data generation through executing pre-defined tasks, which are either resource-intensive or unable to guarantee data quality. Moreover, these methods suffer from limited data diversity and significant gaps between synthetic data and real-world environments. To address these challenges, we propose OS-Genesis, a novel GUI data synthesis pipeline that reverses the conventional trajectory collection process. Instead of relying on pre-defined tasks, OS-Genesis enables agents first to perceive environments and perform step-wise interactions, then retrospectively derive high-quality tasks to enable trajectory-level exploration. A trajectory reward model is then employed to ensure the quality of the generated trajectories. We demonstrate that training GUI agents with OS-Genesis significantly improves their performance on highly challenging online benchmarks. In-depth analysis further validates OS-Genesis's efficiency and its superior data quality and diversity compared to existing synthesis methods.

However, this requires that the dataset be labeled by a reward function. In applied settings such as video game development, the availability of the reward function is not always guaranteed. This paper proposes Trajectory-Ranked OFfline Inverse reinforcement learning (TROFI), a novel approach to effectively learn a policy offline without a pre-defined reward function. TROFI first learns a reward function from human preferences, which it then uses to label the original dataset making it usable for training the policy. In contrast to other approaches, our method does not require optimal trajectories. Through experiments on the D4RL benchmark we demonstrate that TROFI consistently outperforms baselines and performs comparably to using the ground truth reward to learn policies. Additionally, we validate the efficacy of our method in a 3D game environment. Our studies of the reward model highlight the importance of the reward function in this setting: we show that to ensure the alignment of a value function to the actual future discounted reward, it is fundamental to have a well-engineered and easy-to-learn reward function.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at Reinforcement Learning and Video Games Workshop at RLC 2025</p></details> |

This paper proposes a unified framework that jointly predicts both behavioral intentions and trajectories to enhance prediction accuracy, interpretability, and efficiency. Specifically, we employ a shared context encoder for both intention and trajectory predictions, thereby reducing structural redundancy and information loss. Moreover, we address the lack of ground-truth behavioral intention labels in mainstream datasets (Waymo, Argoverse) by auto-labeling these datasets, thus advancing the community's efforts in this direction. We further introduce a vectorized occupancy prediction module that infers the probability of each map polyline being occupied by the target vehicle's future trajectory. By leveraging these intention and occupancy prediction priors, our method conducts dynamic, modality-dependent pruning of irrelevant agents and map polylines in the decoding stage, effectively reducing computational overhead and mitigating noise from non-critical elements. Our approach ranks first among LiDAR-free methods on the Waymo Motion Dataset and achieves first place on the Waymo Interactive Prediction Dataset. Remarkably, even without model ensembling, our single-model framework improves the soft mean average precision (softmAP) by 10 percent compared to the second-best method in the Waymo Interactive Prediction Leaderboard. Furthermore, the proposed framework has been successfully deployed on real vehicles, demonstrating its practical effectiveness in real-world applications.</p></details> | under review |

Our approach integrates several novel contributions, including a tailored object detector optimized for high-altitude bird's-eye view perspectives, a unique track stabilization method that uses detected vehicle bounding boxes as exclusion masks during image registration, and an orthophoto and master frame-based georeferencing strategy that enhances consistent alignment across multiple drone viewpoints. Additionally, our framework features robust vehicle dimension estimation and detailed road segmentation, enabling comprehensive traffic analysis. Conducted in the Songdo International Business District, South Korea, the study utilized a multi-drone experiment covering 20 intersections, capturing approximately 12TB of 4K video data over four days. The framework produced two high-quality datasets: the Songdo Traffic dataset, comprising approximately 700,000 unique vehicle trajectories, and the Songdo Vision dataset, containing over 5,000 human-annotated images with about 300,000 vehicle instances in four classes. Comparisons with high-precision sensor data from an instrumented probe vehicle highlight the accuracy and consistency of our extraction pipeline in dense urban environments. The public release of Songdo Traffic and Songdo Vision, and the complete source code for the extraction pipeline, establishes new benchmarks in data quality, reproducibility, and scalability in traffic research. Results demonstrate the potential of integrating drone technology with advanced computer vision for precise and cost-effective urban traffic monitoring, providing valuable resources for developing intelligent transportation systems and enhancing traffic management strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Interpretable and Efficient Feature Selection in Trajectory Datasets: A Taxonomic Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20359v1)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory analysis is not only about obtaining movement data, but it is also of paramount importance in understanding the pattern in which an object moves through space and time, as well as in predicting its next move. Due to the significant interest in the area, data collection has improved substantially, resulting in a large number of features becoming available for training and predicting models. However, this introduces a high-dimensionality-induced feature explosion problem, which reduces the efficiency and interpretability of the data, thereby reducing the accuracy of machine learning models. To overcome this issue, feature selection has become one of the most prevalent tools. Thus, the objective of this paper was to introduce a taxonomy-based feature selection method that categorizes features based on their internal structure. This approach classifies the data into geometric and kinematic features, further categorizing them into curvature, indentation, speed, and acceleration. The comparative analysis indicated that a taxonomy-based approach consistently achieved comparable or superior predictive performance. Furthermore, due to the taxonomic grouping, which reduces combinatorial space, the time taken to select features was drastically reduced. The taxonomy was also used to gain insights into what feature sets each dataset was more sensitive to. Overall, this study provides robust evidence that a taxonomy-based feature selection method can add a layer of interpretability, reduce dimensionality and computational complexity, and contribute to high-level decision-making. It serves as a step toward providing a methodological framework for researchers and practitioners dealing with trajectory datasets and contributing to the broader field of explainable artificial intelligence.</p></details> |  |

However, their performance depends heavily on accurate camera pose priors. Existing approaches attempt to address this issue by introducing external constraints but fall short of achieving satisfactory accuracy, particularly when camera trajectories are complex. In this paper, we propose a novel method, RA-NeRF, capable of predicting highly accurate camera poses even with complex camera trajectories. Following the incremental pipeline, RA-NeRF reconstructs the scene using NeRF with photometric consistency and incorporates flow-driven pose regulation to enhance robustness during initialization and localization. Additionally, RA-NeRF employs an implicit pose filter to capture the camera movement pattern and eliminate the noise for pose estimation. To validate our method, we conduct extensive experiments on the Tanks\&Temple dataset for standard evaluation, as well as the NeRFBuster dataset, which presents challenging camera pose trajectories. On both datasets, RA-NeRF achieves state-of-the-art results in both camera pose estimation and visual quality, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness in scene reconstruction under complex pose trajectories.</p></details> | IROS 2025 |

The model integrates a learnable component that predicts robot-terrain interaction forces with a neural-symbolic layer that enforces the laws of classical mechanics and consequently improves generalization on out-of-distribution data. The neural-symbolic layer includes a differentiable physics engine that computes the robot's trajectory by querying these forces at the points of contact with the terrain. As the proposed architecture comprises substantial geometrical and physics priors, the resulting model can also be seen as a learnable physics engine conditioned on real sensor data that delivers $10^4$ trajectories per second. We argue and empirically demonstrate that this architecture reduces the sim-to-real gap and mitigates out-of-distribution sensitivity. The differentiability, in conjunction with the rapid simulation speed, makes the model well-suited for various applications including model predictive control, trajectory shooting, supervised and reinforcement learning, or SLAM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/ctu-vras/fusionforce</p></details> |
| **[Pseudo-Kinematic Trajectory Control and Planning of Tracked Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18641v2)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tracked vehicles distribute their weight continuously over a large surface area (the tracks). This distinctive feature makes them the preferred choice for vehicles required to traverse soft and uneven terrain. From a robotics perspective, however, this flexibility comes at a cost: the complexity of modelling the system and the resulting difficulty in designing theoretically sound navigation solutions. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap by proposing a framework for the navigation of tracked vehicles, built upon three key pillars. The first pillar comprises two models: a simulation model and a control-oriented model. The simulation model captures the intricate terramechanics dynamics arising from soil-track interaction and is employed to develop faithful digital twins of the system across a wide range of operating conditions. The control-oriented model is pseudo-kinematic and mathematically tractable, enabling the design of efficient and theoretically robust control schemes. The second pillar is a Lyapunov-based feedback trajectory controller that provides certifiable tracking guarantees. The third pillar is a portfolio of motion planning solutions, each offering different complexity-accuracy trade-offs. The various components of the proposed approach are validated through an extensive set of simulation and experimental data.</p></details> |  |

| **[Reinforcement learning for efficient and robust multi-setpoint and multi-trajectory tracking in bioprocesses](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22409v2)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient and robust bioprocess control is essential for maximizing performance and adaptability in advanced biotechnological systems. In this work, we present a reinforcement-learning framework for multi-setpoint and multi-trajectory tracking. Tracking multiple setpoints and time-varying trajectories in reinforcement learning is challenging due to the complexity of balancing multiple objectives, a difficulty further exacerbated by system uncertainties such as uncertain initial conditions and stochastic dynamics. This challenge is relevant, e.g., in bioprocesses involving microbial consortia, where precise control over population compositions is required. We introduce a novel return function based on multiplicative reciprocal saturation functions, which explicitly couples reward gains to the simultaneous satisfaction of multiple references. Through a case study involving light-mediated cybergenetic growth control in microbial consortia, we demonstrate via computational experiments that our approach achieves faster convergence, improved stability, and superior control compliance compared to conventional quadratic-cost-based return functions. Moreover, our method enables tuning of the saturation function's parameters, shaping the learning process and policy updates. By incorporating system uncertainties, our framework also demonstrates robustness, a key requirement in industrial bioprocessing. Overall, this work advances reinforcement-learning-based control strategies in bioprocess engineering, with implications in the broader field of process and systems engineering.</p></details> |  |
| **[Augmenting Multi-Agent Communication with State Delta Trajectory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19209v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent techniques such as role playing or multi-turn debates have been shown to be effective in improving the performance of large language models (LLMs) in downstream tasks. Despite their differences in workflows, existing LLM-based multi-agent systems mostly use natural language for agent communication. While this is appealing for its simplicity and interpretability, it also introduces inevitable information loss as one model must down sample its continuous state vectors to concrete tokens before transferring them to the other model. Such losses are particularly significant when the information to transfer is not simple facts, but reasoning logics or abstractive thoughts. To tackle this problem, we propose a new communication protocol that transfers both natural language tokens and token-wise state transition trajectory from one agent to another. Particularly, compared to the actual state value, we find that the sequence of state changes in LLMs after generating each token can better reflect the information hidden behind the inference process, so we propose a State Delta Encoding (SDE) method to represent state transition trajectories. The experimental results show that multi-agent systems with SDE achieve SOTA performance compared to other communication protocols, particularly in tasks that involve complex reasoning. This shows the potential of communication augmentation for LLM-based multi-agent systems.</p></details> | 22 pages, 5 figures |

While robotic manipulators offer high precision, versatility, and productivity, they exhibit expressionless and monotonous motions that conceal the robot's intention, resulting in a lack of efficiency and transparency with humans. In this work, we use Laban notation, a dance annotation language, to enable robotic manipulators to generate trajectories with functional expressivity, where the robot uses nonverbal cues to communicate its abilities and the likelihood of succeeding at its task. We achieve this by introducing two novel variants of Hesitant expressive motion (Spoke-Like and Arc-Like). We also enhance the emotional expressivity of four existing emotive trajectories (Happy, Sad, Shy, and Angry) by augmenting Laban Effort usage with Laban Shape. The functionally expressive motions are validated via a human-subjects study, where participants equate both variants of Hesitant motion with reduced robot competency. The enhanced emotive trajectories are shown to be viewed as distinct emotions using the Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) spectrum, corroborating the usage of Laban Shape.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at the 2025 IEEE RO-MAN Conference</p></details> |
| **[ReasonFlux-PRM: Trajectory-Aware PRMs for Long Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18896v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Process Reward Models (PRMs) have recently emerged as a powerful framework for supervising intermediate reasoning steps in large language models (LLMs). Previous PRMs are primarily trained on model final output responses and struggle to evaluate intermediate thinking trajectories robustly, especially in the emerging setting of trajectory-response outputs generated by frontier reasoning models like Deepseek-R1. In this work, we introduce ReasonFlux-PRM, a novel trajectory-aware PRM explicitly designed to evaluate the trajectory-response type of reasoning traces. ReasonFlux-PRM incorporates both step-level and trajectory-level supervision, enabling fine-grained reward assignment aligned with structured chain-of-thought data. We adapt ReasonFlux-PRM to support reward supervision under both offline and online settings, including (i) selecting high-quality model distillation data for downstream supervised fine-tuning of smaller models, (ii) providing dense process-level rewards for policy optimization during reinforcement learning, and (iii) enabling reward-guided Best-of-N test-time scaling. Empirical results on challenging downstream benchmarks such as AIME, MATH500, and GPQA-Diamond demonstrate that ReasonFlux-PRM-7B selects higher quality data than strong PRMs (e.g., Qwen2.5-Math-PRM-72B) and human-curated baselines. Furthermore, our derived ReasonFlux-PRM-7B yields consistent performance improvements, achieving average gains of 12.1% in supervised fine-tuning, 4.5% in reinforcement learning, and 6.3% in test-time scaling. We also release our efficient ReasonFlux-PRM-1.5B for resource-constrained applications and edge deployment.

| **[Understanding Software Engineering Agents: A Study of Thought-Action-Result Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18824v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly employed to automate complex software engineering tasks such as program repair and issue resolution. These agents operate by autonomously generating natural language thoughts, invoking external tools, and iteratively refining their solutions. Despite their widespread adoption, the internal decision-making processes of these agents remain largely unexplored, limiting our understanding of their operational dynamics and failure modes. In this paper, we present a large-scale empirical study of the thought-action-result trajectories of three state-of-the-art LLM-based agents: \textsc{RepairAgent}, \textsc{AutoCodeRover}, and \textsc{OpenHands}. We unify their interaction logs into a common format, capturing 120 trajectories and 2822 LLM interactions focused on program repair and issue resolution. Our study combines quantitative analyses of structural properties, action patterns, and token usage with qualitative assessments of reasoning coherence and feedback integration. We identify key trajectory characteristics such as iteration counts and token consumption, recurring action sequences, and the semantic coherence linking thoughts, actions, and their results. Our findings reveal behavioral motifs and anti-patterns that distinguish successful from failed executions, providing actionable insights for improving agent design, including prompting strategies, failure diagnosis, and anti-pattern detection. We release our dataset and annotation framework to support further research on transparent and robust autonomous software engineering agents.</p></details> |  |

To achieve effective neighboring people selection, we propose a people selection module called the Importance Estimator which outputs the importance of each neighboring person for predicting the primary person's future trajectory. To prevent gradients from being blocked by non-differentiable operations when sampling surrounding people based on their importance, we employ the Gumbel Softmax for training. Experiments conducted on the JRDB dataset show that our method speeds up the process with competitive prediction accuracy.</p></details> | MIRU 2025 |

While statistically grounded criteria are primarily relied upon, clinical relevance is gradually emphasized in medicine to ensure that the identified trajectory heterogeneity appropriately reflects changes in a disease or symptom over time. However, such considerations are often judged through visual comparisons, without concrete approaches for their application. To address this, the Area Between Trajectories (ABTs) was introduced as insights for quantifying trajectory group differences. Using a simulated sleep quality dataset, GBTM was applied to build and compare models. Subsequently, ABTs was demonstrated to show how it works, while also highlighting its limitations and potential applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 4 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[DriveSuprim: Towards Precise Trajectory Selection for End-to-End Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06659v2)** | 2025-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In complex driving environments, autonomous vehicles must navigate safely. Relying on a single predicted path, as in regression-based approaches, usually does not explicitly assess the safety of the predicted trajectory. Selection-based methods address this by generating and scoring multiple trajectory candidates and predicting the safety score for each, but face optimization challenges in precisely selecting the best option from thousands of possibilities and distinguishing subtle but safety-critical differences, especially in rare or underrepresented scenarios. We propose DriveSuprim to overcome these challenges and advance the selection-based paradigm through a coarse-to-fine paradigm for progressive candidate filtering, a rotation-based augmentation method to improve robustness in out-of-distribution scenarios, and a self-distillation framework to stabilize training. DriveSuprim achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching 93.5% PDMS in NAVSIM v1 and 87.1% EPDMS in NAVSIM v2 without extra data, demonstrating superior safetycritical capabilities, including collision avoidance and compliance with rules, while maintaining high trajectory quality in various driving scenarios.</p></details> | 15 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Leveling the Playing Field: Carefully Comparing Classical and Learned Controllers for Quadrotor Trajectory Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17832v1)** | 2025-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning-based control approaches like reinforcement learning (RL) have recently produced a slew of impressive results for tasks like quadrotor trajectory tracking and drone racing. Naturally, it is common to demonstrate the advantages of these new controllers against established methods like analytical controllers. We observe, however, that reliably comparing the performance of such very different classes of controllers is more complicated than might appear at first sight. As a case study, we take up the problem of agile tracking of an end-effector for a quadrotor with a fixed arm. We develop a set of best practices for synthesizing the best-in-class RL and geometric controllers (GC) for benchmarking. In the process, we resolve widespread RL-favoring biases in prior studies that provide asymmetric access to: (1) the task definition, in the form of an objective function, (2) representative datasets, for parameter optimization, and (3) feedforward information, describing the desired future trajectory. The resulting findings are the following: our improvements to the experimental protocol for comparing learned and classical controllers are critical, and each of the above asymmetries can yield misleading conclusions. Prior works have claimed that RL outperforms GC, but we find the gaps between the two controller classes are much smaller than previously published when accounting for symmetric comparisons. Geometric control achieves lower steady-state error than RL, while RL has better transient performance, resulting in GC performing better in relatively slow or less agile tasks, but RL performing better when greater agility is required. Finally, we open-source implementations of geometric and RL controllers for these aerial vehicles, implementing best practices for future development.

To guarantee safety and prevent collisions, autonomous vehicles must be capable of accurately predicting the trajectories of surrounding traffic agents. Over the past decade, significant efforts from both academia and industry have been dedicated to designing solutions for precise trajectory forecasting. These efforts have produced a diverse range of approaches, raising questions about the differences between these methods and whether trajectory prediction challenges have been fully addressed. This paper reviews a substantial portion of recent trajectory prediction methods proposing a taxonomy to classify existing solutions. A general overview of the prediction pipeline is also provided, covering input and output modalities, modeling features, and prediction paradigms existing in the literature. In addition, the paper discusses active research areas within trajectory prediction, addresses the posed research questions, and highlights the remaining research gaps and challenges.</p></details> |  |
| **[Physics-informed mixture of experts network for interpretable battery degradation trajectory computation amid second-life complexities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17755v1)** | 2025-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retired electric vehicle batteries offer immense potential to support low-carbon energy systems, but uncertainties in their degradation behavior and data inaccessibilities under second-life use pose major barriers to safe and scalable deployment. This work proposes a Physics-Informed Mixture of Experts (PIMOE) network that computes battery degradation trajectories using partial, field-accessible signals in a single cycle. PIMOE leverages an adaptive multi-degradation prediction module to classify degradation modes using expert weight synthesis underpinned by capacity-voltage and relaxation data, producing latent degradation trend embeddings. These are input to a use-dependent recurrent network for long-term trajectory prediction. Validated on 207 batteries across 77 use conditions and 67,902 cycles, PIMOE achieves an average mean absolute percentage (MAPE) errors of 0.88% with a 0.43 ms inference time. Compared to the state-of-the-art Informer and PatchTST, it reduces computational time and MAPE by 50%, respectively. Compatible with random state of charge region sampling, PIMOE supports 150-cycle forecasts with 1.50% average and 6.26% maximum MAPE, and operates effectively even with pruned 5MB training data. Broadly, PIMOE framework offers a deployable, history-free solution for battery degradation trajectory computation, redefining how second-life energy storage systems are assessed, optimized, and integrated into the sustainable energy landscape.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory tracking control of USV with actuator constraints in the presence of disturbances](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17005v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>All practical systems often pose a problem of finite control capability, which can notably degrade the performance if not properly addressed. Since actuator input bounds are typically known, integrating actuator saturation considerations into the control law design process can lead to enhanced performance and more precise trajectory tracking. Also, the actuators cannot provide the demanded forces or torques instantaneously; hence, there is a limitation on the rate of magnitude. This work proposes nonlinear feedback controller designs developed using the Lyapunov stability and backstepping method while actively considering the actuator magnitude and rate constraints. The system dynamics are augmented with a smooth control input saturation model. Additionally, an observer is incorporated to estimate the disturbance vector. Through Lyapunov stability analysis, we demonstrate the system's stability under the proposed controller for the Uncrewed Surface Vessel (USV), ensuring adherence to actuator constraints provided their initial values fall within the prescribed bounds. Extensive numerical simulations performed by considering various trajectories and multiple initial conditions demonstrate the effectiveness of the controller in maintaining tracking performance without violating actuator constraints. This work also relaxes the assumption of equally capable actuators to be used to control the motion of USVs, affirming the viability of the controller in practical applications.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional methods often struggle to extract deep semantic representations and incorporate contextual map information. We propose TrajSceneLLM, a multimodal perspective for enhancing semantic understanding of GPS trajectories. The framework integrates visualized map images (encoding spatial context) and textual descriptions generated through LLM reasoning (capturing temporal sequences and movement dynamics). Separate embeddings are generated for each modality and then concatenated to produce trajectory scene embeddings with rich semantic content which are further paired with a simple MLP classifier. We validate the proposed framework on Travel Mode Identification (TMI), a critical task for analyzing travel choices and understanding mobility behavior. Our experiments show that these embeddings achieve significant performance improvement, highlighting the advantage of our LLM-driven method in capturing deep spatio-temporal dependencies and reducing reliance on handcrafted features. This semantic enhancement promises significant potential for diverse downstream applications and future research in geospatial artificial intelligence.

While model-driven, rule-based, and classical learning-based methods are widely used to tackle these tasks at present, they can struggle to effectively capture the complex, multimodal distributions of future trajectories. In this paper we investigate whether a generative adversarial network (GAN) trained on videos of bird's-eye view (BEV) traffic scenarios can generate statistically accurate trajectories that correctly capture spatial relationships between the agents. To this end, we propose a pipeline that uses low-resolution BEV occupancy grid videos as training data for a video generative model. From the generated videos of traffic scenarios we extract abstract trajectory data using single-frame object detection and frame-to-frame object matching. We particularly choose a GAN architecture for the fast training and inference times with respect to diffusion models. We obtain our best results within 100 GPU hours of training, with inference times under 20\,ms. We demonstrate the physical realism of the proposed trajectories in terms of distribution alignment of spatial and dynamic parameters with respect to the ground truth videos from the Waymo Open Motion Dataset.</p></details> |  |

Multi-drone thermal screening systems offer promising solutions for fast, large-scale, and non-intrusive human temperature monitoring. However, trajectory planning for multiple drones in complex urban environments poses significant challenges, including collision avoidance, coverage efficiency, and constrained flight environments. In this study, we propose an enhanced trust region sequential convex optimization (TR-SCO) algorithm for optimal trajectory planning of multiple drones performing thermal screening tasks. Our improved algorithm integrates a refined convex optimization formulation within a trust region framework, effectively balancing trajectory smoothness, obstacle avoidance, altitude constraints, and maximum screening coverage. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves trajectory optimality and computational efficiency compared to conventional convex optimization methods. This research provides critical insights and practical contributions toward deploying efficient multi-drone systems for real-time thermal screening in urban areas.

| **[Autonomous Trajectory Optimization for UAVs in Disaster Zone Using Henry Gas Optimization Scheme](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15910v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in a disaster-prone environment plays important role in assisting the rescue services and providing the internet connectivity with the outside world. However, in such a complex environment the selection of optimum trajectory of UAVs is of utmost importance. UAV trajectory optimization deals with finding the shortest path in the minimal possible time. In this paper, a cluster optimization scheme (COS) is proposed using the Henry gas optimization (HGO) metaheuristic algorithm to identify the shortest path having minimal transportation cost and algorithm complexity. The mathematical model is designed for COS using the HGO algorithm and compared with the state-of-the-art metaheuristic algorithms such as particle swarm optimization (PSO), grey wolf optimization (GWO), cuckoo search algorithm (CSA) and barnacles mating optimizer (BMO). In order to prove the robustness of the proposed model, four different scenarios are evaluated that includes ambient environment, constrict environment, tangled environment, and complex environment. In all the aforementioned scenarios, the HGO algorithm outperforms the existing algorithms. Particularly, in the ambient environment, the HGO algorithm achieves a 39.3% reduction in transportation cost and a 16.8% reduction in computational time as compared to the PSO algorithm. Hence, the HGO algorithm can be used for autonomous trajectory optimization of UAVs in smart cities.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figuers |
| **[TrajDiff: Diffusion Bridge Network with Semantic Alignment for Trajectory Similarity Computation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15898v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the proliferation of location-tracking technologies, massive volumes of trajectory data are continuously being collected. As a fundamental task in trajectory data mining, trajectory similarity computation plays a critical role in a wide range of real-world applications. However, existing learning-based methods face three challenges: First, they ignore the semantic gap between GPS and grid features in trajectories, making it difficult to obtain meaningful trajectory embeddings. Second, the noise inherent in the trajectories, as well as the noise introduced during grid discretization, obscures the true motion patterns of the trajectories. Third, existing methods focus solely on point-wise and pair-wise losses, without utilizing the global ranking information obtained by sorting all trajectories according to their similarity to a given trajectory. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose a novel trajectory similarity computation framework, named TrajDiff. Specifically, the semantic alignment module relies on cross-attention and an attention score mask mechanism with adaptive fusion, effectively eliminating semantic discrepancies between data at two scales and generating a unified representation. Additionally, the DDBM-based Noise-robust Pre-Training introduces the transfer patterns between any two trajectories into the model training process, enhancing the model's noise robustness. Finally, the overall ranking-aware regularization shifts the model's focus from a local to a global perspective, enabling it to capture the holistic ordering information among trajectories. Extensive experiments on three publicly available datasets show that TrajDiff consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. In particular, it achieves an average HR@1 gain of 33.38% across all three evaluation metrics and datasets.</p></details> |  |

MENSA learns a shared representation of the input features while capturing the complex dependence structures between events. In practice, it optimizes the sum of the traditional negative log-likelihood across events and a novel trajectory-based likelihood, which encourages the model to learn the temporal order in which events occur. Experiments on real-world clinical datasets demonstrate that MENSA improves risk and time-to-event prediction compared to state-of-the-art models across single-event, competing-risk, and multi-event settings. Moreover, MENSA achieves this with fewer parameters and lower computational cost (FLOPs) than several deep learning baselines, particularly in high-dimensional feature spaces (more than 100 features).</p></details> |  |

This metric builds on the recently introduced probabilistic GOSPA metric to account for both the existence and state estimation uncertainties of individual object states. Similar to trajectory GOSPA (TGOSPA), it can be formulated as a multidimensional assignment problem, and its linear programming relaxation--also a valid metric--is computable in polynomial time. Additionally, this metric retains the interpretability of TGOSPA, and we show that its decomposition yields intuitive costs terms associated to expected localization error and existence probability mismatch error for properly detected objects, expected missed and false detection error, and track switch error. The effectiveness of the proposed metric is demonstrated through a simulation study.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |

However, due to the instability of heterogeneous communication and time-varying characteristics of SAGIN, it is challenging to meet the remote Internet of Things (IoT) demands for data collection and offloading. In this paper, we investigate a two-phase hierarchical data uplink model in SAGIN. Specifically, UAVs optimize trajectories to enable efficient data collection from IoT devices, and then they transmit the data to LEO satellites with computing capabilities for further processing. The problem is formulated to minimize the total energy consumption for IoT devices, UAVs, and LEO satellites. Since the problem is in the form of mixed-integer nonlinear programming and intractable to solve directly, we decompose it into two phases. In the IoT-UAV phase, we design the algorithm to jointly optimize the IoT pairing, power allocation, and UAVs trajectories. Considering the high dynamic characteristics of LEO satellites, a real-time LEO satellite selection mechanism joint with the Satellite Tool Kit is proposed in the UAV-LEO phase. Finally, simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, with about 10% less energy consumption compared with the benchmark algorithm.</p></details> |  |

While prompt engineering and finetuning are common approaches, recent work has explored latent steering, a lightweight technique that alters LLM internal activations to guide generation. However, subsequent studies revealed latent steering's effectiveness to be limited, often underperforming simple instruction prompting. To address this limitation, we first establish a benchmark across diverse behaviors for standardized evaluation of steering techniques. Building on insights from this benchmark, we introduce Instruction Attention Boosting (InstABoost), a latent steering method that boosts the strength of instruction prompting by altering the model's attention during generation. InstABoost combines the strengths of existing approaches and is theoretically supported by prior work that suggests that in-context rule following in transformer-based models can be controlled by manipulating attention on instructions. Empirically, InstABoost demonstrates superior control success compared to both traditional prompting and latent steering.</p></details> |  |

This study examines how gender-diverse populations perceive bias, accuracy, and trustworthiness in LLMs, specifically ChatGPT. Through 25 in-depth interviews with non-binary/transgender, male, and female participants, we investigate how gendered and neutral prompts influence model responses and how users evaluate these responses. Our findings reveal that gendered prompts elicit more identity-specific responses, with non-binary participants particularly susceptible to condescending and stereotypical portrayals. Perceived accuracy was consistent across gender groups, with errors most noted in technical topics and creative tasks. Trustworthiness varied by gender, with men showing higher trust, especially in performance, and non-binary participants demonstrating higher performance-based trust. Additionally, participants suggested improving the LLMs by diversifying training data, ensuring equal depth in gendered responses, and incorporating clarifying questions.

However, acquiring real-world SQL queries is challenging due to privacy concerns, and existing SQL generation methods are limited in customization and in satisfying realistic constraints. To address this issue, we present SQLBarber, a system based on Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate customized and realistic SQL workloads. SQLBarber (i) eliminates the need for users to manually craft SQL templates in advance, while providing the flexibility to accept natural language specifications to constrain SQL templates, (ii) scales efficiently to generate large volumes of queries matching any user-defined cost distribution (e.g., cardinality and execution plan cost), and (iii) uses execution statistics from Amazon Redshift and Snowflake to derive SQL template specifications and query cost distributions that reflect real-world query characteristics. SQLBarber introduces (i) a declarative interface for users to effortlessly generate customized SQL templates, (ii) an LLM-powered pipeline augmented with a self-correction module that profiles, refines, and prunes SQL templates based on query costs, and (iii) a Bayesian Optimizer to efficiently explore different predicate values and identify a set of queries that satisfy the target cost distribution. We construct and open-source ten benchmarks of varying difficulty levels and target query cost distributions based on real-world statistics from Snowflake and Amazon Redshift. Extensive experiments on these benchmarks show that SQLBarber is the only system that can generate customized SQL templates. It reduces query generation time by one to three orders of magnitude, and significantly improves alignment with the target cost distribution, compared with existing methods.</p></details> |  |

As artificial intelligence provides scalable tools for modelling human outcomes, it is crucial to evaluate whether large language models (LLMs) can accurately predict well-being across diverse global populations. We evaluate four leading LLMs using data from 64,000 individuals in 64 countries. While LLMs capture broad correlates such as income and health, their predictive accuracy decreases in countries underrepresented in the training data, highlighting systematic biases rooted in global digital and economic inequality. A pre-registered experiment demonstrates that LLMs rely on surface-level linguistic similarity rather than conceptual understanding, leading to systematic misestimations in unfamiliar or resource-limited settings. Injecting findings from underrepresented contexts substantially enhances performance, but a significant gap remains. These results highlight both the promise and limitations of LLMs in predicting global well-being, underscoring the importance of robust validation prior to their implementation across these areas.</p></details> |  |

We introduce the Code Triangle framework, which systematically evaluates LLMs across three fundamental dimensions: editorial analysis, code implementation, and test case generation. Through extensive experiments on competitive programming benchmarks, we reveal that while LLMs can form a self-consistent system across these dimensions, their solutions often lack the diversity and robustness of human programmers. We identify a significant distribution shift between model cognition and human expertise, with model errors tending to cluster due to training data biases and limited reasoning transfer. Our study demonstrates that incorporating human-generated editorials, solutions, and diverse test cases, as well as leveraging model mixtures, can substantially enhance both the performance and robustness of LLMs. Furthermore, we reveal both the consistency and inconsistency in the cognition of LLMs that may facilitate self-reflection and self-improvement, providing a potential direction for developing more powerful coding models.</p></details> |  |

Furthermore, LLMs must be designed to align with human values, like preventing harmful content and ensuring responsible usage. The current automated systems and solutions for monitoring LLMs in production are primarily centered on LLM-specific concerns like hallucination etc, with little consideration given to the requirements of specific use-cases and user preferences. This paper introduces GAF-Guard, a novel agentic framework for LLM governance that places the user, the use-case, and the model itself at the center. The framework is designed to detect and monitor risks associated with the deployment of LLM based applications. The approach models autonomous agents that identify risks, activate risk detection tools, within specific use-cases and facilitate continuous monitoring and reporting to enhance AI safety, and user expectations.

| **[A Cascading Cooperative Multi-agent Framework for On-ramp Merging Control Integrating Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08199v2)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL) suffers from replicating human-like behaviors, generalizing effectively in multi-agent scenarios, and overcoming inherent interpretability issues.These tasks are compounded when deep environment understanding, agent coordination and dynamic optimization are required. While Large Language Model (LLM) enhanced methods have shown promise in generalization and interoperability, they often neglect necessary multi-agent coordination. Therefore, we introduce the Cascading Cooperative Multi-agent (CCMA) framework, integrating RL for individual interactions, a fine-tuned LLM for regional cooperation, a reward function for global optimization, and the Retrieval-augmented Generation mechanism to dynamically optimize decision-making across complex driving scenarios. Our experiments demonstrate that the CCMA outperforms existing RL methods, demonstrating significant improvements in both micro and macro-level performance in complex driving environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Tool Use in Large Language Models with Meta-Cognition Trigger](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12961v2)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable emergent capabilities, transforming the execution of functional tasks by leveraging external tools for complex problems that require specialized processing or up-to-date data. While existing research expands LLMs access to diverse tools (e.g., program interpreters, search engines, calculators), the necessity of using these tools is often overlooked, leading to indiscriminate tool invocation. This naive approach raises two key issues: increased latency due to unnecessary tool calls, and potential errors resulting from faulty interactions with external tools. In this paper, we introduce meta-cognition as a proxy for LLMs self-assessment of their capabilities, reflecting the model's awareness of its own limitations. Based on this, we propose MeCo, an adaptive decision-making strategy for external tool use. MeCo quantifies metacognitive scores by capturing high-level cognitive signals in the representation space, guiding when to invoke tools. Notably, MeCo is fine-tuning-free and incurs minimal cost. Experiments across multiple backbone models and benchmarks show that MeCo reliably detects LLMs' internal cognitive signals and significantly improves tool-use decision-making.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, camera ready version for ACL-2025</p></details> |

However, research applying these advances to the financial domain, where considerable domain-specific knowledge is necessary to complete tasks, remains limited. To address this gap, we introduce FEVO (Financial Evolution), a multi-stage enhancement framework developed to enhance LLM performance in the financial domain. FEVO systemically enhances LLM performance by using continued pre-training (CPT) to expand financial domain knowledge, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to instill structured, elaborate reasoning patterns, and reinforcement learning (RL) to further integrate the expanded financial domain knowledge with the learned structured reasoning. To ensure effective and efficient training, we leverage frontier reasoning models and rule-based filtering to curate FEVO-Train, high-quality datasets specifically designed for the different post-training phases. Using our framework, we train the FEVO series of models -- C32B, S32B, R32B -- from Qwen2.5-32B and evaluate them on seven benchmarks to assess financial and general capabilities, with results showing that FEVO-R32B achieves state-of-the-art performance on five financial benchmarks against much larger models as well as specialist models. More significantly, FEVO-R32B demonstrates markedly better performance than FEVO-R32B-0 (trained from Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct using only RL), thus validating the effectiveness of financial domain knowledge expansion and structured, logical reasoning distillation</p></details> |  |

However, the most powerful empathetic LSLMs are increasingly closed off, leaving the crucial details about the architecture, data and development opaque to researchers. Given the critical need for transparent research into the LSLMs and empathetic behavior, we present OpenS2S, a fully open-source, transparent and end-to-end LSLM designed to enable empathetic speech interactions. Based on our empathetic speech-to-text model BLSP-Emo, OpenS2S further employs a streaming interleaved decoding architecture to achieve low-latency speech generation. To facilitate end-to-end training, OpenS2S incorporates an automated data construction pipeline that synthesizes diverse, high-quality empathetic speech dialogues at low cost. By leveraging large language models to generate empathetic content and controllable text-to-speech systems to introduce speaker and emotional variation, we construct a scalable training corpus with rich paralinguistic diversity and minimal human supervision. We release the fully open-source OpenS2S model, including the dataset, model weights, pre-training and fine-tuning codes, to empower the broader research community and accelerate innovation in empathetic speech systems.

To assess potential biases across candidates' gender and partisan identities in the algorithmic curation of candidate information, we conducted a large-scale algorithm audit analyzing Google's selection and ranking of information about candidates for the 2023 Swiss Federal Elections, three and one week before the election day. Results indicate that text searches prioritize media sources in search output but less so for women politicians. Image searches revealed a tendency to reinforce stereotypes about women candidates, marked by a disproportionate focus on stereotypically pleasant emotions for women, particularly among right-leaning candidates. Crucially, we find that patterns of candidates' representation in Google text and image searches are predictive of their electoral performance.</p></details> | 44 pages |
| **[Evolution without Large Models: Training Language Model with Task Principles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05991v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A common training approach for language models involves using a large-scale language model to expand a human-provided dataset, which is subsequently used for model training.This method significantly reduces training costs by eliminating the need for extensive human data annotation. However, it still faces challenges such as high carbon emissions during data augmentation and the risk of data leakage when we use closed-source LLMs. To address these issues, we propose a self-evolution method for language models. First, we introduce the Multi-level Principle Generation, which enables a large-scale model to summarize task-completion principles based on a small amount of task data. Then, we propose the Principle-based Instance Generation, in which a smaller-scale language model uses these task principles to generate a large amount of data. This data is then used for model training. Experimental results show that our proposed method significantly improves model performance compared to directly using a smaller-scale language model to generate data. Additionally, since we only use the large-scale language model to generate the task-completion principles, the carbon emissions associated with training the model are greatly reduced.</p></details> |  |

Research on improving their accuracy mainly focuses on prompt engineering, model fine-tuning, and retrieval augmented generation. However, these methods often treat models as isolated black boxes - relying on single-pass outputs without iterative refinement or collaboration, limiting robustness and adaptability. Objective: We propose that, just as human debates enhance accuracy and reduce bias in RE tasks by incorporating diverse perspectives, different LLM agents debating and collaborating may achieve similar improvements. Our goal is to investigate whether Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) strategies can enhance RE performance. Method: We conducted a systematic study of existing MAD strategies across various domains to identify their key characteristics. To assess their applicability in RE, we implemented and tested a preliminary MAD-based framework for RE classification. Results: Our study identified and categorized several MAD strategies, leading to a taxonomy outlining their core attributes. Our preliminary evaluation demonstrated the feasibility of applying MAD to RE classification. Conclusions: MAD presents a promising approach for improving LLM accuracy in RE tasks. This study provides a foundational understanding of MAD strategies, offering insights for future research and refinements in RE applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Analytic Subspace Routing: How Recursive Least Squares Works in Continual Learning of Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13575v2)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) possess encompassing capabilities that can process diverse language-related tasks. However, finetuning on LLMs will diminish this general skills and continual finetuning will further cause severe degradation on accumulated knowledge. Recently, Continual Learning (CL) in Large Language Models (LLMs) arises which aims to continually adapt the LLMs to new tasks while maintaining previously learned knowledge and inheriting general skills. Existing techniques either leverage previous data to replay, leading to extra computational costs, or utilize a single parameter-efficient module to learn the downstream task, constraining new knowledge absorption with interference between different tasks. Toward these issues, this paper proposes Analytic Subspace Routing(ASR) to address these challenges. For each task, we isolate the learning within a subspace of deep layers' features via low-rank adaptation, eliminating knowledge interference between different tasks. Additionally, we propose an analytic routing mechanism to properly utilize knowledge learned in different subspaces. Our approach employs Recursive Least Squares to train a multi-task router model, allowing the router to dynamically adapt to incoming data without requiring access to historical data. Also, the router effectively assigns the current task to an appropriate subspace and has a non-forgetting property of previously learned tasks with a solid theoretical guarantee. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves near-perfect retention of prior knowledge while seamlessly integrating new information, effectively overcoming the core limitations of existing methods. Our code will be released after acceptance.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |

This research examines how Large Language Models (LLMs) can transform the accessibility of ML technologies within organizations through a human-centered Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) approach. Through a comprehensive user study involving 15 professionals across various roles and technical backgrounds, we evaluate the organizational impact of an LLM-based AutoML framework compared to traditional implementation methods. Our research offers four significant contributions to both management practice and technical innovation: First, we present pioneering evidence that LLM-based interfaces can dramatically improve ML implementation success rates, with 93.34% of users achieved superior performance in the LLM condition, with 46.67% showing higher accuracy (10-25% improvement over baseline) and 46.67% demonstrating significantly higher accuracy (>25% improvement over baseline), while 6.67% maintained comparable performance levels; and 60% reporting substantially reduced development time. Second, we demonstrate how natural language interfaces can effectively bridge the technical skills gap in organizations, cutting implementation time by 50% while improving accuracy across all expertise levels. Third, we provide valuable insights for organizations designing human-AI collaborative systems, showing that our approach reduced error resolution time by 73% and significantly accelerated employee learning curves. Finally, we establish empirical support for natural language as an effective interface for complex technical systems, offering organizations a path to democratize ML capabilities without compromising quality or performance.</p></details> |  |

No LLM inference mechanism can simultaneously achieve truthful response generation, semantic information conservation, relevant knowledge revelation, and knowledge-constrained optimality. This impossibility is fundamental, arising from the mathematical structure of information aggregation itself rather than engineering limitations. The proof spans three mathematical frameworks: auction theory, proper scoring theory for probabilistic predictions, and log-sum-exp analysis for transformer architectures. In each setting, we demonstrate that information aggregation creates unavoidable violations of conservation principles. The Jensen gap in transformer probability aggregation provides a direct measure of this impossibility. These results reframe hallucination from an engineering bug to an inevitable mathematical feature of distributed intelligence. There are fundamental trade-offs between truthfulness, knowledge utilization, and response completeness, providing principled foundations for managing rather than eliminating hallucination. This work reveals deep connections between neural network inference, philosophy of knowledge and reasoning, and classical results in game theory and information theory, opening new research directions for developing beneficial AI systems within mathematical constraints.</p></details> | <details><summary>trans...</summary><p>transformer example extended, discussion and speculation section added</p></details> |

Inspired by the motion of particles in physics, we propose a universal framework for large-scale multi-objective optimization based on particle drift and diffusion to solve these challenges in this paper. This framework innovatively divides the optimization process into three sub-stages: two coarse-tuning sub-stages and one fine-tuning sub-stage. Different strategies of drift-diffusion operations are performed on the guiding solutions according to the current sub-stage, ingeniously simulating the movement of particles under diverse environmental conditions. Finally, representative evolutionary algorithms are embedded into the proposed framework, and their effectiveness are evaluated through comparative experiments on various large-scale multi-objective problems with 1000 to 5000 decision variables. Moreover, comparative algorithms are conducted on neural network training problems to validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in the practical problems. The experimental results demonstrate that the framework proposed in this paper significantly enhances the performance of convergence and diversity of MOEAs, and improves the computational efficiency of algorithms in solving large-scale multi-objective optimization problems.</p></details> |  |

Given that audio large language models (ALLMs) have made significant progress in various audio processing tasks, a heuristic question arises: \textit{Can ALLMs be leveraged to solve ADD?}. In this paper, we first conduct a comprehensive zero-shot evaluation of ALLMs on ADD, revealing their ineffectiveness. To this end, we propose ALLM4ADD, an ALLM-driven framework for ADD. Specifically, we reformulate ADD task as an audio question answering problem, prompting the model with the question: ``Is this audio fake or real?''. We then perform supervised fine-tuning to enable the ALLM to assess the authenticity of query audio. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate that our ALLM-based method can achieve superior performance in fake audio detection, particularly in data-scarce scenarios. As a pioneering study, we anticipate that this work will inspire the research community to leverage ALLMs to develop more effective ADD systems.

Furthermore, existing studies face prohibitive computational costs when dealing with large-scale high-order tensor data. To alleviate these issue, assisted by the Krylov subspace iteration, block Lanczos bidiagonalization process, and random projection strategies, this article first devises two fast and accurate randomized algorithms for low-rank tensor approximation (LRTA) problem. Theoretical bounds on the accuracy of the approximation error estimate are established. Next, we develop a novel generalized nonconvex modeling framework tailored to large-scale tensor recovery, in which a new regularization paradigm is exploited to achieve insightful prior representation for large-scale tensors. On the basis of the above, we further investigate new unified nonconvex models and efficient optimization algorithms, respectively, for several typical high-order tensor recovery tasks in unquantized and quantized situations. To render the proposed algorithms practical and efficient for large-scale tensor data, the proposed randomized LRTA schemes are integrated into their central and time-intensive computations. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on various large-scale tensors, whose results demonstrate the practicability, effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method in comparison with some state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |

We propose TalkFashion, an intelligent try-on assistant that leverages the powerful comprehension capabilities of large language models to analyze user instructions and determine which task to execute, thereby activating different processing pipelines accordingly. Additionally, we introduce an instruction-based local repainting model that eliminates the need for users to manually provide masks.

To address this challenge, we propose NoWag: (Normalized Weight and Activation Guided Compression), a unified framework for zero-shot shape preserving compression algorithms. We compressed Llama-2 7B/13B/70B and Llama-3 8/70BB models, using two popular forms of shape-preserving compression, vector quantization NoWag-VQ (NoWag for Vector Quantization), and unstructured/semi-structured pruning NoWag-P (NoWag for Pruning). We found that NoWag-VQ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art zero shot VQ, and that NoWag-P performs competitively against state-of-the-art methods. These results suggest commonalities between these compression paradigms that could inspire future work. Our code is available at https://github.com/LawrenceRLiu/NoWag</p></details> |  |

However, the function of descriptive instructions during ICL remains under-explored. In this work, we propose an ensemble prompt framework to describe the selection criteria of multiple in-context examples, and preliminary experiments on machine translation (MT) across six translation directions confirm that this framework boosts ICL performance. But to our surprise, LLMs might not care what the descriptions actually say, and the performance gain is primarily caused by the ensemble format, since it could lead to improvement even with random descriptive nouns. We further apply this new ensemble framework on a range of commonsense, math, logical reasoning and hallucination tasks with three LLMs and achieve promising results, suggesting again that designing a proper prompt format would be much more effective and efficient than paying effort into specific descriptions.

Existing codebook-based methods either rely on small vocabularies (~16K entries) that lack fine-grained semantics or naively scale up, resulting in low token utilization and unstable training. We propose UniCode$^2$, a cascaded codebook framework enabling large-scale, semantically aligned, and stable visual tokenization. By clustering millions of SigLIP sequence embeddings, we build a 500K-entry codebook that preserves vision-language alignment while expanding capacity. Stability is ensured via a cascaded design: a frozen codebook anchors the embedding space, and a trainable codebook refines task-specific semantics. This decoupling promotes high utilization and robust learning. Moreover, the alignment of our visual tokens with textual semantics enables seamless integration with pretrained diffusion decoders, supporting high-quality visual synthesis with minimal adaptation. UniCode^2 delivers strong performance across diverse benchmarks, demonstrating the viability of scaling visual token spaces without sacrificing stability, semantics, or modularity.</p></details> | 19 pages, 5 figures |

However, fast satellite motion, brief satellite-ground station (GS) contact windows, and large size of the images pose a data download challenge. To enable near real-time Earth observation applications (e.g., disaster and extreme weather monitoring), we should explore how to deploy LVLM in LEO satellite networks, and design SpaceVerse, an efficient satellite-ground synergistic LVLM inference system. To this end, firstly, we deploy compact LVLMs on satellites for lightweight tasks, whereas regular LVLMs operate on GSs to handle computationally intensive tasks. Then, we propose a computing and communication co-design framework comprised of a progressive confidence network and an attention-based multi-scale preprocessing, used to identify on-satellite inferring data, and reduce data redundancy before satellite-GS transmission, separately. We implement and evaluate SpaceVerse on real-world LEO satellite constellations and datasets, achieving a 31.2% average gain in accuracy and a 51.2% reduction in latency compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | 11 pages, 12 figures |

After reviewing the current use of LLMs in ABM, this study reflects on the opportunities and challenges of the potential use of LLMs in ABM. It does so by following the modelling cycle, from problem formulation to documentation and communication of model results, and holding a critical stance.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, including 2 pages of appendix, accepted for publication at the Social Simulation Conference 2025 (https://ssc2025.tbm.tudelft.nl/)</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Training of Large-Scale AI Models Through Federated Mixture-of-Experts: A System-Level Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05685v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of Federated Learning (FL) and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) presents a compelling pathway for training more powerful, large-scale artificial intelligence models (LAMs) on decentralized data while preserving privacy. However, efficient federated training of these complex MoE-structured LAMs is hindered by significant system-level challenges, particularly in managing the interplay between heterogeneous client resources and the sophisticated coordination required for numerous specialized experts. This article highlights a critical, yet underexplored concept: the absence of robust quantitative strategies for dynamic client-expert alignment that holistically considers varying client capacities and the imperative for system-wise load balancing. Specifically, we propose a conceptual system design for intelligent client-expert alignment that incorporates dynamic fitness scoring, global expert load monitoring, and client capacity profiling. By tackling these systemic issues, we can unlock more scalable, efficient, and robust training mechanisms {with fewer communication rounds for convergence}, paving the way for the widespread deployment of large-scale federated MoE-structured LAMs in edge computing with ultra-high communication efficiency.</p></details> | 7 pages |

BMMR comprises 110k college-level questions spanning 300 UNESCO-defined subjects, spanning diverse formats-multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank, and open-ended QA-and sourced from both print and digital media such as books, exams, and quizzes. All data are curated and filtered via a human-in-the-loop and scalable framework, and each instance is paired with a high-quality reasoning path. The dataset is organized into two parts: BMMR-Eval that comprises 20,458 high-quality instances to comprehensively assess LMMs' knowledge and reasoning across multiple disciplines in both Chinese and English; and BMMR-Train that contains 88,991 instances to support further research and development, extending the current focus on mathematical reasoning to diverse disciplines and domains. In addition, we propose the process-based multi-discipline verifier (i.e., BMMR-Verifier) for accurate and fine-grained evaluation of reasoning paths. Extensive experiments on 24 models reveal that (i) even SOTA models (e.g., o3 and Gemini-2.5-Pro) leave substantial headroom on BMMR-Eval; (ii) reasoning models exhibit discipline bias and outperform LMMs only on specific subjects; (iii) open-source models still trail their proprietary counterparts; and (iv) fine-tuning on BMMR-Train narrows this gap. Additionally, we conduct reasoning-chain analyses using BMMR-Verifier and other in-depth studies, uncovering the challenges LMMs currently face in multidisciplinary reasoning. We will release the data, and we hope our work can offer insights and contributions to the community.</p></details> | Preprint |

To address this, we introduce AgentSafe, a novel framework that enhances MAS security through hierarchical information management and memory protection. AgentSafe classifies information by security levels, restricting sensitive data access to authorized agents. AgentSafe incorporates two components: ThreatSieve, which secures communication by verifying information authority and preventing impersonation, and HierarCache, an adaptive memory management system that defends against unauthorized access and malicious poisoning, representing the first systematic defense for agent memory. Experiments across various LLMs show that AgentSafe significantly boosts system resilience, achieving defense success rates above 80% under adversarial conditions. Additionally, AgentSafe demonstrates scalability, maintaining robust performance as agent numbers and information complexity grow. Results underscore effectiveness of AgentSafe in securing MAS and its potential for real-world application.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose MEF, a capability-aware multi-encryption framework for evaluating vulnerabilities in black-box LLMs. Our key insight is that the effectiveness of jailbreak strategies can be significantly enhanced by tailoring them to the semantic comprehension capabilities of the target model. We present a typology that classifies LLMs into Type I and Type II based on their comprehension levels, and design adaptive attack strategies for each. MEF combines layered semantic mutations and dual-ended encryption techniques, enabling circumvention of input, inference, and output-level defenses. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Remarkably, it achieves a jailbreak success rate of 98.9\% on GPT-4o (29 May 2025 release). Our findings reveal vulnerabilities in current LLMs' alignment defenses.</p></details> |  |

To explore this, we introduce an analytical framework using systematically designed prompts on existing multimodal sarcasm datasets. Evaluating 12 state-of-the-art LVLMs over 2,409 samples, we examine interpretive variations within and across models, focusing on confidence levels, alignment with dataset labels, and recognition of ambiguous "neutral" cases. Our findings reveal notable discrepancies -- across LVLMs and within the same model under varied prompts. While classification-oriented prompts yield higher internal consistency, models diverge markedly when tasked with interpretive reasoning. These results challenge binary labeling paradigms by highlighting sarcasm's subjectivity. We advocate moving beyond rigid annotation schemes toward multi-perspective, uncertainty-aware modeling, offering deeper insights into multimodal sarcasm comprehension. Our code and data are available at: https://github.com/CoderChen01/LVLMSarcasmAnalysis</p></details> |  |

Determining adsorption energy requires evaluating numerous adsorbate-catalyst configurations, making it computationally intensive. Current methods rely on exhaustive sampling, which does not guarantee the identification of the global minimum energy. To address this, we introduce Adsorb-Agent, a Large Language Model (LLM) agent designed to efficiently identify stable adsorption configurations corresponding to the global minimum energy. Adsorb-Agent leverages its built-in knowledge and reasoning to strategically explore configurations, significantly reducing the number of initial setups required while improving energy prediction accuracy. In this study, we also evaluated the performance of different LLMs, including GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Claude-3.7-Sonnet, and DeepSeek-Chat, as the reasoning engine for Adsorb-Agent, with GPT-4o showing the strongest overall performance. Tested on twenty diverse systems, Adsorb-Agent identifies comparable adsorption energies for 84% of cases and achieves lower energies for 35%, particularly excelling in complex systems. It identifies lower energies in 47% of intermetallic systems and 67% of systems with large adsorbates. These findings demonstrate Adsorb-Agent's potential to accelerate catalyst discovery by reducing computational costs and enhancing prediction reliability compared to exhaustive search methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Domain adaptation of large language models for geotechnical applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05613v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent developments in large language models (LLMs) are opening up new opportunities in geotechnical engineering and engineering geology. While general-purpose LLMs possess broad capabilities, effective application in geotechnics often requires domain-specific adaptation. Such tailored LLMs are increasingly employed to streamline geotechnical workflows. This paper presents the first survey of the adaptation and application of LLMs in geotechnical engineering. It outlines key methodologies for adaptation to geotechnical domain, including prompt engineering, retrieval-augmented generation, domain-adaptive pretraining, and fine-tuning. The survey examines the state-of-the-art applications of geotechnical-adapted LLMs, including geological interpretation, subsurface characterization, site planning, design calculations, numerical modeling, safety and risk assessment, and educational tutoring. It also analyzes benefits and limitations of geotechnical-adapted LLMs, and identifies promising directions for future research in this interdisciplinary discipline. The findings serve as a valuable resource for practitioners seeking to integrate LLMs into geotechnical practice, while also providing a foundation to stimulate further investigation within the academic community.</p></details> |  |

AbdomenAtlas provides 673K high-quality masks of anatomical structures in the abdominal region annotated by a team of 10 radiologists with the help of AI algorithms. We start by having expert radiologists manually annotate 22 anatomical structures in 5,246 CT volumes. Following this, a semi-automatic annotation procedure is performed for the remaining CT volumes, where radiologists revise the annotations predicted by AI, and in turn, AI improves its predictions by learning from revised annotations. Such a large-scale, detailed-annotated, and multi-center dataset is needed for two reasons. Firstly, AbdomenAtlas provides important resources for AI development at scale, branded as large pre-trained models, which can alleviate the annotation workload of expert radiologists to transfer to broader clinical applications. Secondly, AbdomenAtlas establishes a large-scale benchmark for evaluating AI algorithms -- the more data we use to test the algorithms, the better we can guarantee reliable performance in complex clinical scenarios. An ISBI & MICCAI challenge named BodyMaps: Towards 3D Atlas of Human Body was launched using a subset of our AbdomenAtlas, aiming to stimulate AI innovation and to benchmark segmentation accuracy, inference efficiency, and domain generalizability. We hope our AbdomenAtlas can set the stage for larger-scale clinical trials and offer exceptional opportunities to practitioners in the medical imaging community.

Previous studies often lack clear explanations of how these scores were determined, limiting their adoption in clinical practice. While the advent of LLMs provides a possible pathway for explainable depression diagnosis, current LLMs capable of processing multimodal data lack training on interview data, resulting in poor diagnostic performance when used directly. In this paper, we propose a novel multimodal large language model (MLlm-DR) that can understand multimodal information inputs and supports explainable depression diagnosis. MLlm-DR integrates a smaller LLMs and a lightweight query module (LQ-former). Specifically, the smaller LLMs is designed to generate depression scores and corresponding evaluation rationales. To enhance its logical reasoning for domain-specific tasks while maintaining practicality, we constructed a robust training dataset to fine-tune it. Meanwhile, the LQ-former captures depression-related features from speech and visual data, aiding the model's ability to process multimodal information, to achieve comprehensive depression diagnosis. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on two interview-based benchmark datasets, CMDC and E-DAIC-WOZ, demonstrating its effectiveness and superiority.</p></details> |  |
| **[Offline Learning and Forgetting for Reasoning with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11364v3)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging inference-time search in large language models has proven effective in further enhancing a trained model's capability to solve complex mathematical and reasoning problems. However, this approach significantly increases computational costs and inference time, as the model must generate and evaluate multiple candidate solutions to identify a viable reasoning path. To address this, we propose an effective approach that integrates search capabilities directly into the model by fine-tuning it on unpaired successful (learning) and failed reasoning paths (forgetting) derived from diverse search methods. A key challenge we identify is that naive fine-tuning can degrade the model's search capability; we show this can be mitigated with a smaller learning rate. Extensive experiments on the challenging Game-of-24 and Countdown reasoning benchmarks show that, replacing CoT-generated data with search-generated data for offline fine-tuning improves success rates by around 23% over inference-time search baselines, while reducing inference time by 180$\times$. On top of this, our learning and forgetting objective consistently outperforms both supervised fine-tuning and preference-based methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/twni2016/llm-reasoning-uft</p></details> |

However, the underlying large language models (LLMs) are evolving rapidly and so prompting them consistently is a challenge. This leads to inconsistent and unpredictable application behavior, undermining the reliability that businesses require for mission-critical workflows. In this paper, we introduce the concept of prompt migration as a systematic approach to stabilizing GenAI applications amid changing LLMs. Using the Tursio enterprise search application as a case study, we analyze the impact of successive GPT model upgrades, detail our migration framework including prompt redesign and a migration testbed, and demonstrate how these techniques restore application consistency. Our results show that structured prompt migration can fully recover the application reliability that was lost due to model drift. We conclude with practical lessons learned, emphasizing the need for prompt lifecycle management and robust testing to ensure dependable GenAI-powered business applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReLayout: Integrating Relation Reasoning for Content-aware Layout Generation with Multi-modal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05568v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Content-aware layout aims to arrange design elements appropriately on a given canvas to convey information effectively. Recently, the trend for this task has been to leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate layouts automatically, achieving remarkable performance. However, existing LLM-based methods fail to adequately interpret spatial relationships among visual themes and design elements, leading to structural and diverse problems in layout generation. To address this issue, we introduce ReLayout, a novel method that leverages relation-CoT to generate more reasonable and aesthetically coherent layouts by fundamentally originating from design concepts. Specifically, we enhance layout annotations by introducing explicit relation definitions, such as region, salient, and margin between elements, with the goal of decomposing the layout into smaller, structured, and recursive layouts, thereby enabling the generation of more structured layouts. Furthermore, based on these defined relationships, we introduce a layout prototype rebalance sampler, which defines layout prototype features across three dimensions and quantifies distinct layout styles. This sampler addresses uniformity issues in generation that arise from data bias in the prototype distribution balance process. Extensive experimental results verify that ReLayout outperforms baselines and can generate structural and diverse layouts that are more aligned with human aesthetics and more explainable.</p></details> |  |
| **[Search-based Selection of Metamorphic Relations for Optimized Robustness Testing of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05565v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Assessing the trustworthiness of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as robustness, has garnered significant attention. Recently, metamorphic testing that defines Metamorphic Relations (MRs) has been widely applied to evaluate the robustness of LLM executions. However, the MR-based robustness testing still requires a scalable number of MRs, thereby necessitating the optimization of selecting MRs. Most extant LLM testing studies are limited to automatically generating test cases (i.e., MRs) to enhance failure detection. Additionally, most studies only considered a limited test space of single perturbation MRs in their evaluation of LLMs. In contrast, our paper proposes a search-based approach for optimizing the MR groups to maximize failure detection and minimize the LLM execution cost. Moreover, our approach covers the combinatorial perturbations in MRs, facilitating the expansion of test space in the robustness assessment. We have developed a search process and implemented four search algorithms: Single-GA, NSGA-II, SPEA2, and MOEA/D with novel encoding to solve the MR selection problem in the LLM robustness testing. We conducted comparative experiments on the four search algorithms along with a random search, using two major LLMs with primary Text-to-Text tasks. Our statistical and empirical investigation revealed two key findings: (1) the MOEA/D algorithm performed the best in optimizing the MR space for LLM robustness testing, and (2) we identified silver bullet MRs for the LLM robustness testing, which demonstrated dominant capabilities in confusing LLMs across different Text-to-Text tasks. In LLM robustness assessment, our research sheds light on the fundamental problem for optimized testing and provides insights into search-based solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Test-Time Scaling of Large Language Models with Hierarchical Retrieval-Augmented MCTS](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05557v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test-time scaling has emerged as a promising paradigm in language modeling, leveraging additional computational resources at inference time to enhance model performance. In this work, we introduce R2-LLMs, a novel and versatile hierarchical retrieval-augmented reasoning framework designed to improve test-time scaling in large language models (LLMs) without requiring distillation from more advanced models to obtain chain-of-thought (CoT) training data. R2-LLMs enhances inference-time generalization by integrating dual-level retrieval-based in-context learning: (1) At the coarse level, our approach extracts abstract templates from complex reasoning problems and retrieves similar problem-answer pairs to facilitate high-level in-context learning; (2) At the fine level, during Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), R2-LLMs efficiently retrieves analogous intermediate solution steps from reference mathematical problem datasets, refining step-wise reasoning with the aid of a process reward model (PRM) for scoring. R2-LLMs is a robust hierarchical reasoning-augmentation method that enhances in-context-level reasoning while seamlessly integrating with step-level tree search methods. Utilizing PRM, it refines both candidate generation and decision-making for improved reasoning accuracy. Empirical evaluations on the MATH500, GSM8K, and OlympiadBench-TO datasets achieve substantial relative improvement with an increase of up to 16% using LLaMA-3.1-8B compared to the baselines, showcasing the effectiveness of our approach in complex reasoning tasks.</p></details> | Technical Report |

In this paper, we propose the Deductive and InDuctive(DID) method, a novel framework that enhances LLM reasoning by dynamically integrating both deductive and inductive reasoning approaches. Drawing from cognitive science principles, DID implements a dual-metric complexity evaluation system that combines Littlestone dimension and information entropy to precisely assess task difficulty and guide decomposition strategies. DID enables the model to progressively adapt its reasoning pathways based on problem complexity, mirroring human cognitive processes. We evaluate DID's effectiveness across multiple benchmarks, including the AIW and MR-GSM8K, as well as our custom Holiday Puzzle dataset for temporal reasoning. Our results demonstrate significant improvements in reasoning quality and solution accuracy - achieving 70.3% accuracy on AIW (compared to 62.2% for Tree of Thought) while maintaining lower computational costs. The success of DID in improving LLM performance while preserving computational efficiency suggests promising directions for developing more cognitively aligned and capable language models. Our work contributes a theoretically grounded, input-centric approach to enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities, offering an efficient alternative to traditional output-exploration methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 fig...</summary><p>4 figures, accept at ACL2025 Main</p></details> |

Recent studies have concentrated on classifying cardiac conditions using ECG data but have overlooked ECG report generation, which is time-consuming and requires clinical expertise. To automate ECG report generation and ensure its versatility, we propose the Multimodal ECG Instruction Tuning (MEIT) framework, the first attempt to tackle ECG report generation with LLMs and multimodal instructions. To facilitate future research, we establish a benchmark to evaluate MEIT with various LLMs backbones across two large-scale ECG datasets. Our approach uniquely aligns the representations of the ECG signal and the report, and we conduct extensive experiments to benchmark MEIT with nine open-source LLMs using more than 800,000 ECG reports. MEIT's results underscore the superior performance of instruction-tuned LLMs, showcasing their proficiency in quality report generation, zero-shot capabilities, resilience to signal perturbation, and alignment with human expert evaluation. These findings emphasize the efficacy of MEIT and its potential for real-world clinical application.</p></details> | ACL 2025 |

However, their proficiency within the chemistry domain remains restricted, especially in solving molecule-related tasks. This challenge is attributed to their inherent limitations in comprehending molecules using only common textual representations, i.e. SMILES strings. In this study, we seek to enhance the ability of LLMs to comprehend molecules by equipping them with a multi-modal external module, termed MolX. Instead of directly using SMILES strings to represent a molecule, we utilize specific encoders to extract fine-grained features from both SMILES string and 2D molecular graph representations for feeding into an LLM. A hand-crafted molecular fingerprint is incorporated to leverage its embedded domain knowledge. To establish an alignment between MolX and the LLM's textual input space, the model in which the LLM is frozen, is pre-trained with a strategy including a diverse set of tasks. Experimental evaluations show that our proposed method outperforms baselines across 4 downstream molecule-related tasks ranging from molecule-to-text translation to retrosynthesis, with and without fine-tuning the LLM, while only introducing a small number of trainable parameters--0.53\% and 0.82\%, respectively.</p></details> | MLoG-GenAI@KDD '25 |

However, the regularization with respect to the reference policy, which is crucial for mitigating over-optimization, has been insufficiently investigated in self-play alignment. To study the impact of different regularization strategies, we propose \textbf{Regularized Self-Play Policy Optimization (RSPO)}, a general and modular framework that unifies prior methods and enables simple plug-and-play integration of various regularizers, meanwhile preserving convergence to Nash equilibrium of the corresponding regularized game.Our empirical study involving over $120$ fine-tuned Mistral-7B-Instruct models reveals that forward KL divergence regularization reduces response length, whereas reverse KL divergence markedly improves raw win rates. Crucially, RSPO regularized with a linear combination of forward and reverse KL divergence significantly boosts the length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval-2 from $28.5\%$ (unregularized self-play, SPPO) to $35.4\%$, and consistently demonstrates superior performance on Arena-Hard, MT-Bench, ArmoRM scores, and response diversity. Combining simplicity, convergence guarantees, and significant empirical gains, RSPO offers a strong foundation for exploring regularized self-play in language model alignment.</p></details> | Preprint |

However, it remains controversial to what extent these systems truly understand language. We examine this issue by narrowing the question down to the semantics of LLMs at the word and sentence level. By examining the inner workings of LLMs and their generated representation of language and by drawing on classical semantic theories by Frege and Russell, we get a more nuanced picture of the potential semantic capabilities of LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **["Lost-in-the-Later": Framework for Quantifying Contextual Grounding in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05424v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models are capable of leveraging both contextual and parametric knowledge but how they prioritize and integrate these sources remains underexplored. We introduce CoPE, a novel evaluation framework that systematically measures contextual knowledge (CK) and parametric knowledge (PK) across models and languages. Using our MultiWikiAtomic dataset in English, Spanish, and Danish, we analyze how large language models (LLMs) integrate context, prioritize information, and incorporate PK in open-ended question answering. Our analysis uncovers a phenomenon we call lost-in-the-later, where LLMs tend to overlook or deprioritize information that appears later in a given context, revealing a strong positional bias that affects contextual grounding. We further find that reasoning models, as well as non-reasoning models prompted with chain-of-thought (CoT), use context even less than non-reasoning models without CoT and fail to mitigate the lost-in-the-later effect. CoT prompting, in particular, results in lower recall and shorter responses, leading to degraded contextual grounding. Based on these insights, we design prompt-based methods to effectively leverage input context. A case study applying CoPE to summarization demonstrates that CK-informed prompting improves factual grounding and reduces hallucination.</p></details> |  |

An exception is the two-page standardized notice that U.S. financial institutions must provide under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA). However, banks now operate websites, mobile apps, and other services that involve complex data sharing practices that require additional privacy notices and do-not-sell opt-outs. We conducted a large-scale analysis of how U.S. banks implement privacy policies and controls in response to GLBA; other federal privacy policy requirements; and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), a key example for U.S. state privacy laws. We focused on the disclosure and control of a set of especially privacy-invasive practices: third-party data sharing for marketing-related purposes. We collected privacy policies for the 2,067 largest U.S. banks, 45.3\% of which provided multiple policies. Across disclosures and controls within the \textit{same} bank, we identified frequent, concerning inconsistencies -- such as banks indicating in GLBA notices that they do not share with third parties but disclosing sharing elsewhere, or using third-party marketing/advertising cookies without disclosure. This multiplicity of policies, with the inconsistencies it causes, may create consumer confusion and undermine the transparency goals of the very laws that require them. Our findings call into question whether current policy requirements, such as the GLBA notice, are achieving their intended goals in today's online banking landscape. We discuss potential avenues for reforming and harmonizing privacy policies and control requirements across federal and state laws.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in CCS 2025.

Compared to other state-of-the-art deep learning systems, AXLearn has a unique focus on modularity and support for heterogeneous hardware infrastructure. AXLearn's internal interfaces between software components follow strict encapsulation, allowing different components to be assembled to facilitate rapid model development and experimentation on heterogeneous compute infrastructure. We introduce a novel method of quantifying modularity via Lines-of-Code (LoC)-complexity, which demonstrates how our system maintains constant complexity as we scale the components in the system, compared to linear or quadratic complexity in other systems. This allows integrating features such as Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) into AXLearn across hundred of modules with just 10 lines of code, compared to hundreds as required in other systems. At the same time, AXLearn maintains equivalent performance compared to state-of-the-art training systems. Finally, we share our experience in the development and operation of AXLearn.</p></details> |  |

Recently, various downstream tasks, such as chart question answering, chart2text, and fact-checking, have emerged. Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) show promise in tackling these tasks, but their evaluation is costly and time-consuming, limiting real-world deployment. While using LVLMs as judges to assess the chart comprehension capabilities of other LVLMs could streamline evaluation processes, challenges like proprietary datasets, restricted access to powerful models, and evaluation costs hinder their adoption in industrial settings. To this end, we present a comprehensive evaluation of 13 open-source LVLMs as judges for diverse chart comprehension and reasoning tasks. We design both pairwise and pointwise evaluation tasks covering criteria like factual correctness, informativeness, and relevancy. Additionally, we analyze LVLM judges based on format adherence, positional consistency, length bias, and instruction-following. We focus on cost-effective LVLMs (<10B parameters) suitable for both research and commercial use, following a standardized evaluation protocol and rubric to measure the LVLM judge's accuracy. Experimental results reveal notable variability: while some open LVLM judges achieve GPT-4-level evaluation performance (about 80% agreement with GPT-4 judgments), others struggle (below ~10% agreement). Our findings highlight that state-of-the-art open-source LVLMs can serve as cost-effective automatic evaluators for chart-related tasks, though biases such as positional preference and length bias persist.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ACL 2025 Industry Track</p></details> |
| **[Response Attack: Exploiting Contextual Priming to Jailbreak Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05248v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contextual priming, where earlier stimuli covertly bias later judgments, offers an unexplored attack surface for large language models (LLMs). We uncover a contextual priming vulnerability in which the previous response in the dialogue can steer its subsequent behavior toward policy-violating content. Building on this insight, we propose Response Attack, which uses an auxiliary LLM to generate a mildly harmful response to a paraphrased version of the original malicious query. They are then formatted into the dialogue and followed by a succinct trigger prompt, thereby priming the target model to generate harmful content. Across eight open-source and proprietary LLMs, RA consistently outperforms seven state-of-the-art jailbreak techniques, achieving higher attack success rates. To mitigate this threat, we construct and release a context-aware safety fine-tuning dataset, which significantly reduces the attack success rate while preserving model capabilities. The code and data are available at https://github.com/Dtc7w3PQ/Response-Attack.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 9 figures.

| **[A Careful Examination of Large Behavior Models for Multitask Dexterous Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05331v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robot manipulation has seen tremendous progress in recent years, with imitation learning policies enabling successful performance of dexterous and hard-to-model tasks. Concurrently, scaling data and model size has led to the development of capable language and vision foundation models, motivating large-scale efforts to create general-purpose robot foundation models. While these models have garnered significant enthusiasm and investment, meaningful evaluation of real-world performance remains a challenge, limiting both the pace of development and inhibiting a nuanced understanding of current capabilities. In this paper, we rigorously evaluate multitask robot manipulation policies, referred to as Large Behavior Models (LBMs), by extending the Diffusion Policy paradigm across a corpus of simulated and real-world robot data. We propose and validate an evaluation pipeline to rigorously analyze the capabilities of these models with statistical confidence. We compare against single-task baselines through blind, randomized trials in a controlled setting, using both simulation and real-world experiments. We find that multi-task pretraining makes the policies more successful and robust, and enables teaching complex new tasks more quickly, using a fraction of the data when compared to single-task baselines. Moreover, performance predictably increases as pretraining scale and diversity grows. Project page: https://toyotaresearchinstitute.github.io/lbm1/</p></details> |  |
| **[The Super Weight in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07191v2)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent works have shown a surprising result: a small fraction of Large Language Model (LLM) parameter outliers are disproportionately important to the quality of the model. LLMs contain billions of parameters, so these small fractions, such as 0.01%, translate to hundreds of thousands of parameters. In this work, we present an even more surprising finding: Pruning as few as a single parameter can destroy an LLM's ability to generate text -- increasing perplexity by 3 orders of magnitude and reducing zero-shot accuracy to guessing. We propose a data-free method for identifying such parameters, termed super weights, using a single forward pass through the model. We additionally find that these super weights induce correspondingly rare and large activation outliers, termed super activations. When preserved with high precision, super activations can improve simple round-to-nearest quantization to become competitive with state-of-the-art methods. For weight quantization, we similarly find that by preserving the super weight and clipping other weight outliers, round-to-nearest quantization can scale to much larger block sizes than previously considered. To facilitate further research into super weights, we provide an index of super weight coordinates for common, openly available LLMs.</p></details> |  |

In particular, the transferability of adversarial examples remains an ongoing challenge. In this paper, we specifically analyze the manifestation of adversarial transferability among MLLMs and identify the key factors that influence this characteristic. We discover that the transferability of MLLMs exists in cross-LLM scenarios with the same vision encoder and indicate \underline{\textit{two key Factors}} that may influence transferability. We provide two semantic-level data augmentation methods, Adding Image Patch (AIP) and Typography Augment Transferability Method (TATM), which boost the transferability of adversarial examples across MLLMs. To explore the potential impact in the real world, we utilize two tasks that can have both negative and positive societal impacts: \ding{182} Harmful Content Insertion and \ding{183} Information Protection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM 2025</p></details> |

They adapt to various styles and genres, producing content that is both grammatically correct and semantically meaningful. Recently, LLMs have been misused to create highly realistic phishing emails, spread fake news, generate code to automate cyber crime, and write fraudulent scientific articles. Additionally, in many real-world applications, the generated content including style and topic and the generator model are not known beforehand. The increasing prevalence and sophistication of artificial intelligence (AI)-generated texts have made their detection progressively more challenging. Various attempts have been made to distinguish machine-generated text from human-authored content using linguistic, statistical, machine learning, and ensemble-based approaches. This work focuses on two primary objectives Task-A, which involves distinguishing human-written text from machine-generated text, and Task-B, which attempts to identify the specific LLM model responsible for the generation. Both of these tasks are based on fine tuning of Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT_4o-mini), Large Language Model Meta AI (LLaMA) 3 8B, and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT). The fine-tuned version of GPT_4o-mini and the BERT model has achieved accuracies of 0.9547 for Task-A and 0.4698 for Task-B.</p></details> | 7 pages, 3 figures |

Despite the remarkable success of LLMs in Natural Language Processing (NLP), their performance in text summarization across various domains and datasets has not been comprehensively evaluated. At the same time, the ability to summarize text effectively without relying on extensive training data has become a crucial bottleneck. To address these issues, we present a systematic evaluation of six LLMs across four datasets: CNN/Daily Mail and NewsRoom (news), SAMSum (dialog), and ArXiv (scientific). By leveraging prompt engineering techniques including zero-shot and in-context learning, our study evaluates the performance using the ROUGE and BERTScore metrics. In addition, a detailed analysis of inference times is conducted to better understand the trade-off between summarization quality and computational efficiency. For Long documents, introduce a sentence-based chunking strategy that enables LLMs with shorter context windows to summarize extended inputs in multiple stages. The findings reveal that while LLMs perform competitively on news and dialog tasks, their performance on long scientific documents improves significantly when aided by chunking strategies. In addition, notable performance variations were observed based on model parameters, dataset properties, and prompt design. These results offer actionable insights into how different LLMs behave across task types, contributing to ongoing research in efficient, instruction-based NLP systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript is an extended version of the work accepted for publication in the International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications (IJACSA), Volume 16, Issue 6, June 2025</p></details> |

While artificial intelligence (AI) offers a promising approach to CSI acquisition and utilization, existing methods largely depend on task-specific neural networks (NNs) that require expert-driven design and large training datasets, limiting their generalizability and practicality. To address these challenges, we propose LVM4CSI, a general and efficient framework that leverages the structural similarity between CSI and computer vision (CV) data to directly apply large vision models (LVMs) pre-trained on extensive CV datasets to wireless tasks without any fine-tuning, in contrast to large language model-based methods that generally necessitate fine-tuning. LVM4CSI maps CSI tasks to analogous CV tasks, transforms complex-valued CSI into visual formats compatible with LVMs, and integrates lightweight trainable layers to adapt extracted features to specific communication objectives. We validate LVM4CSI through three representative case studies, including channel estimation, human activity recognition, and user localization. Results demonstrate that LVM4CSI achieves comparable or superior performance to task-specific NNs, including an improvement exceeding 9.61 dB in channel estimation and approximately 40% reduction in localization error. Furthermore, it significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters and eliminates the need for task-specific NN design.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[INTER: Mitigating Hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models by Interaction Guidance Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05056v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hallucinations in large vision-language models (LVLMs) pose significant challenges for real-world applications, as LVLMs may generate responses that appear plausible yet remain inconsistent with the associated visual content. This issue rarely occurs in human cognition. We argue that this discrepancy arises from humans' ability to effectively leverage multimodal interaction information in data samples. Specifically, humans typically first gather multimodal information, analyze the interactions across modalities for understanding, and then express their understanding through language. Motivated by this observation, we conduct extensive experiments on popular LVLMs and obtained insights that surprisingly reveal human-like, though less pronounced, cognitive behavior of LVLMs on multimodal samples. Building on these findings, we further propose \textbf{INTER}: \textbf{Inter}action Guidance Sampling, a novel training-free algorithm that mitigate hallucinations without requiring additional data. Specifically, INTER explicitly guides LVLMs to effectively reapply their understanding of multimodal interaction information when generating responses, thereby reducing potential hallucinations. On six benchmarks including VQA and image captioning tasks, INTER achieves an average improvement of up to 3.4\% on five LVLMs compared to the state-of-the-art decoding strategy. The code will be released when the paper is accepted.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods for knowledge tracing in learning sciences are predominantly reliant on statistical data and instructor-defined knowledge components, making it challenging to integrate AI-generated educational content with traditional established methods. We propose a method for automatically extracting knowledge components from educational content using instruction-tuned large multimodal models. We validate this approach by comprehensively evaluating it against knowledge tracing benchmarks in five domains. Our results indicate that the automatically extracted knowledge components can effectively replace human-tagged labels, offering a promising direction for enhancing intelligent tutoring systems in limited-data scenarios, achieving more explainable assessments in educational settings, and laying the groundwork for automated assessment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Educational Data Mining 2025</p></details> |

However, the information about APIs available online is often presented as unstructured, free-form HTML documentation, requiring external users to spend significant time manually converting it into a structured format. To address this, we introduce OASBuilder, a novel framework that transforms long and diverse API documentation pages into consistent, machine-readable API specifications. This is achieved through a carefully crafted pipeline that integrates large language models and rule-based algorithms which are guided by domain knowledge of the structure of documentation webpages. Our experiments demonstrate that OASBuilder generalizes well across hundreds of APIs, and produces valid OpenAPI specifications that encapsulate most of the information from the original documentation. OASBuilder has been successfully implemented in an enterprise environment, saving thousands of hours of manual effort and making hundreds of complex enterprise APIs accessible as tools for LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Yet, these advances come with a significant challenge: the high cost of model serving. To mitigate these costs, consumer-grade GPUs emerge as a more affordable alternative. This presents an opportunity for more cost-efficient LLM serving by leveraging these GPUs. However, it is non-trivial to achieve high-efficiency LLM serving on consumer-grade GPUs, mainly due to two challenges: 1) these GPUs are often deployed in limited network conditions; 2) these GPUs often exhibit heterogeneity in host systems. To address these challenges, we present MoLink, a distributed LLM serving system for large models. It incorporates several key techniques, enabling efficient LLM serving on heterogeneous and weakly connected consumer-grade GPUs. Our experiments demonstrate that it achieves throughput improvements of up to 458\% and cost-profit margin improvements of up to 151\%, compared to state-of-the-art systems. MoLink allows users on Windows, Linux, and containerized VMs to seamlessly integrate GPUs with just a few lines of code over Ethernet or public networks. Currently, it supports 18 mainstream architectures of open-source large language models.</p></details> |  |

However, current SDL implementations rely on rigid protocols that fail to capture the adaptability and intuition of expert scientists in dynamic experimental settings. We introduce Artificially Intelligent Lab Assistant (AILA), a framework automating atomic force microscopy through LLM driven agents. Further, we develop AFMBench a comprehensive evaluation suite challenging AI agents across the complete scientific workflow from experimental design to results analysis. We find that state of the art models struggle with basic tasks and coordination scenarios. Notably, Claude 3.5 sonnet performs unexpectedly poorly despite excelling in materials domain question answering (QA) benchmarks, revealing that domain specific QA proficiency does not necessarily translate to effective agentic capabilities. Additionally, we observe that LLMs can deviate from instructions, raising safety alignment concerns for SDL applications. Our ablations reveal that multi agent frameworks outperform single-agent architectures. We also observe significant prompt fragility, where slight modifications in prompt structure cause substantial performance variations in capable models like GPT 4o. Finally, we evaluate AILA's effectiveness in increasingly advanced experiments AFM calibration, feature detection, mechanical property measurement, graphene layer counting, and indenter detection. Our findings underscore the necessity for rigorous benchmarking protocols and prompt engineering strategies before deploying AI laboratory assistants in scientific research environments.</p></details> |  |

Alignment for Answerability in Video Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04976v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the broader context of deep learning, Multimodal Large Language Models have achieved significant breakthroughs by leveraging powerful Large Language Models as a backbone to align different modalities into the language space. A prime exemplification is the development of Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs). While numerous advancements have been proposed to enhance the video understanding capabilities of these models, they are predominantly trained on questions generated directly from video content. However, in real-world scenarios, users often pose questions that extend beyond the informational scope of the video, highlighting the need for Video-LLMs to assess the relevance of the question. We demonstrate that even the best-performing Video-LLMs fail to reject unfit questions-not necessarily due to a lack of video understanding, but because they have not been trained to identify and refuse such questions. To address this limitation, we propose alignment for answerability, a framework that equips Video-LLMs with the ability to evaluate the relevance of a question based on the input video and appropriately decline to answer when the question exceeds the scope of the video, as well as an evaluation framework with a comprehensive set of metrics designed to measure model behavior before and after alignment. Furthermore, we present a pipeline for creating a dataset specifically tailored for alignment for answerability, leveraging existing video-description paired datasets.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

In distributed AI systems, DSE plays a crucial role in identifying hard-to-detect bugs, especially those arising from complex network communication patterns. However, traditional approaches to symbolic execution are often hindered by scalability issues and inefficiencies, particularly in large-scale systems. This paper introduces LIFT (Large-language-model Integrated Functional-equivalent-IR Transformation), a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the optimization of Intermediate Representations (IRs) in symbolic execution. LIFT addresses the challenges of symbolic execution by providing a scalable, context-sensitive solution for IR transformation. The framework consists of two phases: IR Analysis and Optimization, where LLMs optimize time-intensive IR blocks, and Symbolic Execution and Validation, which includes benchmarking and semantic verification to ensure correctness and generalizability. Experiments on real-world binaries demonstrated significant performance improvements, including a 53.5\% reduction in execution time for bigtest and a 10.24\% reduction for random, along with reductions in IR statements, PUT instructions, and temporary variables. These results demonstrate that LLMs simplify IRs while maintaining functional correctness, enhancing symbolic execution in distributed AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM SIGCOMM 2025 - 2nd Workshop on Networks for AI Computing (NAIC). 7 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

We study matrix majorization in large samples and in the catalytic regime in the case where the columns of the matrices need not have equal support, as has been assumed in earlier works. We focus on two cases: either there are no support restrictions (except for requiring a non-empty intersection for the supports) or the final column dominates the others. Using real-algebraic methods, we identify sufficient and almost necessary conditions for majorization in large samples or when using catalytic states under these support conditions. These conditions are given in terms of multivariate divergences that generalize the R\'enyi divergences. We notice that varying support conditions dramatically affect the relevant set of divergences. Our results find an application in the theory of catalytic state transformation in quantum thermodynamics.</p></details> | 51 pages, 5 figures |

However, it is difficult to automatically derive properties from natural language requirements. SpecVerify addresses this challenge by integrating large language models (LLMs) with formal verification tools, providing a more flexible mechanism for expressing requirements. This framework combines Claude 3.5 Sonnet with the ESBMC verifier to form an automated workflow. Evaluated on nine cyber-physical systems from Lockheed Martin, SpecVerify achieves 46.5% verification accuracy, comparable to NASA's CoCoSim, but with lower false positives. Our framework formulates assertions that extend beyond the expressive power of LTL and identifies falsifiable cases that are missed by more traditional methods. Counterexample analysis reveals CoCoSim's limitations stemming from model connection errors and numerical approximation issues. While SpecVerify advances verification automation, our comparative study of Claude, ChatGPT, and Llama shows that high-quality requirements documentation and human monitoring remain critical, as models occasionally misinterpret specifications. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can significantly reduce the barriers to formal verification, while highlighting the continued importance of human-machine collaboration in achieving optimal results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in 2025 IEEE 33rd International Requirements Engineering Conference (RE)</p></details> |

We propose a fully LLM-based solution that predicts the incident impact using a combination of traffic features and LLM-extracted incident features. A key ingredient of this solution is an effective method of selecting examples for the LLM's in-context learning. We evaluate the performance of three advanced LLMs and two state-of-the-art machine learning models on a real traffic incident dataset. The results show that the best-performing LLM matches the accuracy of the most accurate machine learning model, despite the former not having been trained on this prediction task.

This paper investigates the potential of LLMs in advancing Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS), analyzing current challenges, methodologies, and future opportunities. It begins by establishing a foundational understanding of NIDS and LLMs, exploring the enabling technologies that bridge the gap between intelligent and cognitive systems in AI-driven NIDS. While Intelligent NIDS leverage machine learning and deep learning to detect threats based on learned patterns, they often lack contextual awareness and explainability. In contrast, Cognitive NIDS integrate LLMs to process both structured and unstructured security data, enabling deeper contextual reasoning, explainable decision-making, and automated response for intrusion behaviors. Practical implementations are then detailed, highlighting LLMs as processors, detectors, and explainers within a comprehensive AI-driven NIDS pipeline. Furthermore, the concept of an LLM-centered Controller is proposed, emphasizing its potential to coordinate intrusion detection workflows, optimizing tool collaboration and system performance. Finally, this paper identifies critical challenges and opportunities, aiming to foster innovation in developing reliable, adaptive, and explainable NIDS. By presenting the transformative potential of LLMs, this paper seeks to inspire advancement in next-generation network security systems.</p></details> |  |

Although existing AIGI detection techniques are generally effective, they face two issues: 1) a lack of human-verifiable explanations, and 2) a lack of generalization in the latest generation technology. To address these issues, we introduce a large-scale and comprehensive dataset, Holmes-Set, which includes the Holmes-SFTSet, an instruction-tuning dataset with explanations on whether images are AI-generated, and the Holmes-DPOSet, a human-aligned preference dataset. Our work introduces an efficient data annotation method called the Multi-Expert Jury, enhancing data generation through structured MLLM explanations and quality control via cross-model evaluation, expert defect filtering, and human preference modification. In addition, we propose Holmes Pipeline, a meticulously designed three-stage training framework comprising visual expert pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and direct preference optimization. Holmes Pipeline adapts multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for AIGI detection while generating human-verifiable and human-aligned explanations, ultimately yielding our model AIGI-Holmes. During the inference stage, we introduce a collaborative decoding strategy that integrates the model perception of the visual expert with the semantic reasoning of MLLMs, further enhancing the generalization capabilities.

In this paper, we evaluate the capability of existing general LLMs for Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS) code generation for CPUs. We use two LLMs provided by OpenAI: GPT-4.1, a Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model, and o4-mini, one of the o-series of Reasoning models. Both have been released in April 2025. For the routines from level-1 to 3 BLAS, we tried to generate (1) C code without optimization from routine name only, (2) C code with basic performance optimizations (thread parallelization, SIMD vectorization, and cache blocking) from routine name only, and (3) C code with basic performance optimizations based on Fortran reference code. As a result, we found that correct code can be generated in many cases even when only routine name are given. We also confirmed that thread parallelization with OpenMP, SIMD vectorization, and cache blocking can be implemented to some extent, and that the code is faster than the reference code.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 tables |

In this study, we seek to pinpoint the sources of this fragility by identifying parameters and input dimensions (pixels or token embeddings) that are susceptible to such perturbations. To this end, we propose a stability measure called \textbf{FI}, \textbf{F}irst order local \textbf{I}nfluence, which is rooted in information geometry and quantifies the sensitivity of individual parameter and input dimensions. Our extensive analysis across LLMs and VLMs (from 1.5B to 13B parameters) reveals that: (I) A small subset of parameters or input dimensions with high FI values disproportionately contribute to model brittleness. (II) Mitigating the influence of these vulnerable parameters during model merging leads to improved performance.</p></details> |  |

While recent efforts have implemented various personalization methods, a unified theoretical framework that can systematically understand the drivers of effective personalization is still lacking. In this work, we integrate the well-established cognitive dual-memory model into LLM personalization, by mirroring episodic memory to historical user engagements and semantic memory to long-term, evolving user beliefs. Specifically, we systematically investigate memory instantiations and introduce a unified framework, PRIME, using episodic and semantic memory mechanisms. We further augment PRIME with a novel personalized thinking capability inspired by the slow thinking strategy. Moreover, recognizing the absence of suitable benchmarks, we introduce a dataset using Change My View (CMV) from Reddit, specifically designed to evaluate long-context personalization. Extensive experiments validate PRIME's effectiveness across both long- and short-context scenarios. Further analysis confirms that PRIME effectively captures dynamic personalization beyond mere popularity biases.</p></details> |  |

While the optimization of parallel data processing graphs has been extensively researched in database systems, the vast search space makes it challenging to apply traditional database query optimization methods and algorithms. This paper introduces CFP, an optimization system for intra-operator parallelism that significantly reduces the complexity of searching for parallelism plans by leveraging two structural patterns found in large models. First, we identify parallel-preserving subgraphs, which ensure that the optimal global plan assigns the same parallel strategy to all operators within the subgraph. This approach allows us to avoid enumerating all possible combinations of parallel strategies for these operators. Second, we recognize repetitive subgraph patterns within the large computational graph, enabling us to profile a moderate number of representative subgraphs and accurately estimate the cost of parallelism plans with low overhead. With the significantly reduced search space, we can employ dynamic programming to search for the optimized parallelism plan. In our experiments, we demonstrate that CFP achieves significant speedups compared to the state-of-the-art framework for large models like GPT and LLAMA.</p></details> |  |

Existing defenses that aim to preserve context privacy during inference either lack formal guarantees or suffer from a poor utility/privacy trade-off. We propose DP-Fusion, a token-level Differentially Private Inference (DPI) mechanism that provably bounds how much an LLM's outputs reveal about sensitive tokens in its context. We demonstrate DPI through the task of document privatization, where the goal is to paraphrase documents so that sensitive content (e.g., Personally Identifiable Information, PII) cannot be reliably inferred, while still preserving the overall utility of the text. This is controlled by a parameter $\epsilon$: $\epsilon=0$ hides PII entirely, while higher values trade off privacy for improved paraphrase quality. DP-Fusion works as follows: (i) partition sensitive tokens into disjoint privacy groups, (ii) run the LLM once per group, and (iii) blend the output distributions so that the final output remains within a fixed statistical distance of the baseline distribution produced when no privacy group is revealed. This approach allows fine-grained control over the privacy/utility trade-off but requires multiple LLM forward passes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our c...</summary><p>Our code and data are publicly available here: https://github.com/MBZUAI-Trustworthy-ML/DP-Fusion-DPI</p></details> |

We present a theoretical analysis comparing autoregressive and masked diffusion LLMs, revealing that the intrinsic bidirectional attention mechanism of diffusion LLMs (dLLMs) enables superior context modeling and generation controllability. However, existing dLLM applications face significant challenges in controllable generation: the native multi-step denoising process exhibits high sensitivity to sequence length, elevated hallucination rates, and prohibitive inference costs without specialized optimizations. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{S}elf-adaptive \textbf{S}chema \textbf{S}caffolding ($S^3$), a novel framework that enables dLLMs to generate structured outputs (e.g., JSON) while maintaining semantic fidelity and accelerating inference. Our approach injects the target schema structure into the output context, reducing unnecessary computation while improving controllability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that $S^3$ achieves substantial improvements: 65\% increase in structural adherence, 48\% enhancement in content fidelity, and 17\% reduction in hallucination rates compared to baseline. These results establish both theoretical foundations and practical pathways for deploying diffusion models in controllable text generation tasks. Code and data will be publicly released.</p></details> |  |
| **[A validity-guided workflow for robust large language model research in psychology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04491v1)** | 2025-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly being integrated into psychological research as research tools, evaluation targets, human simulators, and cognitive models. However, recent evidence reveals severe measurement unreliability: Personality assessments collapse under factor analysis, moral preferences reverse with punctuation changes, and theory-of-mind accuracy varies widely with trivial rephrasing. These "measurement phantoms"--statistical artifacts masquerading as psychological phenomena--threaten the validity of a growing body of research. Guided by the dual-validity framework that integrates psychometrics with causal inference, we present a six-stage workflow that scales validity requirements to research ambition--using LLMs to code text requires basic reliability and accuracy, while claims about psychological properties demand comprehensive construct validation. Researchers must (1) explicitly define their research goal and corresponding validity requirements, (2) develop and validate computational instruments through psychometric testing, (3) design experiments that control for computational confounds, (4) execute protocols with transparency, (5) analyze data using methods appropriate for non-independent observations, and (6) report findings within demonstrated boundaries and use results to refine theory. We illustrate the workflow through an example of model evaluation--"LLM selfhood"--showing how systematic validation can distinguish genuine computational phenomena from measurement artifacts. By establishing validated computational instruments and transparent practices, this workflow provides a path toward building a robust empirical foundation for AI psychology research.</p></details> |  |

This paper investigates model inversion attacks on the Llama 3.2 model, a multilingual LLM developed by Meta. By querying the model with carefully crafted prompts, we demonstrate the extraction of personally identifiable information (PII) such as passwords, email addresses, and account numbers. Our findings highlight the vulnerability of even smaller LLMs to privacy attacks and underscore the need for robust defenses. We discuss potential mitigation strategies, including differential privacy and data sanitization, and call for further research into privacy-preserving machine learning techniques.</p></details> |  |

We identify key LLMs in use, including GPT-4, Gemini, and PaLM, and map their integration across the design lifecycle, from ideation to evaluation. Common practices include prompt engineering, human-in-the-loop workflows, and multimodal input. While LLMs are reshaping design processes, challenges such as hallucination, prompt instability, and limited explainability persist. Our findings highlight LLMs as emerging collaborators in design, and we propose directions for the ethical, inclusive, and effective integration of these technologies.</p></details> |  |

One promising solution, called offsite-tuning (OT), is proposed to address these challenges, where a weaker emulator is compressed from the original model and further fine-tuned with adapter to enhance privacy. However, the existing OT-based methods require high computational costs and lack theoretical analysis. This paper introduces a novel OT approach based on gradient-preserving compression, named GradOT. By analyzing the OT problem through the lens of optimization, we propose a method that selectively applies compression techniques such as rank compression and channel pruning, preserving the gradients of fine-tuned adapters while ensuring privacy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach surpasses existing OT methods, both in terms of privacy protection and model performance. Our method provides a theoretical foundation for OT and offers a practical, training-free solution for offsite-tuning of large-scale LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACL 2025 main</p></details> |

However, achieving compliance with these new limits remains a key challenge for urban planners. This study investigates drivers' compliance with the 30 km/h speed limit in Milan and examines how street characteristics influence driving behavior. Our findings suggest that the mere introduction of lower speed limits is not sufficient to reduce driving speeds effectively, highlighting the need to understand how street design can improve speed limit adherence. To comprehend this relationship, we apply computer vision-based semantic segmentation models to Google Street View images. A large-scale analysis reveals that narrower streets and densely built environments are associated with lower speeds, whereas roads with greater visibility and larger sky views encourage faster driving. To evaluate the influence of the local context on speeding behaviour, we apply the developed methodological framework to two additional cities: Amsterdam, which, similar to Milan, is a historic European city not originally developed for cars, and Dubai, which instead has developed in recent decades with a more car-centric design. The results of the analyses largely confirm the findings obtained in Milan, which demonstrates the broad applicability of the road design guidelines for driver speed compliance identified in this paper. Finally, we develop a machine learning model to predict driving speeds based on street characteristics. We showcase the model's predictive power by estimating the compliance with speed limits in Milan if the city were to adopt a 30 km/h speed limit city-wide. The tool provides actionable insights for urban planners, supporting the design of interventions to improve speed limit compliance.</p></details> |  |

In artificial intelligence, as systems increasingly operate in open, uncertain, and multimodal environments, reasoning becomes essential for enabling robust and adaptive behavior. Large Multimodal Reasoning Models (LMRMs) have emerged as a promising paradigm, integrating modalities such as text, images, audio, and video to support complex reasoning capabilities and aiming to achieve comprehensive perception, precise understanding, and deep reasoning. As research advances, multimodal reasoning has rapidly evolved from modular, perception-driven pipelines to unified, language-centric frameworks that offer more coherent cross-modal understanding. While instruction tuning and reinforcement learning have improved model reasoning, significant challenges remain in omni-modal generalization, reasoning depth, and agentic behavior. To address these issues, we present a comprehensive and structured survey of multimodal reasoning research, organized around a four-stage developmental roadmap that reflects the field's shifting design philosophies and emerging capabilities. First, we review early efforts based on task-specific modules, where reasoning was implicitly embedded across stages of representation, alignment, and fusion. Next, we examine recent approaches that unify reasoning into multimodal LLMs, with advances such as Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) and multimodal reinforcement learning enabling richer and more structured reasoning chains. Finally, drawing on empirical insights from challenging benchmarks and experimental cases of OpenAI O3 and O4-mini, we discuss the conceptual direction of native large multimodal reasoning models (N-LMRMs), which aim to support scalable, agentic, and adaptive reasoning and planning in complex, real-world environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>v2, 9...</summary><p>v2, 91 Pages, 10 figures; Project: https://github.com/HITsz-TMG/Awesome-Large-Multimodal-Reasoning-Models</p></details> |

While decoding-time strategies provide a promising efficient solution without training, existing methods typically treat token-level and layer-level signals in isolation, overlooking the joint dynamics between them. In this work, we introduce a token-aware, layer-localized contrastive decoding method that aligns specific token types with their most influential transformer layers to improve factual generation. Through empirical attention analysis, we identify two key patterns: punctuation tokens receive dominant attention in early layers, while conceptual tokens govern semantic reasoning in intermediate layers. By selectively suppressing attention to these token types at their respective depths, we achieve the induction of controlled factual degradation and derive contrastive signals to guide the final factual decoding. Our method requires no additional training or model modification, and experiments demonstrate that our method consistently improves factuality across multiple LLMs and various benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Especially, Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained attention as a powerful technology, yet their accuracy and feasibility in capturing different opinions and perspectives on health issues are largely unexplored. Thus, this research examines how accurate the three prominent LLMs (GPT, Gemini, and LLAMA) are in detecting risk-promoting versus health-supporting sentiments across two critical public health topics: Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination and heated tobacco products (HTPs). Drawing on data from Facebook and Twitter, we curated multiple sets of messages supporting or opposing recommended health behaviors, supplemented with human annotations as the gold standard for sentiment classification. The findings indicate that all three LLMs generally demonstrate substantial accuracy in classifying risk-promoting and health-supporting sentiments, although notable discrepancies emerge by platform, health issue, and model type. Specifically, models often show higher accuracy for risk-promoting sentiment on Facebook, whereas health-supporting messages on Twitter are more accurately detected. An additional analysis also shows the challenges LLMs face in reliably detecting neutral messages. These results highlight the importance of carefully selecting and validating language models for public health analyses, particularly given potential biases in training data that may lead LLMs to overestimate or underestimate the prevalence of certain perspectives.</p></details> | <details><summary>Forth...</summary><p>Forthcoming in Social Science & Medicine</p></details> |

Consequently, numerous data selection methods have been proposed to identify subsets of data that can effectively and efficiently enhance model performance. However, most of these methods focus on general data selection and tend to overlook the specific nuances of domain-related data. In this paper, we introduce MASS, a \textbf{MA}thematical data \textbf{S}election framework using the \textbf{S}kill graph for pretraining LLMs in the mathematical reasoning domain. By taking into account the unique characteristics of mathematics and reasoning, we construct a skill graph that captures the mathematical skills and their interrelations from a reference dataset. This skill graph guides us in assigning quality scores to the target dataset, enabling us to select the top-ranked subset which is further used to pretrain LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of MASS across different model sizes (1B and 7B) and pretraining datasets (web data and synthetic data). Specifically, in terms of efficiency, models trained on subsets selected by MASS can achieve similar performance to models trained on the original datasets, with a significant reduction in the number of trained tokens - ranging from 50\% to 70\% fewer tokens. In terms of effectiveness, when trained on the same amount of tokens, models trained on the data selected by MASS outperform those trained on the original datasets by 3.3\% to 5.9\%. These results underscore the potential of MASS to improve both the efficiency and effectiveness of pretraining LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Current approaches predominantly utilize a three-stage pipeline encompassing dual-modal encoding, cross-modal interaction, and pixel decoding. These methods demonstrate significant limitations in managing complex semantic relationships and achieving precise cross-modal alignment, largely due to their coupled processing mechanism that conflates target localization with boundary delineation. This architectural coupling amplifies error propagation under semantic ambiguity while restricting model generalizability and interpretability. To address these issues, we propose RSRefSeg 2, a decoupling paradigm that reformulates the conventional workflow into a collaborative dual-stage framework: coarse localization followed by fine segmentation. RSRefSeg 2 integrates CLIP's cross-modal alignment strength with SAM's segmentation generalizability through strategic foundation model collaboration. Specifically, CLIP is employed as the dual-modal encoder to activate target features within its pre-aligned semantic space and generate localization prompts. To mitigate CLIP's misactivation challenges in multi-entity scenarios described by referring texts, a cascaded second-order prompter is devised, which enhances precision through implicit reasoning via decomposition of text embeddings into complementary semantic subspaces. These optimized semantic prompts subsequently direct the SAM to generate pixel-level refined masks, thereby completing the semantic transmission pipeline. Extensive experiments (RefSegRS, RRSIS-D, and RISBench) demonstrate that RSRefSeg 2 surpasses contemporary methods in segmentation accuracy (+~3% gIoU) and complex semantic interpretation. Code is available at: https://github.com/KyanChen/RSRefSeg2.</p></details> |  |

Achieving this goal requires a deep understanding of the frontiers of human knowledge. As such, Humanity's Last Exam (HLE) provides an exceptionally challenging touchstone for evaluating scientific AI agents. In this work, we aim to construct the foundational architecture for general-purpose agents and validate the capabilities through leading performance on HLE. To achieve this, we introduce X-Master, a tool-augmented reasoning agent designed to emulate human researchers by interacting flexibly with external tools during its reasoning process. This agent, guided by the conceptualization of code as an interaction language, can flexibly leverage built-in Python libraries and our customized tools to augment the reasoning. We further scale its capabilities through X-Masters, a scattered-and-stacked agentic workflow that systematically enhances breadth and depth of reasoning. Our open-source solution, X-Masters, sets a new state-of-the-art record on HLE with a score of 32.1%, surpassing OpenAI's and Google's Deep Research (26.6% and 26.9%) and becoming the first to exceed the 30% threshold. This work allows us to gain a deeper understanding of complex task-solving and accumulates valuable experience that can inform future advancements, guiding subsequent model training.</p></details> | 15 pages, 10 figures |

This study introduces a self-supervised multimodal framework that combines 3D brain imaging, clinical data, and image-derived features to improve stroke risk prediction prior to onset. By leveraging large unannotated clinical datasets, the framework captures complementary and synergistic information across image and tabular data modalities. Our approach is based on a contrastive learning framework that couples contrastive language-image pretraining with an image-tabular matching module, to better align multimodal data representations in a shared latent space. The model is trained on the UK Biobank, which includes structural brain MRI and clinical data. We benchmark its performance against state-of-the-art unimodal and multimodal methods using tabular, image, and image-tabular combinations under diverse frozen and trainable model settings. The proposed model outperformed self-supervised tabular (image) methods by 2.6% (2.6%) in ROC-AUC and by 3.3% (5.6%) in balanced accuracy. Additionally, it showed a 7.6% increase in balanced accuracy compared to the best multimodal supervised model. Through interpretable tools, our approach demonstrated better integration of tabular and image data, providing richer and more aligned embeddings. Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping heatmaps further revealed activated brain regions commonly associated in the literature with brain aging, stroke risk, and clinical outcomes. This robust self-supervised multimodal framework surpasses state-of-the-art methods for stroke risk prediction and offers a strong foundation for future studies integrating diverse data modalities to advance clinical predictive modelling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as oral paper at AIM-FM workshop, Neurips 2024</p></details> |
| **[A Wireless Foundation Model for Multi-Task Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05938v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the growing complexity and dynamics of the mobile communication networks, accurately predicting key system parameters, such as channel state information (CSI), user location, and network traffic, has become essential for a wide range of physical (PHY)-layer and medium access control (MAC)-layer tasks. Although traditional deep learning (DL)-based methods have been widely applied to such prediction tasks, they often struggle to generalize across different scenarios and tasks. In response, we propose a unified foundation model for multi-task prediction in wireless networks that supports diverse prediction intervals. The proposed model enforces univariate decomposition to unify heterogeneous tasks, encodes granularity for interval awareness, and uses a causal Transformer backbone for accurate predictions. Additionally, we introduce a patch masking strategy during training to support arbitrary input lengths. After trained on large-scale datasets, the proposed foundation model demonstrates strong generalization to unseen scenarios and achieves zero-shot performance on new tasks that surpass traditional full-shot baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Video Event Reasoning and Prediction by Fusing World Knowledge from LLMs with Vision Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05822v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current video understanding models excel at recognizing "what" is happening but fall short in high-level cognitive tasks like causal reasoning and future prediction, a limitation rooted in their lack of commonsense world knowledge. To bridge this cognitive gap, we propose a novel framework that synergistically fuses a powerful Vision Foundation Model (VFM) for deep visual perception with a Large Language Model (LLM) serving as a knowledge-driven reasoning core. Our key technical innovation is a sophisticated fusion module, inspired by the Q-Former architecture, which distills complex spatiotemporal and object-centric visual features into a concise, language-aligned representation. This enables the LLM to effectively ground its inferential processes in direct visual evidence. The model is trained via a two-stage strategy, beginning with large-scale alignment pre-training on video-text data, followed by targeted instruction fine-tuning on a curated dataset designed to elicit advanced reasoning and prediction skills. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple challenging benchmarks. Notably, it exhibits remarkable zero-shot generalization to unseen reasoning tasks, and our in-depth ablation studies validate the critical contribution of each architectural component. This work pushes the boundary of machine perception from simple recognition towards genuine cognitive understanding, paving the way for more intelligent and capable AI systems in robotics, human-computer interaction, and beyond.</p></details> | 22 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Improving Robustness of Foundation Models in Domain Adaptation with Soup-Adapters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05807v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we tackle two fundamental problems in few-shot domain adaptation of foundation models. First, hyperparameter tuning is often impractical due to the lack of large validation datasets. Second, model robustness under distribution shifts where test time data deviates slightly from training distributions, remains a concern. We show that by training multiple independent adapters and averaging their outputs, the new model has a higher performance and is more robust to distribution shifts compared to any individual adapter. This improvement holds even when the adapters are trained with diverse hyperparameters sampled from a wide range, resulting in varied individual performance. Consequently, our method addresses both of the problems described above. The ensemble is also significantly less sensitive to the residual ratio, a critical hyperparameter of CLIP-Adapter. Since the ensemble can be reparameterized to a single adapter again using a principled concatenation of the parameters, we refer to our method as Soup-Adapter. This is also the first study to explore CLIP adapter-style techniques for DINOv2 and to directly compare them with CLIP in this setting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Geological Everything Model 3D: A Promptable Foundation Model for Unified and Zero-Shot Subsurface Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00419v2)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding Earth's subsurface is critical for energy transition, natural hazard mitigation, and planetary science. Yet subsurface analysis remains fragmented, with separate models required for structural interpretation, stratigraphic analysis, geobody segmentation, and property modeling-each tightly coupled to specific data distributions and task formulations. We introduce the Geological Everything Model 3D (GEM), a unified generative architecture that reformulates all these tasks as prompt-conditioned inference along latent structural frameworks derived from subsurface imaging. This formulation moves beyond task-specific models by enabling a shared inference mechanism, where GEM propagates human-provided prompts-such as well logs, masks, or structural sketches-along inferred structural frameworks to produce geologically coherent outputs. Through this mechanism, GEM achieves zero-shot generalization across tasks with heterogeneous prompt types, without retraining for new tasks or data sources. This capability emerges from a two-stage training process that combines self-supervised representation learning on large-scale field seismic data with adversarial fine-tuning using mixed prompts and labels across diverse subsurface tasks. GEM demonstrates broad applicability across surveys and tasks, including Martian radar stratigraphy analysis, structural interpretation in subduction zones, full seismic stratigraphic interpretation, geobody segmentation, and property modeling.

| **[Theoretical Foundations of Waste Factor and Waste Figure with Applications to Fixed Wireless Access and Relay Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08414v2)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The exponential rise in energy consumption across wireless communication systems, particularly in anticipation of next-generation wireless systems, necessitates rigorous frameworks for evaluating and optimizing energy efficiency. This paper revisits and expands the concept of the Waste Factor (W), or Waste Figure (WF) in decibel scale, as a unifying metric that captures both utilized and wasted power in cascaded communication systems. Building upon its foundation in system-level power modeling, we integrate the Waste Factor into a refined formulation of the Consumption Factor (CF), the ratio of data rate to total consumed power, linking it directly to Shannon's theoretical limit on energy per bit. This analysis introduces additive energy waste into the classical energy-per-bit derivation through the Waste Factor term. We derive closed-form expressions for energy-per-bit expenditure in both direct and relay-assisted links and develop a decision rule to determine which communication path is more energy efficient under given conditions. While not modeled explicitly, Reflective Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) can be interpreted as a special case of relay-based architectures within this unified formulation, suggesting broader applicability of the Waste Factor framework to emerging 6G use cases. The framework is then extended to a Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) scenario, where uplink and downlink asymmetries, traffic directionality, and component inefficiencies are jointly considered to analyze energy-optimal deployment strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Nature npj Wireless Technology, July 1st, 2025</p></details> |

Typically relying on weeks of training on large databases, the creation of FMs is a resource-intensive process in many ways. In this paper, we introduce the extension of our supervised foundation model, Tissue Concepts, to whole slide images, called Tissue Concepts v2 (TCv2), a supervised foundation model for whole slide images to address the issue above. TCv2 uses supervised, end-to-end multitask learning on slide-level labels. Training TCv2 uses a fraction of the training resources compared to self-supervised training. The presented model shows superior performance compared to SSL-trained models in cancer subtyping benchmarks and is fully trained on freely available data. Furthermore, a shared trained attention module provides an additional layer of explainability across different tasks.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in foundation models have demonstrated remarkable performance in remote sensing and climate sciences, and therefore offer new opportunities for agricultural monitoring. However, their application in challenges related to agriculture-such as crop type mapping, crop phenology estimation, and crop yield estimation-remains under-explored. In this work, we quantitatively evaluate existing foundational models to assess their effectivity for a representative set of agricultural tasks. From an agricultural domain perspective, we describe a requirements framework for an ideal agricultural foundation model (CropFM). We then survey and compare existing general-purpose foundational models in this framework and empirically evaluate two exemplary of them in three representative agriculture specific tasks. Finally, we highlight the need for a dedicated foundational model tailored specifically to agriculture.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal Foundation Models: Disentangling Physics from Instrument Properties](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05333v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models for structured time series data must contend with a fundamental challenge: observations often conflate the true underlying physical phenomena with systematic distortions introduced by measurement instruments. This entanglement limits model generalization, especially in heterogeneous or multi-instrument settings. We present a causally-motivated foundation model that explicitly disentangles physical and instrumental factors using a dual-encoder architecture trained with structured contrastive learning. Leveraging naturally occurring observational triplets (i.e., where the same target is measured under varying conditions, and distinct targets are measured under shared conditions) our model learns separate latent representations for the underlying physical signal and instrument effects. Evaluated on simulated astronomical time series designed to resemble the complexity of variable stars observed by missions like NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), our method significantly outperforms traditional single-latent space foundation models on downstream prediction tasks, particularly in low-data regimes. These results demonstrate that our model supports key capabilities of foundation models, including few-shot generalization and efficient adaptation, and highlight the importance of encoding causal structure into representation learning for structured data.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures.

| **[Large Language Models for Network Intrusion Detection Systems: Foundations, Implementations, and Future Directions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04752v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized various fields with their exceptional capabilities in understanding, processing, and generating human-like text. This paper investigates the potential of LLMs in advancing Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS), analyzing current challenges, methodologies, and future opportunities. It begins by establishing a foundational understanding of NIDS and LLMs, exploring the enabling technologies that bridge the gap between intelligent and cognitive systems in AI-driven NIDS. While Intelligent NIDS leverage machine learning and deep learning to detect threats based on learned patterns, they often lack contextual awareness and explainability. In contrast, Cognitive NIDS integrate LLMs to process both structured and unstructured security data, enabling deeper contextual reasoning, explainable decision-making, and automated response for intrusion behaviors. Practical implementations are then detailed, highlighting LLMs as processors, detectors, and explainers within a comprehensive AI-driven NIDS pipeline. Furthermore, the concept of an LLM-centered Controller is proposed, emphasizing its potential to coordinate intrusion detection workflows, optimizing tool collaboration and system performance. Finally, this paper identifies critical challenges and opportunities, aiming to foster innovation in developing reliable, adaptive, and explainable NIDS. By presenting the transformative potential of LLMs, this paper seeks to inspire advancement in next-generation network security systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Geometric-Guided Few-Shot Dental Landmark Detection with Human-Centric Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04710v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate detection of anatomic landmarks is essential for assessing alveolar bone and root conditions, thereby optimizing clinical outcomes in orthodontics, periodontics, and implant dentistry. Manual annotation of landmarks on cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) by dentists is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and subject to inter-observer variability. Deep learning-based automated methods present a promising approach to streamline this process efficiently. However, the scarcity of training data and the high cost of expert annotations hinder the adoption of conventional deep learning techniques. To overcome these challenges, we introduce GeoSapiens, a novel few-shot learning framework designed for robust dental landmark detection using limited annotated CBCT of anterior teeth. Our GeoSapiens framework comprises two key components: (1) a robust baseline adapted from Sapiens, a foundational model that has achieved state-of-the-art performance in human-centric vision tasks, and (2) a novel geometric loss function that improves the model's capacity to capture critical geometric relationships among anatomical structures. Experiments conducted on our collected dataset of anterior teeth landmarks revealed that GeoSapiens surpassed existing landmark detection methods, outperforming the leading approach by an 8.18% higher success detection rate at a strict 0.5 mm threshold-a standard widely recognized in dental diagnostics. Code is available at: https://github.com/xmed-lab/GeoSapiens.</p></details> | MICCAI 2025 |

The choice of this particular area of proof-theoretic study is based on a particular ground that is, to formulate a robust and foundational classical singlesuccedent sequent calculus that includes a number of novel rules with the ultimate aim of deriving the singlesuccedent sequent {\Gamma} sequent arrow C. To this end, we argue that among all standard sequent calculi (at least to the best of our knowledge) there is no classical singlesuccedent sequent calculus that can be considered the rightful successor to Gerhard Gentzen's (1935) original LK system. However, we also contend that while several classical singlesuccedent sequent calculi exist such as Sara Negri's and Jan von Plato's (2001 & 2011) G3ip+Gem-at and G0ip+Gem0-at calculi, none of these proof systems possess the classical proof-theoretic potential to meet the formal expectations of a dedicated classical proof theorist. Conversely, we shall demonstrate that our forthcoming system, namely G-Calculus through its classical division i.e. Gc has been entirely designed to meet these expectations. Prior to commencing our enquiry, a supplementary note must be made and that is in this work when discussing various sequent calculi, for proof-theoretic purposes, we are primarily concerned with their propositional components rather than their predicate divisions except in G-Calculus where we examine both aspects.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is currently in draft form; therefore, constructive comments sent via email are welcome</p></details> |
| **[PrivTuner with Homomorphic Encryption and LoRA: A P3EFT Scheme for Privacy-Preserving Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning of AI Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00433v2)** | 2025-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI foundation models have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities across a wide range of tasks. Fine-tuning (FT) is a method of customizing a pre-trained AI foundation model by further training it on a smaller, targeted dataset. In this paper, we initiate the study of the Privacy-Preserving Parameter-Efficient FT (P3EFT) framework, which can be viewed as the intersection of Parameter-Efficient FT (PEFT) and Privacy-Preserving FT (PPFT). PEFT modifies only a small subset of the model's parameters to achieve FT (i.e., adapting a pre-trained model to a specific dataset), while PPFT uses privacy-preserving technologies to protect the confidentiality of the model during the FT process. There have been many studies on PEFT or PPFT but very few on their fusion, which motivates our work on P3EFT to achieve both parameter efficiency and model privacy. To exemplify our P3EFT, we present the PrivTuner scheme, which incorporates Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) enabled privacy protection into LoRA (short for ``Low-Rank Adapter''). Intuitively speaking, PrivTuner allows the model owner and the external data owners to collaboratively implement PEFT with encrypted data. After describing PrivTuner in detail, we further investigate its energy consumption and privacy protection. Then, we consider a PrivTuner system over wireless communications and formulate a joint optimization problem to adaptively minimize energy while maximizing privacy protection, with the optimization variables including FDMA bandwidth allocation, wireless transmission power, computational resource allocation, and privacy protection. A resource allocation algorithm is devised to solve the problem. Experiments demonstrate that our algorithm can significantly reduce energy consumption while adapting to different privacy requirements.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pedestrian Intention Prediction via Vision-Language Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04141v1)** | 2025-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prediction of pedestrian crossing intention is a critical function in autonomous vehicles. Conventional vision-based methods of crossing intention prediction often struggle with generalizability, context understanding, and causal reasoning. This study explores the potential of vision-language foundation models (VLFMs) for predicting pedestrian crossing intentions by integrating multimodal data through hierarchical prompt templates. The methodology incorporates contextual information, including visual frames, physical cues observations, and ego-vehicle dynamics, into systematically refined prompts to guide VLFMs effectively in intention prediction. Experiments were conducted on three common datasets-JAAD, PIE, and FU-PIP. Results demonstrate that incorporating vehicle speed, its variations over time, and time-conscious prompts significantly enhances the prediction accuracy up to 19.8%. Additionally, optimised prompts generated via an automatic prompt engineering framework yielded 12.5% further accuracy gains. These findings highlight the superior performance of VLFMs compared to conventional vision-based models, offering enhanced generalisation and contextual understanding for autonomous driving applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Looking Locally: Object-Centric Vision Transformers as Foundation Models for Efficient Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02763v2)** | 2025-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current state-of-the-art segmentation models encode entire images before focusing on specific objects. As a result, they waste computational resources - particularly when small objects are to be segmented in high-resolution scenes. We introduce FLIP (Fovea-Like Input Patching), a parameter-efficient vision model that realizes object segmentation through biologically-inspired top-down attention. FLIP selectively samples multi-resolution patches centered on objects of interest from the input. As a result, it allocates high-resolution processing to object centers while maintaining coarser peripheral context. This off-grid, scale-invariant design enables FLIP to outperform META's Segment Anything models (SAM) by large margins: With more than 1000x fewer parameters, FLIP-Tiny (0.51M parameters) reaches a mean IoU of 78.24% while SAM-H reaches 75.41% IoU (641.1M parameters). FLIP-Large even achieves 80.33% mean IoU (96.6M parameters), still running about 6$\times$ faster than SAM-H. We evaluate on six benchmarks in total. In five established benchmarks (Hypersim, KITTI-360, OpenImages, COCO, LVIS) FLIP consistently outperforms SAM and various variants of it. In our novel ObjaScale dataset, which stress-tests scale invariance with objects ranging from 0.0001% up-to 25% of the image area, we show that FLIP segments even very small objects accurately, where existing models fail severely. FLIP opens new possibilities for real-time, object-centric vision applications and offers much higher energy efficiency. We believe that FLIP can act as a powerful foundation model, as it is very well-suited to track objects over time, for example, when being integrated into slot-based scene segmentation architectures.</p></details> |  |

We show that this performance can be significantly boosted by a targeted continued pre-training phase. Specifically, we demonstrate that leveraging a small, curated collection of large, real-world datasets for continued pre-training yields superior downstream predictive accuracy compared to using broader, potentially noisier corpora like CommonCrawl or GitTables. Our resulting model, Real-TabPFN, achieves substantial performance gains on 29 datasets from the OpenML AutoML Benchmark.</p></details> |  |

The proposed model utilizes not only rich acoustic features extracted by a self-supervised-learning (SSL)-based model or a Whisper encoder, but also linguistic features obtained from phoneme-input pretrained linguistic foundation models such as PnG BERT and PL-BERT. The concatenation of acoustic and linguistic features is used to predict phoneme-level prosodic labels. In the experimental evaluation on Japanese prosodic labels, including pitch accents and phrase break indices, it was observed that the combination of both speech and linguistic foundation models enhanced the prediction accuracy compared to using either a speech or linguistic input alone. Specifically, we achieved 89.8% prediction accuracy in accent labels, 93.2% in high-low pitch accents, and 94.3% in break indices.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Speech Synthesis Workshop 2025 (SSW13)</p></details> |
| **[JanusDNA: A Powerful Bi-directional Hybrid DNA Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17257v3)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing and are increasingly applied to other sequential data types, including genetic sequences. However, adapting LLMs to genomics presents significant challenges. Capturing complex genomic interactions requires modeling long-range dependencies within DNA sequences, where interactions often span over 10,000 base pairs, even within a single gene, posing substantial computational burdens under conventional model architectures and training paradigms. Moreover, standard LLM training approaches are suboptimal for DNA: autoregressive training, while efficient, supports only unidirectional understanding. However, DNA is inherently bidirectional, e.g., bidirectional promoters regulate transcription in both directions and account for nearly 11% of human gene expression. Masked language models (MLMs) allow bidirectional understanding but are inefficient, as only masked tokens contribute to the loss per step. To address these limitations, we introduce JanusDNA, the first bidirectional DNA foundation model built upon a novel pretraining paradigm that combines the optimization efficiency of autoregressive modeling with the bidirectional comprehension of masked modeling. JanusDNA adopts a hybrid Mamba, Attention and Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture, combining long-range modeling of Attention with efficient sequential learning of Mamba. MoE layers further scale model capacity via sparse activation while keeping computational cost low. Notably, JanusDNA processes up to 1 million base pairs at single nucleotide resolution on a single 80GB GPU. Extensive experiments and ablations show JanusDNA achieves new SOTA results on three genomic representation benchmarks, outperforming models with 250x more activated parameters.

| **[Foundation versus Domain-specific Models: Performance Comparison, Fusion, and Explainability in Face Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03541v1)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we address the following question: How do generic foundation models (e.g., CLIP, BLIP, LLaVa, DINO) compare against a domain-specific face recognition model (viz., AdaFace or ArcFace) on the face recognition task? Through a series of experiments involving several foundation models and benchmark datasets, we are able to report the following findings: (a) In all datasets considered, domain-specific models outperformed zero-shot foundation models. (b) The performance of zero-shot generic foundation models improves on over-segmented face images than tightly cropped faces thereby suggesting the importance of contextual clues. For example, at a False Match Rate (FMR) of 0.01%, the True Match Rate (TMR) of OpenCLIP improved from 64.97% to 81.73% on the LFW dataset as the face crop increased from 112x112 to 250x250 while the TMR of domain-specific AdaFace dropped from 99.09% to 77.31%. (c) A simple score-level fusion of a foundation model with a domain-specific FR model improved the accuracy at low FMRs. For example, the TMR of AdaFace when fused with BLIP improved from 72.64% to 83.31% at an FMR of 0.0001% on the IJB-B dataset and from 73.17% to 85.81% on the IJB-C dataset. (d) Foundation models, such as ChatGPT, can be used to impart explainability to the FR pipeline (e.g., ``Despite minor lighting and head tilt differences, the two left-profile images show high consistency in forehead slope, nose shape, chin contour...''). In some instances, foundation models are even able to resolve low-confidence decisions made by AdaFace (e.g., ``Although AdaFace assigns a low similarity score of 0.21, both images exhibit visual similarity...and the pair is likely of the same person''), thereby reiterating the importance of combining domain-specific FR models with generic foundation models in a judicious manner.</p></details> |  |

Ensuring safety and efficiency in ORs of the future requires intelligent systems, like surgical robots, smart instruments and digital copilots, capable of understanding complex activities and hazards of surgeries. Yet, existing computational approaches, lack the breadth, and generalization needed for comprehensive OR understanding. We introduce ORQA, a multimodal foundation model unifying visual, auditory, and structured data for holistic surgical understanding. ORQA's question-answering framework empowers diverse tasks, serving as an intelligence core for a broad spectrum of surgical technologies. We benchmark ORQA against generalist vision-language models, including ChatGPT and Gemini, and show that while they struggle to perceive surgical scenes, ORQA delivers substantially stronger, consistent performance. Recognizing the extensive range of deployment settings across clinical practice, we design, and release a family of smaller ORQA models tailored to different computational requirements. This work establishes a foundation for the next wave of intelligent surgical solutions, enabling surgical teams and medical technology providers to create smarter and safer operating rooms.</p></details> |  |

However, existing solutions often rely on gestures or language commands, making interaction inefficient and ambiguous, particularly for users with physical impairments. In this paper, we introduce FAM-HRI, an efficient multi-modal framework for human-robot interaction that integrates language and gaze inputs via foundation models. By leveraging lightweight Meta ARIA glasses, our system captures real-time multi-modal signals and utilizes large language models (LLMs) to fuse user intention with scene context, enabling intuitive and precise robot manipulation. Our method accurately determines gaze fixation time interval, reducing noise caused by the gaze dynamic nature. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that FAM-HRI achieves a high success rate in task execution while maintaining a low interaction time, providing a practical solution for individuals with limited physical mobility or motor impairments.</p></details> |  |

While VLFMs show a rich understanding of semantic content across modalities, they often struggle with fine-grained alignment tasks that require precise correspondence between image regions and textual descriptions, a limitation in medical imaging, where accurate localization and detection of clinical features are essential for diagnosis and analysis. To address this issue, we propose a multi-stage architecture where a pre-trained VLFM (e.g. Stable Diffusion) provides a cursory semantic understanding, while a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm refines the alignment through an iterative process that optimizes for understanding semantic context. The reward signal is designed to align the semantic information of the text with synthesized images. Experiments on the public ISIC2019 skin lesion dataset demonstrate that the proposed method improves (a) the quality of the generated images, and (b) the alignment with the text prompt over the original fine-tuned Stable Diffusion baseline. We also show that the synthesized samples could be used to improve disease classifier performance for underrepresented subgroups through augmentation.

This text-centric approach, however, treats vision as a static, initial context, creating a fundamental "semantic gap" between rich perceptual data and discrete symbolic thought. Human cognition often transcends language, utilizing vision as a dynamic mental sketchpad. A similar evolution is now unfolding in AI, marking a fundamental paradigm shift from models that merely think about images to those that can truly think with images. This emerging paradigm is characterized by models leveraging visual information as intermediate steps in their thought process, transforming vision from a passive input into a dynamic, manipulable cognitive workspace. In this survey, we chart this evolution of intelligence along a trajectory of increasing cognitive autonomy, which unfolds across three key stages: from external tool exploration, through programmatic manipulation, to intrinsic imagination. To structure this rapidly evolving field, our survey makes four key contributions. (1) We establish the foundational principles of the think with image paradigm and its three-stage framework. (2) We provide a comprehensive review of the core methods that characterize each stage of this roadmap. (3) We analyze the critical landscape of evaluation benchmarks and transformative applications. (4) We identify significant challenges and outline promising future directions.

One of the most predominant biomarkers in neuroimaging is represented by brain age, which has been shown to be a good indicator for different conditions, such as Alzheimer's Disease. Using brain age for weakly supervised pre-training of DL models in transfer learning settings has also recently shown promising results, especially when dealing with data scarcity of different conditions. On the other hand, anatomical information of brain MRIs (e.g. cortical thickness) can provide important information for learning good representations that can be transferred to many downstream tasks. In this work, we propose AnatCL, an anatomical foundation model for brain MRIs that i.) leverages anatomical information in a weakly contrastive learning approach, and ii.) achieves state-of-the-art performances across many different downstream tasks. To validate our approach we consider 12 different downstream tasks for the diagnosis of different conditions such as Alzheimer's Disease, autism spectrum disorder, and schizophrenia. Furthermore, we also target the prediction of 10 different clinical assessment scores using structural MRI data. Our findings show that incorporating anatomical information during pre-training leads to more robust and generalizable representations.

| **[Toward a Robust and Generalizable Metamaterial Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02436v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advances in material functionalities drive innovations across various fields, where metamaterials-defined by structure rather than composition-are leading the way. Despite the rise of artificial intelligence (AI)-driven design strategies, their impact is limited by task-specific retraining, poor out-of-distribution(OOD) generalization, and the need for separate models for forward and inverse design. To address these limitations, we introduce the Metamaterial Foundation Model (MetaFO), a Bayesian transformer-based foundation model inspired by large language models. MetaFO learns the underlying mechanics of metamaterials, enabling probabilistic, zero-shot predictions across diverse, unseen combinations of material properties and structural responses. It also excels in nonlinear inverse design, even under OOD conditions. By treating metamaterials as an operator that maps material properties to structural responses, MetaFO uncovers intricate structure-property relationships and significantly expands the design space. This scalable and generalizable framework marks a paradigm shift in AI-driven metamaterial discovery, paving the way for next-generation innovations.</p></details> |  |

While recent advances in generative modeling have enabled high-quality synthetic data generation, existing approaches are often limited to unimodal, unidirectional synthesis and therefore lack the ability to jointly synthesize multiple modalities while preserving clinical consistency. To address this challenge, we introduce XGeM, a 6.77-billion-parameter multimodal generative model designed to support flexible, any-to-any synthesis between medical data modalities. XGeM constructs a shared latent space via contrastive learning and introduces a novel Multi-Prompt Training strategy, enabling conditioning on arbitrary subsets of input modalities. This design allows the model to adapt to heterogeneous clinical inputs and generate multiple outputs jointly, preserving both semantic and structural coherence. We extensively validate XGeM: first we benchmark it against five competitors on the MIMIC-CXR dataset, a state-of-the-art dataset for multi-view Chest X-ray and radiological report generation. Secondly, we perform a Visual Turing Test with expert radiologists to assess the realism and clinical relevance of the generated data, ensuring alignment with real-world scenarios. Finally, we show how XGeM can support key medical data challenges such as anonymization, class imbalance, and data scarcity, underscoring its utility as a foundation model for medical data synthesis.

Evaluating Multimodal Foundation Models on Standard Computer Vision Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01955v1)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal foundation models, such as GPT-4o, have recently made remarkable progress, but it is not clear where exactly these models stand in terms of understanding vision. In this paper, we benchmark the performance of popular multimodal foundation models (GPT-4o, o4-mini, Gemini 1.5 Pro and Gemini 2.0 Flash, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Qwen2-VL, Llama 3.2) on standard computer vision tasks (semantic segmentation, object detection, image classification, depth and surface normal prediction) using established datasets (e.g., COCO, ImageNet and its variants, etc). The main challenges to performing this are: 1) most models are trained to output text and cannot natively express versatile domains, such as segments or 3D geometry, and 2) many leading models are proprietary and accessible only at an API level, i.e., there is no weight access to adapt them. We address these challenges by translating standard vision tasks into equivalent text-promptable and API-compatible tasks via prompt chaining to create a standardized benchmarking framework. We observe that 1) the models are not close to the state-of-the-art specialist models at any task. However, 2) they are respectable generalists; this is remarkable as they are presumably trained on primarily image-text-based tasks. 3) They perform semantic tasks notably better than geometric ones. 4) While the prompt-chaining techniques affect performance, better models exhibit less sensitivity to prompt variations. 5) GPT-4o performs the best among non-reasoning models, securing the top position in 4 out of 6 tasks, 6) reasoning models, e.g. o3, show improvements in geometric tasks, and 7) a preliminary analysis of models with native image generation, like the latest GPT-4o, shows they exhibit quirks like hallucinations and spatial misalignments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page at https://fm-vision-evals.epfl.ch/</p></details> |
| **[A computationally frugal open-source foundation model for thoracic disease detection in lung cancer screening programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01881v1)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) imaging employed in lung cancer screening (LCS) programs is increasing in uptake worldwide. LCS programs herald a generational opportunity to simultaneously detect cancer and non-cancer-related early-stage lung disease. Yet these efforts are hampered by a shortage of radiologists to interpret scans at scale. Here, we present TANGERINE, a computationally frugal, open-source vision foundation model for volumetric LDCT analysis. Designed for broad accessibility and rapid adaptation, TANGERINE can be fine-tuned off the shelf for a wide range of disease-specific tasks with limited computational resources and training data. Relative to models trained from scratch, TANGERINE demonstrates fast convergence during fine-tuning, thereby requiring significantly fewer GPU hours, and displays strong label efficiency, achieving comparable or superior performance with a fraction of fine-tuning data. Pretrained using self-supervised learning on over 98,000 thoracic LDCTs, including the UK's largest LCS initiative to date and 27 public datasets, TANGERINE achieves state-of-the-art performance across 14 disease classification tasks, including lung cancer and multiple respiratory diseases, while generalising robustly across diverse clinical centres. By extending a masked autoencoder framework to 3D imaging, TANGERINE offers a scalable solution for LDCT analysis, departing from recent closed, resource-intensive models by combining architectural simplicity, public availability, and modest computational requirements. Its accessible, open-source lightweight design lays the foundation for rapid integration into next-generation medical imaging tools that could transform LCS initiatives, allowing them to pivot from a singular focus on lung cancer detection to comprehensive respiratory disease management in high-risk populations.</p></details> |  |

We introduce FAE (Foundation Auto-Encoders), a foundation generative-AI model for anomaly detection in time-series data, based on Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs). By foundation, we mean a model pretrained on massive amounts of time-series data which can learn complex temporal patterns useful for accurate modeling, forecasting, and detection of anomalies on previously unseen datasets. FAE leverages VAEs and Dilated Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) to build a generic model for univariate time-series modeling, which could eventually perform properly in out-of-the-box, zero-shot anomaly detection applications. We introduce the main concepts of FAE, and present preliminary results in different multi-dimensional time-series datasets from various domains, including a real dataset from an operational mobile ISP, and the well known KDD 2021 Anomaly Detection dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at ACM KDD 2024, MiLeTS 2024 Workshop, August 25, 2024, Barcelona, Spain</p></details> |

Consequently, these models can be used and fine-tuned for various purposes. Naturally, studying such models' use in the context of digital twins for cyber-physical systems (CPSs) is a relevant area of investigation. To this end, we provide perspectives on various aspects within the context of developing digital twins for CPSs, where foundation models can be used to increase the efficiency of creating digital twins, improve the effectiveness of the capabilities they provide, and used as specialized fine-tuned foundation models acting as digital twins themselves. We also discuss challenges in using foundation models in a more generic context. We use the case of an autonomous driving system as a representative CPS to give examples. Finally, we provide discussions and open research directions that we believe are valuable for the digital twin community.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Cardiac MRI Foundation Models: Comprehensive Visual-Tabular Representations for Whole-Heart Assessment and Beyond](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13037v3)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is the gold standard for non-invasive cardiac assessment, offering rich spatio-temporal views of the cardiac anatomy and physiology. Patient-level health factors, such as demographics, metabolic, and lifestyle, are known to substantially influence cardiovascular health and disease risk, yet remain uncaptured by CMR alone. To holistically understand cardiac health and to enable the best possible interpretation of an individual's disease risk, CMR and patient-level factors must be jointly exploited within an integrated framework. Recent multi-modal approaches have begun to bridge this gap, yet they often rely on limited spatio-temporal data and focus on isolated clinical tasks, thereby hindering the development of a comprehensive representation for cardiac health evaluation. To overcome these limitations, we introduce ViTa, a step toward foundation models that delivers a comprehensive representation of the heart and a precise interpretation of individual disease risk. Leveraging data from 42,000 UK Biobank participants, ViTa integrates 3D+T cine stacks from short-axis and long-axis views, enabling a complete capture of the cardiac cycle. These imaging data are then fused with detailed tabular patient-level factors, enabling context-aware insights. This multi-modal paradigm supports a wide spectrum of downstream tasks, including cardiac phenotype and physiological feature prediction, segmentation, and classification of cardiac and metabolic diseases within a single unified framework. By learning a shared latent representation that bridges rich imaging features and patient context, ViTa moves beyond traditional, task-specific models toward a universal, patient-specific understanding of cardiac health, highlighting its potential to advance clinical utility and scalability in cardiac analysis.</p></details> |  |

Insights from Fine-tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01196v1)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation Models have demonstrated significant success across various domains in Artificial Intelligence (AI), yet their capabilities for brainwave modeling remain unclear. In this paper, we comprehensively evaluate current Large Brainwave Foundation Models (LBMs) through systematic fine-tuning experiments across multiple Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) benchmark tasks, including memory tasks and sleep stage classification. Our extensive analysis shows that state-of-the-art LBMs achieve only marginal improvements (0.9%-1.2%) over traditional deep architectures while requiring significantly more parameters (millions vs thousands), raising important questions about their efficiency and applicability in BCI contexts. Moreover, through detailed ablation studies and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), we significantly reduce trainable parameters without performance degradation, while demonstrating that architectural and training inefficiencies limit LBMs' current capabilities. Our experiments span both full model fine-tuning and parameter-efficient adaptation techniques, providing insights into optimal training strategies for BCI applications. We pioneer the application of LoRA to LBMs, revealing that performance benefits generally emerge when adapting multiple neural network components simultaneously. These findings highlight the critical need for domain-specific development strategies to advance LBMs, suggesting that current architectures may require redesign to fully leverage the potential of foundation models in brainwave analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Why Neural Network Can Discover Symbolic Structures with Gradient-based Training: An Algebraic and Geometric Foundation for Neurosymbolic Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21797v2)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop a theoretical framework that explains how discrete symbolic structures can emerge naturally from continuous neural network training dynamics. By lifting neural parameters to a measure space and modeling training as Wasserstein gradient flow, we show that under geometric constraints, such as group invariance, the parameter measure $\mu_t$ undergoes two concurrent phenomena: (1) a decoupling of the gradient flow into independent optimization trajectories over some potential functions, and (2) a progressive contraction on the degree of freedom. These potentials encode algebraic constraints relevant to the task and act as ring homomorphisms under a commutative semi-ring structure on the measure space. As training progresses, the network transitions from a high-dimensional exploration to compositional representations that comply with algebraic operations and exhibit a lower degree of freedom. We further establish data scaling laws for realizing symbolic tasks, linking representational capacity to the group invariance that facilitates symbolic solutions. This framework charts a principled foundation for understanding and designing neurosymbolic systems that integrate continuous learning with discrete algebraic reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Conference on Neuro-symbolic Systems (NeuS), 2025</p></details> |

Unlike traditional benchmarks for scientific literature understanding and synthesis, SciArena engages the research community directly, following the Chatbot Arena evaluation approach of community voting on model comparisons. By leveraging collective intelligence, SciArena offers a community-driven evaluation of model performance on open-ended scientific tasks that demand literature-grounded, long-form responses. The platform currently supports 23 open-source and proprietary foundation models and has collected over 13,000 votes from trusted researchers across diverse scientific domains. We analyze the data collected so far and confirm that the submitted questions are diverse, aligned with real-world literature needs, and that participating researchers demonstrate strong self-consistency and inter-annotator agreement in their evaluations. We discuss the results and insights based on the model ranking leaderboard. To further promote research in building model-based automated evaluation systems for literature tasks, we release SciArena-Eval, a meta-evaluation benchmark based on our collected preference data. The benchmark measures the accuracy of models in judging answer quality by comparing their pairwise assessments with human votes. Our experiments highlight the benchmark's challenges and emphasize the need for more reliable automated evaluation methods.</p></details> |  |

This enduring question continues to shape the pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Despite the growing capabilities of models such as GPT-4.5, DeepSeek, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Phi-4, and Grok 3, which exhibit multimodal fluency and partial reasoning, these systems remain fundamentally limited by their reliance on token-level prediction and lack of grounded agency. This paper offers a cross-disciplinary synthesis of AGI development, spanning artificial intelligence, cognitive neuroscience, psychology, generative models, and agent-based systems. We analyze the architectural and cognitive foundations of general intelligence, highlighting the role of modular reasoning, persistent memory, and multi-agent coordination. In particular, we emphasize the rise of Agentic RAG frameworks that combine retrieval, planning, and dynamic tool use to enable more adaptive behavior. We discuss generalization strategies, including information compression, test-time adaptation, and training-free methods, as critical pathways toward flexible, domain-agnostic intelligence. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are reexamined not just as perception modules but as evolving interfaces for embodied understanding and collaborative task completion. We also argue that true intelligence arises not from scale alone but from the integration of memory and reasoning: an orchestration of modular, interactive, and self-improving components where compression enables adaptive behavior. Drawing on advances in neurosymbolic systems, reinforcement learning, and cognitive scaffolding, we explore how recent architectures begin to bridge the gap between statistical learning and goal-directed cognition. Finally, we identify key scientific, technical, and ethical challenges on the path to AGI.</p></details> |  |

Moirai and TimesFM outperform both statistical and deep learning baselines, achieving up to 33% lower RMSE, 39% lower MAE and up to 49% higher CPC compared to state-of-the-art competitors.

| **[A Scalable and Quantum-Accurate Foundation Model for Biomolecular Force Field via Linearly Tensorized Quadrangle Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00884v1)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate atomistic biomolecular simulations are vital for disease mechanism understanding, drug discovery, and biomaterial design, but existing simulation methods exhibit significant limitations. Classical force fields are efficient but lack accuracy for transition states and fine conformational details critical in many chemical and biological processes. Quantum Mechanics (QM) methods are highly accurate but computationally infeasible for large-scale or long-time simulations. AI-based force fields (AIFFs) aim to achieve QM-level accuracy with efficiency but struggle to balance many-body modeling complexity, accuracy, and speed, often constrained by limited training data and insufficient validation for generalizability. To overcome these challenges, we introduce LiTEN, a novel equivariant neural network with Tensorized Quadrangle Attention (TQA). TQA efficiently models three- and four-body interactions with linear complexity by reparameterizing high-order tensor features via vector operations, avoiding costly spherical harmonics. Building on LiTEN, LiTEN-FF is a robust AIFF foundation model, pre-trained on the extensive nablaDFT dataset for broad chemical generalization and fine-tuned on SPICE for accurate solvated system simulations. LiTEN achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across most evaluation subsets of rMD17, MD22, and Chignolin, outperforming leading models such as MACE, NequIP, and EquiFormer. LiTEN-FF enables the most comprehensive suite of downstream biomolecular modeling tasks to date, including QM-level conformer searches, geometry optimization, and free energy surface construction, while offering 10x faster inference than MACE-OFF for large biomolecules (~1000 atoms). In summary, we present a physically grounded, highly efficient framework that advances complex biomolecular modeling, providing a versatile foundation for drug discovery and related applications.</p></details> |  |

Their ability to leverage prior knowledge from massive datasets has streamlined the development of intelligent pathology models. However, we identify several critical and interrelated ethical risks that remain underexplored, yet must be addressed to enable the safe translation of PFMs from lab to clinic. These include the potential leakage of patient-sensitive attributes, disparities in model performance across demographic and institutional subgroups, and the reliance on diagnosis-irrelevant features that undermine clinical reliability. In this study, we pioneer the quantitative analysis for ethical risks in PFMs, including privacy leakage, clinical reliability, and group fairness. Specifically, we propose an evaluation framework that systematically measures key dimensions of ethical concern: the degree to which patient-sensitive attributes can be inferred from model representations, the extent of performance disparities across demographic and institutional subgroups, and the influence of diagnostically irrelevant features on model decisions. We further investigate the underlying causes of these ethical risks in PFMs and empirically validate our findings. Then we offer insights into potential directions for mitigating such risks, aiming to inform the development of more ethically robust PFMs. This work provides the first quantitative and systematic evaluation of ethical risks in PFMs. Our findings highlight the urgent need for ethical safeguards in PFMs and offer actionable insights for building more trustworthy and clinically robust PFMs. To facilitate future research and deployment, we will release the assessment framework as an online toolkit to support the development, auditing, and deployment of ethically robust PFMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages,5 figure,23 tables</p></details> |

We present a novel generative pretraining strategy for sequential EHR data using next-visit event prediction. Our model learns to autoregressively generate various tokenized clinical events for the next visit based on patient history and inherently handles the joint prediction of heterogeneous data types. Additionally, we introduce regularization on predicting repeated events and highlight a key pitfall in EHR-based foundation model evaluations: repeated event tokens can inflate performance metrics when new onsets are not distinguished from subsequent occurrences. Our model is evaluated via zero-shot prediction for forecasting dementia and knee osteoarthritis incidence within 2 and 5 years, and the model performance rivals a fully fine-tuned masked pretrained Transformer baseline, demonstrating that our approach captures complex clinical dependencies without requiring costly task-specific fine-tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICML 2025 Workshop on Foundation Models for Structured Data</p></details> |

As the wave of general-purpose foundation models sweeps across various domains, their influence has significantly extended to the field of recommendation systems. While recent efforts have explored recommendation foundation models for various generative tasks, they often overlook crucial embedding tasks and struggle with the complexities of multi-task learning, including knowledge sharing & conflict resolution, and convergence speed inconsistencies. To address these limitations, we introduce RecFound, a generative representational learning framework for recommendation foundation models. We construct the first comprehensive dataset for recommendation foundation models covering both generative and embedding tasks across diverse scenarios. Based on this dataset, we propose a novel multi-task training scheme featuring a Task-wise Mixture of Low-rank Experts (TMoLE) to handle knowledge sharing & conflict, a Step-wise Convergence-oriented Sample Scheduler (S2Sched) to address inconsistent convergence, and a Model Merge module to balance the performance across tasks. Experiments demonstrate that RecFound achieves state-of-the-art performance across various recommendation tasks, outperforming existing baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page is available at https://junkfood436.github.io/RecFound/</p></details> |

The arrival of large AI models paves the way for the next phase of Wireless AI, driven by wireless foundation models (WFMs). In particular, pre-training on universal electromagnetic (EM) principles equips WFMs with the essential adaptability for a multitude of demanding 6G applications. However, existing large AI models face critical limitations, including pre-training strategies disconnected from EM-compliant constraints leading to physically inconsistent predictions, a lack of embedded understanding of wave propagation physics, and the inaccessibility of massive labeled datasets for comprehensive EM-aware training. To address these challenges, this article presents an electromagnetic information theory-guided self-supervised pre-training (EIT-SPT) framework designed to systematically inject EM physics into WFMs. The EIT-SPT framework aims to infuse WFMs with intrinsic EM knowledge, thereby enhancing their physical consistency, generalization capabilities across varied EM landscapes, and overall data efficiency. Building upon the proposed EIT-SPT framework, this article first elaborates on diverse potential applications in 6G scenarios of WFMs, then validates the efficacy of the proposed framework through illustrative case studies, and finally summarizes critical open research challenges and future directions for WFMs.</p></details> |  |

However, compared to the open accessibility and high spatiotemporal coverage of medium-resolution data, the limited acquisition channels for ultra-high-resolution optical RS imagery have constrained the progress of high-resolution remote sensing vision foundation models (RSVFM). As the world's largest sub-meter-level commercial RS satellite constellation, the Jilin-1 constellation possesses abundant sub-meter-level image resources. This study proposes CGEarthEye, a RSVFM framework specifically designed for Jilin-1 satellite characteristics, comprising five backbones with different parameter scales with totaling 2.1 billion parameters. To enhance the representational capacity of the foundation model, we developed JLSSD, the first 15-million-scale multi-temporal self-supervised learning (SSL) dataset featuring global coverage with quarterly temporal sampling within a single year, constructed through multi-level representation clustering and sampling strategies. The framework integrates seasonal contrast, augmentation-based contrast, and masked patch token contrastive strategies for pre-training. Comprehensive evaluations across 10 benchmark datasets covering four typical RS tasks demonstrate that the CGEarthEye consistently achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. Further analysis reveals CGEarthEye's superior characteristics in feature visualization, model convergence, parameter efficiency, and practical mapping applications. This study anticipates that the exceptional representation capabilities of CGEarthEye will facilitate broader and more efficient applications of Jilin-1 data in traditional EO application.</p></details> | <details><summary>A Rem...</summary><p>A Remote Sensing Fundation Model for Very High Resolution Images</p></details> |

Latest foundational models trained for time series forecasting show strengths (e.g., for long sequences and in zero-shot settings). However, foundational model was not yet used for forecasting rare, spiky events, i.e., a challenging target because those are a corner case of extreme events. In this paper, we optimize a state-of-the-art foundational model to forecast sporadic or spiky production outages of high-performance machine learning services powering billions of client devices. We evaluate the forecasting errors of the foundational model compared with classical stochastic forecasting models (e.g., moving average and autoregressive). The analysis helps us understand how each of the evaluated models performs for the sporadic or spiky events. For example, it identifies the key patterns in the target data that are well tracked by the foundational model vs. each of the stochastic models. We use the models with optimal parameters to estimate a year-long outage statistics of a particular root cause with less than 6% value errors.</p></details> |  |

Evaluated on 57 health-related tasks, our model shows strong performance across diverse real-world applications including individual-level classification and time-varying health state prediction.

This is challenging as it involves deep vision-language understanding, pixel-level dense prediction and spatiotemporal reasoning. Despite notable progress in recent years, existing methods still exhibit a noticeable gap when considering all these aspects. In this work, we propose \textbf{ReferDINO}, a strong RVOS model that inherits region-level vision-language alignment from foundational visual grounding models, and is further endowed with pixel-level dense perception and cross-modal spatiotemporal reasoning. In detail, ReferDINO integrates two key components: 1) a grounding-guided deformable mask decoder that utilizes location prediction to progressively guide mask prediction through differentiable deformation mechanisms; 2) an object-consistent temporal enhancer that injects pretrained time-varying text features into inter-frame interaction to capture object-aware dynamic changes. Moreover, a confidence-aware query pruning strategy is designed to accelerate object decoding without compromising model performance. Extensive experimental results on five benchmarks demonstrate that our ReferDINO significantly outperforms previous methods (e.g., +3.9% (\mathcal{J}&\mathcal{F}) on Ref-YouTube-VOS) with real-time inference speed (51 FPS).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025.

One specific challenge is that of data semantics: numerical entries take their meaning from context, e.g., column name. Pre-trained neural networks that jointly model column names and table entries have recently boosted prediction accuracy. While these models outline the promises of world knowledge to interpret table values, they lack the convenience of popular foundation models in text or vision. Indeed, they must be fine-tuned to bring benefits, come with sizeable computation costs, and cannot easily be reused or combined with other architectures. Here we introduce TARTE, a foundation model that transforms tables to knowledge-enhanced vector representations using the string to capture semantics. Pre-trained on large relational data, TARTE yields representations that facilitate subsequent learning with little additional cost. These representations can be fine-tuned or combined with other learners, giving models that push the state-of-the-art prediction performance and improve the prediction/computation performance trade-off. Specialized to a task or a domain, TARTE gives domain-specific representations that facilitate further learning. Our study demonstrates an effective approach to knowledge pre-training for tabular learning.</p></details> |  |

However, performing inference with LFMs in resource-constrained and heterogeneous edge environments, such as Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC), presents significant challenges for workload orchestration due to time-varying network, compute, and storage conditions. In particular, current split inference strategies, which partition LFM layers across nodes, are not designed to adapt to fluctuating workloads, dynamic bandwidth conditions, or evolving privacy constraints in high-utilization MEC environments. In this work, we propose a novel adaptive split inference orchestration framework that elevates both the placement and partitioning of LFM layers to runtime-tunable variables. Specifically, our framework enables real-time, quality-of-service (QoS)-aware management of inference workloads by extending conventional orchestrators with three key services: (1) Capacity-aware workload distribution, which continuously profiles node resources and selects an optimal subset of MEC nodes; (2) Dynamic partition migration, which transparently relocates pre-cut LFM segments in response to changes in utilization or network conditions; (3) Real-time reconfiguration, which dynamically re-splits LFM layers to balance latency, throughput, and privacy. We formalize the joint placement-partitioning problem, outline a reference architecture and algorithmic workflow, and discuss applicability in representative smart city, V2X, and industrial edge scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables, 50 references</p></details> |

We intend this document primarily for developers of large-scale, state-of-the-art GPAI/foundation models; others that can benefit from this guidance include downstream developers of end-use applications that build on a GPAI/foundation model. This document facilitates conformity with or use of leading AI risk management-related standards, adapting and building on the generic voluntary guidance in the NIST AI Risk Management Framework and ISO/IEC 23894, with a focus on the unique issues faced by developers of GPAI/foundation models.</p></details> |  |

However, applying LoRA in federated learning environments, where data is distributed across multiple clients, presents unique challenges. Existing methods rely on traditional federated averaging of LoRA adapters, resulting in inexact updates. To address this, we propose Federated Exact LoRA, or FedEx-LoRA, which adds a residual error term to the pretrained frozen weight matrix. Our approach achieves exact updates with minimal computational and communication overhead, preserving LoRA's efficiency. We evaluate the method on various models across arithmetic reasoning, commonsense reasoning, natural language understanding and natural language generation tasks, showing consistent performance gains over state-of-the-art methods across multiple settings. Through extensive analysis, we quantify that the deviations in updates from the ideal solution are significant, highlighting the need for exact aggregation. Our method's simplicity, efficiency, and broad applicability position it as a promising solution for accurate and effective federated fine-tuning of foundation models.

However, their potential has yet to be fully demonstrated in bioacoustics tasks, such as detecting animal vocalizations in large recordings, classifying rare and endangered species, and labeling context and behavior -- tasks that are crucial for conservation, biodiversity monitoring, and animal behavior studies. In this work, we present NatureLM-audio, the first audio-language foundation model specifically designed for bioacoustics. Our training dataset consists of carefully curated text-audio pairs spanning bioacoustics, speech, and music, designed to address the field's limited availability of annotated data. We demonstrate successful transfer of learned representations from music and speech to bioacoustics, and our model shows promising generalization to unseen taxa and tasks. We evaluate NatureLM-audio on a novel benchmark (BEANS-Zero) and it sets a new state of the art on several bioacoustics tasks, including zero-shot classification of unseen species. To advance bioacoustics research, we release our model weights, benchmark data, and open-source the code for training and benchmark data generation and model training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Demo ...</summary><p>Demo page: https://earthspecies.github.io/naturelm-audio-demo/</p></details> |

This has led to a new quest in graph machine learning: how to build graph foundation models capable of generalizing across arbitrary graphs and features? In this work, we present a recipe for designing graph foundation models for node-level tasks from first principles. The key ingredient underpinning our study is a systematic investigation of the symmetries that a graph foundation model must respect. In a nutshell, we argue that label permutation-equivariance alongside feature permutation-invariance are necessary in addition to the common node permutation-equivariance on each local neighborhood of the graph. To this end, we first characterize the space of linear transformations that are equivariant to permutations of nodes and labels, and invariant to permutations of features. We then prove that the resulting network is a universal approximator on multisets that respect the aforementioned symmetries. Our recipe uses such layers on the multiset of features induced by the local neighborhood of the graph to obtain a class of graph foundation models for node property prediction. We validate our approach through extensive experiments on 29 real-world node classification datasets, demonstrating both strong zero-shot empirical performance and consistent improvement as the number of training graphs increases.</p></details> |  |

With the success of image foundation models (IFMs) in image understanding, recent approaches have explored parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) to adapt IFMs for video. However, most of these methods tend to process spatial and temporal information separately, which may fail to capture the full intricacy of video dynamics. In this paper, we propose MoMa, an efficient adapter framework that achieves full spatial-temporal modeling by integrating Mamba's selective state space modeling into IFMs. We propose a novel SeqMod operation to inject spatial-temporal information into pre-trained IFMs, without disrupting their original features. By incorporating SeqMod into a Divide-and-Modulate architecture, MoMa enhances video understanding while maintaining computational efficiency. Extensive experiments on multiple video benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of MoMa, achieving superior performance with reduced computational cost.</p></details> | ICML 2025 paper |
| **[The language of time: a language model perspective on time-series foundation models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00078v1)** | 2025-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rise of large language models, the paradigm of training foundation models with massive parameter counts on vast datasets has been adopted in multiple domains to achieve remarkable success. Time series foundation models represent a significant extension of this paradigm, demonstrating exceptional expressive power, generalization, and cross-domain transferability. However, this gives rise to a fundamental paradox: time series data reflect distinct dynamical systems, making cross-domain transfer intuitively implausible, yet this is contradicted by the models' empirical success. To resolve this paradox, this paper investigates, from both theoretical and experimental perspectives, the representation learning mechanisms and generalization capabilities of patch-based time series foundation models. We argue that such models are not merely applying a new architecture but are fundamentally generalizing the representation paradigm of language models by extending deterministic vector-based representations to latent probabilistic distributional forms. Our theoretical analysis supports this framework by demonstrating that continuous time-series patches can be faithfully quantized into a discrete vocabulary whose key statistical properties are highly consistent with those of natural language. This generalization allows time series models to inherit the robust representation and transfer abilities of large language models, thereby explaining their superior performance in temporal tasks. Ultimately, our work provides a rigorous theoretical cornerstone for understanding, evaluating, and improving the safety and reliability of large-scale time series foundation models.</p></details> |  |

First, the conceptual framing: the capabilities, risks, and the supply chain that grounds foundation models in the broader economy. Second, the empirical insights that enrich the conceptual foundations: transparency created via evaluations at the model level and indexes at the organization level. Finally, the transition from understanding to action: superior understanding of the societal impact of foundation models advances evidence-based AI policy.

While recent EEG foundation models advance generalized decoding via unified architectures and large-scale pretraining, they adopt a scale-agnostic dense modeling paradigm inherited from NLP and vision. This design neglects a core property of neural activity: cross-scale spatiotemporal structure. EEG task patterns span a wide range of temporal and spatial scales, from short bursts to slow rhythms, and from localized cortical responses to distributed interactions. Ignoring this diversity leads to suboptimal representations and weak generalization. We propose CSBrain, a Cross-scale Spatiotemporal Brain foundation model for generalized EEG decoding. CSBrain introduces: (i) Cross-scale Spatiotemporal Tokenization (CST), which aggregates multi-scale features from localized temporal windows and anatomical brain regions into compact scale-aware tokens; and (ii) Structured Sparse Attention (SSA), which captures cross-window and cross-region dependencies, enhancing scale diversity while removing spurious correlations. CST and SSA are alternately stacked to progressively integrate multi-scale dependencies. Experiments on 11 EEG tasks across 16 datasets show that CSBrain consistently outperforms task-specific and foundation model baselines. These results establish cross-scale modeling as a key inductive bias and position CSBrain as a robust backbone for future brain-AI research.</p></details> |  |

However, similar advancements in health data modeling remain limited due to the need for innovative adaptations. Wearable movement data offers a valuable avenue for exploration, as it's a core feature in nearly all commercial smartwatches, well established in clinical and mental health research, and the sequential nature of the data shares similarities to language. We introduce the Pretrained Actigraphy Transformer (PAT), the first open source foundation model designed for time-series wearable movement data. Leveraging transformer-based architectures and novel techniques, such as patch embeddings, and pretraining on data from 29,307 participants in a national U.S. sample, PAT achieves state-of-the-art performance in several mental health prediction tasks. PAT is also lightweight and easily interpretable, making it a robust tool for mental health research. GitHub: https://github.com/njacobsonlab/Pretrained-Actigraphy-Transformer/</p></details> |  |
| **[Resilient-Native and Intelligent Next-Generation Wireless Systems: Key Enablers, Foundations, and Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22991v1)** | 2025-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Just like power, water, and transportation systems, wireless networks are a crucial societal infrastructure. As natural and human-induced disruptions continue to grow, wireless networks must be resilient. This requires them to withstand and recover from unexpected adverse conditions, shocks, unmodeled disturbances and cascading failures. Unlike robustness and reliability, resilience is based on the understanding that disruptions will inevitably happen. Resilience, as elasticity, focuses on the ability to bounce back to favorable states, while resilience as plasticity involves agents and networks that can flexibly expand their states and hypotheses through real-time adaptation and reconfiguration. This situational awareness and active preparedness, adapting world models and counterfactually reasoning about potential system failures and the best responses, is a core aspect of resilience. This article will first disambiguate resilience from reliability and robustness, before delving into key mathematical foundations of resilience grounded in abstraction, compositionality and emergence. Subsequently, we focus our attention on a plethora of techniques and methodologies pertaining to the unique characteristics of resilience, as well as their applications through a comprehensive set of use cases. Ultimately, the goal of this paper is to establish a unified foundation for understanding, modeling, and engineering resilience in wireless communication systems, while laying a roadmap for the next-generation of resilient-native and intelligent wireless systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Universal Gluing and Contextual Choice: Categorical Logic and the Foundations of Analytic Approximation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22693v1)** | 2025-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a new categorical and constructive foundation for analytic approximation based on a Contextual Choice Principle (CCP), which enforces locality and compatibility in the construction of mathematical objects. Central to our approach is the Universal Embedding and Linear Approximation Theorem (UELAT), which establishes that functions in broad spaces -- including C(K), Sobolev spaces W^{k,p}(Omega), and distributions D'(Omega) -- can be explicitly approximated by finite-rank linear projections, each with a constructive, algorithmically verifiable certificate of accuracy. These constructions are governed categorically by a functorial adjunction between local logical probes and analytic models, making analytic existence both formally certifiable and programmatically extractable. As a key result, we prove a uniform certificate stability theorem, ensuring that approximation certificates persist under uniform convergence. The CCP avoids classical pathologies (e.g., non-measurable sets, Banach--Tarski paradoxes) by eliminating non-constructive choice and replacing it with a coherent, local-to-global semantic logic. Our framework strengthens the foundations of constructive analysis while contributing tools relevant to formal verification, type-theoretic proof systems, and computational mathematics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Inventiones Mathematicae.

However, transferring this success to biomedicine is hindered by the scarcity of large-scale biomedical image-text corpora, the heterogeneity of image modalities, and fragmented data standards across institutions. These limitations hinder the development of a unified and generalizable biomedical foundation model trained from scratch. To overcome this, we introduce MMKD-CLIP, a generalist biomedical foundation model developed via Multiple Medical CLIP Knowledge Distillation. Rather than relying on billion-scale raw data, MMKD-CLIP distills knowledge from nine state-of-the-art domain-specific or generalist biomedical CLIP models, each pretrained on millions of biomedical image-text pairs. Our two-stage training pipeline first performs CLIP-style pretraining on over 2.9 million biomedical image-text pairs from 26 image modalities, followed by feature-level distillation using over 19.2 million feature pairs extracted from teacher models. We evaluate MMKD-CLIP on 58 diverse biomedical datasets, encompassing over 10.8 million biomedical images across nine image modalities. The evaluation spans six core task types: zero-shot classification, linear probing, cross-modal retrieval, visual question answering, survival prediction, and cancer diagnosis. MMKD-CLIP consistently outperforms all teacher models while demonstrating remarkable robustness and generalization across image domains and task settings. These results underscore that multi-teacher knowledge distillation is a scalable and effective paradigm for building high-performing biomedical foundation models under the practical constraints of real-world data availability.</p></details> |  |

Intrinsic motivation attempts to decouple exploration from external, task-based rewards. However, established approaches to intrinsic motivation that follow general principles such as information gain, often only uncover low-level interactions. In contrast, children's play suggests that they engage in meaningful high-level behavior by imitating or interacting with their caregivers. Recent work has focused on using foundation models to inject these semantic biases into exploration. However, these methods often rely on unrealistic assumptions, such as language-embedded environments or access to high-level actions. We propose SEmaNtically Sensible ExploratIon (SENSEI), a framework to equip model-based RL agents with an intrinsic motivation for semantically meaningful behavior. SENSEI distills a reward signal of interestingness from Vision Language Model (VLM) annotations, enabling an agent to predict these rewards through a world model. Using model-based RL, SENSEI trains an exploration policy that jointly maximizes semantic rewards and uncertainty. We show that in both robotic and video game-like simulations SENSEI discovers a variety of meaningful behaviors from image observations and low-level actions. SENSEI provides a general tool for learning from foundation model feedback, a crucial research direction, as VLMs become more powerful.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025 camera-ready version.

They typically exhibit distinctive structure and domain-specific knowledge, motivating the development of a Graph Foundation Model (GFM) that generalizes across diverse graphs and tasks. Despite large efforts to integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for TAGs, existing approaches suffer from decoupled architectures with two-stage alignment, limiting their synergistic potential. Even worse, existing methods assign out-of-vocabulary (OOV) tokens to graph nodes, leading to graph-specific semantics, token explosion, and incompatibility with task-oriented prompt templates, which hinders cross-graph and cross-task transferability. To address these challenges, we propose PromptGFM, a versatile GFM for TAGs grounded in graph vocabulary learning. PromptGFM comprises two key components: (1) Graph Understanding Module, which explicitly prompts LLMs to replicate the finest GNN workflow within the text space, facilitating seamless GNN-LLM integration and elegant graph-text alignment; (2) Graph Inference Module, which establishes a language-based graph vocabulary ensuring expressiveness, transferability, and scalability, enabling readable instructions for LLM fine-tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate our superiority and transferability across diverse graphs and tasks. The code is available at this: https://github.com/agiresearch/PromptGFM.</p></details> |  |

A popular DL approach is self-supervised learning (SSL), where models learn from vast amounts of unlabeled data, avoiding costly annotation. SSL has allowed the development of foundation models (FMs), large models that can be used for a variety of downstream tasks. However, existing FMs for OCT, trained solely on image data, lack a comprehensive and robust semantic understanding of images, as evidenced by their downstream performance (especially for complex tasks), and thus require supervised fine-tuning (which may be unfeasible) to better adapt to specific applications and populations. To address this, we propose RetFiner, an SSL vision-language refinement scheme that improves the representations of existing FMs and enables their efficient and direct adaptation to specific populations for improved downstream performance. Our method uses a diverse set of training objectives which take advantage of the rich supervisory signal found in textual data. We tested RetFiner on the retinal FMs RETFound, UrFound, and VisionFM, showing significant improvements in linear probing performance on seven highly diverse OCT classification tasks, with an average increase of 5.8, 3.9, and 2.1 percentage points over their baselines, respectively.

However, their design primarily targets real-valued series, limiting their ability to handle general forecasting tasks involving diverse and often heterogeneous covariates--such as categorical variables and multimodal data (e.g., images, text)--which are typically task-specific and difficult to leverage during pretraining. To address this gap, we propose Unified Covariate Adaptation (UniCA), a framework to bridge TSFMs with general covariate-aware forecasting. UniCA first performs covariate homogenization to transform heterogeneous covariates into high-level homogeneous series representations and then fuses them via a unified attention-based fusion mechanism. UniCA is compatible and universal for adaptation with both homogeneous and heterogeneous covariates, incorporating extra covariate information while preserving the generalization ability of TSFMs.Extensive experiments on multiple unimodal and multimodal covariate-aware forecasting benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of UniCA, highlighting the promise of covariate-aware TSFM adaptation in real-world forecasting scenarios. Codes are released on https://github.com/hanlu-nju/UniCA.</p></details> |  |

To address these, we propose TASeg, a text-aware RGB-T segmentation framework by using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning technology to adapt vision foundation models. Specifically, we propose a Dynamic Feature Fusion Module (DFFM) in the image encoder, which effectively merges features from multiple visual modalities while freezing SAM's original transformer blocks. Additionally, we incorporate CLIP-generated text embeddings in the mask decoder to enable semantic alignment, which further rectifies the classification error and improves the semantic understanding accuracy.

Traditional IEs, typically pre-trained on the target dataset, are inherently dataset-dependent. Foundation models (FMs) offer a promising alternative, potentially mitigating this limitation. This work investigates two key questions: (1) Can FM-based subset selection outperform traditional IE-based methods across diverse datasets? (2) Do all FMs perform equally well as IEs for subset selection? Extensive experiments uncovered surprising insights: FMs consistently outperform traditional IEs on fine-grained datasets, whereas their advantage diminishes on coarse-grained datasets with noisy labels. Motivated by these finding, we propose RAM-APL (RAnking Mean-Accuracy of Pseudo-class Labels), a method tailored for fine-grained image datasets. RAM-APL leverages multiple FMs to enhance subset selection by exploiting their complementary strengths. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on fine-grained datasets, including Oxford-IIIT Pet, Food-101, and Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 10 figures, accepted by ICML 2025</p></details> |

We propose a simple yet effective approach for few-shot segmentation of historical maps, leveraging the rich semantic embeddings of large vision foundation models combined with parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art on the Siegfried benchmark dataset in vineyard and railway segmentation, achieving +5% and +13% relative improvements in mIoU in 10-shot scenarios and around +20% in the more challenging 5-shot setting. Additionally, it demonstrates strong performance on the ICDAR 2021 competition dataset, attaining a mean PQ of 67.3% for building block segmentation, despite not being optimized for this shape-sensitive metric, underscoring its generalizability. Notably, our approach maintains high performance even in extremely low-data regimes (10- & 5-shot), while requiring only 689k trainable parameters - just 0.21% of the total model size.

To tackle challenges of processing multi-source, multi-fidelity data during pre-training, recent studies employ multi-task learning, in which shared message passing layers initially process input atomistic structures regardless of source, then route them to multiple decoding heads that predict data-specific outputs. This approach stabilizes pre-training and enhances a model's transferability to unexplored chemical regions. Preliminary results on approximately four million structures are encouraging, yet questions remain about generalizability to larger, more diverse datasets and scalability on supercomputers. We propose a multi-task parallelism method that distributes each head across computing resources with GPU acceleration. Implemented in the open-source HydraGNN architecture, our method was trained on over 24 million structures from five datasets and tested on the Perlmutter, Aurora, and Frontier supercomputers, demonstrating efficient scaling on all three highly heterogeneous super-computing architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

While these interfaces enhance database accessibility, most research today focuses solely on English, with limited evaluation in other languages. This paper investigates the performance of foundational LLMs on the Text2Cypher task across multiple languages. We create and release a multilingual test set by translating English questions into Spanish and Turkish while preserving the original Cypher queries, enabling fair cross-lingual comparison. We evaluate multiple foundational models using standardized prompts and metrics. Our results show a consistent performance pattern: highest on English, then Spanish, and lowest on Turkish. We attribute this to differences in training data availability and linguistic characteristics. Additionally, we explore the impact of translating task prompts into Spanish and Turkish. Results show little to no change in evaluation metrics, suggesting prompt translation has minor impact. Our findings highlight the need for more inclusive evaluation and development in multilingual query generation. Future work includes schema localization and fine-tuning across diverse languages.</p></details> |  |

However, their identification remains challenging due to low prevalence, at times subtle morphological differences from normal mitoses, low inter-rater agreement among pathologists, and class imbalance in datasets. Building on the Atypical Mitosis dataset for Breast Cancer (AMi-Br), this study presents a comprehensive benchmark comparing deep learning approaches for automated atypical mitotic figure (AMF) classification, including baseline models, foundation models with linear probing, and foundation models fine-tuned with low-rank adaptation (LoRA). For rigorous evaluation, we further introduce two new hold-out AMF datasets - AtNorM-Br, a dataset of mitoses from the The TCGA breast cancer cohort, and AtNorM-MD, a multi-domain dataset of mitoses from the MIDOG++ training set. We found average balanced accuracy values of up to 0.8135, 0.7696, and 0.7705 on the in-domain AMi-Br and the out-of-domain AtNorm-Br and AtNorM-MD datasets, respectively, with the results being particularly good for LoRA-based adaptation of the Virchow-line of foundation models. Our work shows that atypical mitosis classification, while being a challenging problem, can be effectively addressed through the use of recent advances in transfer learning and model fine-tuning techniques.

This potential stems from their ability to aggregate images from diverse sources such as varying physical groundings or data acquisition systems and to learn spatio-temporal correlations using transformer architectures. However, tokenizing and aggregating images can be compute-intensive, a challenge not fully addressed by current distributed methods. In this work, we introduce the Distributed Cross-Channel Hierarchical Aggregation (D-CHAG) approach designed for datasets with a large number of channels across image modalities. Our method is compatible with any model-parallel strategy and any type of vision transformer architecture, significantly improving computational efficiency. We evaluated D-CHAG on hyperspectral imaging and weather forecasting tasks. When integrated with tensor parallelism and model sharding, our approach achieved up to a 75% reduction in memory usage and more than doubled sustained throughput on up to 1,024 AMD GPUs on the Frontier Supercomputer.</p></details> |  |

Although DNA language models (DNALMs) such as DNABERT, GENA-LM have achieved high level of performance on genome-related biological tasks, these models do not encode biological functions in the presence of sequence variations. To address this problem, we pre-train foundation models that effectively integrate sequence variations, in particular Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs), as they underlie important biological functions. Specifically, we use ModernBERT to pre-train two different Biomedical Foundation Models (BMFM), namely, BMFM-DNA-REF in which the model is trained with sequences of varying lengths along with their reverse complements derived from the reference genome and BMFM-DNA-SNP in which the model is trained with sequences created using a novel representation scheme that encodes sequence variations. Our findings indicate that integrating sequence variations into DNALMs helps capture the biological functions as seen in improvements on all fine-tuning tasks. To explore the model's practical utility, we experimented with various strategies for SNP imputation on promoter detection task introduced in DNABERT-2. However, we acknowledge that the current benchmarks are limited in their ability to fully evaluate these models. To enable more comprehensive assessment in the future and encourage community contributions, we release our models through HuggingFace and the code to reproduce the results at https://github.com/BiomedSciAI/biomed-multi-omic</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Scalable and Generalizable Earth Observation Data Mining via Foundation Model Composition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20174v2)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models are rapidly transforming Earth Observation data mining by enabling generalizable and scalable solutions for key tasks such as scene classification and semantic segmentation. While most efforts in the geospatial domain have focused on developing large models trained from scratch using massive Earth Observation datasets, an alternative strategy that remains underexplored is the reuse and combination of existing pretrained models. In this study, we investigate whether foundation models pretrained on remote sensing and general vision datasets can be effectively combined to improve performance across a diverse set of key Earth Observation tasks. Using the GEO-Bench benchmark, we evaluate several prominent models, including Prithvi, Hiera, and DOFA, on eleven datasets covering a range of spatial resolutions, sensor modalities, and task types. The results show that feature-level ensembling of smaller pretrained models can match or exceed the performance of much larger models, while requiring less training time and computational resources. Moreover, the study highlights the potential of applying knowledge distillation to transfer the strengths of ensembles into more compact models, offering a practical path for deploying foundation models in real-world Earth Observation applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Text-free Graph Foundation Models: Rethinking Multi-Domain Graph Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22510v1)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have achieved great success in natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV). Their success largely stems from the ability to integrate multi-domain knowledge in pre-training and transfer it to target domains. Considering graph data, especially graphs without textual features, is ubiquitous in real-world applications such as social networks and recommendation systems, some researchers have attempted to extend this paradigm to the graph field, aiming to construct graph foundation models. However, unlike CV and NLP, there are huge gaps among the semantics and properties of graphs in different domains, while current works still adopt traditional contrastive pre-training strategies designed in the single-domain scenario, which regard contrastive samples from different domains as equivalent. From experimental investigations, we discovered that inherent domain-specific differences prevent these strategies from effectively absorbing knowledge from different domains to generate informative representations. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-domain pre-training and cross-domain transfer framework, namely MDGCL.In the pre-training stage, we design a contrastive learning strategy to substantially recognize and capture domain differences, and introduce domain tokens to encode domain-level global information. In the downstream stage, we introduce a domain attention mechanism to enable fine-grained domain knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets have demonstrated that our method outperforms state-of-the-art significantly, with the maximum improvement of 19.33\% on accuracy and 19.13\% on Macro-F1 score.</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures |

However, they face challenges such as low computational efficiency and limited interpretability, especially when dealing with large-scale remote sensing images. To overcome these, we draw inspiration from heat conduction, a physical process modeling local heat diffusion. Building on this idea, we are the first to explore the potential of using the parallel computing model of heat conduction to simulate the local region correlations in high-resolution remote sensing images, and introduce RS-vHeat, an efficient multi-modal remote sensing foundation model. Specifically, RS-vHeat 1) applies the Heat Conduction Operator (HCO) with a complexity of $O(N^{1.5})$ and a global receptive field, reducing computational overhead while capturing remote sensing object structure information to guide heat diffusion; 2) learns the frequency distribution representations of various scenes through a self-supervised strategy based on frequency domain hierarchical masking and multi-domain reconstruction; 3) significantly improves efficiency and performance over state-of-the-art techniques across 4 tasks and 10 datasets. Compared to attention-based remote sensing foundation models, we reduce memory usage by 84\%, FLOPs by 24\% and improves throughput by 2.7 times. The code will be made publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 8 figures and 10 tables</p></details> |

However, a key hurdle in achieving this goal lies in the robots' ability to manipulate objects in their unstructured surrounding environments according to different tasks. The learning-based approach is considered an effective way to address generalization. The impressive performance of foundation models in the fields of computer vision and natural language suggests the potential of embedding foundation models into manipulation tasks as a viable path toward achieving general manipulation capability. However, we believe achieving general manipulation capability requires an overarching framework akin to auto driving. This framework should encompass multiple functional modules, with different foundation models assuming distinct roles in facilitating general manipulation capability. This survey focuses on the contributions of foundation models to robot learning for manipulation. We propose a comprehensive framework and detail how foundation models can address challenges in each module of the framework. What's more, we examine current approaches, outline challenges, suggest future research directions, and identify potential risks associated with integrating foundation models into this domain.</p></details> |  |
| **[Machine learning of microstructure--property relationships in materials leveraging microstructure representation from foundational vision transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18637v2)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning of microstructure--property relationships from data is an emerging approach in computational materials science. Most existing machine learning efforts focus on the development of task-specific models for each microstructure--property relationship. We propose utilizing pre-trained foundational vision transformers for the extraction of task-agnostic microstructure features and subsequent light-weight machine learning of a microstructure-dependent property. We demonstrate our approach with pre-trained state-of-the-art vision transformers (CLIP, DINOv2, SAM) in two case studies on machine-learning: (i) elastic modulus of two-phase microstructures based on simulations data; and (ii) Vicker's hardness of Ni-base and Co-base superalloys based on experimental data published in literature. Our results show the potential of foundational vision transformers for robust microstructure representation and efficient machine learning of microstructure--property relationships without the need for expensive task-specific training or fine-tuning of bespoke deep learning models.</p></details> |  |
| **[How do Foundation Models Compare to Skeleton-Based Approaches for Gesture Recognition in Human-Robot Interaction?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20795v1)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gestures enable non-verbal human-robot communication, especially in noisy environments like agile production. Traditional deep learning-based gesture recognition relies on task-specific architectures using images, videos, or skeletal pose estimates as input. Meanwhile, Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) with their strong generalization abilities offer potential to reduce system complexity by replacing dedicated task-specific modules. This study investigates adapting such models for dynamic, full-body gesture recognition, comparing V-JEPA (a state-of-the-art VFM), Gemini Flash 2.0 (a multimodal VLM), and HD-GCN (a top-performing skeleton-based approach). We introduce NUGGET, a dataset tailored for human-robot communication in intralogistics environments, to evaluate the different gesture recognition approaches. In our experiments, HD-GCN achieves best performance, but V-JEPA comes close with a simple, task-specific classification head - thus paving a possible way towards reducing system complexity, by using it as a shared multi-task model. In contrast, Gemini struggles to differentiate gestures based solely on textual descriptions in the zero-shot setting, highlighting the need of further research on suitable input representations for gestures.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey of AI for Materials Science: Foundation Models, LLM Agents, Datasets, and Tools](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20743v1)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models (FMs) are catalyzing a transformative shift in materials science (MatSci) by enabling scalable, general-purpose, and multimodal AI systems for scientific discovery. Unlike traditional machine learning models, which are typically narrow in scope and require task-specific engineering, FMs offer cross-domain generalization and exhibit emergent capabilities. Their versatility is especially well-suited to materials science, where research challenges span diverse data types and scales. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of foundation models, agentic systems, datasets, and computational tools supporting this growing field. We introduce a task-driven taxonomy encompassing six broad application areas: data extraction, interpretation and Q\&A; atomistic simulation; property prediction; materials structure, design and discovery; process planning, discovery, and optimization; and multiscale modeling. We discuss recent advances in both unimodal and multimodal FMs, as well as emerging large language model (LLM) agents. Furthermore, we review standardized datasets, open-source tools, and autonomous experimental platforms that collectively fuel the development and integration of FMs into research workflows. We assess the early successes of foundation models and identify persistent limitations, including challenges in generalizability, interpretability, data imbalance, safety concerns, and limited multimodal fusion. Finally, we articulate future research directions centered on scalable pretraining, continual learning, data governance, and trustworthiness.</p></details> |  |
| **[IRanker: Towards Ranking Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21638v1)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ranking tasks are ubiquitous, encompassing applications such as recommendation systems, LLM routing, and item re-ranking. We propose to unify these tasks using a single ranking foundation model (FM), as it eliminates the need for designing different models for each specific ranking task. However, unlike general supervision tasks in LLMs, ranking tasks do not have clear labels for supervision, posing great challenges to developing a ranking FM. To overcome these challenges, we propose IRanker, a ranking FM framework with reinforcement learning (RL) and iterative decoding. Our insight is to decompose the complex ranking task into an iterative decoding process that eliminates the worst candidate from the candidate pool step by step, which significantly reduces the output combinatorial space and better utilizes the limited context length during RL training. We meticulously train and comprehensively evaluate an IRanker-3B model on nine datasets across three scenarios: recommendation, routing, and passage ranking. The results show that a single IRanker-3B achieves state-of-the-art results on several datasets compared to models of similar size, and even surpasses the performance of larger models on certain datasets. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our RL design and the robustness of the iterative mechanism across different LLM sizes. Moreover, we conducted both in-domain and out-of-domain zero-shot generalization experiments, which showed that IRanker-3B achieved good generalization on in-domain ranking tasks compared to the base LLM by at least 5% improvement. Surprisingly, on out-of-domain generic LLM tasks, IRanker-3B outperformed the base model by at least 9% on GSM8K, IFEval, and MathQA. In addition, the thoughts generated by IRanker-3B during training could further enhance zero-shot LLM performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[FluoroSAM: A Language-promptable Foundation Model for Flexible X-ray Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08059v3)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language promptable X-ray image segmentation would enable greater flexibility for human-in-the-loop workflows in diagnostic and interventional precision medicine. Prior efforts have contributed task-specific models capable of solving problems within a narrow scope, but expanding to broader use requires additional data, annotations, and training time. Recently, language-aligned foundation models (LFMs) -- machine learning models trained on large amounts of highly variable image and text data thus enabling broad applicability -- have emerged as promising tools for automated image analysis. Existing foundation models for medical image analysis focus on scenarios and modalities where large, richly annotated datasets are available. However, the X-ray imaging modality features highly variable image appearance and applications, from diagnostic chest X-rays to interventional fluoroscopy, with varying availability of data. To pave the way toward an LFM for comprehensive and language-aligned analysis of arbitrary medical X-ray images, we introduce FluoroSAM, a language-promptable variant of the Segment Anything Model, trained from scratch on 3M synthetic X-ray images from a wide variety of human anatomies, imaging geometries, and viewing angles. These include pseudo-ground truth masks for 128 organ types and 464 tools with associated text descriptions. FluoroSAM is capable of segmenting myriad anatomical structures and tools based on natural language prompts, thanks to the novel incorporation of vector quantization (VQ) of text embeddings in the training process. We demonstrate FluoroSAM's performance quantitatively on real X-ray images and showcase on several applications how FluoroSAM is a key enabler for rich human-machine interaction in the X-ray image acquisition and analysis context.

While foundation models have shown promise, they often lack the flexibility to reason about places, which are context-rich regions spanning different spatial granularities. We propose PlaceFM, a spatial foundation model that captures place representations using a training-free graph condensation method. PlaceFM condenses a nationwide POI graph built from integrated Foursquare and OpenStreetMap data in the U.S., generating general-purpose embeddings of places. These embeddings can be seamlessly integrated into geolocation data pipelines to support a wide range of downstream tasks. Without requiring pretraining, PlaceFM offers a scalable and adaptable solution for multi-scale geospatial analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Behavior Foundation Model: Towards Next-Generation Whole-Body Control System of Humanoid Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20487v1)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humanoid robots are drawing significant attention as versatile platforms for complex motor control, human-robot interaction, and general-purpose physical intelligence. However, achieving efficient whole-body control (WBC) in humanoids remains a fundamental challenge due to sophisticated dynamics, underactuation, and diverse task requirements. While learning-based controllers have shown promise for complex tasks, their reliance on labor-intensive and costly retraining for new scenarios limits real-world applicability. To address these limitations, behavior(al) foundation models (BFMs) have emerged as a new paradigm that leverages large-scale pretraining to learn reusable primitive skills and behavioral priors, enabling zero-shot or rapid adaptation to a wide range of downstream tasks. In this paper, we present a comprehensive overview of BFMs for humanoid WBC, tracing their development across diverse pre-training pipelines. Furthermore, we discuss real-world applications, current limitations, urgent challenges, and future opportunities, positioning BFMs as a key approach toward scalable and general-purpose humanoid intelligence. Finally, we provide a curated and long-term list of BFM papers and projects to facilitate more subsequent research, which is available at https://github.com/yuanmingqi/awesome-bfm-papers.</p></details> | 19 pages, 8 figures |

Integrating such multimodal data provides unprecedented insights into cellular identity, regulatory processes, and disease mechanisms. However, it remains challenging, as current methods often rely on selecting highly variable genes or peaks during preprocessing, which may inadvertently discard crucial biological information. Here, we present scMamba, a foundation model designed to integrate single-cell multi-omics data without the need for prior feature selection while preserving genomic positional information. scMamba introduces a patch-based cell tokenization strategy that treats genomics regions as words (tokens) and cells as sentences. Building upon the concept of state space duality, scMamba distills rich biological insights from high-dimensional, sparse single-cell multi-omics data. Additionally, our novel contrastive learning approach, enhanced with cosine similarity regularization, enables superior alignment across omics layers compared to traditional methods. Systematic benchmarking across multiple datasets demonstrates that scMamba significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in preserving biological variation, aligning omics layers, and enhancing key downstream tasks such as clustering, cell type annotation, and trajectory inference. Our findings position scMamba as a powerful tool for large-scale single-cell multi-omics integration, capable of handling large-scale atlases and advancing biological discovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Novel Large Vision Foundation Model (LVFM)-based Approach for Generating High-Resolution Canopy Height Maps in Plantations for Precision Forestry Management](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20388v1)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate, cost-effective monitoring of plantation aboveground biomass (AGB) is crucial for supporting local livelihoods and carbon sequestration initiatives like the China Certified Emission Reduction (CCER) program. High-resolution canopy height maps (CHMs) are essential for this, but standard lidar-based methods are expensive. While deep learning with RGB imagery offers an alternative, accurately extracting canopy height features remains challenging. To address this, we developed a novel model for high-resolution CHM generation using a Large Vision Foundation Model (LVFM). Our model integrates a feature extractor, a self-supervised feature enhancement module to preserve spatial details, and a height estimator. Tested in Beijing's Fangshan District using 1-meter Google Earth imagery, our model outperformed existing methods, including conventional CNNs. It achieved a mean absolute error of 0.09 m, a root mean square error of 0.24 m, and a correlation of 0.78 against lidar-based CHMs. The resulting CHMs enabled over 90% success in individual tree detection, high accuracy in AGB estimation, and effective tracking of plantation growth, demonstrating strong generalization to non-training areas. This approach presents a promising, scalable tool for evaluating carbon sequestration in both plantations and natural forests.</p></details> |  |
| **[A foundation model with multi-variate parallel attention to generate neuronal activity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20354v1)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning from multi-variate time-series with heterogeneous channel configurations remains a fundamental challenge for deep neural networks (DNNs), particularly in clinical domains such as intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG), where channel setups vary widely across subjects. In this work, we introduce multi-variate parallel attention (MVPA), a novel self-attention mechanism that disentangles content, temporal, and spatial attention, enabling flexible, generalizable, and efficient modeling of time-series data with varying channel counts and configurations. We use MVPA to build MVPFormer, a generative foundation model for human electrophysiology, trained to predict the evolution of iEEG signals across diverse subjects. To support this and future effort by the community, we release the SWEC iEEG dataset, the largest publicly available iEEG dataset to date, comprising nearly 10,000 hours of recordings from heterogeneous clinical sources. MVPFormer leverages MVPA to achieve strong generalization across subjects, demonstrating expert-level performance in seizure detection and outperforming state-of-the-art Transformer baselines on our SWEC, the MAYO, and the FNUSA dataset. We further validate MVPA on standard time-series forecasting and classification tasks, where it matches or exceeds existing attention-based models. Together, our contributions establish MVPA as a general-purpose attention mechanism for heterogeneous time-series and MVPFormer as the first open-source, open-weights, and open-data iEEG foundation model with state-of-the-art clinical performance.

| **[COIN: Uncertainty-Guarding Selective Question Answering for Foundation Models with Provable Risk Guarantees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20178v1)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Uncertainty quantification (UQ) for foundation models is essential to identify and mitigate potential hallucinations in automatically generated text. However, heuristic UQ approaches lack formal guarantees for key metrics such as the false discovery rate (FDR) in selective prediction. Previous work adopts the split conformal prediction (SCP) framework to ensure desired coverage of admissible answers by constructing prediction sets, but these sets often contain incorrect candidates, limiting their practical utility. To address this, we propose COIN, an uncertainty-guarding selection framework that calibrates statistically valid thresholds to filter a single generated answer per question under user-specified FDR constraints. COIN estimates the empirical error rate on a calibration set and applies confidence interval methods such as Clopper-Pearson to establish a high-probability upper bound on the true error rate (i.e., FDR). This enables the selection of the largest uncertainty threshold that ensures FDR control on test data while significantly increasing sample retention. We demonstrate COIN's robustness in risk control, strong test-time power in retaining admissible answers, and predictive efficiency under limited calibration data across both general and multimodal text generation tasks. Furthermore, we show that employing alternative upper bound constructions and UQ strategies can further boost COIN's power performance, which underscores its extensibility and adaptability to diverse application scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Foundational individual Mobility Prediction Model based on Open-Source Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16553v2)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely applied to domain-specific tasks due to their massive general knowledge and remarkable inference capacities. Current studies on LLMs have shown immense potential in applying LLMs to model individual mobility prediction problems. However, most LLM-based mobility prediction models only train on specific datasets or use single well-designed prompts, leading to difficulty in adapting to different cities and users with diverse contexts. To fill these gaps, this paper proposes a unified fine-tuning framework to train a foundational open source LLM-based mobility prediction model. We conducted extensive experiments on six real-world mobility datasets to validate the proposed model. The results showed that the proposed model achieved the best performance in prediction accuracy and transferability over state-of-the-art models based on deep learning and LLMs.</p></details> |  |
