| **[Online Micro-gesture Recognition Using Data Augmentation and Spatial-Temporal Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09512v2)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce the latest solution developed by our team, HFUT-VUT, for the Micro-gesture Online Recognition track of the IJCAI 2025 MiGA Challenge. The Micro-gesture Online Recognition task is a highly challenging problem that aims to locate the temporal positions and recognize the categories of multiple micro-gesture instances in untrimmed videos. Compared to traditional temporal action detection, this task places greater emphasis on distinguishing between micro-gesture categories and precisely identifying the start and end times of each instance. Moreover, micro-gestures are typically spontaneous human actions, with greater differences than those found in other human actions. To address these challenges, we propose hand-crafted data augmentation and spatial-temporal attention to enhance the model's ability to classify and localize micro-gestures more accurately. Our solution achieved an F1 score of 38.03, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art by 37.9%. As a result, our method ranked first in the Micro-gesture Online Recognition track.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |

We introduce a toolkit, R\'ECITKIT for supporting spatial data narratives in head-mounted display (HMD) environments. The toolkit allows developers to create interactive dashboards, tag data attributes as spatial assets to 3D models and immersive scenes, generate text and audio narratives, enabling dynamic filtering, and hierarchical drill-down data discoverability. To demonstrate the utility of the toolkit, we developed Charles Minard's historical flow map of Napoleon's 1812 campaign in Russia as an immersive experience on Apple Vision Pro. We conducted a preliminary evaluation with 21 participants that comprised two groups: developers, who evaluated the toolkit by authoring spatial stories and consumers, who provided feedback on the Minard app's narrative clarity, interaction design, and engagement. Feedback highlighted how spatial interactions and guided narration enhanced insight formation, with participants emphasizing the benefits of physical manipulation (e.g., gaze, pinch, navigation) for understanding temporal and geographic data. Participants also identified opportunities for future enhancement, including improved interaction affordance visibility, customizable storytelling logic, and integration of contextual assets to support user orientation. These findings contribute to the broader discourse on toolkit-driven approaches to immersive data storytelling across domains such as education, decision support, and exploratory analytics.</p></details> | 5 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Mimicking associative learning of rats via a neuromorphic robot in open field maze using spatial cell models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18460v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data-driven Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches have exhibited remarkable prowess across various cognitive tasks using extensive training data. However, the reliance on large datasets and neural networks presents challenges such as highpower consumption and limited adaptability, particularly in SWaP-constrained applications like planetary exploration. To address these issues, we propose enhancing the autonomous capabilities of intelligent robots by emulating the associative learning observed in animals. Associative learning enables animals to adapt to their environment by memorizing concurrent events. By replicating this mechanism, neuromorphic robots can navigate dynamic environments autonomously, learning from interactions to optimize performance. This paper explores the emulation of associative learning in rodents using neuromorphic robots within open-field maze environments, leveraging insights from spatial cells such as place and grid cells. By integrating these models, we aim to enable online associative learning for spatial tasks in real-time scenarios, bridging the gap between biological spatial cognition and robotics for advancements in autonomous systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[CoMPaSS: Enhancing Spatial Understanding in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13195v2)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models excel at generating photorealistic images but often fail to render accurate spatial relationships. We identify two core issues underlying this common failure: 1) the ambiguous nature of data concerning spatial relationships in existing datasets, and 2) the inability of current text encoders to accurately interpret the spatial semantics of input descriptions. We propose CoMPaSS, a versatile framework that enhances spatial understanding in T2I models. It first addresses data ambiguity with the Spatial Constraints-Oriented Pairing (SCOP) data engine, which curates spatially-accurate training data via principled constraints. To leverage these priors, CoMPaSS also introduces the Token ENcoding ORdering (TENOR) module, which preserves crucial token ordering information lost by text encoders, thereby reinforcing the prompt's linguistic structure. Extensive experiments on four popular T2I models (UNet and MMDiT-based) show CoMPaSS sets a new state of the art on key spatial benchmarks, with substantial relative gains on VISOR (+98%), T2I-CompBench Spatial (+67%), and GenEval Position (+131%). Code is available at https://github.com/blurgyy/CoMPaSS.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 12 figures. Accepted to ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[CleverDistiller: Simple and Spatially Consistent Cross-modal Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09878v2)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision foundation models (VFMs) such as DINO have led to a paradigm shift in 2D camera-based perception towards extracting generalized features to support many downstream tasks. Recent works introduce self-supervised cross-modal knowledge distillation (KD) as a way to transfer these powerful generalization capabilities into 3D LiDAR-based models. However, they either rely on highly complex distillation losses, pseudo-semantic maps, or limit KD to features useful for semantic segmentation only. In this work, we propose CleverDistiller, a self-supervised, cross-modal 2D-to-3D KD framework introducing a set of simple yet effective design choices: Unlike contrastive approaches relying on complex loss design choices, our method employs a direct feature similarity loss in combination with a multi layer perceptron (MLP) projection head to allow the 3D network to learn complex semantic dependencies throughout the projection. Crucially, our approach does not depend on pseudo-semantic maps, allowing for direct knowledge transfer from a VFM without explicit semantic supervision. Additionally, we introduce the auxiliary self-supervised spatial task of occupancy prediction to enhance the semantic knowledge, obtained from a VFM through KD, with 3D spatial reasoning capabilities. Experiments on standard autonomous driving benchmarks for 2D-to-3D KD demonstrate that CleverDistiller achieves state-of-the-art performance in both semantic segmentation and 3D object detection (3DOD) by up to 10% mIoU, especially when fine tuning on really low data amounts, showing the effectiveness of our simple yet powerful KD strategy</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to BMVC 2025</p></details> |
| **[TinyGiantVLM: A Lightweight Vision-Language Architecture for Spatial Reasoning under Resource Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17595v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning about fine-grained spatial relationships in warehouse-scale environments poses a significant challenge for existing vision-language models (VLMs), which often struggle to comprehend 3D layouts, object arrangements, and multimodal cues in real-world industrial settings. In this paper, we present TinyGiantVLM, a lightweight and modular two-stage framework designed for physical spatial reasoning, distinguishing itself from traditional geographic reasoning in complex logistics scenes. Our approach encodes both global and region-level features from RGB and depth modalities using pretrained visual backbones. To effectively handle the complexity of high-modality inputs and diverse question types, we incorporate a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) fusion module, which dynamically combines spatial representations to support downstream reasoning tasks and improve convergence. Training is conducted in a two-phase strategy: the first phase focuses on generating free-form answers to enhance spatial reasoning ability, while the second phase uses normalized answers for evaluation. Evaluated on Track 3 of the AI City Challenge 2025, our 64M-parameter base model achieved 5th place on the leaderboard with a score of 66.8861, demonstrating strong performance in bridging visual perception and spatial understanding in industrial environments. We further present an 80M-parameter variant with expanded MoE capacity, which demonstrates improved performance on spatial reasoning tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) Workshops, 2025</p></details> |
| **[Neural Posterior Estimation for Cataloging Astronomical Images with Spatially Varying Backgrounds and Point Spread Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00156v2)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural posterior estimation (NPE), a type of amortized variational inference, is a computationally efficient means of constructing probabilistic catalogs of light sources from astronomical images. To date, NPE has not been used to perform inference in models with spatially varying covariates. However, ground-based astronomical images have spatially varying sky backgrounds and point spread functions (PSFs), and accounting for this variation is essential for constructing accurate catalogs of imaged light sources. In this work, we introduce a method of performing NPE with spatially varying backgrounds and PSFs. In this method, we generate synthetic catalogs and semi-synthetic images for these catalogs using randomly sampled PSF and background estimates from existing surveys. Using this data, we train a neural network, which takes an astronomical image and representations of its background and PSF as input, to output a probabilistic catalog. Our experiments with Sloan Digital Sky Survey data demonstrate the effectiveness of NPE in the presence of spatially varying backgrounds and PSFs for light source detection, star/galaxy separation, and flux measurement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the Astronomical Journal</p></details> |
| **[Neural Proteomics Fields for Super-resolved Spatial Proteomics Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17389v1)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial proteomics maps protein distributions in tissues, providing transformative insights for life sciences. However, current sequencing-based technologies suffer from low spatial resolution, and substantial inter-tissue variability in protein expression further compromises the performance of existing molecular data prediction methods. In this work, we introduce the novel task of spatial super-resolution for sequencing-based spatial proteomics (seq-SP) and, to the best of our knowledge, propose the first deep learning model for this task--Neural Proteomics Fields (NPF). NPF formulates seq-SP as a protein reconstruction problem in continuous space by training a dedicated network for each tissue. The model comprises a Spatial Modeling Module, which learns tissue-specific protein spatial distributions, and a Morphology Modeling Module, which extracts tissue-specific morphological features. Furthermore, to facilitate rigorous evaluation, we establish an open-source benchmark dataset, Pseudo-Visium SP, for this task. Experimental results demonstrate that NPF achieves state-of-the-art performance with fewer learnable parameters, underscoring its potential for advancing spatial proteomics research. Our code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/Bokai-Zhao/NPF.</p></details> | MICCAI 2025 |
| **[Unsupervised Urban Tree Biodiversity Mapping from Street-Level Imagery Using Spatially-Aware Visual Clustering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13814v3)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban tree biodiversity is critical for climate resilience, ecological stability, and livability in cities, yet most municipalities lack detailed knowledge of their canopies. Field-based inventories provide reliable estimates of Shannon and Simpson diversity but are costly and time-consuming, while supervised AI methods require labeled data that often fail to generalize across regions. We introduce an unsupervised clustering framework that integrates visual embeddings from street-level imagery with spatial planting patterns to estimate biodiversity without labels. Applied to eight North American cities, the method recovers genus-level diversity patterns with high fidelity, achieving low Wasserstein distances to ground truth for Shannon and Simpson indices and preserving spatial autocorrelation. This scalable, fine-grained approach enables biodiversity mapping in cities lacking detailed inventories and offers a pathway for continuous, low-cost monitoring to support equitable access to greenery and adaptive management of urban ecosystems.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 7 figures, Nature Format</p></details> |
| **[SIFThinker: Spatially-Aware Image Focus for Visual Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06259v3)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) still face significant challenges in complex visual tasks (e.g., spatial understanding, fine-grained perception). Prior methods have tried to incorporate visual reasoning, however, they fail to leverage attention correction with spatial cues to iteratively refine their focus on prompt-relevant regions. In this paper, we introduce SIFThinker, a spatially-aware "think-with-images" framework that mimics human visual perception. Specifically, SIFThinker enables attention correcting and image region focusing by interleaving depth-enhanced bounding boxes and natural language. Our contributions are twofold: First, we introduce a reverse-expansion-forward-inference strategy that facilitates the generation of interleaved image-text chains of thought for process-level supervision, which in turn leads to the construction of the SIF-50K dataset. Besides, we propose GRPO-SIF, a reinforced training paradigm that integrates depth-informed visual grounding into a unified reasoning pipeline, teaching the model to dynamically correct and focus on prompt-relevant regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SIFThinker outperforms state-of-the-art methods in spatial understanding and fine-grained visual perception, while maintaining strong general capabilities, highlighting the effectiveness of our method.

| **[SpecGen: Neural Spectral BRDF Generation via Spectral-Spatial Tri-plane Aggregation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17316v1)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthesizing spectral images across different wavelengths is essential for photorealistic rendering. Unlike conventional spectral uplifting methods that convert RGB images into spectral ones, we introduce SpecGen, a novel method that generates spectral bidirectional reflectance distribution functions (BRDFs) from a single RGB image of a sphere. This enables spectral image rendering under arbitrary illuminations and shapes covered by the corresponding material. A key challenge in spectral BRDF generation is the scarcity of measured spectral BRDF data. To address this, we propose the Spectral-Spatial Tri-plane Aggregation (SSTA) network, which models reflectance responses across wavelengths and incident-outgoing directions, allowing the training strategy to leverage abundant RGB BRDF data to enhance spectral BRDF generation. Experiments show that our method accurately reconstructs spectral BRDFs from limited spectral data and surpasses state-of-the-art methods in hyperspectral image reconstruction, achieving an improvement of 8 dB in PSNR. Codes and data will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial-Temporal Human-Object Interaction Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17270v1)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a new instance-level human-object interaction detection task on videos called ST-HOID, which aims to distinguish fine-grained human-object interactions (HOIs) and the trajectories of subjects and objects. It is motivated by the fact that HOI is crucial for human-centric video content understanding. To solve ST-HOID, we propose a novel method consisting of an object trajectory detection module and an interaction reasoning module. Furthermore, we construct the first dataset named VidOR-HOID for ST-HOID evaluation, which contains 10,831 spatial-temporal HOI instances. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our method. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the baselines generated by the state-of-the-art methods of image human-object interaction detection, video visual relation detection and video human-object interaction recognition.</p></details> |  |
| **[From reactive to cognitive: brain-inspired spatial intelligence for embodied agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17198v1)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial cognition enables adaptive goal-directed behavior by constructing internal models of space. Robust biological systems consolidate spatial knowledge into three interconnected forms: \textit{landmarks} for salient cues, \textit{route knowledge} for movement trajectories, and \textit{survey knowledge} for map-like representations. While recent advances in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled visual-language reasoning in embodied agents, these efforts lack structured spatial memory and instead operate reactively, limiting their generalization and adaptability in complex real-world environments. Here we present Brain-inspired Spatial Cognition for Navigation (BSC-Nav), a unified framework for constructing and leveraging structured spatial memory in embodied agents. BSC-Nav builds allocentric cognitive maps from egocentric trajectories and contextual cues, and dynamically retrieves spatial knowledge aligned with semantic goals. Integrated with powerful MLLMs, BSC-Nav achieves state-of-the-art efficacy and efficiency across diverse navigation tasks, demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization, and supports versatile embodied behaviors in the real physical world, offering a scalable and biologically grounded path toward general-purpose spatial intelligence.</p></details> | 40 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Beyond Play and Pause: Turning GPT-4o Spatial Weakness into a Strength for In-Depth Interactive Video Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17160v1)** | 2025-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional video-based learning remains passive, offering limited opportunities for users to engage dynamically with content. While current AI-powered tools offer transcription and summarization, they lack real-time, region-specific interaction capabilities. This paper introduces Untwist, an AI-driven system that enables interactive video learning by allowing users to ask questions about the entire video or specific regions using a bounding box, receiving context-aware, multimodal responses. By integrating GPT APIs with Computer Vision techniques, Untwist extracts, processes, and structures video content to enhance comprehension. Our approach addresses GPT-4o spatial weakness by leveraging annotated frames instead of raw coordinate data, significantly improving accuracy in localizing and interpreting video content. This paper describes the system architecture, including video pre-processing and real-time interaction, and outlines how Untwist can transform passive video consumption into an interactive, AI-driven learning experience with the potential to enhance engagement and comprehension.</p></details> |  |
| **[CE-RS-SBCIT A Novel Channel Enhanced Hybrid CNN Transformer with Residual, Spatial, and Boundary-Aware Learning for Brain Tumor MRI Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17128v1)** | 2025-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Brain tumors remain among the most lethal human diseases, where early detection and accurate classification are critical for effective diagnosis and treatment planning. Although deep learning-based computer-aided diagnostic (CADx) systems have shown remarkable progress. However, conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers face persistent challenges, including high computational cost, sensitivity to minor contrast variations, structural heterogeneity, and texture inconsistencies in MRI data. Therefore, a novel hybrid framework, CE-RS-SBCIT, is introduced, integrating residual and spatial learning-based CNNs with transformer-driven modules. The proposed framework exploits local fine-grained and global contextual cues through four core innovations: (i) a smoothing and boundary-based CNN-integrated Transformer (SBCIT), (ii) tailored residual and spatial learning CNNs, (iii) a channel enhancement (CE) strategy, and (iv) a novel spatial attention mechanism. The developed SBCIT employs stem convolution and contextual interaction transformer blocks with systematic smoothing and boundary operations, enabling efficient global feature modeling. Moreover, Residual and spatial CNNs, enhanced by auxiliary transfer-learned feature maps, enrich the representation space, while the CE module amplifies discriminative channels and mitigates redundancy. Furthermore, the spatial attention mechanism selectively emphasizes subtle contrast and textural variations across tumor classes. Extensive evaluation on challenging MRI datasets from Kaggle and Figshare, encompassing glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumors, and healthy controls, demonstrates superior performance, achieving 98.30% accuracy, 98.08% sensitivity, 98.25% F1-score, and 98.43% precision.</p></details> | 37 Pages, 12 Figures |
| **[SSG-Dit: A Spatial Signal Guided Framework for Controllable Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17062v1)** | 2025-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Controllable video generation aims to synthesize video content that aligns precisely with user-provided conditions, such as text descriptions and initial images. However, a significant challenge persists in this domain: existing models often struggle to maintain strong semantic consistency, frequently generating videos that deviate from the nuanced details specified in the prompts. To address this issue, we propose SSG-DiT (Spatial Signal Guided Diffusion Transformer), a novel and efficient framework for high-fidelity controllable video generation. Our approach introduces a decoupled two-stage process. The first stage, Spatial Signal Prompting, generates a spatially aware visual prompt by leveraging the rich internal representations of a pre-trained multi-modal model. This prompt, combined with the original text, forms a joint condition that is then injected into a frozen video DiT backbone via our lightweight and parameter-efficient SSG-Adapter. This unique design, featuring a dual-branch attention mechanism, allows the model to simultaneously harness its powerful generative priors while being precisely steered by external spatial signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SSG-DiT achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing models on multiple key metrics in the VBench benchmark, particularly in spatial relationship control and overall consistency.</p></details> |  |
| **[GraphCoT-VLA: A 3D Spatial-Aware Reasoning Vision-Language-Action Model for Robotic Manipulation with Ambiguous Instructions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07650v2)** | 2025-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language-action models have emerged as a crucial paradigm in robotic manipulation. However, existing VLA models exhibit notable limitations in handling ambiguous language instructions and unknown environmental states. Furthermore, their perception is largely constrained to static two-dimensional observations, lacking the capability to model three-dimensional interactions between the robot and its environment. To address these challenges, this paper proposes GraphCoT-VLA, an efficient end-to-end model. To enhance the model's ability to interpret ambiguous instructions and improve task planning, we design a structured Chain-of-Thought reasoning module that integrates high-level task understanding and planning, failed task feedback, and low-level imaginative reasoning about future object positions and robot actions. Additionally, we construct a real-time updatable 3D Pose-Object graph, which captures the spatial configuration of robot joints and the topological relationships between objects in 3D space, enabling the model to better understand and manipulate their interactions. We further integrates a dropout hybrid reasoning strategy to achieve efficient control outputs. Experimental results across multiple real-world robotic tasks demonstrate that GraphCoT-VLA significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of task success rate and response speed, exhibiting strong generalization and robustness in open environments and under uncertain instructions.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Baltimore Atlas: FreqWeaver Adapter for Semi-supervised Ultra-high Spatial Resolution Land Cover Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15565v2)** | 2025-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ultra-high Spatial Resolution (UHSR) Land Cover Classification is increasingly important for urban analysis, enabling fine-scale planning, ecological monitoring, and infrastructure management. It identifies land cover types on sub-meter remote sensing imagery, capturing details such as building outlines, road networks, and distinct boundaries. However, most existing methods focus on 1 m imagery and rely heavily on large-scale annotations, while UHSR data remain scarce and difficult to annotate, limiting practical applicability. To address these challenges, we introduce Baltimore Atlas, a UHSR land cover classification framework that reduces reliance on large-scale training data and delivers high-accuracy results. Baltimore Atlas builds on three key ideas: (1) Baltimore Atlas Dataset, a 0.3 m resolution dataset based on aerial imagery of Baltimore City; (2) FreqWeaver Adapter, a parameter-efficient adapter that transfers SAM2 to this domain, leveraging foundation model knowledge to reduce training data needs while enabling fine-grained detail and structural modeling; (3) Uncertainty-Aware Teacher Student Framework, a semi-supervised framework that exploits unlabeled data to further reduce training dependence and improve generalization across diverse scenes. Using only 5.96% of total model parameters, our approach achieves a 1.78% IoU improvement over existing parameter-efficient tuning strategies and a 3.44% IoU gain compared to state-of-the-art high-resolution remote sensing segmentation methods on the Baltimore Atlas Dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[RF-PGS: Fully-structured Spatial Wireless Channel Representation with Planar Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16849v1)** | 2025-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the 6G era, the demand for higher system throughput and the implementation of emerging 6G technologies require large-scale antenna arrays and accurate spatial channel state information (Spatial-CSI). Traditional channel modeling approaches, such as empirical models, ray tracing, and measurement-based methods, face challenges in spatial resolution, efficiency, and scalability. Radiance field-based methods have emerged as promising alternatives but still suffer from geometric inaccuracy and costly supervision. This paper proposes RF-PGS, a novel framework that reconstructs high-fidelity radio propagation paths from only sparse path loss spectra. By introducing Planar Gaussians as geometry primitives with certain RF-specific optimizations, RF-PGS achieves dense, surface-aligned scene reconstruction in the first geometry training stage. In the subsequent Radio Frequency (RF) training stage, the proposed fully-structured radio radiance, combined with a tailored multi-view loss, accurately models radio propagation behavior. Compared to prior radiance field methods, RF-PGS significantly improves reconstruction accuracy, reduces training costs, and enables efficient representation of wireless channels, offering a practical solution for scalable 6G Spatial-CSI modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 16 figures, in submission to IEEE journal</p></details> |
| **[MuST2-Learn: Multi-view Spatial-Temporal-Type Learning for Heterogeneous Municipal Service Time Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16503v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Non-emergency municipal services such as city 311 systems have been widely implemented across cities in Canada and the United States to enhance residents' quality of life. These systems enable residents to report issues, e.g., noise complaints, missed garbage collection, and potholes, via phone calls, mobile applications, or webpages. However, residents are often given limited information about when their service requests will be addressed, which can reduce transparency, lower resident satisfaction, and increase the number of follow-up inquiries. Predicting the service time for municipal service requests is challenging due to several complex factors: dynamic spatial-temporal correlations, underlying interactions among heterogeneous service request types, and high variation in service duration even within the same request category. In this work, we propose MuST2-Learn: a Multi-view Spatial-Temporal-Type Learning framework designed to address the aforementioned challenges by jointly modeling spatial, temporal, and service type dimensions. In detail, it incorporates an inter-type encoder to capture relationships among heterogeneous service request types and an intra-type variation encoder to model service time variation within homogeneous types. In addition, a spatiotemporal encoder is integrated to capture spatial and temporal correlations in each request type. The proposed framework is evaluated with extensive experiments using two real-world datasets. The results show that MuST2-Learn reduces mean absolute error by at least 32.5%, which outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to SIGSPATIAL 2025</p></details> |
| **[Lightweight and Fast Real-time Image Enhancement via Decomposition of the Spatial-aware Lookup Tables](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16121v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The image enhancement methods based on 3D lookup tables (3D LUTs) efficiently reduce both model size and runtime by interpolating pre-calculated values at the vertices. However, the 3D LUT methods have a limitation due to their lack of spatial information, as they convert color values on a point-by-point basis. Although spatial-aware 3D LUT methods address this limitation, they introduce additional modules that require a substantial number of parameters, leading to increased runtime as image resolution increases. To address this issue, we propose a method for generating image-adaptive LUTs by focusing on the redundant parts of the tables. Our efficient framework decomposes a 3D LUT into a linear sum of low-dimensional LUTs and employs singular value decomposition (SVD). Furthermore, we enhance the modules for spatial feature fusion to be more cache-efficient. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our model effectively decreases both the number of parameters and runtime while maintaining spatial awareness and performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[GUI Based Fuzzy Logic and Spatial Statistics for Unsupervised Microscopy Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15979v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Brightfield microscopy imaging of unstained live cells remains a persistent challenge due to low contrast, temporal changes in specimen phenotypes, irregular illumination, and the absence of training labels. While deep learning (DL) methods (e.g., Cellpose 3.0) achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, they require extensive labeled data and heavy computational resources, and they often fail under uneven illumination. We present the first unsupervised segmentation framework combining spatial standard deviation from local mean (SSDLM), fuzzy logic, adjusted variograms, Moran's I, and cumulative squared shift of nodal intensity (CSSNI) to address these limitations. Unlike deep learning models, our approach requires no annotations or retraining and operates through a user-friendly GUI tailored for non-programming users. The robustness and generality were validated on three datasets, including cross-domain data. We benchmark our method against 2023--2024 SOTA models, including Cellpose 3.0 and StarDist, using a dataset of unstained myoblast images. Our method achieves a significant improvement in segmentation performance, with an IoU increase of up to 48\% and statistically validated superiority ($p < 0.01$, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Expert evaluation from two biologists further supports the segmentation quality (Cohen's $\kappa > 0.75$). The proposed algorithm is lightweight, interpretable, and computationally efficient, offering a practical and effective alternative for cell segmentation in label-free microscopy. The code, the dataset, and the results are available for reproducibility*.</p></details> |  |
| **[A nonstationary spatial model of PM2.5 with localized transfer learning from numerical model output](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15978v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ambient air pollution measurements from regulatory monitoring networks are routinely used to support epidemiologic studies and environmental policy decision making. However, regulatory monitors are spatially sparse and preferentially located in areas with large populations. Numerical air pollution model output can be leveraged into the inference and prediction of air pollution data combining with measurements from monitors. Nonstationary covariance functions allow the model to adapt to spatial surfaces whose variability changes with location like air pollution data. In the paper, we employ localized covariance parameters learned from the numerical output model to knit together into a global nonstationary covariance, to incorporate in a fully Bayesian model. We model the nonstationary structure in a computationally efficient way to make the Bayesian model scalable.</p></details> |  |
| **[STGAtt: A Spatial-Temporal Unified Graph Attention Network for Traffic Flow Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16685v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and timely traffic flow forecasting is crucial for intelligent transportation systems. This paper presents a novel deep learning model, the Spatial-Temporal Unified Graph Attention Network (STGAtt). By leveraging a unified graph representation and an attention mechanism, STGAtt effectively captures complex spatial-temporal dependencies. Unlike methods relying on separate spatial and temporal dependency modeling modules, STGAtt directly models correlations within a Spatial-Temporal Unified Graph, dynamically weighing connections across both dimensions. To further enhance its capabilities, STGAtt partitions traffic flow observation signal into neighborhood subsets and employs a novel exchanging mechanism, enabling effective capture of both short-range and long-range correlations. Extensive experiments on the PEMS-BAY and SHMetro datasets demonstrate STGAtt's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines across various prediction horizons. Visualization of attention weights confirms STGAtt's ability to adapt to dynamic traffic patterns and capture long-range dependencies, highlighting its potential for real-world traffic flow forecasting applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Spatial-Temporal Dynamics in Event-based Facial Micro-Expression Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11988v2)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Micro-expression analysis has applications in domains such as Human-Robot Interaction and Driver Monitoring Systems. Accurately capturing subtle and fast facial movements remains difficult when relying solely on RGB cameras, due to limitations in temporal resolution and sensitivity to motion blur. Event cameras offer an alternative, with microsecond-level precision, high dynamic range, and low latency. However, public datasets featuring event-based recordings of Action Units are still scarce. In this work, we introduce a novel, preliminary multi-resolution and multi-modal micro-expression dataset recorded with synchronized RGB and event cameras under variable lighting conditions. Two baseline tasks are evaluated to explore the spatial-temporal dynamics of micro-expressions: Action Unit classification using Spiking Neural Networks (51.23\% accuracy with events vs. 23.12\% with RGB), and frame reconstruction using Conditional Variational Autoencoders, achieving SSIM = 0.8513 and PSNR = 26.89 dB with high-resolution event input. These promising results show that event-based data can be used for micro-expression recognition and frame reconstruction.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods lack spatial awareness capabilities, limiting their effectiveness in bridging visual plans to actionable control in complex environments. To address this problem, we propose Spatial Policy (SP), a unified spatial-aware visuomotor robotic manipulation framework via explicit spatial modeling and reasoning. Specifically, we first design a spatial-conditioned embodied video generation module to model spatially guided predictions through a spatial plan table. Then, we propose a spatial-based action prediction module to infer executable actions with coordination. Finally, we propose a spatial reasoning feedback policy to refine the spatial plan table via dual-stage replanning. Extensive experiments show that SP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a 33.0% average improvement over the best baseline. With an 86.7% average success rate across 11 diverse tasks, SP substantially enhances the practicality of embodied models for robotic control applications.

| **[FoleySpace: Vision-Aligned Binaural Spatial Audio Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12918v2)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, with the advancement of AIGC, deep learning-based video-to-audio (V2A) technology has garnered significant attention. However, existing research mostly focuses on mono audio generation that lacks spatial perception, while the exploration of binaural spatial audio generation technologies, which can provide a stronger sense of immersion, remains insufficient. To solve this problem, we propose FoleySpace, a framework for video-to-binaural audio generation that produces immersive and spatially consistent stereo sound guided by visual information. Specifically, we develop a sound source estimation method to determine the sound source 2D coordinates and depth in each video frame, and then employ a coordinate mapping mechanism to convert the 2D source positions into a 3D trajectory. This 3D trajectory, together with the monaural audio generated by a pre-trained V2A model, serves as a conditioning input for a diffusion model to generate spatially consistent binaural audio. To support the generation of dynamic sound fields, we constructed a training dataset based on recorded Head-Related Impulse Responses that includes various sound source movement scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches in spatial perception consistency, effectively enhancing the immersive quality of the audio-visual experience.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Linearity to Non-Linearity: How Masked Autoencoders Capture Spatial Correlations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15404v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) have emerged as a powerful pretraining technique for vision foundation models. Despite their effectiveness, they require extensive hyperparameter tuning (masking ratio, patch size, encoder/decoder layers) when applied to novel datasets. While prior theoretical works have analyzed MAEs in terms of their attention patterns and hierarchical latent variable models, the connection between MAE hyperparameters and performance on downstream tasks is relatively unexplored. This work investigates how MAEs learn spatial correlations in the input image. We analytically derive the features learned by a linear MAE and show that masking ratio and patch size can be used to select for features that capture short- and long-range spatial correlations. We extend this analysis to non-linear MAEs to show that MAE representations adapt to spatial correlations in the dataset, beyond second-order statistics. Finally, we discuss some insights on how to select MAE hyper-parameters in practice.</p></details> |  |
| **[Random Sampling over Spatial Range Joins](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15070v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial range joins have many applications, including geographic information systems, location-based social networking services, neuroscience, and visualization. However, joins incur not only expensive computational costs but also too large result sets. A practical and reasonable approach to alleviating these issues is to return random samples of the join results. Although this is promising and sufficient for many applications involving spatial range joins, efficiently computing random samples is not trivial. This is because we must obtain random join samples without running spatial range joins. We address this challenging problem for the first time and aim at designing a time- and space-efficient algorithm. First, we design two baseline algorithms that employ existing techniques for random sampling and show that they are not efficient. Then, we propose a new data structure that can deal with our problem in $\tilde{O}(n + m + t)$ expected time and $O(n+m)$ space, where $n$ and $m$ are the sizes of two point sets and $t$ is the required number of samples. We conduct extensive experiments using four real spatial datasets, and the results demonstrate that our algorithm is significantly faster than the baselines in most tests.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted version of our ICDE2025 paper</p></details> |

To address these challenges, we present TRUST-Planner, a topology-guided hierarchical planning framework for robust spatial-temporal obstacle avoidance. In the frontend, a dynamic enhanced visible probabilistic roadmap (DEV-PRM) is proposed to rapidly explore topological paths for global guidance. The backend utilizes a uniform terminal-free minimum control polynomial (UTF-MINCO) and dynamic distance field (DDF) to enable efficient predictive obstacle avoidance and fast parallel computation. Furthermore, an incremental multi-branch trajectory management framework is introduced to enable spatio-temporal topological decision-making, while efficiently leveraging historical information to reduce replanning time. Simulation results show that TRUST-Planner outperforms baseline competitors, achieving a 96\% success rate and millisecond-level computation efficiency in tested complex environments. Real-world experiments further validate the feasibility and practicality of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |

Unlike traditional mono sound, spatial audio offers a more realistic and immersive auditory experience. Despite notable progress in the field, there remains a lack of comprehensive surveys that systematically organize and analyze these methods and their underlying technologies. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of spatial audio and systematically review recent literature in the area. To address this, we chronologically outlining existing work related to spatial audio and categorize these studies based on input-output representations, as well as generation and understanding tasks, thereby summarizing various research aspects of spatial audio. In addition, we review related datasets, evaluation metrics, and benchmarks, offering insights from both training and evaluation perspectives.

| **[MSNav: Zero-Shot Vision-and-Language Navigation with Dynamic Memory and LLM Spatial Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16654v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires an agent to interpret natural language instructions and navigate complex environments. Current approaches often adopt a "black-box" paradigm, where a single Large Language Model (LLM) makes end-to-end decisions. However, it is plagued by critical vulnerabilities, including poor spatial reasoning, weak cross-modal grounding, and memory overload in long-horizon tasks. To systematically address these issues, we propose Memory Spatial Navigation(MSNav), a framework that fuses three modules into a synergistic architecture, which transforms fragile inference into a robust, integrated intelligence. MSNav integrates three modules: Memory Module, a dynamic map memory module that tackles memory overload through selective node pruning, enhancing long-range exploration; Spatial Module, a module for spatial reasoning and object relationship inference that improves endpoint recognition; and Decision Module, a module using LLM-based path planning to execute robust actions. Powering Spatial Module, we also introduce an Instruction-Object-Space (I-O-S) dataset and fine-tune the Qwen3-4B model into Qwen-Spatial (Qwen-Sp), which outperforms leading commercial LLMs in object list extraction, achieving higher F1 and NDCG scores on the I-O-S test set. Extensive experiments on the Room-to-Room (R2R) and REVERIE datasets demonstrate MSNav's state-of-the-art performance with significant improvements in Success Rate (SR) and Success weighted by Path Length (SPL).</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |

However, the increasing resolution of ST, particularly with platforms such as Visium HD achieving 8um or finer, introduces significant computational and modeling challenges. Conventional spot-by-spot sequential regression frameworks become inefficient and unstable at this scale, while the inherent extreme sparsity and low expression levels of high-resolution ST further complicate both prediction and evaluation. To address these limitations, we propose Img2ST-Net, a novel histology-to-ST generation framework for efficient and parallel high-resolution ST prediction. Unlike conventional spot-by-spot inference methods, Img2ST-Net employs a fully convolutional architecture to generate dense, HD gene expression maps in a parallelized manner. By modeling HD ST data as super-pixel representations, the task is reformulated from image-to-omics inference into a super-content image generation problem with hundreds or thousands of output channels. This design not only improves computational efficiency but also better preserves the spatial organization intrinsic to spatial omics data. To enhance robustness under sparse expression patterns, we further introduce SSIM-ST, a structural-similarity-based evaluation metric tailored for high-resolution ST analysis. We present a scalable, biologically coherent framework for high-resolution ST prediction. Img2ST-Net offers a principled solution for efficient and accurate ST inference at scale. Our contributions lay the groundwork for next-generation ST modeling that is robust and resolution-aware.

| **[Spatial-Temporal Transformer with Curriculum Learning for EEG-Based Emotion Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14698v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>EEG-based emotion recognition plays an important role in developing adaptive brain-computer communication systems, yet faces two fundamental challenges in practical implementations: (1) effective integration of non-stationary spatial-temporal neural patterns, (2) robust adaptation to dynamic emotional intensity variations in real-world scenarios. This paper proposes SST-CL, a novel framework integrating spatial-temporal transformers with curriculum learning. Our method introduces two core components: a spatial encoder that models inter-channel relationships and a temporal encoder that captures multi-scale dependencies through windowed attention mechanisms, enabling simultaneous extraction of spatial correlations and temporal dynamics from EEG signals. Complementing this architecture, an intensity-aware curriculum learning strategy progressively guides training from high-intensity to low-intensity emotional states through dynamic sample scheduling based on a dual difficulty assessment. Comprehensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across various emotional intensity levels, with ablation studies confirming the necessity of both architectural components and the curriculum learning mechanism.</p></details> |  |
| **[SCRNet: Spatial-Channel Regulation Network for Medical Ultrasound Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13899v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical ultrasound image segmentation presents a formidable challenge in the realm of computer vision. Traditional approaches rely on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based methods to address the intricacies of medical image segmentation. Nevertheless, inherent limitations persist, as CNN-based methods tend to disregard long-range dependencies, while Transformer-based methods may overlook local contextual information. To address these deficiencies, we propose a novel Feature Aggregation Module (FAM) designed to process two input features from the preceding layer. These features are seamlessly directed into two branches of the Convolution and Cross-Attention Parallel Module (CCAPM) to endow them with different roles in each of the two branches to help establish a strong connection between the two input features. This strategy enables our module to focus concurrently on both long-range dependencies and local contextual information by judiciously merging convolution operations with cross-attention mechanisms. Moreover, by integrating FAM within our proposed Spatial-Channel Regulation Module (SCRM), the ability to discern salient regions and informative features warranting increased attention is enhanced. Furthermore, by incorporating the SCRM into the encoder block of the UNet architecture, we introduce a novel framework dubbed Spatial-Channel Regulation Network (SCRNet). The results of our extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of SCRNet, which consistently achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance compared to existing methods.</p></details> | 8 pagegs |

While current methods mainly focus on predicting the next location for personalized services like recommendations, they often fall short in supporting broader applications such as traffic management and epidemic control, which require longer period forecasts of human mobility. This study addresses mid-term mobility prediction, aiming to capture daily travel patterns and forecast trajectories for the upcoming day or week. We propose a novel Multi-scale Spatial-Temporal Decoupled Predictor (MSTDP) designed to efficiently extract spatial and temporal information by decoupling daily trajectories into distinct location-duration chains. Our approach employs a hierarchical encoder to model multi-scale temporal patterns, including daily recurrence and weekly periodicity, and utilizes a transformer-based decoder to globally attend to predicted information in the location or duration chain. Additionally, we introduce a spatial heterogeneous graph learner to capture multi-scale spatial relationships, enhancing semantic-rich representations. Extensive experiments, including statistical physics analysis, are conducted on large-scale mobile phone records in five cities (Boston, Los Angeles, SF Bay Area, Shanghai, and Tokyo), to demonstrate MSTDP's advantages. Applied to epidemic modeling in Boston, MSTDP significantly outperforms the best-performing baseline, achieving a remarkable 62.8% reduction in MAE for cumulative new cases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatially-guided Temporal Aggregation for Robust Event-RGB Optical Flow Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00838v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current optical flow methods exploit the stable appearance of frame (or RGB) data to establish robust correspondences across time. Event cameras, on the other hand, provide high-temporal-resolution motion cues and excel in challenging scenarios. These complementary characteristics underscore the potential of integrating frame and event data for optical flow estimation. However, most cross-modal approaches fail to fully utilize the complementary advantages, relying instead on simply stacking information. This study introduces a novel approach that uses a spatially dense modality to guide the aggregation of the temporally dense event modality, achieving effective cross-modal fusion. Specifically, we propose an event-enhanced frame representation that preserves the rich texture of frames and the basic structure of events. We use the enhanced representation as the guiding modality and employ events to capture temporally dense motion information. The robust motion features derived from the guiding modality direct the aggregation of motion information from events. To further enhance fusion, we propose a transformer-based module that complements sparse event motion features with spatially rich frame information and enhances global information propagation. Additionally, a mix-fusion encoder is designed to extract comprehensive spatiotemporal contextual features from both modalities. Extensive experiments on the MVSEC and DSEC-Flow datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. Leveraging the complementary strengths of frames and events, our method achieves leading performance on the DSEC-Flow dataset. Compared to the event-only model, frame guidance improves accuracy by 10\%. Furthermore, it outperforms the state-of-the-art fusion-based method with a 4\% accuracy gain and a 45\% reduction in inference time.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 8 figures, under review</p></details> |

Traditional site selection methods often rely on static traffic counts or subjective assessments. This research introduces a data-driven methodology to objectively quantify location visibility by analyzing large-scale connected vehicle trajectory data (sourced from Compass IoT) within urban environments. We model the dynamic driver field-of-view using a forward-projected visibility area for each vehicle position derived from interpolated trajectories. By integrating this with building vertex locations extracted from OpenStreetMap, we quantify the cumulative visual exposure, or ``visibility count'', for thousands of potential points of interest near roadways. The analysis reveals that visibility is highly concentrated, identifying specific ``visual hotspots'' that receive disproportionately high exposure compared to average locations. The core technical contribution involves the construction of a BallTree spatial index over building vertices. This enables highly efficient (O(logN) complexity) radius queries to determine which vertices fall within the viewing circles of millions of trajectory points across numerous trips, significantly outperforming brute-force geometric checks. Analysis reveals two key findings: 1) Visibility is highly concentrated, identifying distinct 'visual hotspots' receiving disproportionately high exposure compared to average locations. 2) The aggregated visibility counts across vertices conform to a Log-Normal distribution.</p></details> |  |

Early detection and timely intervention are critical in significantly reducing mortality rates. However, the intricate anatomical architecture and diverse pathological changes of liver tissue complicate the accurate detection and characterization of lesions in clinical settings. Existing methods underutilize the spatial anatomical details in volumetric MRI data, thereby hindering their clinical effectiveness and explainability. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel Mamba-based network, SRMA-Mamba, designed to model the spatial relationships within the complex anatomical structures of MRI volumes. By integrating the Spatial Anatomy-Based Mamba module (SABMamba), SRMA-Mamba performs selective Mamba scans within liver cirrhotic tissues and combines anatomical information from the sagittal, coronal, and axial planes to construct a global spatial context representation, enabling efficient volumetric segmentation of pathological liver structures. Furthermore, we introduce the Spatial Reverse Attention module (SRMA), designed to progressively refine cirrhotic details in the segmentation map, utilizing both the coarse segmentation map and hierarchical encoding features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SRMA-Mamba surpasses state-of-the-art methods, delivering exceptional performance in 3D pathological liver segmentation.

Nevertheless, they continue to exhibit notable limitations in spatial understanding and reasoning, which are fundamental capabilities to achieving artificial general intelligence. With the recent release of GPT-5, allegedly the most powerful AI model to date, it is timely to examine where the leading models stand on the path toward spatial intelligence. First, we propose a comprehensive taxonomy of spatial tasks that unifies existing benchmarks and discuss the challenges in ensuring fair evaluation. We then evaluate state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source models on eight key benchmarks, at a cost exceeding one billion total tokens. Our empirical study reveals that (1) GPT-5 demonstrates unprecedented strength in spatial intelligence, yet (2) still falls short of human performance across a broad spectrum of tasks. Moreover, we (3) identify the more challenging spatial intelligence problems for multi-modal models, and (4) proprietary models do not exhibit a decisive advantage when facing the most difficult problems. In addition, we conduct a qualitative evaluation across a diverse set of scenarios that are intuitive for humans yet fail even the most advanced multi-modal models.</p></details> |  |

The framework is currently being used to study the capabilities of nnU-Net, exploiting the spatial model checker VoxLogicA to generate two distinct categories of synthetic datasets: maze connectivity problems for topological analysis and spatial distance computation tasks for geometric understanding. Each category is evaluated across multiple resolutions to assess scalability and generalization properties. The automated pipeline encompasses a complete machine learning workflow including: synthetic dataset generation, standardized training with cross-validation, inference execution, and comprehensive evaluation using Dice coefficient and IoU (Intersection over Union) metrics. Preliminary experimental results demonstrate significant challenges in neural network spatial reasoning capabilities, revealing systematic failures in basic geometric and topological understanding tasks. The framework provides a reproducible experimental protocol, enabling researchers to identify specific limitations. Such limitations could be addressed through hybrid approaches combining neural networks with symbolic reasoning methods for improved spatial understanding in clinical applications, establishing a foundation for ongoing research into neural network spatial reasoning limitations and potential solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[S2FGL: Spatial Spectral Federated Graph Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02409v4)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Graph Learning (FGL) combines the privacy-preserving capabilities of federated learning (FL) with the strong graph modeling capability of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Current research addresses subgraph-FL from the structural perspective, neglecting the propagation of graph signals on spatial and spectral domains of the structure. From a spatial perspective, subgraph-FL introduces edge disconnections between clients, leading to disruptions in label signals and a degradation in the semantic knowledge of the global GNN. From a spectral perspective, spectral heterogeneity causes inconsistencies in signal frequencies across subgraphs, which makes local GNNs overfit the local signal propagation schemes. As a result, spectral client drift occurs, undermining global generalizability. To tackle the challenges, we propose a global knowledge repository to mitigate the challenge of poor semantic knowledge caused by label signal disruption. Furthermore, we design a frequency alignment to address spectral client drift. The combination of Spatial and Spectral strategies forms our framework S2FGL. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the superiority of S2FGL. The code is available at https://github.com/Wonder7racer/S2FGL.git.</p></details> |  |

However, their potential for spatial modeling in multivariate time-series forecasting remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce a brand new SNN architecture, which is among the first to seamlessly integrate graph structural learning with spike-based temporal processing for multivariate time-series forecasting. Specifically, we first embed time features and an adaptive matrix, eliminating the need for predefined graph structures. We then further learn sequence features through the Observation (OBS) Block. Building upon this, our Multi-Scale Spike Aggregation (MSSA) hierarchically aggregates neighborhood information through spiking SAGE layers, enabling multi-hop feature extraction while eliminating the need for floating-point operations. Finally, we propose a Dual-Path Spike Fusion (DSF) Block to integrate spatial graph features and temporal dynamics via a spike-gated mechanism, combining LSTM-processed sequences with spiking self-attention outputs, effectively improve the model accuracy of long sequence datasets. Experiments show that our model surpasses the state-of-the-art SNN-based iSpikformer on all datasets and outperforms traditional temporal models at long horizons, thereby establishing a new paradigm for efficient spatial-temporal modeling.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |

However, detecting drowsiness accurately remains a challenging task, especially in real-world settings where facial data from different individuals is decentralized and highly diverse. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for drowsiness detection that is designed to work effectively with heterogeneous and decentralized data. Our approach develops a new Spatial Self-Attention (SSA) mechanism integrated with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to better extract key facial features and improve detection performance. To support federated learning, we employ a Gradient Similarity Comparison (GSC) that selects the most relevant trained models from different operators before aggregation. This improves the accuracy and robustness of the global model while preserving user privacy. We also develop a customized tool that automatically processes video data by extracting frames, detecting and cropping faces, and applying data augmentation techniques such as rotation, flipping, brightness adjustment, and zooming. Experimental results show that our framework achieves a detection accuracy of 89.9% in the federated learning settings, outperforming existing methods under various deployment scenarios. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in handling real-world data variability and highlight its potential for deployment in intelligent transportation systems to enhance road safety through early and reliable drowsiness detection.</p></details> |  |

Traditional single-threaded ESCG simulations are computationally expensive and scale poorly. To address this, high-performance implementations were developed using Apple's Metal and Nvidia's CUDA, with a validated single-threaded C++ version serving as a baseline comparison point. Benchmarking results show that GPU acceleration delivers significant speedups, with the CUDA maxStep implementation achieving up to a 28x improvement. Larger system sizes, up to 3200x3200, became tractable, while Metal faced scalability limits. The GPU frameworks also enabled replication and critical extension of recent ESCG studies, revealing sensitivities to system size and runtime not fully explored in prior work. Overall, this project provides a configurable ESCG simulation platform that advances the computational toolkit for this field of research. This dissertation forms the basis for a paper accepted for publication and presentation at the European Modelling and Simulation Symposium.</p></details> |  |

Implications of Spatial Inequality for Prediction-Based Allocation Policies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08573v2)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI-powered scarce resource allocation policies rely on predictions to target either specific individuals (e.g., high-risk) or settings (e.g., neighborhoods). Recent research on individual-level targeting demonstrates conflicting results; some models show that targeting is not useful when inequality is high, while other work demonstrates potential benefits. To study and reconcile this apparent discrepancy, we develop a stylized framework based on the Mallows model to understand how the spatial distribution of inequality affects the effectiveness of door-to-door outreach policies. We introduce the RENT (Relative Efficiency of Non-Targeting) metric, which we use to assess the effectiveness of targeting approaches compared with neighborhood-based approaches in preventing tenant eviction when high-risk households are more versus less spatially concentrated. We then calibrate the model parameters to eviction court records collected in a medium-sized city in the USA. Results demonstrate considerable gains in the number of high-risk households canvassed through individually targeted policies, even in a highly segregated metro area with concentrated risks of eviction. We conclude that apparent discrepancies in the prior literature can be reconciled by considering 1) the source of deployment costs and 2) the observed versus modeled concentrations of risk. Our results inform the deployment of AI-based solutions in social service provision that account for particular applications and geographies.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted for publication as a full paper at the AAAI/ACM Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society (AIES 2025)</p></details> |

However, efficiently computing these equilibria requires games to have a carefully designed structure and satisfy numerous restrictions; otherwise, the computational complexity becomes prohibitive. In particular, finding even approximate Nash equilibria in general-sum normal-form games with two or more players is known to be PPAD-complete. Current state-of-the-art algorithms for computing Nash equilibria in multiplayer normal-form games either suffer from poor scalability due to their reliance on non-convex optimization solvers, or lack guarantees of convergence to a true equilibrium. In this paper, we propose a formulation of the Nash equilibrium computation problem as a polynomial complementarity problem and develop a complete and sound spatial branch-and-bound algorithm based on this formulation. We provide a qualitative analysis arguing why one should expect our approach to perform well, and show the relationship between approximate solutions to our formulation and that of computing an approximate Nash equilibrium. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our algorithm substantially outperforms existing complete methods.</p></details> |  |

However, this task is often challenging due to the diversity of scenes, large number of fine-grained objects, and complex free-form nature of language references. Furthermore, in the 3D domain, obtaining large amounts of natural language training data is difficult. Thus, it is important for methods to learn from little data and zero-shot generalize to new environments. To address these challenges, we propose SORT3D, an approach that utilizes rich object attributes from 2D data and merges a heuristics-based spatial reasoning toolbox with the ability of large language models (LLMs) to perform sequential reasoning. Importantly, our method does not require text-to-3D data for training and can be applied zero-shot to unseen environments. We show that SORT3D achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on complex view-dependent grounding tasks on two benchmarks. We also implement the pipeline to run real-time on two autonomous vehicles and demonstrate that our approach can be used for object-goal navigation on previously unseen real-world environments. All source code for the system pipeline is publicly released at https://github.com/nzantout/SORT3D.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, published in IROS 2025</p></details> |

Instead of directly controlling robots through Programming by Demonstration (PbD) or teleoperation, we propose giving instructions by interacting with GhostObjects-world-aligned, life-size virtual twins of physical objects-in augmented reality (AR). By direct manipulation of GhostObjects, users can precisely specify physical goals and spatial parameters, with features including real-world lasso selection of multiple objects and snapping back to default positions, enabling tasks beyond simple pick-and-place.</p></details> |  |

Despite recent progress, existing methods have at least two limitations: (i) topological learning typically considers only representations of individual cells or their interaction graphs; however, spatial transcriptomic profiles are often noisy, making these approaches vulnerable to low-quality topological signals, and (ii) insufficient modeling of spatial neighborhood information leads to low-quality spatial embeddings. To address these limitations, we propose SPHENIC, a novel Spatial Persistent Homology Enhanced Neighborhood Integrative Clustering method. Specifically, SPHENIC incorporates invariant topological features into the clustering network to achieve stable representation learning. Additionally, to construct high-quality spatial embeddings that reflect the true cellular distribution, we design the Spatial Constraint and Distribution Optimization Module (SCDOM). This module increases the similarity between a cell's embedding and those of its spatial neighbors, decreases similarity with non-neighboring cells, and thereby produces clustering-friendly spatial embeddings. Extensive experiments on 14 benchmark spatial transcriptomic slices demonstrate that SPHENIC achieves superior performance on the spatial clustering task, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods by 3.31%-6.54% over the best alternative.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Kotz, Levermann and Wenz (Nature, 2024) statistically analyzed economic and climate data, finding significant projected damages until mid-century and a divergence in outcomes between high- and low-emission scenarios thereafter. We find that their analysis underestimates uncertainty owing to large, unaccounted-for spatial correlations on the subnational level, rendering their results statistically insignificant when properly corrected. Thus, their study does not provide the robust empirical evidence needed to inform climate policy.</p></details> |  |

However, the user experience is limited when performing complex tasks, such as searching for a group of locations simultaneously. In this study, we examine the extended scenario known as Spatial Exemplar Query (SEQ), where multiple relevant locations are jointly searched based on user-specified examples. We introduce SEQ-GPT, a spatial query system powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) towards more versatile SEQ search using natural language. The language capabilities of LLMs enable unique interactive operations in the SEQ process, including asking users to clarify query details and dynamically adjusting the search based on user feedback. We also propose a tailored LLM adaptation pipeline that aligns natural language with structured spatial data and queries through dialogue synthesis and multi-model cooperation. SEQ-GPT offers an end-to-end demonstration for broadening spatial search with realistic data and application scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Spatially Consistent Image Generation: On Incorporating Intrinsic Scene Properties into Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10382v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image generation models trained on large datasets can synthesize high-quality images but often produce spatially inconsistent and distorted images due to limited information about the underlying structures and spatial layouts. In this work, we leverage intrinsic scene properties (e.g., depth, segmentation maps) that provide rich information about the underlying scene, unlike prior approaches that solely rely on image-text pairs or use intrinsics as conditional inputs. Our approach aims to co-generate both images and their corresponding intrinsics, enabling the model to implicitly capture the underlying scene structure and generate more spatially consistent and realistic images. Specifically, we first extract rich intrinsic scene properties from a large image dataset with pre-trained estimators, eliminating the need for additional scene information or explicit 3D representations. We then aggregate various intrinsic scene properties into a single latent variable using an autoencoder. Building upon pre-trained large-scale Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), our method simultaneously denoises the image and intrinsic domains by carefully sharing mutual information so that the image and intrinsic reflect each other without degrading image quality. Experimental results demonstrate that our method corrects spatial inconsistencies and produces a more natural layout of scenes while maintaining the fidelity and textual alignment of the base model (e.g., Stable Diffusion).</p></details> |  |
| **[HGAurban: Heterogeneous Graph Autoencoding for Urban Spatial-Temporal Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10915v2)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial-temporal graph representations play a crucial role in urban sensing applications, including traffic analysis, human mobility behavior modeling, and citywide crime prediction. However, a key challenge lies in the noisy and sparse nature of spatial-temporal data, which limits existing neural networks' ability to learn meaningful region representations in the spatial-temporal graph. To overcome these limitations, we propose HGAurban, a novel heterogeneous spatial-temporal graph masked autoencoder that leverages generative self-supervised learning for robust urban data representation. Our framework introduces a spatial-temporal heterogeneous graph encoder that extracts region-wise dependencies from multi-source data, enabling comprehensive modeling of diverse spatial relationships. Within our self-supervised learning paradigm, we implement a masked autoencoder that jointly processes node features and graph structure. This approach automatically learns heterogeneous spatial-temporal patterns across regions, significantly improving the representation of dynamic temporal correlations. Comprehensive experiments across multiple spatiotemporal mining tasks demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods and robustly handles real-world urban data challenges, including noise and sparsity in both spatial and temporal dimensions.</p></details> | 10 pages |

| **[Training Spatial Ability in Virtual Reality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10195v1)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: Spatial reasoning has been identified as a critical skill for success in STEM. Unfortunately, under-represented groups often have lower incoming spatial ability. Courses that improve spatial skills exist but are not widely used. Virtual reality (VR) has been suggested as a possible tool for teaching spatial reasoning since students are more accurate and complete spatial tasks more quickly in three dimensions. However, no prior work has developed or evaluated a fully-structured VR spatial skills course. Objectives: We seek to assess the effectiveness of teaching spatial reasoning in VR, both in isolation as a structured training curriculum and also in comparison to traditional methods. Methods: We adapted three modules of an existing pencil-and-paper course to VR, leveraging educational scaffolding and real-time feedback in the design. We evaluated our three-week course in a study with $n=24$ undergraduate introductory STEM students, capturing both quantitative spatial ability gains (using pre- and post test scores on validated assessments) and qualitative insights (from a post-study questionnaire). We also compared our VR course to an offering of a baseline non-VR course (using data collected in a previous study). Results and Conclusions: Students who took our VR course had significant spatial ability gains. Critically, we find no significant difference in outcomes between our VR course (3 meetings of 120 minutes each) and a baseline pencil and paper course (10 meetings of 90 minutes each), suggesting that spatial reasoning can be very efficiently taught in VR. We observed cybersickness at lower rates than are generally reported and most students reported enjoying learning in VR.</p></details> |  |
| **[CAPTURe: Evaluating Spatial Reasoning in Vision Language Models via Occluded Object Counting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15485v2)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recognizing and reasoning about occluded (partially or fully hidden) objects is vital to understanding visual scenes, as occlusions frequently occur in real-world environments and act as obstacles for spatial comprehension. To test models' ability to reason about multiple occluded objects, we introduce a novel task, Counting Amodally for Patterns Through Unseen REgions (CAPTURe), which requires a model to count objects arranged in a pattern by inferring how the pattern continues behind an occluder (an object which blocks parts of the scene). CAPTURe requires both recognizing visual patterns and reasoning, making it a useful testbed for evaluating vision-language models (VLMs) on whether they understand occluded patterns and possess spatial understanding skills. By requiring models to reason about occluded objects, CAPTURe also tests VLMs' ability to form world models that would allow them to fill in missing information. CAPTURe consists of two parts: (1) CAPTURe-real, with manually filtered images of real objects in patterns and (2) CAPTURe-synthetic, a controlled diagnostic with generated patterned images. We evaluate four strong VLMs (GPT-4o, Intern-VL2, Molmo, and Qwen2-VL) on CAPTURe, finding that models struggle to count on both occluded and unoccluded patterns. Crucially, we find that models perform worse with occlusion, suggesting that VLMs are also deficient in inferring unseen spatial relationships: even the strongest VLMs like GPT-4o fail to count with occlusion. In contrast, we find that humans achieve very little error on CAPTURe. We also find that providing auxiliary information of occluded object locations increases performance, underscoring that the model error comes both from an inability to handle occlusion as well as difficulty in counting in images.

To pursue higher intelligence in space, MLLMs require integrating multiple atomic spatial capabilities to handle complex and dynamic tasks. However, existing benchmarks struggle to comprehensively evaluate the spatial intelligence of common MLLMs from the atomic level to the compositional level. To fill this gap, we present SpaCE-10, a comprehensive benchmark for compositional spatial evaluations. In SpaCE-10, we define 10 atomic spatial capabilities, which are combined to form 8 compositional capabilities. Based on these definitions, we propose a novel hierarchical annotation pipeline to generate high-quality and diverse question-answer (QA) pairs. With over 150+ hours of human expert effort, we obtain over 5k QA pairs for 811 real indoor scenes in SpaCE-10, which covers various evaluation settings like point cloud input and multi-choice QA. We conduct an extensive evaluation of common MLLMs on SpaCE-10 and find that even the most advanced MLLM still lags behind humans by large margins. Through our careful study, we also draw several significant findings that benefit the MLLM community. For example, we reveal that the shortcoming of counting capability greatly limits the compositional spatial capabilities of existing MLLMs. The evaluation code and benchmark datasets are available at https://github.com/Cuzyoung/SpaCE-10.</p></details> |  |

As for the motion-transfer task, current methods mainly use two-stage Low-Rank Adaptations (LoRAs) finetuning to obtain better performance. However, existing adaptation-based motion transfer still suffers from motion inconsistency and tuning inefficiency when applied to large video diffusion transformers. Naive two-stage LoRA tuning struggles to maintain motion consistency between generated and input videos due to the inherent spatial-temporal coupling in the 3D attention operator. Additionally, they require time-consuming fine-tuning processes in both stages. To tackle these issues, we propose Follow-Your-Motion, an efficient two-stage video motion transfer framework that finetunes a powerful video diffusion transformer to synthesize complex motion. Specifically, we propose a spatial-temporal decoupled LoRA to decouple the attention architecture for spatial appearance and temporal motion processing. During the second training stage, we design the sparse motion sampling and adaptive RoPE to accelerate the tuning speed. To address the lack of a benchmark for this field, we introduce MotionBench, a comprehensive benchmark comprising diverse motion, including creative camera motion, single object motion, multiple object motion, and complex human motion. We show extensive evaluations on MotionBench to verify the superiority of Follow-Your-Motion.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: https://follow-your-motion.github.io/</p></details> |

However, due to occlusions and data sparsity, these sensors often fail to capture complete information. Semantic Occupancy Prediction (SOP) addresses this challenge by inferring both occupancy and semantics of unobserved regions. Existing transformer-based SOP methods lack explicit modeling of spatial structure in attention computation, resulting in limited geometric awareness and poor performance in sparse or occluded areas. To this end, we propose Spatially-aware Window Attention (SWA), a novel mechanism that incorporates local spatial context into attention. SWA significantly improves scene completion and achieves state-of-the-art results on LiDAR-based SOP benchmarks. We further validate its generality by integrating SWA into a camera-based SOP pipeline, where it also yields consistent gains across modalities.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC), Vienna, Austria, Oct 2025</p></details> |

Calcium imaging has emerged as a powerful method to observe large-scale neuronal activity in freely moving animals, providing time-resolved recordings of hundreds of neurons. However, fluorescence signals are noisy and only indirectly reflect underlying spikes of neuronal activity, complicating the extraction of reliable patterns of neuronal coordination. We introduce a fully Bayesian, semiparametric model that jointly infers spiking activity and identifies functionally coherent neuronal ensembles from calcium traces. Our approach models each neuron's spiking probability through a latent Gaussian process and encourages anatomically coherent clustering using a location-dependent stick-breaking prior. A spike-and-slab Dirichlet process captures heterogeneity in spike amplitudes while filtering out negligible events. We consider calcium imaging data from the hippocampal CA1 region of a mouse as it navigates a circular arena, a setting critical for understanding spatial memory and neuronal representation of environments. Our model uncovers spatially structured co-activation patterns among neurons and can be employed to reveal how ensemble structures vary with the animal's position.</p></details> |  |

We propose a unified Hierarchical Vision-Language framework (HVL) that integrates domain-invariant text embeddings as object queries in a transformer-based segmentation network to improve generalization and reduce misclassification under limited supervision. The mentioned textual queries are used for grouping pixels with shared semantics under SSS. HVL is designed to (1) generate textual queries that maximally encode domain-invariant semantics from VLM while capturing intra-class variations; (2) align these queries with spatial visual features to enhance their segmentation ability and improve the semantic clarity of visual features. We also introduce targeted regularization losses that maintain vision--language alignment throughout training to reinforce semantic understanding. HVL establishes a novel state-of-the-art by achieving a +9.3% improvement in mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) on COCO, utilizing 232 labelled images, +3.1% on Pascal VOC employing 92 labels, +4.8% on ADE20 using 316 labels, and +3.4% on Cityscapes with 100 labels, demonstrating superior performance with less than 1% supervision on four benchmark datasets. Our results show that language-guided segmentation bridges the label efficiency gap and enables new levels of fine-grained generalization.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches introduce data-independent spatial decay based on fixed distance metrics, applying uniform attention weighting regardless of image content and limiting adaptability to diverse visual scenarios. Inspired by recent advances in large language models where content-aware gating mechanisms (e.g., GLA, HGRN2, FOX) significantly outperform static alternatives, we present the first successful adaptation of data-dependent spatial decay to 2D vision transformers. We introduce \textbf{Spatial Decay Transformer (SDT)}, featuring a novel Context-Aware Gating (CAG) mechanism that generates dynamic, data-dependent decay for patch interactions. Our approach learns to modulate spatial attention based on both content relevance and spatial proximity. We address the fundamental challenge of 1D-to-2D adaptation through a unified spatial-content fusion framework that integrates manhattan distance-based spatial priors with learned content representations. Extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K classification and generation tasks demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines. Our work establishes data-dependent spatial decay as a new paradigm for enhancing spatial attention in vision transformers.</p></details> |  |

However, their direct application to hyperspectral remote sensing remains challenging due to inherent spectral disparities and the scarcity of available observations. In this work, we present HyperKD, a novel knowledge distillation framework that enables transferring learned representations from a teacher model into a student model for effective development of a foundation model on hyperspectral images. Unlike typical knowledge distillation frameworks, which use a complex teacher to guide a simpler student, HyperKD enables an inverse form of knowledge transfer across different types of spectral data, guided by a simpler teacher model. Building upon a Masked Autoencoder, HyperKD distills knowledge from the Prithvi foundational model into a student tailored for EnMAP hyperspectral imagery. HyperKD addresses the inverse domain adaptation problem with spectral gaps by introducing a feature-based strategy that includes spectral range-based channel alignment, spatial feature-guided masking, and an enhanced loss function tailored for hyperspectral images. HyperKD bridges the substantial spectral domain gap, enabling the effective use of pretrained foundation models for geospatial applications. Extensive experiments show that HyperKD significantly improves representation learning in MAEs, leading to enhanced reconstruction fidelity and more robust performance on downstream tasks such as land cover classification, crop type identification, and soil organic carbon prediction, underpinning the potential of knowledge distillation frameworks in remote sensing analytics with hyperspectral imagery.</p></details> |  |

Although recent research has focused on enhancing spatial and temporal understanding independently, this paper presents a novel approach that integrates both aspects through visual prompting. We introduce a method that projects visual traces of key points from observations onto depth maps, enabling models to capture both spatial and temporal information simultaneously. The experiments in SimplerEnv show that the mean number of tasks successfully solved increased for 4% compared to SpatialVLA and 19% compared to TraceVLA. Furthermore, we show that this enhancement can be achieved with minimal training data, making it particularly valuable for real-world applications where data collection is challenging.

These architectures face fundamental limitations: quadratic computational complexity restricts the use of high-resolution features, and a lack of spatial priors prevents them from effectively modeling the inherent structure of Bird's Eye View (BEV) representations. This paper introduces GMF-Drive (Gated Mamba Fusion for Driving), an end-to-end framework that overcomes these challenges through two principled innovations. First, we supersede the information-limited histogram-based LiDAR representation with a geometrically-augmented pillar format encoding shape descriptors and statistical features, preserving critical 3D geometric details. Second, we propose a novel hierarchical gated mamba fusion (GM-Fusion) architecture that substitutes an expensive transformer with a highly efficient, spatially-aware state-space model (SSM). Our core BEV-SSM leverages directional sequencing and adaptive fusion mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies with linear complexity, while explicitly respecting the unique spatial properties of the driving scene. Extensive experiments on the challenging NAVSIM benchmark demonstrate that GMF-Drive achieves a new state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming DiffusionDrive. Comprehensive ablation studies validate the efficacy of each component, demonstrating that task-specific SSMs can surpass a general-purpose transformer in both performance and efficiency for autonomous driving.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |

To address these challenges, we introduce MSQ, a novel quantization method that compresses the motion sequence into multi-scale discrete tokens across spatial and temporal dimensions. MSQ employs distinct encoders to capture body parts at varying spatial granularities and temporally interpolates the encoded features into multiple scales before quantizing them into discrete tokens. Building on this representation, we establish a generative mask modeling model to effectively support motion editing, motion control, and conditional motion generation. Through quantitative and qualitative analysis, we show that our quantization method enables the seamless composition of motion tokens without requiring specialized design or re-training. Furthermore, extensive evaluations demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing baseline methods on various benchmarks.</p></details> | 18 pages |

Techniques for reducing these costs require datasets of software faults, as well as an understanding of the faults, for optimal testing and evaluation. In this paper, we present an empirical analysis of the temporal and spatial characteristics of faults existing in 16 open-source Java and Python projects, which form part of the Defects4J and BugsInPy datasets, respectively. Our findings show that many faults in these software systems are long-lived, leading to the majority of software versions having multiple coexisting faults. This is in contrast to the assumptions of the original datasets, where the majority of versions only identify a single fault. In addition, we show that although the faults are found in only a small subset of the systems, these faults are often evenly distributed amongst this subset, leading to relatively few bug hotspots.</p></details> |  |

Although existing methods achieve real-time inference through lightweight designs, we reveal their inherent limitation: misalignment between class representations and image features caused by a per-pixel classification paradigm. With experimental analysis, we find that this paradigm results in a highly challenging assumption for efficient scenarios: Image pixel features should not vary for the same category in different images. To address this dilemma, we propose a coupled dual-branch offset learning paradigm that explicitly learns feature and class offsets to dynamically refine both class representations and spatial image features. Based on the proposed paradigm, we construct an efficient semantic segmentation network, OffSeg. Notably, the offset learning paradigm can be adopted to existing methods with no additional architectural changes. Extensive experiments on four datasets, including ADE20K, Cityscapes, COCO-Stuff-164K, and Pascal Context, demonstrate consistent improvements with negligible parameters. For instance, on the ADE20K dataset, our proposed offset learning paradigm improves SegFormer-B0, SegNeXt-T, and Mask2Former-Tiny by 2.7%, 1.9%, and 2.6% mIoU, respectively, with only 0.1-0.2M additional parameters required.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV 2025.

In this work, we introduce a novel testbed that enables simultaneous, synchronized evaluation of multiple XR devices under identical environmental and kinematic conditions. Leveraging this platform, we present the first comprehensive empirical benchmarking of five state-of-the-art XR devices across 16 diverse scenarios. Our results reveal substantial intra-device performance variation, with individual devices exhibiting up to 101\% increases in error when operating in featureless environments. We also demonstrate that tracking accuracy strongly correlates with visual conditions and motion dynamics. We also observe significant inter-device disparities, with performance differences of up to 2.8$\times$, which are closely linked to hardware specifications such as sensor configurations and dedicated processing units. Finally, we explore the feasibility of substituting a motion capture system with the Apple Vision Pro as a practical ground truth reference. While the Apple Vision Pro delivers highly accurate relative pose error estimates ($R^2 = 0.830$), its absolute pose error estimation remains limited ($R^2 = 0.387$), highlighting both its potential and its constraints for rigorous XR evaluation. This work establishes the first standardized framework for comparative XR tracking evaluation, providing the research community with reproducible methodologies, comprehensive benchmark datasets, and open-source tools that enable systematic analysis of tracking performance across devices and conditions, thereby accelerating the development of more robust spatial sensing technologies for XR systems.</p></details> |  |

Although video generation models offer cost-efficient solutions for VFX production, current methods are constrained by per-effect LoRA training, which limits generation to single effects. This fundamental limitation impedes applications that require spatially controllable composite effects, i.e., the concurrent generation of multiple effects at designated locations. However, integrating diverse effects into a unified framework faces major challenges: interference from effect variations and spatial uncontrollability during multi-VFX joint training. To tackle these challenges, we propose Omni-Effects, a first unified framework capable of generating prompt-guided effects and spatially controllable composite effects. The core of our framework comprises two key innovations: (1) LoRA-based Mixture of Experts (LoRA-MoE), which employs a group of expert LoRAs, integrating diverse effects within a unified model while effectively mitigating cross-task interference. (2) Spatial-Aware Prompt (SAP) incorporates spatial mask information into the text token, enabling precise spatial control. Furthermore, we introduce an Independent-Information Flow (IIF) module integrated within the SAP, isolating the control signals corresponding to individual effects to prevent any unwanted blending. To facilitate this research, we construct a comprehensive VFX dataset Omni-VFX via a novel data collection pipeline combining image editing and First-Last Frame-to-Video (FLF2V) synthesis, and introduce a dedicated VFX evaluation framework for validating model performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Omni-Effects achieves precise spatial control and diverse effect generation, enabling users to specify both the category and location of desired effects.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tracing the impacts of Mount Pinatubo eruption on regional climate using spatially-varying changepoint detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08908v2)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Significant events, such as volcanic eruptions, can have global and long-lasting impacts on climate. These global impacts, however, are not uniform across space and time. Understanding how the Mt. Pinatubo eruption affects global and regional climate is of great interest for predicting the impact on climate due to similar events as well as understanding the possible effect of the stratospheric aerosol injections proposed to combat climate change. While many studies illustrated the impact of the Pinatubo eruption on a global scale, studies at a fine regional scale are scarce. We propose a Bayesian spatially-varying changepoint detection and estimation method to trace the impact of Mt. Pinatubo eruption on regional climate. Our approach takes into account the diffusing nature and spatial correlation of the climate changes attributed to the volcanic eruption. We illustrate our method and demonstrate its advantages over an existing changepoint detection method through simulations. Finally, we apply our method to monthly stratospheric aerosol optical depth and surface temperature data from 1985 to 1995 to detect and estimate changepoints following the 1991 Mt. Pinatubo eruption. Our results quantitatively characterize the spatial pattern of the eruption's impact on regional climate, complementing the previous studies on the global impact of the Pinatubo eruption.</p></details> |  |

Generalisable Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) thus hold promise for adapting these interventions across individuals. However, inter-subject variability in EEG signals, further compounded by movement-induced artefacts and motor planning differences, hinders the generalisability of BCIs and results in lengthy calibration processes. We propose Individual Tangent Space Alignment (ITSA), a novel pre-alignment strategy incorporating subject-specific recentering, distribution matching, and supervised rotational alignment to enhance cross-subject generalisation. Our hybrid architecture fuses Regularised Common Spatial Patterns (RCSP) with Riemannian geometry in parallel and sequential configurations, improving class separability while maintaining the geometric structure of covariance matrices for robust statistical computation. Using leave-one-subject-out cross-validation, `ITSA' demonstrates significant performance improvements across subjects and conditions. The parallel fusion approach shows the greatest enhancement over its sequential counterpart, with robust performance maintained across varying data conditions and electrode configurations. The code will be made publicly available at the time of publication.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |

While existing approaches leverage large-scale multimodal datasets for latent-space alignment to implicitly learn spatial relationships, they overlook the 3D capabilities of MLLMs. However, this approach raises two issues: (1) Operating rooms typically lack multiple video and audio sensors, making multimodal 3D data difficult to obtain; (2) Training solely on readily available 2D data fails to capture fine-grained details in complex scenes. To address this gap, we introduce Spatial-ORMLLM, the first large vision-language model for 3D spatial reasoning in operating rooms using only RGB modality to infer volumetric and semantic cues, enabling downstream medical tasks with detailed and holistic spatial context. Spatial-ORMLLM incorporates a Spatial-Enhanced Feature Fusion Block, which integrates 2D modality inputs with rich 3D spatial knowledge extracted by the estimation algorithm and then feeds the combined features into the visual tower. By employing a unified end-to-end MLLM framework, it combines powerful spatial features with textual features to deliver robust 3D scene reasoning without any additional expert annotations or sensor inputs. Experiments on multiple benchmark clinical datasets demonstrate that Spatial-ORMLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance and generalizes robustly to previously unseen surgical scenarios and downstream tasks.</p></details> |  |

It aims to provide accurate assessment of cardiac structure and function through Ejection Fraction (EF) estimation. Although existing studies have achieved good segmentation performance, their results do not perform well in EF estimation. In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Spatio-temporal Segmentation Network (\ourmodel) for echocardiography video, aiming to improve EF estimation accuracy by synergizing local detail modeling with global dynamic perception. The network employs a hierarchical design, with low-level stages using convolutional networks to process single-frame images and preserve details, while high-level stages utilize the Mamba architecture to capture spatio-temporal relationships. The hierarchical design balances single-frame and multi-frame processing, avoiding issues such as local error accumulation when relying solely on single frames or neglecting details when using only multi-frame data. To overcome local spatio-temporal limitations, we propose the Spatio-temporal Cross Scan (STCS) module, which integrates long-range context through skip scanning across frames and positions. This approach helps mitigate EF calculation biases caused by ultrasound image noise and other factors.</p></details> |  |

The approach enables nonparametric and data driven estimation of complex time evolving vector fields while preserving both spatial and temporal structure. We establish representer theorems for time dependent OV-RKHS interpolation, derive Sobolev type approximation bounds for smooth vector fields, and provide spectral convergence guarantees for kernel Koopman operator approximations. This framework supports efficient reduced order modeling and long term prediction of high dimensional nonlinear systems, offering theoretically grounded tools for forecasting, control, and uncertainty quantification in spatio-temporal machine learning.</p></details> |  |

Traditional models often rely on parametric kernels, limiting their ability to capture heterogeneous, nonstationary dynamics. Recent innovations integrate deep neural architectures -- either by modeling the conditional intensity function directly or by learning flexible, data-driven influence kernels, substantially broadening their expressive power. This article reviews the development of the deep influence kernel approach, which enjoys statistical explainability, since the influence kernel remains in the model to capture the spatiotemporal propagation of event influence and its impact on future events, while also possessing strong expressive power, thereby benefiting from both worlds. We explain the main components in developing deep kernel point processes, leveraging tools such as functional basis decomposition and graph neural networks to encode complex spatial or network structures, as well as estimation using both likelihood-based and likelihood-free methods, and address computational scalability for large-scale data. We also discuss the theoretical foundation of kernel identifiability. Simulated and real-data examples highlight applications to crime analysis, earthquake aftershock prediction, and sepsis prediction modeling, and we conclude by discussing promising directions for the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Annua...</summary><p>Annual Review of Statistics and Its Application, 2025</p></details> |
| **[Not Only Consistency: Enhance Test-Time Adaptation with Spatio-temporal Inconsistency for Remote Physiological Measurement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07908v2)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote physiological measurement (RPM) has emerged as a promising non-invasive method for monitoring physiological signals using the non-contact device. Although various domain adaptation and generalization methods were proposed to promote the adaptability of deep-based RPM models in unseen deployment environments, considerations in aspects such as privacy concerns and real-time adaptation restrict their application in real-world deployment. Thus, we aim to propose a novel fully Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) strategy tailored for RPM tasks in this work. Specifically, based on prior knowledge in physiology and our observations, we noticed not only there is spatio-temporal consistency in the frequency domain of BVP signals, but also that inconsistency in the time domain was significant. Given this, by leveraging both consistency and inconsistency priors, we introduce an innovative expert knowledge-based self-supervised \textbf{C}onsistency-\textbf{i}n\textbf{C}onsistency-\textbf{i}ntegration (\textbf{CiCi}) framework to enhances model adaptation during inference. Besides, our approach further incorporates a gradient dynamic control mechanism to mitigate potential conflicts between priors, ensuring stable adaptation across instances. Through extensive experiments on five diverse datasets under the TTA protocol, our method consistently outperforms existing techniques, presenting state-of-the-art performance in real-time self-supervised adaptation without accessing source data. The code will be released later.</p></details> |  |
| **[STA-GANN: A Valid and Generalizable Spatio-Temporal Kriging Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16161v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal tasks often encounter incomplete data arising from missing or inaccessible sensors, making spatio-temporal kriging crucial for inferring the completely missing temporal information. However, current models struggle with ensuring the validity and generalizability of inferred spatio-temporal patterns, especially in capturing dynamic spatial dependencies and temporal shifts, and optimizing the generalizability of unknown sensors. To overcome these limitations, we propose Spatio-Temporal Aware Graph Adversarial Neural Network (STA-GANN), a novel GNN-based kriging framework that improves spatio-temporal pattern validity and generalization. STA-GANN integrates (i) Decoupled Phase Module that senses and adjusts for timestamp shifts. (ii) Dynamic Data-Driven Metadata Graph Modeling to update spatial relationships using temporal data and metadata; (iii) An adversarial transfer learning strategy to ensure generalizability. Extensive validation across nine datasets from four fields and theoretical evidence both demonstrate the superior performance of STA-GANN.</p></details> |  |

While current spatial media technologies have primarily focused on capturing or replaying content as static assets, often disconnected from the viewer's environment or offering limited interactivity, the means to describe an experience's underlying semantic and interactive structure remains underexplored. We propose a descriptive framework called MAR-ED based on three core primitives: 1) Event Primitives for semantic scene graph representation, 2) Keyframe Primitives for efficient and meaningful data access, and 3) Playback Primitives for user-driven adaptive interactive playback of recorded MAR experience. The proposed flowchart of the three-stage process of the proposed MAR-ED framework transforms a recorded experience into a unique adaptive MAR experience during playback, where its spatio-temporal structure dynamically conforms to a new environment and its narrative can be altered by live user input. Drawing on this framework, personal digital memories and recorded events can evolve beyond passive 2D/3D videos into immersive, spatially-integrated group experiences, opening new paradigms for training, cultural heritage, and interactive storytelling without requiring complex, per-user adaptive rendering.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 2 figures, Accepted in the IEEE ISMAR 2025 XRStand Workshop</p></details> |

Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) are designed to support human drivers and are especially useful when they can anticipate potential accidents before they happen. While many existing systems depend on a range of sensors such as LiDAR, radar, and GPS, relying solely on dash-cam video input presents a more challenging but a more cost-effective and easily deployable solution. In this work, we incorporate better spatio-temporal features and aggregate them through a recurrent network to improve upon state-of-the-art graph neural networks for predicting accidents from dash-cam videos. Experiments using three publicly available datasets show that our proposed STAGNet model achieves higher average precision and mean time-to-collision values than previous methods, both when cross-validated on a given dataset and when trained and tested on different datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[UST-SSM: Unified Spatio-Temporal State Space Models for Point Cloud Video Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14604v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Point cloud videos capture dynamic 3D motion while reducing the effects of lighting and viewpoint variations, making them highly effective for recognizing subtle and continuous human actions. Although Selective State Space Models (SSMs) have shown good performance in sequence modeling with linear complexity, the spatio-temporal disorder of point cloud videos hinders their unidirectional modeling when directly unfolding the point cloud video into a 1D sequence through temporally sequential scanning. To address this challenge, we propose the Unified Spatio-Temporal State Space Model (UST-SSM), which extends the latest advancements in SSMs to point cloud videos. Specifically, we introduce Spatial-Temporal Selection Scanning (STSS), which reorganizes unordered points into semantic-aware sequences through prompt-guided clustering, thereby enabling the effective utilization of points that are spatially and temporally distant yet similar within the sequence. For missing 4D geometric and motion details, Spatio-Temporal Structure Aggregation (STSA) aggregates spatio-temporal features and compensates. To improve temporal interaction within the sampled sequence, Temporal Interaction Sampling (TIS) enhances fine-grained temporal dependencies through non-anchor frame utilization and expanded receptive fields. Experimental results on the MSR-Action3D, NTU RGB+D, and Synthia 4D datasets validate the effectiveness of our method.

Interpretation of digital subtraction angiography (DSA) sequences poses challenges due to anatomical complexity and time constraints. This work proposes OccluNet, a spatio-temporal deep learning model that integrates YOLOX, a single-stage object detector, with transformer-based temporal attention mechanisms to automate occlusion detection in DSA sequences. We compared OccluNet with a YOLOv11 baseline trained on either individual DSA frames or minimum intensity projections. Two spatio-temporal variants were explored for OccluNet: pure temporal attention and divided space-time attention. Evaluation on DSA images from the MR CLEAN Registry revealed the model's capability to capture temporally consistent features, achieving precision and recall of 89.02% and 74.87%, respectively. OccluNet significantly outperformed the baseline models, and both attention variants attained similar performance.

While various dynamic computation methods have been developed to mitigate this by targeting spatial, temporal, or architecture-specific redundancies, they remain fragmented. While the principles of adaptive computation time (ACT) offer a robust foundation for a unified approach, its application to SNN-based vision Transformers (ViTs) is hindered by two core issues: the violation of its temporal similarity prerequisite and a static architecture fundamentally unsuited for its principles. To address these challenges, we propose STAS (Spatio-Temporal Adaptive computation time for Spiking transformers), a framework that co-designs the static architecture and dynamic computation policy. STAS introduces an integrated spike patch splitting (I-SPS) module to establish temporal stability by creating a unified input representation, thereby solving the architectural problem of temporal dissimilarity. This stability, in turn, allows our adaptive spiking self-attention (A-SSA) module to perform two-dimensional token pruning across both spatial and temporal axes. Implemented on spiking Transformer architectures and validated on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, STAS reduces energy consumption by up to 45.9%, 43.8%, and 30.1%, respectively, while simultaneously improving accuracy over SOTA models.</p></details> | 8 pages |

This paper introduces STER-VLM, a computationally efficient framework that enhances VLM performance through (1) caption decomposition to tackle spatial and temporal information separately, (2) temporal frame selection with best-view filtering for sufficient temporal information, and (3) reference-driven understanding for capturing fine-grained motion and dynamic context and (4) curated visual/textual prompt techniques. Experimental results on the WTS \cite{kong2024wts} and BDD \cite{BDD} datasets demonstrate substantial gains in semantic richness and traffic scene interpretation. Our framework is validated through a decent test score of 55.655 in the AI City Challenge 2025 Track 2, showing its effectiveness in advancing resource-efficient and accurate traffic analysis for real-world applications.</p></details> | ICCV Workshop 2025 |

Although Transformer-based models offer strong global modeling, they often struggle with rigid temporal encoding and weak space-time fusion. We propose STPFormer, a Spatio-Temporal Pattern-Aware Transformer that achieves state-of-the-art performance via unified and interpretable representation learning. It integrates four modules: Temporal Position Aggregator (TPA) for pattern-aware temporal encoding, Spatial Sequence Aggregator (SSA) for sequential spatial learning, Spatial-Temporal Graph Matching (STGM) for cross-domain alignment, and an Attention Mixer for multi-scale fusion. Experiments on five real-world datasets show that STPFormer consistently sets new SOTA results, with ablation and visualizations confirming its effectiveness and generalizability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Compact Attention: Exploiting Structured Spatio-Temporal Sparsity for Fast Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12969v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The computational demands of self-attention mechanisms pose a critical challenge for transformer-based video generation, particularly in synthesizing ultra-long sequences. Current approaches, such as factorized attention and fixed sparse patterns, fail to fully exploit the inherent spatio-temporal redundancies in video data. Through systematic analysis of video diffusion transformers (DiT), we uncover a key insight: Attention matrices exhibit structured, yet heterogeneous sparsity patterns, where specialized heads dynamically attend to distinct spatiotemporal regions (e.g., local pattern, cross-shaped pattern, or global pattern). Existing sparse attention methods either impose rigid constraints or introduce significant overhead, limiting their effectiveness. To address this, we propose Compact Attention, a hardware-aware acceleration framework featuring three innovations: 1) Adaptive tiling strategies that approximate diverse spatial interaction patterns via dynamic tile grouping, 2) Temporally varying windows that adjust sparsity levels based on frame proximity, and 3) An automated configuration search algorithm that optimizes sparse patterns while preserving critical attention pathways. Our method achieves 1.6~2.5x acceleration in attention computation on single-GPU setups while maintaining comparable visual quality with full-attention baselines. This work provides a principled approach to unlocking efficient long-form video generation through structured sparsity exploitation.

A critical research gap lies in identifying the underlying causes of hydrogen bond formation and separation -understanding which interactions or prior events contribute to their emergence over time. With this challenge in mind, we propose leveraging spatio-temporal data analytics and machine learning models to enhance the detection of these phenomena. In this paper, our approach is inspired by causal modeling and aims to identify the root cause variables of hydrogen bond formation and separation events. Specifically, we treat the separation of hydrogen bonds as an "intervention" occurring and represent the causal structure of the bonding and separation events in the MDS as graphical causal models. These causal models are built using a variational autoencoder-inspired architecture that enables us to infer causal relationships across samples with diverse underlying causal graphs while leveraging shared dynamic information. We further include a step to infer the root causes of changes in the joint distribution of the causal models. By constructing causal models that capture shifts in the conditional distributions of molecular interactions during bond formation or separation, this framework provides a novel perspective on root cause analysis in molecular dynamic systems. We validate the efficacy of our model empirically on the atomic trajectories that used MDS for chiral separation, demonstrating that we can predict many steps in the future and also find the variables driving the observed changes in the system.</p></details> | Submitted to ACM |

The long-term spatio-temporal dependency learning brings two new challenges: 1) The long-term temporal sequence includes multiscale information naturally which is hard to extract efficiently; 2) The multiscale temporal information from different nodes is highly correlated and hard to model. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient \textit{\textbf{S}patio-\textbf{T}emporal \textbf{M}ultiscale \textbf{M}amba} (STM2) that includes a multiscale Mamba architecture to capture the multiscale information efficiently and simultaneously, and an adaptive graph causal convolution network to learn the complex multiscale spatio-temporal dependency. STM2 includes hierarchical information aggregation for different-scale information that guarantees their distinguishability. To capture diverse temporal dynamics across all spatial nodes more efficiently, we further propose an enhanced version termed \textit{\textbf{S}patio-\textbf{T}emporal \textbf{M}ixture of \textbf{M}ultiscale \textbf{M}amba} (STM3) that employs a special Mixture-of-Experts architecture, including a more stable routing strategy and a causal contrastive learning strategy to enhance the scale distinguishability. We prove that STM3 has much better routing smoothness and guarantees the pattern disentanglement for each expert successfully. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmarks demonstrate STM2/STM3's superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art results in long-term spatio-temporal time-series prediction.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposed PTSM (Physiology-aware and Task-invariant Spatio-temporal Modeling), a novel framework for interpretable and robust EEG decoding across unseen subjects. PTSM employs a dual-branch masking mechanism that independently learns personalized and shared spatio-temporal patterns, enabling the model to preserve individual-specific neural characteristics while extracting task-relevant, population-shared features. The masks are factorized across temporal and spatial dimensions, allowing fine-grained modulation of dynamic EEG patterns with low computational overhead. To further address representational entanglement, PTSM enforces information-theoretic constraints that decompose latent embeddings into orthogonal task-related and subject-related subspaces. The model is trained end-to-end via a multi-objective loss integrating classification, contrastive, and disentanglement objectives. Extensive experiments on cross-subject motor imagery datasets demonstrate that PTSM achieves strong zero-shot generalization, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines without subject-specific calibration. Results highlight the efficacy of disentangled neural representations for achieving both personalized and transferable decoding in non-stationary neurophysiological settings.</p></details> |  |

While recent vision language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable progress in specialized domains like multimodal mathematics and pure spatial understanding, their capability for spatio-physical reasoning remains largely unexplored. This paper provides a comprehensive diagnostic analysis of mainstream VLMs, revealing that current models perform inadequately on this crucial task. Further detailed analysis shows that this underperformance is largely attributable to biases caused by human-like prior and a lack of deep reasoning. To address these challenges, we apply supervised fine-tuning followed by rule-based reinforcement learning to Qwen2.5-VL-7B, resulting in significant improvements in spatio-physical reasoning capabilities and surpassing leading proprietary models. Nevertheless, despite this success, the model's generalization to new physics scenarios remains limited -- underscoring the pressing need for new approaches in spatio-physical reasoning.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |

Conventional approaches based on large-scale fixed antenna arrays and UAV trajectory optimization struggle to balance energy efficiency, real-time adaptation, and spatial flexibility. The movable antenna (MA) technology has emerged as a promising solution, offering enhanced spatial flexibility and reduced energy consumption to overcome the bottlenecks of urban low-altitude communications. However, MA deployment faces a critical velocity mismatch between UAV mobility and mechanical repositioning latency, undermining real-time link optimization and security assurance. To overcome this, we propose a predictive MA-UAV collaborative control framework. First, optimal antenna positions are derived via secrecy rate maximization. Second, a Transformer-enhanced long short-term memory (LSTM) network predicts future MA positions by capturing spatio-temporal correlations in antenna trajectories. Extensive simulations demonstrate superior prediction accuracy (NMSE reduction exceeds 49\%) and communication reliability versus current popular benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Although advanced Spatio-temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) and pre-trained models have achieved significant progress in traffic prediction, two key challenges remain: (i) limited contextual capacity when modeling complex spatio-temporal dependencies, and (ii) low predictability at fine-grained spatio-temporal points due to heterogeneous patterns. Inspired by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), we propose RAST, a universal framework that integrates retrieval-augmented mechanisms with spatio-temporal modeling to address these challenges. Our framework consists of three key designs: 1) Decoupled Encoder and Query Generator to capture decoupled spatial and temporal features and construct a fusion query via residual fusion; 2) Spatio-temporal Retrieval Store and Retrievers to maintain and retrieve vectorized fine-grained patterns; and 3) Universal Backbone Predictor that flexibly accommodates pre-trained STGNNs or simple MLP predictors. Extensive experiments on six real-world traffic networks, including large-scale datasets, demonstrate that RAST achieves superior performance while maintaining computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |

While traditional matrix time series focus mainly on temporal evolution, our approach incorporates both spatial and temporal dynamics, enabling simultaneous analysis of interactions across multiple dimensions. The inherent endogeneity in spatio-temporal autoregressive models renders ordinary least squares estimation inconsistent. To overcome this difficulty while simultaneously estimating two distinct weight matrices with banded structure, we develop an iterated generalized Yule-Walker estimator by adapting a generalized method of moments framework based on Yule-Walker equations. Moreover, unlike conventional models that employ a single bandwidth parameter, the dual-bandwidth specification in our framework requires a new two-step, ratio-based sequential estimation procedure.</p></details> |  |

Beyond a high number of ignitions, the country has experienced devastating mega-fires, such as those in 2017. Accurate forecasting of wildfire occurrence and burned areas is therefore essential for effective firefighting resource allocation and emergency preparedness. In this study, we present a novel two-stage ensemble approach that extends the widely used latent Gaussian modelling framework with the integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) for spatio-temporal wildfire forecasting. The first stage uses XGBoost, a gradient boosting model, to identify wildfire patterns from environmental covariates and historical fire records, producing one-month-ahead point forecasts for fire counts and burned area. These predictions are then incorporated as external covariates in a latent Gaussian model, which includes additional spatiotemporal random effects to produce the final probabilistic forecasts of monthly total fire counts and burned area at the council level. To effectively model both moderate and extreme wildfire events, we implement the extended generalised Pareto (eGP) likelihood (a sub-asymptotic distribution) within the INLA framework. We also develop and discuss penalised complexity priors (PC-priors) for the eGP parameters and provide a comprehensive comparison of the eGP likelihood against other commonly employed distributions in environmental modelling, such as the Gamma and Weibull distributions. The proposed framework addresses the challenge of accessing future environmental covariates, which are typically unavailable at prediction time, and demonstrates strong performance in one-month-ahead wildfire forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>44 pa...</summary><p>44 pages, 12 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

We present STAC, a cross-cameras surveillance system that leverages spatio-temporal associations for efficient object tracking under constrained network conditions. STAC integrates multi-resolution feature learning, ensuring robustness under variable networked system level optimizations such as frame filtering, FFmpeg-based compression, and Region-of-Interest (RoI) masking, to eliminate redundant content across distributed video streams while preserving downstream model accuracy for object identification and tracking. Evaluated on NVIDIA's AICity Challenge dataset, STAC achieves a 76\% improvement in tracking accuracy and an 8.6x reduction in inference latency over a standard multi-object multi-camera tracking baseline (using YOLOv4 and DeepSORT). Furthermore, 29\% of redundant frames are filtered, significantly reducing data volume without compromising inference quality.</p></details> |  |

Many existing solutions rely on computationally demanding deep learning models, which result in high latency and are unsuitable for embedded robotic devices with limited resources (such as intelligent vehicles/cars) where rapid detection is necessary to prevent accidents. This paper introduces LiteFat, a lightweight spatio-temporal graph learning model designed to detect driver fatigue efficiently while maintaining high accuracy and low computational demands. LiteFat involves converting streaming video data into spatio-temporal graphs (STG) using facial landmark detection, which focuses on key motion patterns and reduces unnecessary data processing. LiteFat uses MobileNet to extract facial features and create a feature matrix for the STG. A lightweight spatio-temporal graph neural network is then employed to identify signs of fatigue with minimal processing and low latency. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that LiteFat performs competitively while significantly decreasing computational complexity and latency as compared to current state-of-the-art methods. This work enables the development of real-time, resource-efficient human fatigue detection systems that can be implemented upon embedded robotic devices.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

We introduce a Physics- and Geometry- Aware Spatio-Spectral Graph Neural Operator ($\pi$G-Sp$^2$GNO) for learning the solution operators of time-independent and time-dependent PDEs. The proposed approach first improves upon the recently developed Sp$^2$GNO by enabling geometry awareness and subsequently exploits the governing physics to learn the underlying solution operator in a simulation-free setup. While the spatio-spectral structure present in the proposed architecture allows multiscale learning, two separate strategies for enabling geometry awareness is introduced in this paper. For time dependent problems, we also introduce a novel hybrid physics informed loss function that combines higher-order time-marching scheme with upscaled theory inspired stochastic projection scheme. This allows accurate integration of the physics-information into the loss function. The performance of the proposed approach is illustrated on number of benchmark examples involving regular and complex domains, variation in geometry during inference, and time-independent and time-dependent problems. The results obtained illustrate the efficacy of the proposed approach as compared to the state-of-the-art physics-informed neural operator algorithms in the literature.</p></details> |  |

Thus, the USVs need to continuously adapt their paths with real-time information to avoid collisions and follow the path of least resistance to the goal via exploiting ocean currents. In this regard, we introduce a novel algorithm, called Self-Morphing Adaptive Replanning Tree for dynamic Obstacles and Currents (SMART-OC), that facilitates real-time time-risk optimal replanning in dynamic environments. SMART-OC integrates the obstacle risks along a path with the time cost to reach the goal to find the time-risk optimal path. The effectiveness of SMART-OC is validated by simulation experiments, which demonstrate that the USV performs fast replannings to avoid dynamic obstacles and exploit ocean currents to successfully reach the goal.</p></details> |  |

Despite this importance, due to the limitations of urban sensing techniques, the data quality from most sources is inadequate for monitoring crowd flow at each POI. This renders the inference of accurate crowd flow from low-quality data a critical and challenging task. The complexity is heightened by three key factors: 1) \emph{The scarcity and rarity of labeled data}, 2) \emph{The intricate spatio-temporal dependencies among POIs}, and 3) \emph{The myriad correlations between precise crowd flow and GPS reports}. To address these challenges, we recast the crowd flow inference problem as a self-supervised attributed graph representation learning task and introduce a novel \underline{C}ontrastive \underline{S}elf-learning framework for \underline{S}patio-\underline{T}emporal data (\model). Our approach initiates with the construction of a spatial adjacency graph founded on the POIs and their respective distances. We then employ a contrastive learning technique to exploit large volumes of unlabeled spatio-temporal data. We adopt a swapped prediction approach to anticipate the representation of the target subgraph from similar instances. Following the pre-training phase, the model is fine-tuned with accurate crowd flow data. Our experiments, conducted on two real-world datasets, demonstrate that the \model pre-trained on extensive noisy data consistently outperforms models trained from scratch.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, incomplete version</p></details> |
| **[Urban-STA4CLC: Urban Theory-Informed Spatio-Temporal Attention Model for Predicting Post-Disaster Commercial Land Use Change](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08976v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Natural disasters such as hurricanes and wildfires increasingly introduce unusual disturbance on economic activities, which are especially likely to reshape commercial land use pattern given their sensitive to customer visitation. However, current modeling approaches are limited in capturing such complex interplay between human activities and commercial land use change under and following disturbances. Such interactions have been more effectively captured in current resilient urban planning theories. This study designs and calibrates a Urban Theory-Informed Spatio-Temporal Attention Model for Predicting Post-Disaster Commercial Land Use Change (Urban-STA4CLC) to predict both the yearly decline and expansion of commercial land use at census block level under cumulative impact of disasters on human activities over two years. Guided by urban theories, Urban-STA4CLC integrates both spatial and temporal attention mechanisms with three theory-informed modules. Resilience theory guides a disaster-aware temporal attention module that captures visitation dynamics. Spatial economic theory informs a multi-relational spatial attention module for inter-block representation. Diffusion theory contributes a regularization term that constrains land use transitions. The model performs significantly better than non-theoretical baselines in predicting commercial land use change under the scenario of recurrent hurricanes, with around 19% improvement in F1 score (0.8763). The effectiveness of the theory-guided modules was further validated through ablation studies. The research demonstrates that embedding urban theory into commercial land use modeling models may substantially enhance the capacity to capture its gains and losses. These advances in commercial land use modeling contribute to land use research that accounts for cumulative impacts of recurrent disasters and shifts in economic activity patterns.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods often rely on complex module compositions and heavy designs, leading to increased parameter counts, high computational costs, and limited scalability. In this paper, we propose a unified spatio-temporal lightweight transformer framework that integrates spatial and temporal modeling within a single attention module, eliminating the need for separate temporal modeling blocks. This approach reduces redundant computations while preserving temporal awareness within the spatial modeling process. Furthermore, we introduce a simplified multi-scale pooling fusion module that combines local and global pooling pathways to enhance the model's ability to capture fine-grained local movements and overarching global motion patterns. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our lightweight model achieves a superior balance between accuracy and efficiency, reducing parameter complexity by over 58% and lowering computational cost by over 60% compared to state-of-the-art transformer-based baselines, while maintaining competitive recognition performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[B-VLLM: A Vision Large Language Model with Balanced Spatio-Temporal Tokens](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09919v2)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) integrated with vision encoders have shown promising performance in vision understanding. The key of VLLMs is to encode visual content into sequences of visual tokens, enabling VLLMs to simultaneously process both visual and textual content. However, understanding videos, especially long videos, remain a challenge to VLLMs as the number of visual tokens grows rapidly when encoding videos, resulting in the risk of exceeding the context window of VLLMs and introducing heavy computation burden. To restrict the number of visual tokens, existing VLLMs either: (1) uniformly downsample videos into a fixed number of frames or (2) reducing the number of visual tokens encoded from each frame. We argue the former solution neglects the rich temporal cue in videos and the later overlooks the spatial details in each frame. In this work, we present Balanced-VLLM (B-VLLM): a novel VLLM framework that aims to effectively leverage task relevant spatio-temporal cues while restricting the number of visual tokens under the VLLM context window length. At the core of our method, we devise a text-conditioned adaptive frame selection module to identify frames relevant to the visual understanding task. The selected frames are then de-duplicated using a temporal frame token merging technique. The visual tokens of the selected frames are processed through a spatial token sampling module and an optional spatial token merging strategy to achieve precise control over the token count. Experimental results show that B-VLLM is effective in balancing the number of frames and visual tokens in video understanding, yielding superior performance on various video understanding benchmarks.

While many spatio-temporal methods focus on improving accuracy, fairness has recently gained attention due to growing evidence that biased predictions in spatio-temporal applications can disproportionately disadvantage certain demographic or geographic groups, thereby reinforcing existing socioeconomic inequalities and undermining the ethical deployment of AI in public services. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, FairDRL-ST, based on disentangled representation learning, to address fairness concerns in spatio-temporal prediction, with a particular focus on mobility demand forecasting. By leveraging adversarial learning and disentangled representation learning, our framework learns to separate attributes that contain sensitive information. Unlike existing methods that enforce fairness through supervised learning, which may lead to overcompensation and degraded performance, our framework achieves fairness in an unsupervised manner with minimal performance loss. We apply our framework to real-world urban mobility datasets and demonstrate its ability to close fairness gaps while delivering competitive predictive performance compared to state-of-the-art fairness-aware methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a Research Paper (short) at ACM SIGSPATIAL 2025.

However, there exist very limited FL works in surgical data science, and FL methods for other modalities do not consider inherent characteristics in surgical domain: i) different scenarios show diverse anatomical backgrounds while highly similar instrument representation; ii) there exist surgical simulators which promote large-scale synthetic data generation with minimal efforts. In this paper, we propose a novel Personalized FL scheme, Spatio-Temporal Representation Decoupling and Enhancement (FedST), which wisely leverages surgical domain knowledge during both local-site and global-server training to boost segmentation. Concretely, our model embraces a Representation Separation and Cooperation (RSC) mechanism in local-site training, which decouples the query embedding layer to be trained privately, to encode respective backgrounds. Meanwhile, other parameters are optimized globally to capture the consistent representations of instruments, including the temporal layer to capture similar motion patterns. A textual-guided channel selection is further designed to highlight site-specific features, facilitating model adapta tion to each site. Moreover, in global-server training, we propose Synthesis-based Explicit Representation Quantification (SERQ), which defines an explicit representation target based on synthetic data to synchronize the model convergence during fusion for improving model generalization.</p></details> |  |

Given that the typical data (i.e., videos and images) collected by the fleet of UAVs deployed in such scenarios can be considerably larger than what the onboard computers can process, the UAVs need to offload their data in real-time to the edge and the cloud for further processing. To that end, we present the design of AerialDB - a lightweight decentralized data storage and query system that can store and process time series data on a multi-UAV system comprising: A) a fleet of hundreds of UAVs fitted with onboard computers, and B) ground-based edge servers connected through a cellular link. Leveraging lightweight techniques for content-based replica placement and indexing of shards, AerialDB has been optimized for efficient processing of different possible combinations of typical spatial and temporal queries performed by real-world disaster management applications. Using containerized deployment spanning up to 400 drones and 80 edges, we demonstrate that AerialDB is able to scale efficiently while providing near real-time performance with different realistic workloads. Further, AerialDB comprises a decentralized and locality-aware distributed execution engine which provides graceful degradation of performance upon edge failures with relatively low latency while processing large spatio-temporal data. AerialDB exhibits comparable insertion performance and 100 times improvement in query performance against state-of-the-art baseline. Moreover, it exhibits a 10 times and 100 times improvement with insertion and query workloads respectively over the cloud baseline.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce the first treatment-aware spatio-temporal diffusion model that is able to generate future masks demonstrating lesion evolution in MS. Our voxel-space approach incorporates multi-modal patient data, including MRI and treatment information, to forecast new and enlarging T2 (NET2) lesion masks at a future time point. Extensive experiments on a multi-centre dataset of 2131 patient 3D MRIs from randomized clinical trials for relapsing-remitting MS demonstrate that our generative model is able to accurately predict NET2 lesion masks for patients across six different treatments. Moreover, we demonstrate our model has the potential for real-world clinical applications through downstream tasks such as future lesion count and location estimation, binary lesion activity classification, and generating counterfactual future NET2 masks for several treatments with different efficacies. This work highlights the potential of causal, image-based generative models as powerful tools for advancing data-driven prognostics in MS.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to MICCAI 2025 (LMID Workshop)</p></details> |

Land Surface Temperature (LST) is a key variable in this context and is retrieved from remote sensing satellites. However, these systems face a trade-off between spatial and temporal resolution. While spatio-temporal fusion methods offer promising solutions, few have addressed the estimation of daily LST at 10 m resolution. In this study, we present WGAST, a Weakly-Supervised Generative Network for Daily 10 m LST Estimation via Spatio-Temporal Fusion of Terra MODIS, Landsat 8, and Sentinel-2. WGAST is the first end-to-end deep learning framework designed for this task. It adopts a conditional generative adversarial architecture, with a generator composed of four stages: feature extraction, fusion, LST reconstruction, and noise suppression. The first stage employs a set of encoders to extract multi-level latent representations from the inputs, which are then fused in the second stage using cosine similarity, normalization, and temporal attention mechanisms. The third stage decodes the fused features into high-resolution LST, followed by a Gaussian filter to suppress high-frequency noise. Training follows a weakly supervised strategy based on physical averaging principles and reinforced by a PatchGAN discriminator. Experiments demonstrate that WGAST outperforms existing methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Compared to the best-performing baseline, on average, WGAST reduces RMSE by 17.18% and improves SSIM by 11.00%. Furthermore, WGAST is robust to cloud-induced LST and effectively captures fine-scale thermal patterns, as validated against 33 ground-based sensors.

While the fusion of surround-view 4D radar and cameras offers a promising low-cost solution, effectively extracting and integrating features from these heterogeneous sensors remains challenging. This paper introduces MetaOcc, a novel multi-modal framework for omnidirectional 3D occupancy prediction that leverages both multi-view 4D radar and images. To address the limitations of directly applying LiDAR-oriented encoders to sparse radar data, we propose a Radar Height Self-Attention module that enhances vertical spatial reasoning and feature extraction. Additionally, a Hierarchical Multi-scale Multi-modal Fusion strategy is developed to perform adaptive local-global fusion across modalities and time, mitigating spatio-temporal misalignments and enriching fused feature representations. To reduce reliance on expensive point cloud annotations, we further propose a pseudo-label generation pipeline based on an open-set segmentor. This enables a semi-supervised strategy that achieves 90% of the fully supervised performance using only 50% of the ground truth labels, offering an effective trade-off between annotation cost and accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MetaOcc under full supervision achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming previous methods by +0.47 SC IoU and +4.02 mIoU on the OmniHD-Scenes dataset, and by +1.16 SC IoU and +1.24 mIoU on the SurroundOcc-nuScenes dataset. These results demonstrate the scalability and robustness of MetaOcc across sensor domains and training conditions, paving the way for practical deployment in real-world autonomous systems.

Existing work either assumes all locations are equipped with sensors or focuses on short-term forecast. This paper studies partial sensing forecast of long-term traffic, assuming sensors are available only at some locations. The problem is challenging due to the unknown data distribution at unsensed locations, the intricate spatio-temporal correlation in long-term forecasting, as well as noise to traffic patterns. We propose a Spatio-temporal Long-term Partial sensing Forecast model (SLPF) for traffic prediction, with several novel contributions, including a rank-based embedding technique to reduce the impact of noise in data, a spatial transfer matrix to overcome the spatial distribution shift from sensed locations to unsensed locations, and a multi-step training process that utilizes all available data to successively refine the model parameters for better accuracy. Extensive experiments on several real-world traffic datasets demonstrate its superior performance.

We implement a Bayesian hierarchical Beta regression model to analyze regional obesity rates, integrating spatial and temporal random effects, alongside gender and various exogenous predictors. The model leverages the Stochastic Search Variable Selection technique to identify significant predictors supported by the data. The analysis reveals both regional heterogeneity and dependence in obesity rates over the study period, emphasizing the importance of considering gender and spatial correlation in explaining its dynamics over time. In fact, the inclusion of structured spatial and temporal random effects captures the complexities of regional variations over time. These random effects, along with gender, emerge as the primary determinants of obesity prevalence across Italian regions, while the role of exogenous covariates is found to be minimal at the regional level. While socioeconomic and lifestyle factors remain fundamental at a micro-level, the findings demonstrate that the integration of spatial and temporal structures is critical for capturing macro-level obesity variations.</p></details> |  |

LiDAR-based 4D point clouds provide precise spatial geometry and rich temporal cues, making them ideal for representing real-world scenes. However, despite their potential, 4D LiDAR remains underexplored in the context of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) due to the absence of high-quality, modality-specific annotations and the lack of MLLM architectures capable of processing its high-dimensional composition. To address these challenges, we introduce B4DL, a new benchmark specifically designed for training and evaluating MLLMs on 4D LiDAR understanding. In addition, we propose a scalable data generation pipeline and an MLLM model that, for the first time, directly processes raw 4D LiDAR by bridging it with language understanding. Combined with our dataset and benchmark, our model offers a unified solution for spatio-temporal reasoning in dynamic outdoor environments.

| **[Robust Spatio-Temporal Distributional Regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05041v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by investigating spatio-temporal patterns of the distribution of continuous variables, we consider describing the conditional distribution function of the response variable incorporating spatio-temporal components given predictors. In many applications, continuous variables are observed only as threshold-categorized data due to measurement constraints. For instance, ecological measurements often categorize sizes into intervals rather than recording exact values due to practical limitations. To recover the conditional distribution function of the underlying continuous variables, we consider a distribution regression employing models for binomial data obtained at each threshold value. However, depending on spatio-temporal conditions and predictors, the distribution function may frequently exhibit boundary values (zero or one), which can occur either structurally or randomly. This makes standard binomial models inadequate, requiring more flexible modeling approaches. To address this issue, we propose a boundary-inflated binomial model incorporating spatio-temporal components. The model is a three-component mixture of the binomial model and two Dirac measures at zero and one. We develop a computationally efficient Bayesian inference algorithm using P\'olya-Gamma data augmentation and dynamic Gaussian predictive processes. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that our procedure significantly outperforms distribution regression methods based on standard binomial models across various scenarios.</p></details> | 29 pages, 1 figure |

To solve this problem, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Aggregation eorganization ransformer (STARFormer) that effectively captures both spatial and temporal features of BOLD signals by incorporating three key modules. The region of interest (ROI) spatial structure analysis module uses eigenvector centrality (EC) to reorganize brain regions based on effective connectivity, highlighting critical spatial relationships relevant to the brain disorder. The temporal feature reorganization module systematically segments the time series into equal-dimensional window tokens and captures multiscale features through variable window and cross-window attention. The spatio-temporal feature fusion module employs a parallel transformer architecture with dedicated temporal and spatial branches to extract integrated features. The proposed STARFormer has been rigorously evaluated on two publicly available datasets for the classification of ASD and ADHD. The experimental results confirm that the STARFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple evaluation metrics, providing a more accurate and reliable tool for the diagnosis of brain disorders and biomedical research.

This high dimensionality necessitates computationally efficient models and benefits from applying univariate forecasting approaches through channel-independent strategies. SparseTSF, a recently proposed competitive univariate forecasting model, leverages periodicity to achieve compactness by focusing on cross-period dynamics, extending the Pareto frontier in terms of model size and predictive performance. However, it underperforms on spatio-temporal data due to limited capture of intra-period temporal dependencies. To address this limitation, we propose UltraSTF, which integrates a cross-period forecasting component with an ultra-compact shape bank component. Our model efficiently captures recurring patterns in time series using the attention mechanism of the shape bank component, significantly enhancing its capability to learn intra-period dynamics. UltraSTF achieves state-of-the-art performance on the LargeST benchmark while utilizing fewer than 0.2% of the parameters required by the second-best methods, thereby further extending the Pareto frontier of existing approaches.</p></details> |  |

The architecture, called STARE (Spatio-Temporal Attention Representation for Eye Tracking), uses a new tokenization strategy, which involves mapping the x- and y- pixel coordinates of eye-movement time series on predefined, contiguous Regions of Interest. That tokenization makes the spatio-temporal eye-movement data available to the Chronos, a time-series foundation model based on the T5 architecture, to which co-attention and/or cross-attention is added to capture directional and/or interocular influences of eye movements. We compare STARE with several state-of-the art alternatives on multiple datasets with the purpose of predicting consumer choice behaviors from eye movements. We thus make a first step towards developing and testing DL architectures that represent visual attention dynamics rooted in the neurophysiology of eye movements.</p></details> |  |

Prior work primarily focuses on single-frame cooperative perception, which fuses agents' information across different spatial locations but ignores temporal cues and temporal tasks (e.g., temporal perception and prediction). In this paper, we focus on the spatio-temporal fusion in V2X scenarios and design one-step and multi-step communication strategies (when to transmit) as well as examine their integration with three fusion strategies - early, late, and intermediate (what to transmit), providing comprehensive benchmarks with 11 fusion models (how to fuse). Furthermore, we propose V2XPnP, a novel intermediate fusion framework within one-step communication for end-to-end perception and prediction. Our framework employs a unified Transformer-based architecture to effectively model complex spatio-temporal relationships across multiple agents, frames, and high-definition maps. Moreover, we introduce the V2XPnP Sequential Dataset that supports all V2X collaboration modes and addresses the limitations of existing real-world datasets, which are restricted to single-frame or single-mode cooperation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both perception and prediction tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025, Website link: https://mobility-lab.seas.ucla.edu/v2xpnp/</p></details> |
| **[Data-Driven Spectrum Demand Prediction: A Spatio-Temporal Framework with Transfer Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03863v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate spectrum demand prediction is crucial for informed spectrum allocation, effective regulatory planning, and fostering sustainable growth in modern wireless communication networks. It supports governmental efforts, particularly those led by the international telecommunication union (ITU), to establish fair spectrum allocation policies, improve auction mechanisms, and meet the requirements of emerging technologies such as advanced 5G, forthcoming 6G, and the internet of things (IoT). This paper presents an effective spatio-temporal prediction framework that leverages crowdsourced user-side key performance indicators (KPIs) and regulatory datasets to model and forecast spectrum demand. The proposed methodology achieves superior prediction accuracy and cross-regional generalizability by incorporating advanced feature engineering, comprehensive correlation analysis, and transfer learning techniques. Unlike traditional ITU models, which are often constrained by arbitrary inputs and unrealistic assumptions, this approach exploits granular, data-driven insights to account for spatial and temporal variations in spectrum utilization. Comparative evaluations against ITU estimates, as the benchmark, underscore our framework's capability to deliver more realistic and actionable predictions. Experimental results validate the efficacy of our methodology, highlighting its potential as a robust approach for policymakers and regulatory bodies to enhance spectrum management and planning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to be presented at IEEE PIMRC 2025</p></details> |

With the rapid advancements in virtual/augmented reality, metaverse, and generative artificial intelligence, the demand for high-quality ODVs is surging. However, ODVs often suffer from low resolution due to their wide field of view and limitations in capturing devices and transmission bandwidth. Although video super-resolution (SR) is a capable video quality enhancement technique, the performance ceiling and practical generalization of existing methods are limited when applied to ODVs due to their unique attributes. To alleviate spatial projection distortions and temporal flickering of ODVs, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Distortion Aware Network (STDAN) with joint spatio-temporal alignment and reconstruction. Specifically, we incorporate a spatio-temporal continuous alignment (STCA) to mitigate discrete geometric artifacts in parallel with temporal alignment. Subsequently, we introduce an interlaced multi-frame reconstruction (IMFR) to enhance temporal consistency. Furthermore, we employ latitude-saliency adaptive (LSA) weights to focus on regions with higher texture complexity and human-watching interest. By exploring a spatio-temporal jointly framework and real-world viewing strategies, STDAN effectively reinforces spatio-temporal coherence on a novel ODV-SR dataset and ensures affordable computational costs. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that STDAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in improving visual fidelity and dynamic smoothness of ODVs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Forgetting and Spatio-Temporal Periodic Interest Modeling for Local-Life Service Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02451v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the context of the booming digital economy, recommendation systems, as a key link connecting users and numerous services, face challenges in modeling user behavior sequences on local-life service platforms, including the sparsity of long sequences and strong spatio-temporal dependence. Such challenges can be addressed by drawing an analogy to the forgetting process in human memory. This is because users' responses to recommended content follow the recency effect and the cyclicality of memory. By exploring this, this paper introduces the forgetting curve and proposes Spatio-Temporal periodic Interest Modeling (STIM) with long sequences for local-life service recommendation. STIM integrates three key components: a dynamic masking module based on the forgetting curve, which is used to extract both recent spatiotemporal features and periodic spatiotemporal features; a query-based mixture of experts (MoE) approach that can adaptively activate expert networks under different dynamic masks, enabling the collaborative modeling of time, location, and items; and a hierarchical multi-interest network unit, which captures multi-interest representations by modeling the hierarchical interactions between the shallow and deep semantics of users' recent behaviors. By introducing the STIM method, we conducted online A/B tests and achieved a 1.54\% improvement in gross transaction volume (GTV). In addition, extended offline experiments also showed improvements. STIM has been deployed in a large-scale local-life service recommendation system, serving hundreds of millions of daily active users in core application scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[DMTrack: Spatio-Temporal Multimodal Tracking via Dual-Adapter](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01592v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we explore adapter tuning and introduce a novel dual-adapter architecture for spatio-temporal multimodal tracking, dubbed DMTrack. The key of our DMTrack lies in two simple yet effective modules, including a spatio-temporal modality adapter (STMA) and a progressive modality complementary adapter (PMCA) module. The former, applied to each modality alone, aims to adjust spatio-temporal features extracted from a frozen backbone by self-prompting, which to some extent can bridge the gap between different modalities and thus allows better cross-modality fusion. The latter seeks to facilitate cross-modality prompting progressively with two specially designed pixel-wise shallow and deep adapters. The shallow adapter employs shared parameters between the two modalities, aiming to bridge the information flow between the two modality branches, thereby laying the foundation for following modality fusion, while the deep adapter modulates the preliminarily fused information flow with pixel-wise inner-modal attention and further generates modality-aware prompts through pixel-wise inter-modal attention. With such designs, DMTrack achieves promising spatio-temporal multimodal tracking performance with merely \textbf{0.93M} trainable parameters. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks show that DMTrack achieves state-of-the-art results. Code will be available.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Spatio-temporal Continuous Network for Stochastic 3D Human Motion Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01585v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stochastic Human Motion Prediction (HMP) has received increasing attention due to its wide applications. Despite the rapid progress in generative fields, existing methods often face challenges in learning continuous temporal dynamics and predicting stochastic motion sequences. They tend to overlook the flexibility inherent in complex human motions and are prone to mode collapse. To alleviate these issues, we propose a novel method called STCN, for stochastic and continuous human motion prediction, which consists of two stages. Specifically, in the first stage, we propose a spatio-temporal continuous network to generate smoother human motion sequences. In addition, the anchor set is innovatively introduced into the stochastic HMP task to prevent mode collapse, which refers to the potential human motion patterns. In the second stage, STCN endeavors to acquire the Gaussian mixture distribution (GMM) of observed motion sequences with the aid of the anchor set. It also focuses on the probability associated with each anchor, and employs the strategy of sampling multiple sequences from each anchor to alleviate intra-class differences in human motions. Experimental results on two widely-used datasets (Human3.6M and HumanEva-I) demonstrate that our model obtains competitive performance on both diversity and accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modeling high and low extremes with a novel dynamic spatio-temporal model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01481v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extreme environmental events such as severe storms, drought, heat waves, flash floods, and abrupt species collapse have become more prevalent in the earth-atmosphere dynamic system in recent years. In order to fully understand the underlying mechanisms and enhance informed decision-making, a flexible model capable of accommodating extremes is necessary. Existing dynamic spatio-temporal statistical models exhibit limitations in capturing extremes when assuming Gaussian error distributions, whereas the current models for spatial extremes mostly assume temporal independence and are focused on joint upper tails at two or more locations. Here, we introduce a new class of dynamic spatio-temporal models that capture both high and low extremes using a mixture of heavy- and light-tailed distributions with varying tail indices. Our framework flexibly identifies extremal dependence and independence in both space and time with uncertainty quantification and supports missing data prediction, as in other dynamic spatio-temporal models. We demonstrate its effectiveness using a large reanalysis dataset of hourly particulate matter in the Central United States.</p></details> |  |
| **[Point-wise Diffusion Models for Physical Systems with Shape Variations: Application to Spatio-temporal and Large-scale system](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01230v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study introduces a novel point-wise diffusion model that processes spatio-temporal points independently to efficiently predict complex physical systems with shape variations. This methodological contribution lies in applying forward and backward diffusion processes at individual spatio-temporal points, coupled with a point-wise diffusion transformer architecture for denoising. Unlike conventional image-based diffusion models that operate on structured data representations, this framework enables direct processing of any data formats including meshes and point clouds while preserving geometric fidelity. We validate our approach across three distinct physical domains with complex geometric configurations: 2D spatio-temporal systems including cylinder fluid flow and OLED drop impact test, and 3D large-scale system for road-car external aerodynamics. To justify the necessity of our point-wise approach for real-time prediction applications, we employ denoising diffusion implicit models (DDIM) for efficient deterministic sampling, requiring only 5-10 steps compared to traditional 1000-step and providing computational speedup of 100 to 200 times during inference without compromising accuracy. In addition, our proposed model achieves superior performance compared to image-based diffusion model: reducing training time by 94.4% and requiring 89.0% fewer parameters while achieving over 28% improvement in prediction accuracy. Comprehensive comparisons against data-flexible surrogate models including DeepONet and Meshgraphnet demonstrate consistent superiority of our approach across all three physical systems. To further refine the proposed model, we investigate two key aspects: 1) comparison of final physical states prediction or incremental change prediction, and 2) computational efficiency evaluation across varying subsampling ratios (10%-100%).</p></details> |  |
| **[HyPCV-Former: Hyperbolic Spatio-Temporal Transformer for 3D Point Cloud Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00473v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection is a fundamental task in video surveillance, with broad applications in public safety and intelligent monitoring systems. Although previous methods leverage Euclidean representations in RGB or depth domains, such embeddings are inherently limited in capturing hierarchical event structures and spatio-temporal continuity. To address these limitations, we propose HyPCV-Former, a novel hyperbolic spatio-temporal transformer for anomaly detection in 3D point cloud videos. Our approach first extracts per-frame spatial features from point cloud sequences via point cloud extractor, and then embeds them into Lorentzian hyperbolic space, which better captures the latent hierarchical structure of events. To model temporal dynamics, we introduce a hyperbolic multi-head self-attention (HMHA) mechanism that leverages Lorentzian inner products and curvature-aware softmax to learn temporal dependencies under non-Euclidean geometry. Our method performs all feature transformations and anomaly scoring directly within full Lorentzian space rather than via tangent space approximation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HyPCV-Former achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple anomaly categories, with a 7\% improvement on the TIMo dataset and a 5.6\% gain on the DAD dataset compared to benchmarks. The code will be released upon paper acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mamba-based Efficient Spatio-Frequency Motion Perception for Video Camouflaged Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23601v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing video camouflaged object detection (VCOD) methods primarily rely on spatial appearance features to perceive motion cues for breaking camouflage. However, the high similarity between foreground and background in VCOD results in limited discriminability of spatial appearance features (e.g., color and texture), restricting detection accuracy and completeness. Recent studies demonstrate that frequency features can not only enhance feature representation to compensate for appearance limitations but also perceive motion through dynamic variations in frequency energy. Furthermore, the emerging state space model called Mamba, enables efficient perception of motion cues in frame sequences due to its linear-time long-sequence modeling capability. Motivated by this, we propose a novel visual camouflage Mamba (Vcamba) based on spatio-frequency motion perception that integrates frequency and spatial features for efficient and accurate VCOD. Specifically, we propose a receptive field visual state space (RFVSS) module to extract multi-scale spatial features after sequence modeling. For frequency learning, we introduce an adaptive frequency component enhancement (AFE) module with a novel frequency-domain sequential scanning strategy to maintain semantic consistency. Then we propose a space-based long-range motion perception (SLMP) module and a frequency-based long-range motion perception (FLMP) module to model spatio-temporal and frequency-temporal sequences in spatial and frequency phase domains. Finally, the space and frequency motion fusion module (SFMF) integrates dual-domain features for unified motion representation. Experimental results show that our Vcamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods across 6 evaluation metrics on 2 datasets with lower computation cost, confirming the superiority of Vcamba. Our code is available at: https://github.com/BoydeLi/Vcamba.</p></details> | 11 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Adjustable Spatio-Spectral Hyperspectral Image Compression Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23447v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid growth of hyperspectral data archives in remote sensing (RS), the need for efficient storage has become essential, driving significant attention toward learning-based hyperspectral image (HSI) compression. However, a comprehensive investigation of the individual and joint effects of spectral and spatial compression on learning-based HSI compression has not been thoroughly examined yet. Conducting such an analysis is crucial for understanding how the exploitation of spectral, spatial, and joint spatio-spectral redundancies affects HSI compression. To address this issue, we propose Adjustable Spatio-Spectral Hyperspectral Image Compression Network (HyCASS), a learning-based model designed for adjustable HSI compression in both spectral and spatial dimensions. HyCASS consists of six main modules: 1) spectral encoder; 2) spatial encoder; 3) compression ratio (CR) adapter encoder; 4) CR adapter decoder; 5) spatial decoder; and 6) spectral decoder module. The modules employ convolutional layers and transformer blocks to capture both short-range and long-range redundancies. Experimental results on two HSI benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed adjustable model compared to existing learning-based compression models. Based on our results, we establish a guideline for effectively balancing spectral and spatial compression across different CRs, taking into account the spatial resolution of the HSIs. Our code and pre-trained model weights are publicly available at https://git.tu-berlin.de/rsim/hycass .</p></details> |  |

A valuable approach to studying them requires accurate spatio-temporal information on land surface conditions. One of the most important variables for assessing and understanding these phenomena is Land Surface Temperature (LST), which is derived from satellites and provides essential information about the thermal state of the Earth's surface. However, satellite platforms inherently face a trade-off between spatial and temporal resolutions. To bridge this gap, we propose FuseTen, a novel generative framework that produces daily LST observations at a fine 10 m spatial resolution by fusing spatio-temporal observations derived from Sentinel-2, Landsat 8, and Terra MODIS. FuseTen employs a generative architecture trained using an averaging-based supervision strategy grounded in physical principles. It incorporates attention and normalization modules within the fusion process and uses a PatchGAN discriminator to enforce realism. Experiments across multiple dates show that FuseTen outperforms linear baselines, with an average 32.06% improvement in quantitative metrics and 31.42% in visual fidelity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first non-linear method to generate daily LST estimates at such fine spatial resolution.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in the 2025 International Conference on Machine Intelligence for GeoAnalytics and Remote Sensing (MIGARS)</p></details> |
| **[Multivariate Spatio-temporal Modelling for Completing Cancer Registries and Forecasting Incidence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21714v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cancer data, particularly cancer incidence and mortality, are fundamental to understand the cancer burden, to set targets for cancer control and to evaluate the evolution of the implementation of a cancer control policy. However, the complexity of data collection, classification, validation and processing result in cancer incidence figures often lagging two to three years behind the calendar year. In response, national or regional population-based cancer registries (PBCRs) are increasingly interested in methods for forecasting cancer incidence. However, in many countries there is an additional difficulty in projecting cancer incidence as regional registries are usually not established in the same year and therefore cancer incidence data series between different regions of a country are not harmonised over time. This study addresses the challenge of forecasting cancer incidence with incomplete data at both regional and national levels. To achieve our objective, we propose the use of multivariate spatio-temporal shared component models that jointly model mortality data and available cancer incidence data. The performance of these multivariate models are analyzed using lung cancer incidence data, together with the number of deaths reported in England in the period 2001-2019. Different model predictive measures have been calculated to select the best model.</p></details> | 36 pages |

However, these box annotations require tremendous human effort, limiting the scale and diversity of existing tracking datasets. In this work, we present a novel Self-Supervised Tracking framework named \textbf{{\tracker}}, designed to eliminate the need of box annotations. Specifically, a decoupled spatio-temporal consistency training framework is proposed to learn rich target information across timestamps through global spatial localization and local temporal association. This allows for the simulation of appearance and motion variations of instances in real-world scenarios. Furthermore, an instance contrastive loss is designed to learn instance-level correspondences from a multi-view perspective, offering robust instance supervision without additional labels. This new design paradigm enables {\tracker} to effectively learn generic tracking representations in a self-supervised manner, while reducing reliance on extensive box annotations. Extensive experiments on nine benchmark datasets demonstrate that {\tracker} surpasses \textit{SOTA} self-supervised tracking methods, achieving an improvement of more than 25.3\%, 20.4\%, and 14.8\% in AUC (AO) score on the GOT10K, LaSOT, TrackingNet datasets, respectively.

First, a graph is built based on building characteristics and environmental factors. Next, a multi-level graph convolutional architecture with attention is developed for energy prediction. Lastly, a method interpreting the optimized graph structure is introduced. Experiments on the Building Data Genome Project 2 dataset confirm superior performance over baselines such as XGBoost, SVR, FCNN, GRU, and Naive, highlighting the method's robustness, generalization, and interpretability in capturing meaningful building similarities and spatial relationships.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches often struggle to effectively model the intricate interdependencies among spatial, temporal, and contextual variables that govern accident outcomes. In this study, we introduce STARN-GAT, a Multi-Modal Spatio-Temporal Graph Attention Network, which leverages adaptive graph construction and modality-aware attention mechanisms to capture these complex relationships. Unlike conventional methods, STARN-GAT integrates road network topology, temporal traffic patterns, and environmental context within a unified attention-based framework. The model is evaluated on the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) dataset, achieving a Macro F1-score of 85 percent, ROC-AUC of 0.91, and recall of 81 percent for severe incidents. To ensure generalizability within the South Asian context, STARN-GAT is further validated on the ARI-BUET traffic accident dataset, where it attains a Macro F1-score of 0.84, recall of 0.78, and ROC-AUC of 0.89. These results demonstrate the model's effectiveness in identifying high-risk cases and its potential for deployment in real-time, safety-critical traffic management systems. Furthermore, the attention-based architecture enhances interpretability, offering insights into contributing factors and supporting trust in AI-assisted decision-making. Overall, STARN-GAT bridges the gap between advanced graph neural network techniques and practical applications in road safety analytics.</p></details> | 10 pages |

Existing state-of-the-art methods, like Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs), achieve high imputation accuracy; however, they suffer from significant computational costs and are notably time-consuming due to their iterative nature. In this work, we propose CoSTI, an innovative adaptation of Consistency Models (CMs) for the MTSI domain. CoSTI employs Consistency Training to achieve comparable imputation quality to DDPMs while drastically reducing inference times, making it more suitable for real-time applications. We evaluate CoSTI across multiple datasets and missing data scenarios, demonstrating up to a 98% reduction in imputation time with performance on par with diffusion-based models.

However, obtaining lane-level traffic data has become a critical bottleneck for data-driven models due to limitations in the types and number of sensors and issues with the accuracy of tracking algorithms. To address this, we propose the Fine-grained Road Traffic Inference (FRTI) task, which aims to generate more detailed lane-level traffic information using limited road data, providing a more energy-efficient and cost-effective solution for precise traffic management. This task is abstracted as the first scene of the spatio-temporal graph node generation problem. We designed a two-stage framework--RoadDiff--to solve the FRTI task. solve the FRTI task. This framework leverages the Road-Lane Correlation Autoencoder-Decoder and the Lane Diffusion Module to fully utilize the limited spatio-temporal dependencies and distribution relationships of road data to accurately infer fine-grained lane traffic states. Based on existing research, we designed several baseline models with the potential to solve the FRTI task and conducted extensive experiments on six datasets representing different road conditions to validate the effectiveness of the RoadDiff model in addressing the FRTI task.

| **[Bridging Sequential Deep Operator Network and Video Diffusion: Residual Refinement of Spatio-Temporal PDE Solutions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06133v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video-diffusion models have recently set the standard in video generation, inpainting, and domain translation thanks to their training stability and high perceptual fidelity. Building on these strengths, we repurpose conditional video diffusion as a physics surrogate for spatio-temporal fields governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). Our two-stage surrogate first applies a Sequential Deep Operator Network (S-DeepONet) to produce a coarse, physics-consistent prior from the prescribed boundary or loading conditions. The prior is then passed to a conditional video diffusion model that learns only the residual: the point-wise difference between the ground truth and the S-DeepONet prediction. By shifting the learning burden from the full solution to its much smaller residual space, diffusion can focus on sharpening high-frequency structures without sacrificing global coherence. The framework is assessed on two disparate benchmarks: (i) vortex-dominated lid-driven cavity flow and (ii) tensile plastic deformation of dogbone specimens. Across these data sets the hybrid surrogate consistently outperforms its single-stage counterpart, cutting the mean relative L2 error from 4.57% to 0.83% for the flow problem and from 4.42% to 2.94% for plasticity, a relative improvements of 81.8% and 33.5% respectively. The hybrid approach not only lowers quantitative errors but also improves visual quality, visibly recovering fine spatial details. These results show that (i) conditioning diffusion on a physics-aware prior enables faithful reconstruction of localized features, (ii) residual learning reduces the problem, accelerating convergence and enhancing accuracy, and (iii) the same architecture transfers seamlessly from incompressible flow to nonlinear elasto-plasticity without problem-specific architectural modifications, highlighting its broad applicability to nonlinear, time-dependent continua.</p></details> |  |
| **[IntentVCNet: Bridging Spatio-Temporal Gaps for Intention-Oriented Controllable Video Captioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18531v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intent-oriented controlled video captioning aims to generate targeted descriptions for specific targets in a video based on customized user intent. Current Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) have gained strong instruction following and visual comprehension capabilities. Although the LVLMs demonstrated proficiency in spatial and temporal understanding respectively, it was not able to perform fine-grained spatial control in time sequences in direct response to instructions. This substantial spatio-temporal gap complicates efforts to achieve fine-grained intention-oriented control in video. Towards this end, we propose a novel IntentVCNet that unifies the temporal and spatial understanding knowledge inherent in LVLMs to bridge the spatio-temporal gap from both prompting and model perspectives. Specifically, we first propose a prompt combination strategy designed to enable LLM to model the implicit relationship between prompts that characterize user intent and video sequences. We then propose a parameter efficient box adapter that augments the object semantic information in the global visual context so that the visual token has a priori information about the user intent. The final experiment proves that the combination of the two strategies can further enhance the LVLM's ability to model spatial details in video sequences, and facilitate the LVLMs to accurately generate controlled intent-oriented captions. Our proposed method achieved state-of-the-art results in several open source LVLMs and was the runner-up in the IntentVC challenge. Our code is available on https://github.com/thqiu0419/IntentVCNet.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose a hybrid spatio-temporal modeling framework that combines the interpretability and uncertainty quantification of Bayesian models -- estimated using the INLA-SPDE approach -- with the predictive power and flexibility of Random Forest (RF). Specifically, we introduce two novel algorithms, collectively named INLA-RF, which integrate a statistical spatio-temporal model with RF in an iterative two-stage framework. The first algorithm (INLA-RF1) incorporates RF predictions as an offset in the INLA-SPDE model, while the second (INLA-RF2) uses RF to directly correct selected latent field nodes. Both hybrid strategies enable uncertainty propagation between modeling stages, an aspect often overlooked in existing hybrid approaches. In addition, we propose a Kullback-Leibler divergence-based stopping criterion. We evaluate the predictive performance and uncertainty quantification capabilities of the proposed algorithms through two simulation studies. Results suggest that our hybrid approach enhances spatio-temporal prediction while maintaining interpretability and coherence in uncertainty estimates.</p></details> |  |
| **[LSDM: LLM-Enhanced Spatio-temporal Diffusion Model for Service-Level Mobile Traffic Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17795v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Service-level mobile traffic prediction for individual users is essential for network efficiency and quality of service enhancement. However, current prediction methods are limited in their adaptability across different urban environments and produce inaccurate results due to the high uncertainty in personal traffic patterns, the lack of detailed environmental context, and the complex dependencies among different network services. These challenges demand advanced modeling techniques that can capture dynamic traffic distributions and rich environmental features. Inspired by the recent success of diffusion models in distribution modeling and Large Language Models (LLMs) in contextual understanding, we propose an LLM-Enhanced Spatio-temporal Diffusion Model (LSDM). LSDM integrates the generative power of diffusion models with the adaptive learning capabilities of transformers, augmented by the ability to capture multimodal environmental information for modeling service-level patterns and dynamics. Extensive evaluations on real-world service-level datasets demonstrate that the model excels in traffic usage predictions, showing outstanding generalization and adaptability. After incorporating contextual information via LLM, the performance improves by at least 2.83% in terms of the coefficient of determination. Compared to models of a similar type, such as CSDI, the root mean squared error can be reduced by at least 8.29%. The code and dataset will be available at: https://github.com/SoftYuaneR/LSDM.</p></details> | 14 pages, 9 figures |

This allows for modeling non-linearities and interactions among predictor variables in a flexible data-driven manner and for accounting for spatio-temporal variation that is not explained by observable predictor variables. We also show how estimation and prediction can be done in a computationally efficient manner. In an application to a large U.S. mortgage credit risk data set, we find that both predictive default probabilities for individual loans and predictive loan portfolio loss distributions obtained with our novel approach are more accurate compared to conventional independent linear hazard models and also linear spatio-temporal models. Using interpretability tools for machine learning models, we find that the likely reasons for this outperformance are strong interaction and non-linear effects in the predictor variables and the presence of spatio-temporal frailty effects.</p></details> |  |

We propose COMPASS, a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework that enables decentralized agents to persistently monitor multiple moving targets efficiently. We model the environment as a graph, where nodes represent spatial locations and edges capture topological proximity, allowing agents to reason over structured layouts and revisit informative regions as needed. Each agent independently selects actions based on a shared spatio-temporal attention network that we design to integrate historical observations and spatial context. We model target dynamics using Gaussian Processes (GPs), which support principled belief updates and enable uncertainty-aware planning. We train COMPASS using centralized value estimation and decentralized policy execution under an adaptive reward setting. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that COMPASS consistently outperforms strong baselines in uncertainty reduction, target coverage, and coordination efficiency across dynamic multi-target scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reducing GPU Memory Fragmentation via Spatio-Temporal Planning for Efficient Large-Scale Model Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16274v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid scaling of large language models (LLMs) has significantly increased GPU memory pressure, which is further aggravated by training optimization techniques such as virtual pipeline and recomputation that disrupt tensor lifespans and introduce considerable memory fragmentation. Default GPU memory allocators of popular deep learning frameworks like PyTorch use online strategies without knowledge of tensor lifespans, which can waste up to 43\% of memory and cause out-of-memory errors, rendering optimization techniques ineffective or even unusable. To address this, we introduce STWeaver, a GPU memory allocator for deep learning frameworks that reduces fragmentation by exploiting the spatial and temporal regularity in memory allocation behaviors of training workloads. STWeaver introduces a novel paradigm that combines offline planning with online allocation. The offline planning leverages spatio-temporal regularities to generate a near-optimal allocation plan, while the online allocation handles complex and dynamic models such as Mixture-of-Experts (MoE). Built as a pluggable PyTorch allocator, STWeaver reduces fragmentation ratio on average by 79.2\% (up to 100\%) across both dense and sparse models, with negligible overhead. This enables more efficient, high-throughput training configurations and improves performance by up to 32.5\%.</p></details> |  |
| **[STL-GO: Spatio-Temporal Logic with Graph Operators for Distributed Systems with Multiple Network Topologies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15147v1)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent systems (MASs) consisting of a number of autonomous agents that communicate, coordinate, and jointly sense the environment to achieve complex missions can be found in a variety of applications such as robotics, smart cities, and internet-of-things applications. Modeling and monitoring MAS requirements to guarantee overall mission objectives, safety, and reliability is an important problem. Such requirements implicitly require reasoning about diverse sensing and communication modalities between agents, analysis of the dependencies between agent tasks, and the spatial or virtual distance between agents. To capture such rich MAS requirements, we model agent interactions via multiple directed graphs, and introduce a new logic -- Spatio-Temporal Logic with Graph Operators (STL-GO). The key innovation in STL-GO are graph operators that enable us to reason about the number of agents along either the incoming or outgoing edges of the underlying interaction graph that satisfy a given property of interest; for example, the requirement that an agent should sense at least two neighboring agents whose task graphs indicate the ability to collaborate. We then propose novel distributed monitoring conditions for individual agents that use only local information to determine whether or not an STL-GO specification is satisfied. We compare the expressivity of STL-GO against existing spatio-temporal logic formalisms, and demonstrate the utility of STL-GO and our distributed monitors in a bike-sharing and a multi-drone case study.</p></details> |  |

Most existing methods rely on binary classifiers trained using real and fake image sequences, therefore hindering their generalization capabilities to unseen generation methods. Moreover, with the constant progress in generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), deepfake artifacts are becoming imperceptible at both the spatial and the temporal levels, making them extremely difficult to capture. To address these issues, we propose a fine-grained deepfake video detection approach called FakeSTormer that enforces the modeling of subtle spatio-temporal inconsistencies while avoiding overfitting. Specifically, we introduce a multi-task learning framework that incorporates two auxiliary branches for explicitly attending artifact-prone spatial and temporal regions. Additionally, we propose a video-level data synthesis strategy that generates pseudo-fake videos with subtle spatio-temporal artifacts, providing high-quality samples and hand-free annotations for our additional branches. Extensive experiments on several challenging benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared to recent state-of-the-art methods.

In this paper, we demonstrate that effective information compression may occur over time or space during sequences of node communications in distributed algorithms, leading to the concept of spatio-temporal compressors. This abstraction classifies existing compressors and inspires new compressors as spatio-temporal compressors, with their effectiveness described by constructive stability criteria from nonlinear system theory. Subsequently, we incorporate these spatio-temporal compressors directly into standard continuous-time consensus flows and distributed primal-dual flows, establishing conditions ensuring exponential convergence. Additionally, we introduce a novel observer-based distributed primal-dual continuous flow integrated with spatio-temporal compressors, which provides broader convergence conditions. These continuous flows achieve exponential convergence to the global optimum when the objective function is strongly convex and can be discretized using Euler approximations.

While 3D CNNs have been effective at capturing spatiotemporal dynamics, recent Transformer models leverage self-attention to model long-range spatial and temporal dependencies. Despite achieving state-of-the-art performance on major benchmarks, Transformers remain computationally expensive, particularly with dense video data. To address this, we propose a lightweight Video Focal Modulation Network, DVFL-Net, which distills spatiotemporal knowledge from a large pre-trained teacher into a compact nano student model, enabling efficient on-device deployment. DVFL-Net utilizes knowledge distillation and spatial-temporal feature modulation to significantly reduce computation while preserving high recognition performance. We employ forward Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence alongside spatio-temporal focal modulation to effectively transfer both local and global context from the Video-FocalNet Base (teacher) to the proposed VFL-Net (student). We evaluate DVFL-Net on UCF50, UCF101, HMDB51, SSV2, and Kinetics-400, benchmarking it against recent state-of-the-art methods in Human Action Recognition (HAR). Additionally, we conduct a detailed ablation study analyzing the impact of forward KL divergence. The results confirm the superiority of DVFL-Net in achieving an optimal balance between performance and efficiency, demonstrating lower memory usage, reduced GFLOPs, and strong accuracy, making it a practical solution for real-time HAR applications.</p></details> | 17 pages |

Previous methods solve the issue of insufficient observation by leveraging 4D diffusion models to generate videos at novel viewpoints. However, the generated videos from these models often lack spatio-temporal consistency, thus degrading view synthesis quality. In this paper, we propose a novel sliding iterative denoising process to enhance the spatio-temporal consistency of the 4D diffusion model. Specifically, we define a latent grid in which each latent encodes the image, camera pose, and human pose for a certain viewpoint and timestamp, then alternately denoising the latent grid along spatial and temporal dimensions with a sliding window, and finally decode the videos at target viewpoints from the corresponding denoised latents. Through the iterative sliding, information flows sufficiently across the latent grid, allowing the diffusion model to obtain a large receptive field and thus enhance the 4D consistency of the output, while making the GPU memory consumption affordable. The experiments on the DNA-Rendering and ActorsHQ datasets demonstrate that our method is able to synthesize high-quality and consistent novel-view videos and significantly outperforms the existing approaches.

It serves as a cornerstone for achieving high-level autonomous driving. However, current approaches remain inadequate for accurately modeling the complex spatio-temporal interdependencies and the unpredictable variability of human driving behavior. To address these challenges, we propose CaSTFormer, a Causal Spatio-Temporal Transformer to explicitly model causal interactions between driver behavior and environmental context for robust intention prediction. Specifically, CaSTFormer introduces a novel Reciprocal Shift Fusion (RSF) mechanism for precise temporal alignment of internal and external feature streams, a Causal Pattern Extraction (CPE) module that systematically eliminates spurious correlations to reveal authentic causal dependencies, and an innovative Feature Synthesis Network (FSN) that adaptively synthesizes these purified representations into coherent spatio-temporal inferences. We evaluate the proposed CaSTFormer on the public Brain4Cars dataset, and it achieves state-of-the-art performance. It effectively captures complex causal spatio-temporal dependencies and enhances both the accuracy and transparency of driving intention prediction.</p></details> |  |

Leveraging fine-scale weekly mortality and high-resolution climate data from Austria (2002 to 2019), we assess how interactions between temperature, humidity, age, and gender influence mortality patterns. Our approach goes beyond conventional modelling by capturing complex dependencies through structured interactions across space-time, space-age, and age-time dimensions, allowing us to capture complex demographic and environmental dependencies. The analysis identifies district-level mortality patterns and quantifies climate-related risks on a weekly basis, offering new insights for public health surveillance.</p></details> |  |

Real-world measurements of such processes are often collected at irregularly distributed points in space, which can be effectively represented as graphs; however, there are currently only a few existing datasets. Our work aims to make advancements in the field of PDE-modeling accessible to the temporal graph machine learning community, while addressing the data scarcity problem, by creating and utilizing datasets based on PDEs. In this work, we create and use synthetic datasets based on PDEs to support spatio-temporal graph modeling in machine learning for different applications. More precisely, we showcase three equations to model different types of disasters and hazards in the fields of epidemiology, atmospheric particles, and tsunami waves. Further, we show how such created datasets can be used by benchmarking several machine learning models on the epidemiological dataset. Additionally, we show how pre-training on this dataset can improve model performance on real-world epidemiological data. The presented methods enable others to create datasets and benchmarks customized to individual requirements.

| **[Reprogramming Vision Foundation Models for Spatio-Temporal Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11558v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have achieved remarkable success in natural language processing and computer vision, demonstrating strong capabilities in modeling complex patterns. While recent efforts have explored adapting large language models (LLMs) for time-series forecasting, LLMs primarily capture one-dimensional sequential dependencies and struggle to model the richer spatio-temporal (ST) correlations essential for accurate ST forecasting. In this paper, we present \textbf{ST-VFM}, a novel framework that systematically reprograms Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) for general-purpose spatio-temporal forecasting. While VFMs offer powerful spatial priors, two key challenges arise when applying them to ST tasks: (1) the lack of inherent temporal modeling capacity and (2) the modality gap between visual and ST data. To address these, ST-VFM adopts a \emph{dual-branch architecture} that integrates raw ST inputs with auxiliary ST flow inputs, where the flow encodes lightweight temporal difference signals interpretable as dynamic spatial cues. To effectively process these dual-branch inputs, ST-VFM introduces two dedicated reprogramming stages. The \emph{pre-VFM reprogramming} stage applies a Temporal-Aware Token Adapter to embed temporal context and align both branches into VFM-compatible feature spaces. The \emph{post-VFM reprogramming} stage introduces a Bilateral Cross-Prompt Coordination module, enabling dynamic interaction between branches through prompt-based conditioning, thus enriching joint representation learning without modifying the frozen VFM backbone. Extensive experiments on ten spatio-temporal datasets show that ST-VFM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating effectiveness and robustness across VFM backbones (e.g., DINO, CLIP, DEIT) and ablation studies, establishing it as a strong general framework for spatio-temporal forecasting.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches in this field usually struggle to capture the complex spatio-temporal dependencies in EV charging behaviors, and their limited model parameters hinder their ability to learn complex data distribution representations from large datasets. To this end, we propose a novel EV spatio-temporal large language model (EV-STLLM) for accurate prediction. Our proposed framework is divided into two modules. In the data processing module, we utilize variational mode decomposition (VMD) for data denoising, and improved complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (ICEEMDAN) for data multi-frequency decomposition. Fuzzy information granulation (FIG) for extracting multi-scale information. Additionally, ReliefF is used for feature selection to mitigate redundancy. In the forecasting module, the EV-STLLM is used to directly achieve EV charging and occupancy forecasting. Firstly, we fully capture the intrinsic spatio-temporal characteristics of the data by integrating adjacency matrices derived from the regional stations network and spatio-temporal-frequency embedding information. Then, the partially frozen graph attention (PFGA) module is utilized to maintain the sequential feature modeling capabilities of the pre-trained large model while incorporating EV domain knowledge. Extensive experiments using real-world data from Shenzhen, China, demonstrate that our proposed framework can achieve superior accuracy and robustness compared to the state-of-the-art benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deformable Dynamic Convolution for Accurate yet Efficient Spatio-Temporal Traffic Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11550v1)** | 2025-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal traffic prediction plays a key role in intelligent transportation systems by enabling accurate prediction in complex urban areas. Although not only accuracy but also efficiency for scalability is important, some previous methods struggle to capture heterogeneity such as varying traffic patterns across regions and time periods. Moreover, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which are the mainstream of traffic prediction, not only require predefined adjacency matrix, but also limit scalability to large-scale data containing many nodes due to their inherent complexity. To overcome these limitations, we propose Deformable Dynamic Convolution Network (DDCN) for accurate yet efficient traffic prediction. Traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are limited in modeling non-Euclidean spatial structures and spatio-temporal heterogeneity, DDCN overcomes these challenges by dynamically applying deformable filters based on offset. Specifically, DDCN decomposes transformer-style CNN to encoder-decoder structure, and applies proposed approaches to the spatial and spatio-temporal attention blocks of the encoder to emphasize important features. The decoder, composed of feed-forward module, complements the output of the encoder. This novel structure make DDCN can perform accurate yet efficient traffic prediction. In comprehensive experiments on four real-world datasets, DDCN achieves competitive performance, emphasizing the potential and effectiveness of CNN-based approaches for spatio-temporal traffic prediction.</p></details> | 7 pages |

However, the inherent time variance of many spatio-temporal systems poses challenges to achieving accurate predictions whenever stationarity is not granted. In order to address non-stationarity, we propose a Distribution and Relation Adaptive Network (DRAN) capable of dynamically adapting to relation and distribution changes over time. While temporal normalization and de-normalization are frequently used techniques to adapt to distribution shifts, this operation is not suitable for the spatio-temporal context as temporal normalization scales the time series of nodes and possibly disrupts the spatial relations among nodes. In order to address this problem, a Spatial Factor Learner (SFL) module is developed that enables the normalization and de-normalization process. To adapt to dynamic changes in spatial relationships among sensors, we propose a Dynamic-Static Fusion Learner (DSFL) module that effectively integrates features learned from both dynamic and static relations through an adaptive fusion ratio mechanism. Furthermore, we introduce a Stochastic Learner to capture the noisy components of spatio-temporal representations. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on weather prediction and traffic flow forecasting tasks.Experimental results show that our SFL efficiently preserves spatial relationships across various temporal normalization operations. Visualizations of the learned dynamic and static relations demonstrate that DSFL can capture both local and distant relationships between nodes.</p></details> | 15 pages, 10 figures |

Spatio-Temporal Anomaly detection plays an important role in ensuring system security and operational integrity. However, current data-driven approaches, largely driven by black-box deep learning, face challenges in interpretability, adaptability to distribution shifts, and robustness under evolving system dynamics. In this paper, we advocate for a causal learning perspective to advance anomaly detection in spatially distributed infrastructures that grounds detection in structural cause-effect relationships. We identify and formalize three key directions: causal graph profiling, multi-view fusion, and continual causal graph learning, each offering distinct advantages in uncovering dynamic cause-effect structures across time and space. Drawing on real-world insights from systems such as water treatment infrastructures, we illustrate how causal models provide early warning signals and root cause attribution, addressing the limitations of black-box detectors. Looking ahead, we outline the future research agenda centered on multi-modality, generative AI-driven, and scalable adaptive causal frameworks. Our objective is to lay a new research trajectory toward scalable, adaptive, explainable, and spatially grounded anomaly detection systems. We hope to inspire a paradigm shift in cybersecurity research, promoting causality-driven approaches to address evolving threats in interconnected infrastructures.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 1 figure, Under Review in Vision Paper Track-ACM SIGSPATIAL 2025</p></details> |

To address this, we propose a training-free spatio-temporal token merging method, named STTM. Our key insight is to exploit local spatial and temporal redundancy in video data which has been overlooked in prior work. STTM first transforms each frame into multi-granular spatial tokens using a coarse-to-fine search over a quadtree structure, then performs directed pairwise merging across the temporal dimension. This decomposed merging approach outperforms existing token reduction methods across six video QA benchmarks. Notably, STTM achieves a 2$\times$ speed-up with only a 0.5% accuracy drop under a 50% token budget, and a 3$\times$ speed-up with just a 2% drop under a 30% budget. Moreover, STTM is query-agnostic, allowing KV cache reuse across different questions for the same video.

While most existing benchmarks evaluate models under offline settings with a fixed set of pre-recorded inputs, we introduce OST-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate Online Spatio-Temporal understanding from the perspective of an agent actively exploring a scene. The Online aspect emphasizes the need to process and reason over incrementally acquired observations, while the Spatio-Temporal component requires integrating current visual inputs with historical memory to support dynamic spatial reasoning. OST-Bench better reflects the challenges of real-world embodied perception. Built on an efficient data collection pipeline, OST-Bench consists of 1.4k scenes and 10k question-answer pairs collected from ScanNet, Matterport3D, and ARKitScenes. We evaluate several leading MLLMs on OST-Bench and observe that they fall short on tasks requiring complex spatio-temporal reasoning. Under the online setting, their accuracy declines as the exploration horizon extends and the memory grows. Through further experimental analysis, we identify common error patterns across models and find that both complex clue-based spatial reasoning demands and long-term memory retrieval requirements significantly drop model performance along two separate axes, highlighting the core challenges that must be addressed to improve online embodied reasoning.

The standard neuron model for spike-based computation on such systems has long been the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron. A computationally light augmentation of the LIF neuron model with an adaptation mechanism has recently been shown to exhibit superior performance on spatio-temporal processing tasks. The root of the superiority of these so-called adaptive LIF neurons however is not well understood. In this article, we thoroughly analyze the dynamical, computational, and learning properties of adaptive LIF neurons and networks thereof. Our investigation reveals significant challenges related to stability and parameterization when employing the conventional Euler-Forward discretization for this class of models. We report a rigorous theoretical and empirical demonstration that these challenges can be effectively addressed by adopting an alternative discretization approach - the Symplectic Euler method, allowing to improve over state-of-the-art performances on common event-based benchmark datasets. Our further analysis of the computational properties of networks of adaptive LIF neurons shows that they are particularly well suited to exploit the spatio-temporal structure of input sequences without any normalization techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Nature Communications, July 2025</p></details> |

Recent studies have typically focused on fusing cross-domain spatio-temporal data to train unified Transformer-based models. However, these models suffer from quadratic computational complexity and high memory overhead, limiting their scalability and practical deployment. Inspired by the efficiency of Mamba, a state space model with linear time complexity, we explore its potential for efficient urban spatio-temporal prediction. However, directly applying Mamba as a spatio-temporal backbone leads to negative transfer and severe performance degradation. This is primarily due to spatio-temporal heterogeneity and the recursive mechanism of Mamba's hidden state updates, which limit cross-domain generalization. To overcome these challenges, we propose Damba-ST, a novel domain-adaptive Mamba-based model for efficient urban spatio-temporal prediction. Damba-ST retains Mamba's linear complexity advantage while significantly enhancing its adaptability to heterogeneous domains. Specifically, we introduce two core innovations: (1) a domain-adaptive state space model that partitions the latent representation space into a shared subspace for learning cross-domain commonalities and independent, domain-specific subspaces for capturing intra-domain discriminative features; (2) three distinct Domain Adapters, which serve as domain-aware proxies to bridge disparate domain distributions and facilitate the alignment of cross-domain commonalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate the generalization and efficiency of Damba-ST. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on prediction tasks and demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization, enabling seamless deployment in new urban environments without extensive retraining or fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |

Radar sensors, capable of penetrating ice, provide detailed radargram images of these internal layers. In this work, we present ST-GRIT, a spatio-temporal graph transformer for ice layer thickness, designed to process these radargrams and capture the spatiotemporal relationships between shallow and deep ice layers. ST-GRIT leverages an inductive geometric graph learning framework to extract local spatial features as feature embeddings and employs a series of temporal and spatial attention blocks separately to model long-range dependencies effectively in both dimensions. Experimental evaluation on radargram data from the Greenland ice sheet demonstrates that ST-GRIT consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art methods and other baseline graph neural networks by achieving lower root mean-squared error. These results highlight the advantages of self-attention mechanisms on graphs over pure graph neural networks, including the ability to handle noise, avoid oversmoothing, and capture long-range dependencies. Moreover, the use of separate spatial and temporal attention blocks allows for distinct and robust learning of spatial relationships and temporal patterns, providing a more comprehensive and effective approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for 2025 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)</p></details> |

However, in high-precision industrial scenarios such as semiconductor manufacturing, the absence of specialized benchmark datasets severely hampers research on modeling and predicting complex processes. To address this challenge, we make a twofold contribution.First, we construct and release the Chip Dicing Lane Dataset (CHDL), the first public temporal image dataset dedicated to the semiconductor wafer dicing process. Captured via an industrial-grade vision system, CHDL provides a much-needed and challenging benchmark for high-fidelity process modeling, defect detection, and digital twin development.Second, we propose DIFFUMA, an innovative dual-path prediction architecture specifically designed for such fine-grained dynamics. The model captures global long-range temporal context through a parallel Mamba module, while simultaneously leveraging a diffusion module, guided by temporal features, to restore and enhance fine-grained spatial details, effectively combating feature degradation. Experiments demonstrate that on our CHDL benchmark, DIFFUMA significantly outperforms existing methods, reducing the Mean Squared Error (MSE) by 39% and improving the Structural Similarity (SSIM) from 0.926 to a near-perfect 0.988. This superior performance also generalizes to natural phenomena datasets. Our work not only delivers a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) model but, more importantly, provides the community with an invaluable data resource to drive future research in industrial AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distributionally Robust Predictive Runtime Verification under Spatio-Temporal Logic Specifications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02964v2)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cyber-physical systems (CPS) designed in simulators, often consisting of multiple interacting agents (e.g. in multi-agent formations), behave differently in the real-world. We want to verify these systems during runtime when they are deployed. We thus propose robust predictive runtime verification (RPRV) algorithms for: (1) general stochastic CPS under signal temporal logic (STL) tasks, and (2) stochastic multi-agent systems (MAS) under spatio-temporal logic tasks. The RPRV problem presents the following challenges: (1) there may not be sufficient data on the behavior of the deployed CPS, (2) predictive models based on design phase system trajectories may encounter distribution shift during real-world deployment, and (3) the algorithms need to scale to the complexity of MAS and be applicable to spatio-temporal logic tasks. To address the challenges, we assume knowledge of an upper bound on the statistical distance between the trajectory distributions of the system at deployment and design time. We are motivated by our prior work [1, 2] where we proposed an accurate and an interpretable RPRV algorithm for general CPS, which we here extend to the MAS setting and spatio-temporal logic tasks. Specifically, we use a learned predictive model to estimate the system behavior at runtime and robust conformal prediction to obtain probabilistic guarantees by accounting for distribution shifts. Building on [1], we perform robust conformal prediction over the robust semantics of spatio-temporal reach and escape logic (STREL) to obtain centralized RPRV algorithms for MAS. We empirically validate our results in a drone swarm simulator, where we show the scalability of our RPRV algorithms to MAS and analyze the impact of different trajectory predictors on the verification result. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first statistically valid algorithms for MAS under distribution shift.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2311.09482</p></details> |

Specifically, it is challenging to address prompts that refer to 1) the entirety of an environment that an agent equipped with an MLLM can operate in; and simultaneously also refer to 2) recent actions that just happened and are encoded in a video clip. However, such a holistic spatio-temporal understanding is important for agents operating in the real world. To address this issue, we first develop a framework to collect a large-scale dataset. Using the collected "Reasoning about Environments and Actions" (REA) dataset, we show that recent methods indeed struggle to correctly answer the prompts. To improve, we develop a "spatio-temporal LLM" (ST-LLM), a model equipped with projectors to improve both spatial understanding of an environment and temporal understanding of recent observations. On the collected REA data, we show that the proposed method significantly improves results compared to prior work.

Existing methods often prioritize the development of intricate neural networks to capture the complex dependencies of the data. These methods neglect node-level heterogeneity and face over-parameterization when attempting to model node-specific characteristics. In this paper, we present a novel low-rank adaptation framework for existing spatio-temporal prediction models, termed \model, which alleviates the aforementioned problems through node-level adjustments. Specifically, we introduce the node-adaptive low-rank layer and node-specific predictor, capturing the complex functional characteristics of nodes while maintaining computational efficiency. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that our method consistently achieves superior performance across various forecasting models with minimal computational overhead, improving performance by 7% with only 1% additional parameter cost.

Current video-based approaches, while proficient in tracking, lack the sophisticated reasoning capabilities of large language models, limiting their contextual understanding and generalization. We introduce VideoMolmo, a large multimodal model tailored for fine-grained spatio-temporal pointing conditioned on textual descriptions. Building upon the Molmo architecture, VideoMolmo incorporates a temporal module utilizing an attention mechanism to condition each frame on preceding frames, ensuring temporal consistency. Additionally, our novel temporal mask fusion pipeline employs SAM2 for bidirectional point propagation, significantly enhancing coherence across video sequences. This two-step decomposition, i.e., first using the LLM to generate precise pointing coordinates, then relying on a sequential mask-fusion module to produce coherent segmentation, not only simplifies the task for the language model but also enhances interpretability. Due to the lack of suitable datasets, we curate a comprehensive dataset comprising 72k video-caption pairs annotated with 100k object points. To evaluate the generalization of VideoMolmo, we introduce VPoS-Bench, a challenging out-of-distribution benchmark spanning five real-world scenarios: Cell Tracking, Egocentric Vision, Autonomous Driving, Video-GUI Interaction, and Robotics. We also evaluate our model on Referring Video Object Segmentation (Refer-VOS) and Reasoning VOS tasks. In comparison to existing models, VideoMolmo substantially improves spatio-temporal pointing accuracy and reasoning capability. Our code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/mbzuai-oryx/VideoMolmo.</p></details> | 20 pages, 13 figures |

Although these data can be used for effective local policymaking, their analyses are hindered by several challenges, such as limited information attributed to grouping, the presence of non-sampled areas, and the very low frequency of implementing surveys. To address these challenges, we propose a novel grouped-data-based spatio-temporal finite mixture model for estimating the income distributions of multiple spatial units at multiple time points. A unique feature of the proposed method is that all the areas share common latent distributions and that the mixing proportions, including spatial and temporal effects, capture the potential area-wise heterogeneity. Thus, incorporating these effects can smooth out the quantities of interest over time and space, impute missing values, and predict future values. By treating the HLS data with the proposed method, we obtain complete maps of the income and inequality measures at an arbitrary time, which can facilitate rapid and efficient policymaking with fine granularity.</p></details> |  |

Temporal processing, an extensively researched topic, is one such example that lacks a coherent understanding of its underlying mechanisms. In this study, we investigate temporal processing in a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent performing an interval timing task and explore potential biological counterparts to its emergent behavior. The agent was successfully trained to perform a duration production task, which involved marking successive occurrences of a target interval while viewing a video sequence. Analysis of the agent's internal states revealed oscillatory neural activations, a ubiquitous pattern in biological systems. Interestingly, the agent's actions were predominantly influenced by neurons exhibiting these oscillations with high amplitudes and frequencies corresponding to the target interval. Parallels are drawn between the agent's time-keeping strategy and the Striatal Beat Frequency (SBF) model, a biologically plausible model of interval timing. Furthermore, the agent maintained its oscillatory representations and task performance when tested on different video sequences (including a blank video). Thus, once learned, the agent internalized its time-keeping mechanism and showed minimal reliance on its environment to perform the timing task. A hypothesis about the resemblance between this emergent behavior and certain aspects of the evolution of biological processes like circadian rhythms, has been discussed. This study aims to contribute to recent research efforts of utilizing DNNs to understand biological systems, with a particular emphasis on temporal processing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 2025 Artificial Life Conference</p></details> |

Existing ex situ methods offer only static analysis, while in situ techniques often require manual initialization and lack continuous per-particle trajectory decomposition. We present Visual Feature Tracking (VFTrack) an in-situ real-time particle tracking framework that automatically detects and tracks individual CNT particles in SEM image sequences. VFTrack integrates handcrafted or deep feature detectors and matchers within a particle tracking framework to enable kinematic analysis of CNT micropillar growth. A systematic using 13,540 manually annotated trajectories identifies the ALIKED detector with LightGlue matcher as an optimal combination (F1-score of 0.78, $\alpha$-score of 0.89). VFTrack motion vectors decomposed into axial growth, lateral drift, and oscillations, facilitate the calculation of heterogeneous regional growth rates and the reconstruction of evolving CNT pillar morphologies. This work enables advancement in automated nano-material characterization, bridging the gap between physics-based models and experimental observation to enable real-time optimization of CNT synthesis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE/CVF ICCV 2025, CV4MS Workshop (Computer Vision for Materials Science), Code available at: https://github.com/kavehsfv/VFTrack</p></details> |

We have developed a small, purpose-built model checking algorithm which generates plans in situ based on "core" knowledge and attention as found in biological agents. This is achieved in real-time using no pre-computed data on a low-powered device. Our approach is based on chaining temporary control systems which are spawned to counteract disturbances in the local environment that disrupt an autonomous agent from its preferred action (or resting state). A novel discretization of 2D LiDAR data sensitive to bounded variations in the local environment is used. Multi-step planning using model checking by forward depth-first search is applied to cul-de-sac and playground scenarios. Both empirical results and informal proofs of two fundamental properties of our approach demonstrate that model checking can be used to create efficient multi-step plans for local obstacle avoidance, improving on the performance of a reactive agent which can only plan one step. Our approach is an instructional case study for the development of safe, reliable and explainable planning in the context of autonomous vehicles.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages excluding references, 18 figures, submitted to Formal Aspects of Computing</p></details> |
| **[StagFormer: Time Staggering Transformer Decoding for RunningLayers In Parallel](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15665v2)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decoding in a Transformer based language model is inherently sequential as a token's embedding needs to pass through all the layers in the network before the generation of the next token can begin. In this work, we propose a new architecture StagFormer (Staggered Transformer), which staggers execution along the sequence axis and thereby enables parallelizing the decoding process along the depth of the model. We achieve this by breaking the dependency of the token representation at time step $i$ in layer $l$ upon the representations of tokens until time step $i$ from layer $l-1$. Instead, we stagger the execution and only allow a dependency on token representations until time step $i-1$. The later sections of the Transformer still get access to the "rich" representations from the prior section but only from those token positions which are one time step behind. StagFormer allows for different sections of the model to be executed in parallel yielding a potential speedup in decoding while being quality neutral in our simulations. We also explore many natural extensions of this idea. We present how weight-sharing across the different sections being staggered can be more practical in settings with limited memory. We explore the efficacy of using a bounded window attention to pass information from one section to another which helps drive further latency gains for some applications. We also explore the scalability of the staggering idea over more than 2 sections of the Transformer. Finally, we show how one can approximate a recurrent model during inference using weight-sharing. This variant can lead to substantial gains in quality for short generations while being neutral in its latency impact.</p></details> |  |

However, scenes that satisfy strict task requirements, such as high-clutter environments with plausible spatial arrangement, are rare and costly to curate manually. Instead, we generate large-scale scene data using procedural models that approximate realistic environments for robotic manipulation, and adapt it to task-specific goals. We do this by training a unified diffusion-based generative model that predicts which objects to place from a fixed asset library, along with their SE(3) poses. This model serves as a flexible scene prior that can be adapted using reinforcement learning-based post training, conditional generation, or inference-time search, steering generation toward downstream objectives even when they differ from the original data distribution. Our method enables goal-directed scene synthesis that respects physical feasibility and scales across scene types. We introduce a novel MCTS-based inference-time search strategy for diffusion models, enforce feasibility via projection and simulation, and release a dataset of over 44 million SE(3) scenes spanning five diverse environments.

| **[DTC: Real-Time and Accurate Distributed Triangle Counting in Fully Dynamic Graph Streams](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19057v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Triangle counting is a fundamental problem in graph mining, essential for analyzing graph streams with arbitrary edge orders. However, exact counting becomes impractical due to the massive size of real-world graph streams. To address this, approximate algorithms have been developed, but existing distributed streaming algorithms lack adaptability and struggle with edge deletions. In this article, we propose DTC, a novel family of single-pass distributed streaming algorithms for global and local triangle counting in fully dynamic graph streams. Our DTC-AR algorithm accurately estimates triangle counts without prior knowledge of graph size, leveraging multi-machine resources. Additionally, we introduce DTC-FD, an algorithm tailored for fully dynamic graph streams, incorporating edge insertions and deletions. Using Random Pairing and future edge insertion compensation, DTC-FD achieves unbiased and accurate approximations across multiple machines. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over baselines. DTC-AR achieves up to $2029.4\times$ and $27.1\times$ more accuracy, while maintaining the best trade-off between accuracy and storage space. DTC-FD reduces estimation errors by up to $32.5\times$ and $19.3\times$, scaling linearly with graph stream size. These findings highlight the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms in tackling triangle counting in real-world scenarios.

The key challenge that we address is balancing computational resources against control performance, which is important as constructing near-optimal inputs often requires substantial amount of computations. TROOP addresses this trade-off by adopting an online best-first search strategy inspired by A*, allowing for efficient estimates of the optimal value function. The control laws obtained guarantee both near-optimality and stability properties for the closed-loop system. These properties depend on the planning depth, which determines how far into the future the algorithm explores and is closely related to the amount of computations. TROOP thus strikes a balance between computational efficiency and control performance, which is illustrated by numerical simulations on an example.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical report for CDC 2025 publication</p></details> |
| **[Time Series Analysis of Spiking Neural Systems via Transfer Entropy and Directed Persistent Homology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19048v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a topological framework for analysing neural time series that integrates Transfer Entropy (TE) with directed Persistent Homology (PH) to characterize information flow in spiking neural systems. TE quantifies directional influence between neurons, producing weighted, directed graphs that reflect dynamic interactions. These graphs are then analyzed using PH, enabling assessment of topological complexity across multiple structural scales and dimensions. We apply this TE+PH pipeline to synthetic spiking networks trained on logic gate tasks, image-classification networks exposed to structured and perturbed inputs, and mouse cortical recordings annotated with behavioral events. Across all settings, the resulting topological signatures reveal distinctions in task complexity, stimulus structure, and behavioral regime. Higher-dimensional features become more prominent in complex or noisy conditions, reflecting interaction patterns that extend beyond pairwise connectivity. Our findings offer a principled approach to mapping directed information flow onto global organizational patterns in both artificial and biological neural systems. The framework is generalizable and interpretable, making it well suited for neural systems with time-resolved and binary spiking data.</p></details> |  |
| **[STDiff: A State Transition Diffusion Framework for Time Series Imputation in Industrial Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19011v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most deep learning methods for imputing missing values treat the task as completing patterns within a fixed time window. This assumption often fails in industrial systems, where dynamics are driven by control actions, are highly non-stationary, and can experience long, uninterrupted gaps. We propose STDiff, which reframes imputation as learning how the system evolves from one state to the next. STDiff uses a conditional denoising diffusion model with a causal bias aligned to control theory, generating missing values step-by-step based on the most recent known state and relevant control or environmental inputs. On a public wastewater treatment dataset with simulated missing blocks, STDiff consistently achieves the lowest errors, with its advantage increasing for longer gaps. On a raw industrial dataset with substantial real gaps, it produces trajectories that remain dynamically plausible, in contrast to window-based models that tend to flatten or over-smooth. These results support dynamics-aware, explicitly conditioned imputation as a robust approach for industrial time series, and we discuss computational trade-offs and extensions to broader domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tipping Point Sensitivity Analysis for Missing Data in Time-to-Event Endpoints: Model-Based and Model-Free Approaches](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19988v2)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Missing data frequently occurs in clinical trials with time-to-event endpoints, often due to administrative censoring. Other reasons, such as loss-to-follow up and patient withdrawal of consent, can violate the censoring-at-random assumption hence lead to biased estimates of the treatment effect under treatment policy estimand. Numerous methods have been proposed to conduct sensitivity analyses in these situations, one of which is the tipping point analysis. It aims to evaluate the robustness of trial conclusions by varying certain data and/or model aspects while imputing missing data. We provide an overview of the missing data considerations. The main contribution of this paper lies in categorizing and contrasting tipping point methods as two groups, namely model-based and model-free approaches, where the latter is under-emphasized in the literature. We highlight their important differences in terms of assumptions, behaviors and interpretations. Through two case studies and simulations under various scenarios, we provide insight on how different tipping point methods impact the interpretation of trial outcomes. Through these comparisons, we aim to provide a practical guide to conduct tipping point analyses from the choice of methods to ways of conducting clinical plausibility assessment, and ultimately contributing to more robust and reliable interpretation of clinical trial results in the presence of missing data for time-to-event endpoints.</p></details> |  |

Modern forecasting models are generally opaque and do not provide explanations for their forecasts, while well-known post-hoc explainability methods like LIME are not suitable for the forecasting context. We propose PAX-TS, a model-agnostic post-hoc algorithm to explain time series forecasting models and their forecasts. Our method is based on localized input perturbations and results in multi-granular explanations. Further, it is able to characterize cross-channel correlations for multivariate time series forecasts. We clearly outline the algorithmic procedure behind PAX-TS, demonstrate it on a benchmark with 7 algorithms and 10 diverse datasets, compare it with two other state-of-the-art explanation algorithms, and present the different explanation types of the method. We found that the explanations of high-performing and low-performing algorithms differ on the same datasets, highlighting that the explanations of PAX-TS effectively capture a model's behavior. Based on time step correlation matrices resulting from the benchmark, we identify 6 classes of patterns that repeatedly occur across different datasets and algorithms. We found that the patterns are indicators of performance, with noticeable differences in forecasting error between the classes. Lastly, we outline a multivariate example where PAX-TS demonstrates how the forecasting model takes cross-channel correlations into account. With PAX-TS, time series forecasting models' mechanisms can be illustrated in different levels of detail, and its explanations can be used to answer practical questions on forecasts.</p></details> |  |

However, many existing Python libraries exhibit limitations in modularity and in their native support for irregular, multi-source, or sparse data. We introduce pyFAST, a research-oriented PyTorch framework that explicitly decouples data processing from model computation, fostering a cleaner separation of concerns and facilitating rapid experimentation. Its data engine is engineered for complex scenarios, supporting multi-source loading, protein sequence handling, efficient sequence- and patch-level padding, dynamic normalization, and mask-based modeling for both imputation and forecasting. pyFAST integrates LLM-inspired architectures for the alignment-free fusion of sparse data sources and offers native sparse metrics, specialized loss functions, and flexible exogenous data fusion. Training utilities include batch-based streaming aggregation for evaluation and device synergy to maximize computational efficiency. A comprehensive suite of classical and deep learning models (Linears, CNNs, RNNs, Transformers, and GNNs) is provided within a modular architecture that encourages extension.

However, maintaining these inventories requires labor-intensive on-site campaigns. Remote sensing approaches, particularly when combined with machine learning, offer opportunities to update NFIs more frequently and at larger scales. While the use of Satellite Image Time Series has proven effective for distinguishing tree species through seasonal canopy reflectance patterns, current approaches rely primarily on Random Forest classifiers with hand-designed features and phenology-based metrics. Using deep features from an available pre-trained remote sensing foundation models offers a complementary strategy. These pre-trained models leverage unannotated global data and are meant to used for general-purpose applications and can then be efficiently fine-tuned with smaller labeled datasets for specific classification tasks. This work systematically investigates how deep features improve tree species classification accuracy in the Netherlands with few annotated data. Data-wise, we extracted time-series data from Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and ERA5 satellites data and SRTM data using Google Earth Engine. Our results demonstrate that fine-tuning a publicly available remote sensing time series foundation model outperforms the current state-of-the-art in NFI classification in the Netherlands by a large margin of up to 10% across all datasets. This demonstrates that classic hand-defined harmonic features are too simple for this task and highlights the potential of using deep AI features for data-limited application like NFI classification. By leveraging openly available satellite data and pre-trained models, this approach significantly improves classification accuracy compared to traditional methods and can effectively complement existing forest inventory processes.</p></details> |  |

This effectively alters the system's long term behavior, leading to outcomes that may be beneficial to the deceiver but detrimental to victim. We study this phenomenon for a class of model-free Nash equilibrium seeking (NES) where players implement independent stochastic exploration signals to learn the pseudogradient flow. In particular, we show that deceptive players who obtain real-time measurements of other players' stochastic perturbation can incorporate this information into their own NES action update, consequentially steering the overall dynamics to a new operating point that could potentially improve the payoffs of the deceptive players. We consider games with quadratic payoff functions, as this restriction allows us to derive a more explicit formulation of the capabilities of the deceptive players. By leveraging results on multi-input stochastic averaging for dynamical systems, we establish local exponential (in probability) convergence for the proposed deceptive NES dynamics. To illustrate our results, we apply them to a two player quadratic game.</p></details> |  |

However, deploying these systems in real-time on resource-constrained platforms introduces significant challenges related to scalability, interoperability, and performance. This paper presents a real-time remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) system optimized for low-power devices, designed to extract physiological signals, such as heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), and oxygen saturation (SpO2), from facial video streams. The system is built on the Face2PPG pipeline, which processes video frames sequentially for rPPG signal extraction and analysis, while leveraging a multithreaded architecture to manage video capture, real-time processing, network communication, and graphical user interface (GUI) updates concurrently. This design ensures continuous, reliable operation at 30 frames per second (fps), with adaptive feedback through a collaborative user interface to guide optimal signal capture conditions. The network interface includes both an HTTP server for continuous video streaming and a RESTful API for on-demand vital sign retrieval. To ensure accurate performance despite the limitations of low-power devices, we use a hybrid programming model combining Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) and the Actor Model, allowing event-driven processing and efficient task parallelization. The system is evaluated under real-time constraints, demonstrating robustness while minimizing computational overhead.

In this work, we propose a method for one-step probabilistic multivariate forecasting of time variables involved in a production process. The method is based on an Input-Output Hidden Markov Model (IO-HMM), in which the parameters of interest are the state transition probabilities and the parameters of the observations' joint density. The ultimate goal of the method is to predict operational process times in the near future, which enables the identification of hidden losses and the location of improvement areas in the process. The input stream in the IO-HMM model includes past values of the response variables and other process features, such as calendar variables, that can have an impact on the model's parameters. The discrete part of the IO-HMM models the operational mode of the process. The state transition probabilities are supposed to change over time and are updated using Bayesian principles. The continuous part of the IO-HMM models the joint density of the response variables. The estimate of the continuous model parameters is recursively computed through an adaptive algorithm that also admits a Bayesian interpretation. The adaptive algorithm allows for efficient updating of the current parameter estimates as soon as new information is available. We evaluate the method's performance using a real data set obtained from a company in a particular sector, and the results are compared with a collection of benchmark models.</p></details> | 26 pages, 5 figures |

Recently, there has been a growing demand for services that require low-latency communication, such as real-time applications. The latest amendments to Wi-Fi, IEEE 802.11bn, are being developed to address these demands with technologies such as the multiple access point coordination (MAPC). In this paper, we demonstrate that coordinated TDMA (Co-TDMA), one of the MAPC techniques, effectively reduces the latency of transmitting time-sensitive traffic. In particular, we focus on worst-case latency and jitter, which are key metrics for evaluating the performance of real-time applications. We first introduce a Co-TDMA scheduling strategy. We then investigate how this scheduling strategy impacts latency under varying levels of network congestion and traffic volume characteristics. Finally, we validate our findings through system-level simulations. Our simulation results demonstrate that Co-TDMA effectively mitigates jitter and worst-case latency for LL traffic, with the latter exhibiting an improvement of approximately 24%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM) 2025</p></details> |
| **[Stabilizing Open-Set Test-Time Adaptation via Primary-Auxiliary Filtering and Knowledge-Integrated Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18751v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks demonstrate strong performance under aligned training-test distributions. However, real-world test data often exhibit domain shifts. Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) addresses this challenge by adapting the model to test data during inference. While most TTA studies assume that the training and test data share the same class set (closed-set TTA), real-world scenarios often involve open-set data (open-set TTA), which can degrade closed-set accuracy. A recent study showed that identifying open-set data during adaptation and maximizing its entropy is an effective solution. However, the previous method relies on the source model for filtering, resulting in suboptimal filtering accuracy on domain-shifted test data. In contrast, we found that the adapting model, which learns domain knowledge from noisy test streams, tends to be unstable and leads to error accumulation when used for filtering. To address this problem, we propose Primary-Auxiliary Filtering (PAF), which employs an auxiliary filter to validate data filtered by the primary filter. Furthermore, we propose Knowledge-Integrated Prediction (KIP), which calibrates the outputs of the adapting model, EMA model, and source model to integrate their complementary knowledge for OSTTA. We validate our approach across diverse closed-set and open-set datasets. Our method enhances both closed-set accuracy and open-set discrimination over existing methods.

| **[Globally Stable Discrete Time PID Passivity-based Control of Power Converters: Simulation and Experimental Results](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18719v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The key idea behind PID Passivity-based Control (PID-PBC) is to leverage the passivity property of PIDs (for all positive gains) and wrap the PID controller around a passive output to ensure global stability in closed-loop. However, the practical applicability of PID-PBC is stymied by two key facts: (i) the vast majority of practical implementations of PIDs is carried-out in discrete time -- discretizing the continuous time dynamical system of the PID; (ii) the well-known problem that passivity is not preserved upon discretization, even with small sampling times. Therefore, two aspects of the PID-PBC must be revisited for its safe practical application. First, we propose a discretization of the PID that ensures its passivity. Second, since the output that is identified as passive for the continuous time system is not necessarily passive for its discrete time version, we construct a new output that ensures the passivity property for the discretization of the system. In this paper, we provide a constructive answer to both issues for the case of power converter models. Instrumental to achieve this objective is the use of the implicit midpoint discretization method -- which is a symplectic integration technique that preserves system invariants. Since the reference value for the output to be regulated in power converters is non-zero, we are henceforth interested in the property of passivity of the incremental model -- currently known as shifted passivity. Therefore, we demonstrate that the resulting discrete-time PID-PBC defines a passive map for the incremental model and establish shifted passivity for the discretized power converter model. Combining these properties, we prove global stability for the feedback interconnection of the power converter with the discretized PID-PBC. The paper also presents simulations and experiments that demonstrate the performance of the proposed discretization.</p></details> |  |

An optimized hybrid deep learning framework is introduced that integrates a customized InceptionV3, an LSTM architecture, and a novel ensemble-based feature selection strategy. The proposed framework first extracts spatial descriptors using the customized InceptionV3 model, which captures multilevel contextual patterns, region homogeneity, and fine-grained localization cues. The temporal dependencies across frames are then modeled using LSTMs to effectively encode motion dynamics. Finally, an ensemble-based genetic algorithm with Adaptive Dynamic Fitness Sharing and Attention (ADFSA) is employed to select a compact and optimized feature set by dynamically balancing objectives such as accuracy, redundancy, uniqueness, and complexity reduction. Consequently, the selected feature subsets, which are both diverse and discriminative, enable various lightweight machine learning classifiers to achieve accurate and robust HAR in heterogeneous environments. Experimental results on the robust UCF-YouTube dataset, which presents challenges such as occlusion, cluttered backgrounds, motion dynamics, and poor illumination, demonstrate good performance. The proposed approach achieves 99.65% recognition accuracy, reduces features to as few as 7, and enhances inference time. The lightweight and scalable nature of the HAR system supports real-time deployment on edge devices such as Raspberry Pi, enabling practical applications in intelligent, resource-aware environments, including public safety, assistive technology, and autonomous monitoring systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 25 figures, 11 tables</p></details> |
| **[Uncertainty-Calibrated Test-Time Model Adaptation without Forgetting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11491v2)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test-time adaptation (TTA) seeks to tackle potential distribution shifts between training and test data by adapting a given model w.r.t. any test sample. Although recent TTA has shown promising performance, we still face two key challenges: 1) prior methods perform backpropagation for each test sample, resulting in unbearable optimization costs to many applications; 2) while existing TTA can significantly improve the test performance on out-of-distribution data, they often suffer from severe performance degradation on in-distribution data after TTA (known as forgetting). To this end, we have proposed an Efficient Anti-Forgetting Test-Time Adaptation (EATA) method which develops an active sample selection criterion to identify reliable and non-redundant samples for test-time entropy minimization. To alleviate forgetting, EATA introduces a Fisher regularizer estimated from test samples to constrain important model parameters from drastic changes. However, in EATA, the adopted entropy loss consistently assigns higher confidence to predictions even for samples that are underlying uncertain, leading to overconfident predictions. To tackle this, we further propose EATA with Calibration (EATA-C) to separately exploit the reducible model uncertainty and the inherent data uncertainty for calibrated TTA. Specifically, we measure the model uncertainty by the divergence between predictions from the full network and its sub-networks, on which we propose a divergence loss to encourage consistent predictions instead of overconfident ones. To further recalibrate prediction confidence, we utilize the disagreement among predicted labels as an indicator of the data uncertainty, and then devise a min-max entropy regularizer to selectively increase and decrease prediction confidence for different samples. Experiments on image classification and semantic segmentation verify the effectiveness of our methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 18 figures, 13 tables</p></details> |

Prior studies have investigated FAT modeling via inverse Gaussian distributions [1] and applied FAT statistics for parameter estimation and synchronization tasks [2], [3], while more recent work has characterized FAP for spatial channel analysis [4]. In contrast, we derive an explicit joint probability density function (PDF) under constant drift and isotropic diffusion in arbitrary spatial dimensions. Our result reveals a nontrivial coupling between arrival time and lateral position, generalizing known inverse Gaussian models. We further compute the Fisher information matrix (FIM) with respect to key channel parameters, showing that the joint observation enables estimation of lateral drift and improves sensitivity to the diffusion coefficient -- capabilities not achievable with time-only or position-only models. This joint framework enhances the modeling and inference capabilities for molecular communication channels where spatial randomness itself carries non-negligible information.</p></details> | 4 pages, 2 figures |

We develop a non-recursive convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that maps system parameters and a redundant time encoding directly to excitation-energy-transfer populations in the Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex. The encoding-modified logistic plus $\tanh$ functions-normalizes time and resolves fast, transitional, and quasi-steady regimes, while physics-informed labels enforce population conservation and inter-site consistency. Trained only on $0\sim 7 ps$ reference trajectories generated with a Lindblad model in QuTiP, the network accurately predicts $0\sim100 ps$ dynamics across a range of reorganization energies, bath rates, and temperatures. Beyond $20 ps$, the absolute relative error remains below 0.05, demonstrating stable long-time extrapolation. By avoiding step-by-step recursion, the method suppresses error accumulation and generalizes across timescales. These results show that redundant time encoding enables data-efficient inference of long-time quantum dissipative dynamics in realistic pigment-protein complexes, and may aid the data-driven design of light-harvesting materials.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5figures |
| **[STRATA-TS: Selective Knowledge Transfer for Urban Time Series Forecasting with Retrieval-Guided Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18635v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban forecasting models often face a severe data imbalance problem: only a few cities have dense, long-span records, while many others expose short or incomplete histories. Direct transfer from data-rich to data-scarce cities is unreliable because only a limited subset of source patterns truly benefits the target domain, whereas indiscriminate transfer risks introducing noise and negative transfer. We present STRATA-TS (Selective TRAnsfer via TArget-aware retrieval for Time Series), a framework that combines domain-adapted retrieval with reasoning-capable large models to improve forecasting in scarce data regimes. STRATA-TS employs a patch-based temporal encoder to identify source subsequences that are semantically and dynamically aligned with the target query. These retrieved exemplars are then injected into a retrieval-guided reasoning stage, where an LLM performs structured inference over target inputs and retrieved support. To enable efficient deployment, we distill the reasoning process into a compact open model via supervised fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on three parking availability datasets across Singapore, Nottingham, and Glasgow demonstrate that STRATA-TS consistently outperforms strong forecasting and transfer baselines, while providing interpretable knowledge transfer pathways.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncertainty Awareness on Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Time Series Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18630v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised domain adaptation methods seek to generalize effectively on unlabeled test data, especially when encountering the common challenge in time series data that distribution shifts occur between training and testing datasets. In this paper, we propose incorporating multi-scale feature extraction and uncertainty estimation to improve the model's generalization and robustness across domains. Our approach begins with a multi-scale mixed input architecture that captures features at different scales, increasing training diversity and reducing feature discrepancies between the training and testing domains. Based on the mixed input architecture, we further introduce an uncertainty awareness mechanism based on evidential learning by imposing a Dirichlet prior on the labels to facilitate both target prediction and uncertainty estimation. The uncertainty awareness mechanism enhances domain adaptation by aligning features with the same labels across different domains, which leads to significant performance improvements in the target domain. Additionally, our uncertainty-aware model demonstrates a much lower Expected Calibration Error (ECE), indicating better-calibrated prediction confidence. Our experimental results show that this combined approach of mixed input architecture with the uncertainty awareness mechanism achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmark datasets, underscoring its effectiveness in unsupervised domain adaptation for time series data.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Transactions on Multimedia</p></details> |
| **[Unified theory of testing relevant hypothesis in functional time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18624v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present a general framework for testing relevant hypotheses in functional time series. Our unified approach covers one-sample, two-sample, and change point problems under contaminated observations with arbitrary sampling schemes. By employing B-spline estimators and the self-normalization technique, we propose nuisance-parameter-free testing procedures, obviating the need for additional procedures such as estimating long-run covariance or measurement-error variance functions. A key challenge arises from related nonparametric statistics may not be tight, complicating the joint weak convergence for the test statistics and self-normalizers, particularly in sparse scenarios. To address this, we leverage a Gaussian approximation in a diverging-dimension regime to derive a pivotal approximate distribution. Then, we develop consistent decision rules, provide sufficient conditions ensuring non-degeneracy, and establish phase transition boundaries from sparse to dense. We also examine the multiple change point scenario and extend the theory when one obtains consistent estimates of the change points. The choice of self-normalizers is further discussed, including the recently developed range-adjusted self-normalizer. Extensive numerical experiments support the proposed theory, and we illustrate our methodologies using the AU.SHF implied volatility and traffic volume datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Random Unitaries in Constant (Quantum) Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11487v2)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Random unitaries are a central object of study in quantum information, with applications to quantum computation, quantum many-body physics, and quantum cryptography. Recent work has constructed unitary designs and pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs) using $\Theta(\log \log n)$-depth unitary circuits with two-qubit gates. In this work, we show that unitary designs and PRUs can be efficiently constructed in several well-studied models of $\textit{constant-time}$ quantum computation (i.e., the time complexity on the quantum computer is independent of the system size). These models are constant-depth circuits augmented with certain nonlocal operations, such as (a) many-qubit TOFFOLI gates, (b) many-qubit FANOUT gates, or (c) mid-circuit measurements with classical feedforward control. Recent advances in quantum computing hardware suggest experimental feasibility of these models in the near future. Our results demonstrate that unitary designs and PRUs can be constructed in much weaker circuit models than previously thought. Furthermore, our construction of PRUs in constant-depth with many-qubit TOFFOLI gates shows that, under cryptographic assumptions, there is no polynomial-time learning algorithm for the circuit class $\mathsf{QAC}^0$. Finally, our results suggest a new approach towards proving that PARITY is not computable in $\mathsf{QAC}^0$, a long-standing question in quantum complexity theory.</p></details> |  |

Our framework features a unified trajectory representation that encapsulates the kinematic models of both $SO(3)\times\mathbb{R}^3$ and $SE(3)$ pose representations. This encapsulation strategy allows users to use the same implementation of measurement-based factors for either choice of pose representation, which facilitates experimentation and comparison to achieve the best model for the ME task. In addition, unique to our framework, we derive the kinematic models with the closed-form temporal derivatives of the local variable of $SO(3)$ and $SE(3)$, which so far has only been approximated based on the Taylor expansion in the literature. Our experiments show that these kinematic models can improve the estimation accuracy in high-speed scenarios. All analytical Jacobians of the interpolated states with respect to the support states of the trajectory representation, as well as the motion prior factors, are also provided for accelerated Gauss-Newton (GN) optimization. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of the framework in various motion estimation tasks such as localization, calibration, and odometry, facilitating fast prototyping for ME researchers. We release the source code for the benefit of the community.

However, integrating these technologies presents significant computational challenges, as light field displays require multiple high-resolution renderings from slightly shifted viewpoints, while radiance fields rely on computationally intensive volume rendering. In this paper, we propose a unified and efficient framework for real-time radiance field rendering on light field displays. Our method supports a wide range of radiance field representations, including NeRFs, 3D Gaussian Splatting, and Sparse Voxels, within a shared architecture based on a single-pass plane sweeping strategy and caching of shared, non-directional components. The framework generalizes across different scene formats without retraining, and avoids redundant computation across views. We further demonstrate a real-time interactive application on a Looking Glass display, achieving 200+ FPS at 512p across 45 views, enabling seamless, immersive 3D interaction. On standard benchmarks, our method achieves up to 22x speedup compared to independently rendering each view, while preserving image quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 14 figures.

Given this limitation, meeting the low-latency service requirement of 6G networks becomes even more challenging. However, existing 6G IoT management strategies lack real-time operation and mostly rely on discrete actions, which are insufficient to optimise energy consumption. To address these, in this study, we propose a Digital Twin (DT)-guided energy management framework to jointly handle the low latency and energy efficiency challenges in 6G IoT networks. In this framework, we provide the twin models through a distributed overlay network and handle the dynamic updates between the data layer and the upper layers of the DT over the Real-Time Publish Subscribe (RTPS) protocol. We also design a Reinforcement Learning (RL) engine with a novel formulated reward function to provide optimal data update times for each of the IoT devices. The RL engine receives a diverse set of environment states from the What-if engine and runs Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) to output continuous actions to the IoT devices. Based on our simulation results, we observe that the proposed framework achieves a 37% improvement in 95th percentile latency and a 30% reduction in energy consumption compared to the existing literature.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods usually struggle with limited labeled data, high false-positive rates, and difficulty generalizing to novel anomaly types. To overcome these challenges, we propose a reinforcement learning-based framework that integrates dynamic reward shaping, Variational Autoencoder (VAE), and active learning, called DRTA. Our method uses an adaptive reward mechanism that balances exploration and exploitation by dynamically scaling the effect of VAE-based reconstruction error and classification rewards. This approach enables the agent to detect anomalies effectively in low-label systems while maintaining high precision and recall. Our experimental results on the Yahoo A1 and Yahoo A2 benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised and semi-supervised approaches. These findings show that our framework is a scalable and efficient solution for real-world anomaly detection tasks.</p></details> |  |

Current approaches like search-o1 integrate retrieval augmented generation (RAG) into multi-step reasoning processes but rely on a single, linear reasoning chain while incorporating unstructured textual information in a flat, context-agnostic manner. As a result, these approaches can lead to error accumulation throughout the reasoning chain, which significantly limits its effectiveness in medical question-answering (QA) tasks where both accuracy and traceability are critical requirements. To address these challenges, we propose MIRAGE (Multi-chain Inference with Retrieval-Augmented Graph Exploration), a novel test-time scalable reasoning framework that performs dynamic multi-chain inference over structured medical knowledge graphs. Specifically, MIRAGE 1) decomposes complex queries into entity-grounded sub-questions, 2) executes parallel inference chains, 3) retrieves evidence adaptively via neighbor expansion and multi-hop traversal, and 4) integrates answers using cross-chain verification to resolve contradictions. Experiments on three medical QA benchmarks (GenMedGPT-5k, CMCQA, and ExplainCPE) show that MIRAGE consistently outperforms GPT-4o, Tree-of-Thought variants, and other retrieval-augmented baselines in both automatic and human evaluations. Additionally, MIRAGE improves interpretability by generating explicit reasoning chains that trace each factual claim to concrete chains within the knowledge graph, making it well-suited for complex medical reasoning scenarios.

Recent advances in multimodal generative retrieval -- particularly those leveraging multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as retrievers -- have shown promise. However, most existing methods are tailored to single-turn scenarios and struggle to model the evolving intent and iterative nature of multi-turn dialogues when applied naively. Concurrently, test-time scaling has emerged as a powerful paradigm for improving large language model (LLM) performance through iterative inference-time refinement. Yet, its effectiveness typically relies on two conditions: (1) a well-defined problem space (e.g., mathematical reasoning), and (2) the model's ability to self-correct -- conditions that are rarely met in conversational product search. In this setting, user queries are often ambiguous and evolving, and MLLMs alone have difficulty grounding responses in a fixed product corpus. Motivated by these challenges, we propose a novel framework that introduces test-time scaling into conversational multimodal product retrieval. Our approach builds on a generative retriever, further augmented with a test-time reranking (TTR) mechanism that improves retrieval accuracy and better aligns results with evolving user intent throughout the dialogue. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show consistent improvements, with average gains of 14.5 points in MRR and 10.6 points in nDCG@1.</p></details> |  |

We introduce FreezeTST, a lightweight hybrid that interleaves frozen random-feature (reservoir) blocks with standard trainable Transformer layers. The frozen blocks endow the network with rich nonlinear memory at no optimisation cost; the trainable layers learn to query this memory through self-attention. The design cuts trainable parameters and also lowers wall-clock training time, while leaving inference complexity unchanged. On seven standard long-term forecasting benchmarks, FreezeTST consistently matches or surpasses specialised variants such as Informer, Autoformer, and PatchTST; with substantially lower compute. Our results show that embedding reservoir principles within Transformers offers a simple, principled route to efficient long-term time-series prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 tables, 3 figures, accepted at ECAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Quantum-Classical Hybrid Framework for Zero-Day Time-Push GNSS Spoofing Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18085v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are critical for Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) applications. However, GNSS are highly vulnerable to spoofing attacks, where adversaries transmit counterfeit signals to mislead receivers. Such attacks can lead to severe consequences, including misdirected navigation, compromised data integrity, and operational disruptions. Most existing spoofing detection methods depend on supervised learning techniques and struggle to detect novel, evolved, and unseen attacks. To overcome this limitation, we develop a zero-day spoofing detection method using a Hybrid Quantum-Classical Autoencoder (HQC-AE), trained solely on authentic GNSS signals without exposure to spoofed data. By leveraging features extracted during the tracking stage, our method enables proactive detection before PNT solutions are computed. We focus on spoofing detection in static GNSS receivers, which are particularly susceptible to time-push spoofing attacks, where attackers manipulate timing information to induce incorrect time computations at the receiver. We evaluate our model against different unseen time-push spoofing attack scenarios: simplistic, intermediate, and sophisticated. Our analysis demonstrates that the HQC-AE consistently outperforms its classical counterpart, traditional supervised learning-based models, and existing unsupervised learning-based methods in detecting zero-day, unseen GNSS time-push spoofing attacks, achieving an average detection accuracy of 97.71% with an average false negative rate of 0.62% (when an attack occurs but is not detected). For sophisticated spoofing attacks, the HQC-AE attains an accuracy of 98.23% with a false negative rate of 1.85%. These findings highlight the effectiveness of our method in proactively detecting zero-day GNSS time-push spoofing attacks across various stationary GNSS receiver platforms.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE Internet of Things Journal for possible publication</p></details> |

Preserving this equivalence, GNNs can universally approximate any target function on graphs in probability up to any precision. However, these results are limited to attributed discrete-dynamic graphs represented as sequences of connected graph snapshots. Real-world systems, such as communication networks, financial transaction networks, and molecular interactions, evolve asynchronously and may split into disconnected components. In this paper, we extend the theory of attributed discrete-dynamic graphs to attributed continuous-time dynamic graphs with arbitrary connectivity. To this end, we introduce a continuous-time dynamic 1-WL test, prove its equivalence to continuous-time dynamic unfolding trees, and identify a class of continuous-time dynamic GNNs (CGNNs) based on discrete-dynamic GNN architectures that retain both distinguishing power and universal approximation guarantees. Our constructive proofs further yield practical design guidelines, emphasizing a compact and expressive CGNN architecture with piece-wise continuously differentiable temporal functions to process asynchronous, disconnected graphs.</p></details> |  |
| **[FlexTSF: A Flexible Forecasting Model for Time Series with Variable Regularities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23160v2)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting time series with irregular temporal structures remains challenging for universal pre-trained models. Existing approaches often assume regular sampling or depend heavily on imputation, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios where irregularities are prevalent due to diverse sensing devices and recording practices. We introduce FlexTSF, a flexible forecasting model specifically designed for time series data with variable temporal regularities. At its foundation lies the IVP Patcher, a continuous-time patching module leveraging Initial Value Problems (IVPs) to inherently support uneven time intervals, variable sequence lengths, and missing values. FlexTSF employs a decoder-only architecture that integrates normalized timestamp inputs and domain-specific statistics through a specialized causal self-attention mechanism, enabling adaptability across domains. Extensive experiments on 16 datasets demonstrate FlexTSF's effectiveness, significantly outperforming existing models in classic forecasting scenarios, zero-shot generalization, and low-resource fine-tuning conditions. Ablation studies confirm the contributions of each design component and the advantage of not relying on predefined fixed patch lengths.</p></details> |  |

This variant integrates the characteristics of the Steiner Traveling Salesman Problem with time-window constraints, pickup and delivery operations and vehicle capacity limitations. These features closely mirror the complexities of contemporary logistics challenges, including last-mile distribution, reverse logistics and on-demand service scenarios. To tackle the inherent computational difficulties of this NP-hard problem, we propose two specialized mathematical formulations: an arc-based model and a node-oriented model, each designed to capture distinct structural aspects of the problem. Both models are implemented on D-Wave's LeapCQMHybrid platform, which combines quantum and classical techniques for solving constrained optimization tasks. We further introduce a preprocessing reduction method that eliminates redundant arcs, significantly enhancing computational performance and scalability. Experimental results demonstrate that hybrid quantum approaches are capable of solving problem instances of realistic size, underscoring their potential as a transformative tool for next-generation routing optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 7 figures, and 12 tables</p></details> |

Unlike classical network interdiction models where the leader is subject to a single budget constraint, in our setting, both the leader and the follower are subject to several independent capacity constraints and engage in a zero-sum game. While the problem of finding a maximum weight independent set in a partition matroid is known to be polynomially solvable, we prove that the considered bilevel problem is $NP$-hard even when the weights of ground elements are all binary. On a positive note, it is revealed that, if the number of capacity constraints is fixed for either the leader or the follower, then the considered class of bilevel problems admits several polynomial-time solution schemes. Specifically, these schemes are based on a single-level dual reformulation, a dynamic programming-based approach, and a greedy algorithm for the leader.</p></details> |  |
| **[Effect of Performance Feedback Timing on Motor Learning for a Surgical Training Task](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17830v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Objective: Robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RMIS) has become the gold standard for a variety of surgical procedures, but the optimal method of training surgeons for RMIS is unknown. We hypothesized that real-time, rather than post-task, error feedback would better increase learning speed and reduce errors. Methods: Forty-two surgical novices learned a virtual version of the ring-on-wire task, a canonical task in RMIS training. We investigated the impact of feedback timing with multi-sensory (haptic and visual) cues in three groups: (1) real-time error feedback, (2) trial replay with error feedback, and (3) no error feedback. Results: Participant performance was evaluated based on the accuracy of ring position and orientation during the task. Participants who received real-time feedback outperformed other groups in ring orientation. Additionally, participants who received feedback in replay outperformed participants who did not receive any error feedback on ring orientation during long, straight path sections. There were no significant differences between groups for ring position overall, but participants who received real-time feedback outperformed the other groups in positional accuracy on tightly curved path sections. Conclusion: The addition of real-time haptic and visual error feedback improves learning outcomes in a virtual surgical task over error feedback in replay or no error feedback at all. Significance: This work demonstrates that multi-sensory error feedback delivered in real time leads to better training outcomes as compared to the same feedback delivered after task completion. This novel method of training may enable surgical trainees to develop skills with greater speed and accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering</p></details> |
| **[CLaP -- State Detection from Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01783v2)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ever-growing amount of sensor data from machines, smart devices, and the environment leads to an abundance of high-resolution, unannotated time series (TS). These recordings encode recognizable properties of latent states and transitions from physical phenomena that can be modelled as abstract processes. The unsupervised localization and identification of these states and their transitions is the task of time series state detection (TSSD). Current TSSD algorithms employ classical unsupervised learning techniques, to infer state membership directly from feature space. This limits their predictive power, compared to supervised learning methods, which can exploit additional label information. We introduce CLaP, a new, highly accurate and efficient algorithm for TSSD. It leverages the predictive power of time series classification for TSSD in an unsupervised setting by applying novel self-supervision techniques to detect whether data segments emerge from the same state. To this end, CLaP cross-validates a classifier with segment-labelled subsequences to quantify confusion between segments. It merges labels from segments with high confusion, representing the same latent state, if this leads to an increase in overall classification quality. We conducted an experimental evaluation using 405 TS from five benchmarks and found CLaP to be significantly more precise in detecting states than six state-of-the-art competitors. It achieves the best accuracy-runtime tradeoff and is scalable to large TS. We provide a Python implementation of CLaP, which can be deployed in TS analysis workflows.</p></details> |  |
| **[ASCMamba: Multimodal Time-Frequency Mamba for Acoustic Scene Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15632v2)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Acoustic Scene Classification (ASC) is a fundamental problem in computational audition, which seeks to classify environments based on the distinctive acoustic features. In the ASC task of the APSIPA ASC 2025 Grand Challenge, the organizers introduce a multimodal ASC task. Unlike traditional ASC systems that rely solely on audio inputs, this challenge provides additional textual information as inputs, including the location where the audio is recorded and the time of recording. In this paper, we present our proposed system for the ASC task in the APSIPA ASC 2025 Grand Challenge. Specifically, we propose a multimodal network, ASCMamba, which integrates audio and textual information for fine-grained acoustic scene understanding and effective multimodal ASC. The proposed ASCMamba employs a DenseEncoder to extract hierarchical spectral features from spectrograms, followed by a dual-path Mamba blocks that capture long-range temporal and frequency dependencies using Mamba-based state space models. In addition, we present a two-step pseudo-labeling mechanism to generate more reliable pseudo-labels. Results show that the proposed system outperforms all the participating teams and achieves a 6.2% improvement over the baseline. Code, model and pre-trained checkpoints are available at https://github.com/S-Orion/ASCMamba.git.</p></details> |  |
| **[Personalized Tree-Based Progressive Regression Model for Watch-Time Prediction in Short Video Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22153v2)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In online video platforms, accurate watch time prediction has become a fundamental and challenging problem in video recommendation. Previous research has revealed that the accuracy of watch time prediction highly depends on both the transformation of watch-time labels and the decomposition of the estimation process. TPM (Tree based Progressive Regression Model) achieves State-of-the-Art performance with a carefully designed and effective decomposition paradigm. TPM discretizes the watch time into several ordinal intervals and organizes them into a binary decision tree, where each node corresponds to a specific interval. At each non-leaf node, a binary classifier is used to determine the specific interval in which the watch time variable most likely falls, based on the prediction outcome at its parent node. The tree structure is central to TPM, as it defines the decomposition of watch time estimation and how ordinal intervals are discretized. However, TPM uses a predefined full binary tree, which may be sub-optimal for two reasons. First, full binary trees imply equal partitioning of the watch time space, which may fail to capture the complexity of real-world distributions. Second, rather than relying on a fixed global structure, we advocate for a personalized, data-driven tree that can be learned end-to-end. Thus, we propose PTPM to enable highly personalized decomposition of watch estimation with better efficacy and efficiency. Moreover, we show that TPM suffers from selection bias due to conditional modeling and propose a simple solution. We conduct extensive experiments on offline datasets and online environments. Offline results show improved watch time accuracy, and online A/B tests further validate the effectiveness of our framework. PTPM has been fully deployed in core traffic scenarios and now serves over 400 million users daily.</p></details> | cikm'25 |

However, large-scale UAM operations connecting multiple origin-destination pairs raise concerns about air traffic safety and efficiency due to potential conflict movements, particularly at major conflict points analogous to roadway junctions. To meet the safety and efficiency requirements of future UAM operations, this work proposes an air traffic management framework that integrates route guidance and collision avoidance. The route guidance mechanism optimizes aircraft distribution across both spatial and temporal dimensions by regulating their paths (composed of waypoints). Given the optimized paths, the collision avoidance algorithm generates collision-free aircraft trajectories between waypoints in the 3D space. To enable large-scale applications, we develop fast approximation methods for centralized path planning and adopt the velocity obstacle model for distributed collision avoidance. To our knowledge, this work is one of the first to integrate route guidance and collision avoidance for UAM. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework enables efficient and flexible UAM operations, including air traffic assignment, local congestion mitigation, and dynamic no-fly zone management. Compared with a collision-free baseline strategy, the proposed framework achieves considerable improvements in traffic safety and efficiency, with increases in the average minimum separation (+98.2%), the average travel speed (+70.2%), and the trip completion rate (+130%), along with a reduction in the energy consumption (-23.0%). The proposed framework demonstrates its potential for real-time traffic simulation and management in large-scale UAM systems.</p></details> | 26 pages |

Such data often has metadata and partially observed signals that jointly influence the generated values. However, existing methods face three key limitations: (1) they condition on either the metadata or observed values, but rarely both together; (2) they adopt either training-time approaches that fail to generalize to unseen scenarios, or inference-time approaches that ignore metadata; and (3) they suffer from trade-offs between generation speed and temporal coherence across time windows--choosing either slow but coherent autoregressive methods or fast but incoherent parallel ones. We propose WaveStitch, a novel diffusion-based method to overcome these hurdles through: (1) dual-sourced conditioning on both metadata and partially observed signals; (2) a hybrid training-inference architecture, incorporating metadata during training and observations at inference via gradient-based guidance; and (3) a novel pipeline-style paradigm that generates time windows in parallel while preserving coherence through an inference-time conditional loss and a stitching mechanism. Across diverse datasets, WaveStitch demonstrates adaptability to arbitrary patterns of observed signals, achieving 1.81x lower mean-squared-error compared to the state-of-the-art, and generates data up to 166.48x faster than autoregressive methods while maintaining coherence.

In ad-hoc array conditions, microphone invariance (MI) requires systems to handle different microphone numbers and array geometries. From a practical perspective, multichannel recordings inevitably increase the computational burden for edge-device applications, highlighting the necessity of lightweight and efficient deployments. In this work, we propose a lightweight attentive beamforming network (LABNet) to integrate MI in a low-complexity real-time SE system. We design a three-stage framework for efficient intra-channel modeling and inter-channel interaction. A cross-channel attention module is developed to aggregate features from each channel selectively. Experimental results demonstrate our LABNet achieves impressive performance with ultra-light resource overhead while maintaining the MI, indicating great potential for ad-hoc array processing.</p></details> |  |

In Ultimate, the player holding the disc cannot move, making field dynamics primarily driven by other players' movements. However, current literature in team sports has ignored quantitative evaluations of when players initiate such unlabeled movements in game situations. In this paper, we propose a quantitative evaluation method for movement initiation timing in Ultimate Frisbee. First, game footage was recorded using a drone camera, and players' positional data was obtained, which will be published as UltimateTrack dataset. Next, players' movement initiations were detected, and temporal counterfactual scenarios were generated by shifting the timing of movements using rule-based approaches. These scenarios were analyzed using a space evaluation metric based on soccer's pitch control reflecting the unique rules of Ultimate. By comparing the spatial evaluation values across scenarios, the difference between actual play and the most favorable counterfactual scenario was used to quantitatively assess the impact of movement timing. We validated our method and show that sequences in which the disc was actually thrown to the receiver received higher evaluation scores than the sequences without a throw. In practical verifications, the higher-skill group displays a broader distribution of time offsets from the model's optimal initiation point. These findings demonstrate that the proposed metric provides an objective means of assessing movement initiation timing, which has been difficult to quantify in unlabeled team sport plays.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 13 figures, 12th Workshop on Machine Learning and Data Mining for Sports Analytics, https://github.com/shunsuke-iwashita/VTCS</p></details> |

We propose RT-Cache, a training-free retrieval-as-control pipeline that caches diverse image action trajectories in a unified vector memory and, at test time, embeds the current frame to retrieve and replay multi-step snippets, replacing per-step model calls. A hierarchical search keeps lookups sub-second at million scale, shifting cost from compute to storage and enabling real-time control on modest GPUs. Across real-robot tasks and large open logs, RT-Cache achieves higher success and lower completion time than strong retrieval baselines (approximately x2 higher success and ~30% faster in our settings), and a single-episode anchoring study shows immediate adaptation to a more complex, contact-rich task without fine-tuning. RT-Cache turns experience into an append-only memory, offering a simple, scalable path to few-shot deployment today and a foundation for multimodal keys and optional integration with high-level policies.

| **[An Ontology-Driven Graph RAG for Legal Norms: A Hierarchical, Temporal, and Deterministic Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00039v4)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems in the legal domain face a critical challenge: standard, flat-text retrieval is blind to the hierarchical, diachronic, and causal structure of law, leading to anachronistic and unreliable answers. This paper introduces an ontology-driven Graph RAG framework designed to overcome these limitations. We ground our knowledge graph in a formal, LRMoo-inspired model that distinguishes abstract legal Works from their versioned Expressions. We model temporal states as efficient aggregations that reuse the versioned expressions (CTVs) of unchanged components, and we reify legislative events as first-class Action nodes to make causality explicit and queryable. This structured backbone enables a unified, planner-guided query strategy that applies explicit policies to deterministically resolve complex requests for (i) point-in-time retrieval, (ii) hierarchical impact analysis, and (iii) auditable provenance reconstruction. Through a case study on the Brazilian Constitution, we demonstrate how this approach provides a verifiable, temporally-correct substrate for LLMs, enabling higher-order analytical capabilities while drastically reducing the risk of factual errors. The result is a practical framework for building more trustworthy and explainable legal AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a major revision that significantly expands and deepens the original manuscript. While the core ontological model remains the same, this version provides a substantially more rigorous and detailed account of how the framework is applied in practice, particularly within a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) context</p></details> |
| **[TimeFlow: Temporal Conditioning for Longitudinal Brain MRI Registration and Aging Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08667v3)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Longitudinal brain analysis is essential for understanding healthy aging and identifying pathological deviations. Longitudinal registration of sequential brain MRI underpins such analyses. However, existing methods are limited by reliance on densely sampled time series, a trade-off between accuracy and temporal smoothness, and an inability to prospectively forecast future brain states. To overcome these challenges, we introduce \emph{TimeFlow}, a learning-based framework for longitudinal brain MRI registration. TimeFlow uses a U-Net backbone with temporal conditioning to model neuroanatomy as a continuous function of age. Given only two scans from an individual, TimeFlow estimates accurate and temporally coherent deformation fields, enabling non-linear extrapolation to predict future brain states. This is achieved by our proposed inter-/extra-polation consistency constraints applied to both the deformation fields and deformed images. Remarkably, these constraints preserve temporal consistency and continuity without requiring explicit smoothness regularizers or densely sampled sequential data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TimeFlow outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both future timepoint forecasting and registration accuracy. Moreover, TimeFlow supports novel biological brain aging analyses by differentiating neurodegenerative trajectories from normal aging without requiring segmentation, thereby eliminating the need for labor-intensive annotations and mitigating segmentation inconsistency. TimeFlow offers an accurate, data-efficient, and annotation-free framework for longitudinal analysis of brain aging and chronic diseases, capable of forecasting brain changes beyond the observed study period.</p></details> |  |

However, EEG signals are often noisy, affected by artifacts, and vary across individuals, complicating emotion recognition. While multimodal approaches have used Peripheral Physiological Signals (PPS) like GSR to complement EEG, they often overlook the dynamic synchronization and consistent semantics between the modalities. Additionally, the temporal dynamics of emotional fluctuations across different time resolutions in PPS remain underexplored. To address these challenges, we propose PhysioSync, a novel pre-training framework leveraging temporal and cross-modal contrastive learning, inspired by physiological synchronization phenomena. PhysioSync incorporates Cross-Modal Consistency Alignment (CM-CA) to model dynamic relationships between EEG and complementary PPS, enabling emotion-related synchronizations across modalities. Besides, it introduces Long- and Short-Term Temporal Contrastive Learning (LS-TCL) to capture emotional synchronization at different temporal resolutions within modalities. After pre-training, cross-resolution and cross-modal features are hierarchically fused and fine-tuned to enhance emotion recognition. Experiments on DEAP and DREAMER datasets demonstrate PhysioSync's advanced performance under uni-modal and cross-modal conditions, highlighting its effectiveness for EEG-centered emotion recognition.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in IEEE TCSS.

We propose HierCVAE, a novel architecture that integrates hierarchical attention mechanisms with conditional variational autoencoders to address these challenges. HierCVAE employs a three-tier attention structure (local, global, cross-temporal) combined with multi-modal condition encoding to capture temporal, statistical, and trend information. The approach incorporates ResFormer blocks in the latent space and provides explicit uncertainty quantification via prediction heads. Through evaluations on energy consumption datasets, HierCVAE demonstrates a 15-40% improvement in prediction accuracy and superior uncertainty calibration compared to state-of-the-art methods, excelling in long-term forecasting and complex multi-variate dependencies.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |

Existing methods typically rely on static or first-order causal structures, overlooking the multi-order and time-varying nature of causal relationships. In this paper, we propose MOCHA, a novel framework for discovering multi-order dynamic causality in TPPs. MOCHA characterizes multi-order influences as multi-hop causal paths over a latent time-evolving graph. To model such dynamics, we introduce a time-varying directed acyclic graph (DAG) with learnable structural weights, where acyclicity and sparsity constraints are enforced to ensure structural validity. We design an end-to-end differentiable framework that jointly models causal discovery and TPP dynamics, enabling accurate event prediction and revealing interpretable structures. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that MOCHA not only achieves state-of-the-art performance in event prediction, but also reveals meaningful and interpretable causal structures.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Value Function Space Approach for Hierarchical Planning with Signal Temporal Logic Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01923v2)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Signal Temporal Logic (STL) has emerged as an expressive language for reasoning intricate planning objectives. However, existing STL-based methods often assume full observation and known dynamics, which imposes constraints on real-world applications. To address this challenge, we propose a hierarchical planning framework that starts by constructing the Value Function Space (VFS) for state and action abstraction, which embeds functional information about affordances of the low-level skills. Subsequently, we utilize a neural network to approximate the dynamics in the VFS and employ sampling based optimization to synthesize high-level skill sequences that maximize the robustness measure of the given STL tasks in the VFS. Then those skills are executed in the low-level environment. Empirical evaluations in the Safety Gym and ManiSkill environments demonstrate that our method accomplish the STL tasks without further training in the low-level environments, substantially reducing the training burdens.</p></details> |  |

The Micro-gesture Online Recognition task is a highly challenging problem that aims to locate the temporal positions and recognize the categories of multiple micro-gesture instances in untrimmed videos. Compared to traditional temporal action detection, this task places greater emphasis on distinguishing between micro-gesture categories and precisely identifying the start and end times of each instance. Moreover, micro-gestures are typically spontaneous human actions, with greater differences than those found in other human actions. To address these challenges, we propose hand-crafted data augmentation and spatial-temporal attention to enhance the model's ability to classify and localize micro-gestures more accurately. Our solution achieved an F1 score of 38.03, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art by 37.9%. As a result, our method ranked first in the Micro-gesture Online Recognition track.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Chronological Passage Assembling in RAG framework for Temporal Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18748v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-context question answering over narrative tasks is challenging because correct answers often hinge on reconstructing a coherent timeline of events while preserving contextual flow in a limited context window. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) indexing methods aim to address this challenge by selectively retrieving only necessary document segments. However, narrative texts possess unique characteristics that limit the effectiveness of these existing approaches. Specifically, understanding narrative texts requires more than isolated segments, as the broader context and sequential relationships between segments are crucial for comprehension. To address these limitations, we propose ChronoRAG, a novel RAG framework specialized for narrative texts. This approach focuses on two essential aspects: refining dispersed document information into coherent and structured passages, and preserving narrative flow by explicitly capturing and maintaining the temporal order among retrieved passages. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of ChronoRAG through experiments on the NarrativeQA dataset, showing substantial improvements in tasks requiring both factual identification and comprehension of complex sequential relationships, underscoring that reasoning over temporal order is crucial in resolving narrative QA.</p></details> | 7 pages, 3 figures |

Specifically, we consider a single UAV with 3 degree-of-freedom dynamics tasked with delivering blood packages to multiple hospitals, each with a predefined time window and priority. Mission objectives are encoded using Signal Temporal Logic (STL), enabling the formal specification of spatial-temporal constraints. To ensure safety, city buildings are modeled as 3D convex obstacles, and obstacle avoidance is handled through a Convex Feasible Set (CFS) method. The entire planning problem-combining UAV dynamics, STL satisfaction, and collision avoidance-is formulated as a convex optimization problem that ensures tractability and can be solved efficiently using standard convex programming techniques. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method generates dynamically feasible, collision-free trajectories that satisfy temporal mission goals, providing a scalable and reliable approach for autonomous UAV-based medical logistics.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Hierarchical Spatio-temporal Segmentation Network for Ejection Fraction Estimation in Echocardiography Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18681v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated segmentation of the left ventricular endocardium in echocardiography videos is a key research area in cardiology. It aims to provide accurate assessment of cardiac structure and function through Ejection Fraction (EF) estimation. Although existing studies have achieved good segmentation performance, their results do not perform well in EF estimation. In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Spatio-temporal Segmentation Network (\ourmodel) for echocardiography video, aiming to improve EF estimation accuracy by synergizing local detail modeling with global dynamic perception. The network employs a hierarchical design, with low-level stages using convolutional networks to process single-frame images and preserve details, while high-level stages utilize the Mamba architecture to capture spatio-temporal relationships. The hierarchical design balances single-frame and multi-frame processing, avoiding issues such as local error accumulation when relying solely on single frames or neglecting details when using only multi-frame data. To overcome local spatio-temporal limitations, we propose the Spatio-temporal Cross Scan (STCS) module, which integrates long-range context through skip scanning across frames and positions. This approach helps mitigate EF calculation biases caused by ultrasound image noise and other factors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Controllable Single-shot Animation Blending with Temporal Conditioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18525v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training a generative model on a single human skeletal motion sequence without being bound to a specific kinematic tree has drawn significant attention from the animation community. Unlike text-to-motion generation, single-shot models allow animators to controllably generate variations of existing motion patterns without requiring additional data or extensive retraining. However, existing single-shot methods do not explicitly offer a controllable framework for blending two or more motions within a single generative pass. In this paper, we present the first single-shot motion blending framework that enables seamless blending by temporally conditioning the generation process. Our method introduces a skeleton-aware normalization mechanism to guide the transition between motions, allowing smooth, data-driven control over when and how motions blend. We perform extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations across various animation styles and different kinematic skeletons, demonstrating that our approach produces plausible, smooth, and controllable motion blends in a unified and efficient manner.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the AI for Visual Arts Workshop at ICCV 2025</p></details> |

Leveraging linearity, we decompose each agent's system into deterministic nominal and stochastic error parts, and design disturbance feedback controllers to bound the stochastic errors by solving a tractable optimization problem over the training data. We then quantify prediction regions (PRs) for the aggregate error trajectories corresponding to agent cliques, involved in collaborative tasks, using conformal prediction and calibration data. This enables us to address the specified joint chance constraint via Lipschitz tightening and the computed PRs, and relax the centralized stochastic optimal control problem to a deterministic one, whose solution provides the feedforward inputs. To enhance scalability, we decompose the deterministic problem into agent-level subproblems solved in an MPC fashion, yielding a distributed control policy. Finally, we present an illustrative example and a comparison with [1].</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 2 figures, Accepted for presentation at the 64th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC2025)</p></details> |
| **[TOMATO: Assessing Visual Temporal Reasoning Capabilities in Multimodal Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23266v2)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing benchmarks often highlight the remarkable performance achieved by state-of-the-art Multimodal Foundation Models (MFMs) in leveraging temporal context for video understanding. However, how well do the models truly perform visual temporal reasoning? Our study of existing benchmarks shows that this capability of MFMs is likely overestimated as many questions can be solved by using a single, few, or out-of-order frames. To systematically examine current visual temporal reasoning tasks, we propose three principles with corresponding metrics: (1) Multi-Frame Gain, (2) Frame Order Sensitivity, and (3) Frame Information Disparity. Following these principles, we introduce TOMATO, Temporal Reasoning Multimodal Evaluation, a novel benchmark crafted to rigorously assess MFMs' temporal reasoning capabilities in video understanding. TOMATO comprises 1,484 carefully curated, human-annotated questions spanning six tasks (i.e., action count, direction, rotation, shape & trend, velocity & frequency, and visual cues), applied to 1,417 videos, including 805 self-recorded and -generated videos, that encompass human-centric, real-world, and simulated scenarios. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals a human-model performance gap of 57.3% with the best-performing model. Moreover, our in-depth analysis uncovers more fundamental limitations beyond this gap in current MFMs. While they can accurately recognize events in isolated frames, they fail to interpret these frames as a continuous sequence. We believe TOMATO will serve as a crucial testbed for evaluating the next-generation MFMs and as a call to the community to develop AI systems capable of comprehending human world dynamics through the video modality.</p></details> |  |

The problem has been shown to be critical for tasks such as contact tracing, fault diagnosis, and financial forensics. The state-of-the-art EF-Index designs a separated forest structure for a set of carefully selected windows, incurring quadratic preprocessing time and large redundant storage. Our method introduces the ECB-forest, a compact edge-centric binary forest that captures k-core of any arbitrary query vertex over time. In this way, a query can be processed by searching a connected component in the forest. We develop an efficient algorithm for index construction. Experiments on real-world temporal graphs show that our method significantly improves the index size and construction cost (up to 100x faster on average) while maintaining the high query efficiency.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce a factorized model that captures the semantics of these adverbials as probabilistic distributions. These distributions are composed with event-specific distributions to yield a contextualized meaning for an adverbial applied to a specific event. We fit the model's parameters using existing data capturing judgments of native speakers regarding the applicability of these vague temporal adverbials to events that took place a given time ago. Comparing our approach to a non-factorized model based on a single Gaussian distribution for each pair of event and temporal adverbial, we find that while both models have similar predictive power, our model is preferable in terms of Occam's razor, as it is simpler and has better extendability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Camer...</summary><p>Camera-ready version of the paper accepted at the 2025 Annual Meeting of the Cognitive Science Society (CogSci 2025).

| **[TPA: Temporal Prompt Alignment for Fetal Congenital Heart Defect Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15298v2)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Congenital heart defect (CHD) detection in ultrasound videos is hindered by image noise and probe positioning variability. While automated methods can reduce operator dependence, current machine learning approaches often neglect temporal information, limit themselves to binary classification, and do not account for prediction calibration. We propose Temporal Prompt Alignment (TPA), a method leveraging foundation image-text model and prompt-aware contrastive learning to classify fetal CHD on cardiac ultrasound videos. TPA extracts features from each frame of video subclips using an image encoder, aggregates them with a trainable temporal extractor to capture heart motion, and aligns the video representation with class-specific text prompts via a margin-hinge contrastive loss. To enhance calibration for clinical reliability, we introduce a Conditional Variational Autoencoder Style Modulation (CVAESM) module, which learns a latent style vector to modulate embeddings and quantifies classification uncertainty. Evaluated on a private dataset for CHD detection and on a large public dataset, EchoNet-Dynamic, for systolic dysfunction, TPA achieves state-of-the-art macro F1 scores of 85.40% for CHD diagnosis, while also reducing expected calibration error by 5.38% and adaptive ECE by 6.8%. On EchoNet-Dynamic's three-class task, it boosts macro F1 by 4.73% (from 53.89% to 58.62%). Temporal Prompt Alignment (TPA) is a framework for fetal congenital heart defect (CHD) classification in ultrasound videos that integrates temporal modeling, prompt-aware contrastive learning, and uncertainty quantification.</p></details> |  |

To address this limitation, we propose the first video fusion framework that explicitly incorporates temporal modeling with visual-semantic collaboration to simultaneously ensure visual fidelity, semantic accuracy, and temporal consistency. First, we introduce a visual-semantic interaction module consisting of a semantic branch and a visual branch, with Dinov2 and VGG19 employed for targeted distillation, allowing simultaneous enhancement of both the visual and semantic representations. Second, we pioneer integrate the video degradation enhancement task into the video fusion pipeline by constructing a temporal cooperative module, which leverages temporal dependencies to facilitate weak information recovery. Third, to ensure temporal consistency, we embed a temporal-enhanced mechanism into the network and devise a temporal loss to guide the optimization process. Finally, we introduce two innovative evaluation metrics tailored for video fusion, aimed at assessing the temporal consistency of the generated fused videos. Extensive experimental results on public video datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method.

The method first employs an improved Transformer module to perform temporal modeling on high-dimensional monitoring data, using a self-attention mechanism to capture long-range dependencies and contextual semantics. Then, a multiscale feature construction path is introduced to extract temporal features at different granularities through downsampling and parallel encoding. An attention-weighted fusion module is designed to dynamically adjust the contribution of each scale to the final decision, enhancing the model's robustness in anomaly pattern modeling. In the input modeling stage, standardized multidimensional time series are constructed, covering core signals such as CPU utilization, memory usage, and task scheduling states, while positional encoding is used to strengthen the model's temporal awareness. A systematic experimental setup is designed to evaluate performance, including comparative experiments and hyperparameter sensitivity analysis, focusing on the impact of optimizers, learning rates, anomaly ratios, and noise levels. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms mainstream baseline models in key metrics, including precision, recall, AUC, and F1-score, and maintains strong stability and detection performance under various perturbation conditions, demonstrating its superior capability in complex cloud environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[GaussianFlowOcc: Sparse and Weakly Supervised Occupancy Estimation using Gaussian Splatting and Temporal Flow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17288v4)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Occupancy estimation has become a prominent task in 3D computer vision, particularly within the autonomous driving community. In this paper, we present a novel approach to occupancy estimation, termed GaussianFlowOcc, which is inspired by Gaussian Splatting and replaces traditional dense voxel grids with a sparse 3D Gaussian representation. Our efficient model architecture based on a Gaussian Transformer significantly reduces computational and memory requirements by eliminating the need for expensive 3D convolutions used with inefficient voxel-based representations that predominantly represent empty 3D spaces. GaussianFlowOcc effectively captures scene dynamics by estimating temporal flow for each Gaussian during the overall network training process, offering a straightforward solution to a complex problem that is often neglected by existing methods. Moreover, GaussianFlowOcc is designed for scalability, as it employs weak supervision and does not require costly dense 3D voxel annotations based on additional data (e.g., LiDAR). Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that GaussianFlowOcc significantly outperforms all previous methods for weakly supervised occupancy estimation on the nuScenes dataset while featuring an inference speed that is 50 times faster than current SOTA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025</p></details> |

We propose Language-Guided Temporal Token Pruning (LGTTP), which leverages temporal cues from queries to adaptively prune video tokens, preserving contextual continuity while reducing computational overhead. Unlike uniform pruning or keyframe selection, LGTTP retains higher token density in temporally relevant segments. Our model-agnostic framework integrates with TimeChat and LLaVA-Video, achieving a 65% reduction in computation while preserving 97-99% of the original performance. On QVHighlights, LGTTP improves HIT@1 by +9.5%, and on Charades-STA, it retains 99.6% of R@1. It excels on queries with explicit temporal markers and remains effective across general video understanding tasks.</p></details> |  |

While deep learning and pretrained foundation models show strong potential for improved generalization via lightweight adaptation of the final layers ('probing'), their robustness to unseen viewpoints remains underexplored. We study this challenge by adapting image foundation models to driver monitoring using a single training view, and evaluating them directly on unseen perspectives without further adaptation. We benchmark simple linear probes, advanced probing strategies, and compare two foundation models (DINOv2 and CLIP) against parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) and full fine-tuning. Building on these insights, we introduce T-MASK -- a new image-to-video probing method that leverages temporal token masking and emphasizes more dynamic video regions. Benchmarked on the public Drive&Act dataset, T-MASK improves cross-view top-1 accuracy by $+1.23\%$ over strong probing baselines and $+8.0\%$ over PEFT methods, without adding any parameters. It proves particularly effective for underrepresented secondary activities, boosting recognition by $+5.42\%$ under the trained view and $+1.36\%$ under cross-view settings. This work provides encouraging evidence that adapting foundation models with lightweight probing methods like T-MASK has strong potential in fine-grained driver observation, especially in cross-view and low-data settings. These results highlight the importance of temporal token selection when leveraging foundation models to build robust driver monitoring systems. Code and models will be made available at https://github.com/th-nesh/T-MASK to support ongoing research.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by 26th IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems ITSC 2025</p></details> |

In this work, we revisit temporal search paradigms for long-form video understanding and address a fundamental issue pertaining to all state-of-the-art (SOTA) long-context vision-language models (VLMs). Our contributions are twofold: First, we frame temporal search as a Long Video Haystack problem: finding a minimal set of relevant frames (e.g., one to five) from tens of thousands based on specific queries. Upon this formulation, we introduce LV-Haystack, the first dataset with 480 hours of videos, 15,092 human-annotated instances for both training and evaluation aiming to improve temporal search quality and efficiency. Results on LV-Haystack highlight a significant research gap in temporal search capabilities, with current SOTA search methods only achieving 2.1% temporal F1 score on the Longvideobench subset. Next, inspired by visual search in images, we propose a lightweight temporal search framework, T* that reframes costly temporal search as spatial search. T* leverages powerful visual localization techniques commonly used in images and introduces an adaptive zooming-in mechanism that operates across both temporal and spatial dimensions. Extensive experiments show that integrating T* with existing methods significantly improves SOTA long-form video understanding. Under an inference budget of 32 frames, T* improves GPT-4o's performance from 50.5% to 53.1% and LLaVA-OneVision-OV-72B's performance from 56.5% to 62.4% on the Longvideobench XL subset.

In Ultimate, the player holding the disc cannot move, making field dynamics primarily driven by other players' movements. However, current literature in team sports has ignored quantitative evaluations of when players initiate such unlabeled movements in game situations. In this paper, we propose a quantitative evaluation method for movement initiation timing in Ultimate Frisbee. First, game footage was recorded using a drone camera, and players' positional data was obtained, which will be published as UltimateTrack dataset. Next, players' movement initiations were detected, and temporal counterfactual scenarios were generated by shifting the timing of movements using rule-based approaches. These scenarios were analyzed using a space evaluation metric based on soccer's pitch control reflecting the unique rules of Ultimate. By comparing the spatial evaluation values across scenarios, the difference between actual play and the most favorable counterfactual scenario was used to quantitatively assess the impact of movement timing. We validated our method and show that sequences in which the disc was actually thrown to the receiver received higher evaluation scores than the sequences without a throw. In practical verifications, the higher-skill group displays a broader distribution of time offsets from the model's optimal initiation point. These findings demonstrate that the proposed metric provides an objective means of assessing movement initiation timing, which has been difficult to quantify in unlabeled team sport plays.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 13 figures, 12th Workshop on Machine Learning and Data Mining for Sports Analytics, https://github.com/shunsuke-iwashita/VTCS</p></details> |
| **[Tracking Temporal Evolution of Topological Features in Image Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17530v1)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Topological Data Analysis (TDA) can be used to detect and characterize holes in an image, such as zero-dimensional holes (connected components) or one-dimensional holes (loops). However, there is currently no widely accepted statistical framework for modeling spatiotemporal dependence in the evolution of topological features, such as holes, within a time series of images. We propose a hypothesis testing framework to identify statistically significant topological features of images in space and time, simultaneously. This addition of time may induce higher-dimensional topological features which can be used to establish temporal connections between the lower-dimensional features at each point in time. The temporal evolution of these lower-dimensional features is then represented on a zigzag persistence diagram, as a topological summary statistic focused on time dynamics. We demonstrate that the method effectively captures the emergence and progression of topological features in a study of a series of images of a wounded cell as it repairs. The proposed method outperforms a current approach in a simulation study that includes features of the wound healing process. Since, the wounded cell images exhibit nonlinear, dynamic, spatial, and temporal structures during single-cell repair, they provide a good application for this method.</p></details> | 24 pages, 9 Figures |

Traditional methods often rely on imputation, which may introduce bias or fail to capture the underlying temporal dynamics. In this paper, we propose TANDEM (Temporal Attention-guided Neural Differential Equations for Missingness), an attention-guided neural differential equation framework that effectively classifies time series data with missing values. Our approach integrates raw observation, interpolated control path, and continuous latent dynamics through a novel attention mechanism, allowing the model to focus on the most informative aspects of the data. We evaluate TANDEM on 30 benchmark datasets and a real-world medical dataset, demonstrating its superiority over existing state-of-the-art methods. Our framework not only improves classification accuracy but also provides insights into the handling of missing data, making it a valuable tool in practice.</p></details> |  |

This mismatch mirrors biological morphogenesis where developmental phases demand distinct genetic programs. Inspired by epigenetic regulation governing morphological specialization, we propose **(ANT)**, an **A**daptive **N**eural **T**emporal-Aware architecture. ANT orchestrates semantic granularity through: **(i) Semantic Temporally Adaptive (STA) Module:** Automatically partitions denoising into low-frequency structural planning and high-frequency refinement via spectral analysis. **(ii) Dynamic Classifier-Free Guidance scheduling (DCFG):** Adaptively adjusts conditional to unconditional ratio enhancing efficiency while maintaining fidelity.

It is motivated by the fact that HOI is crucial for human-centric video content understanding. To solve ST-HOID, we propose a novel method consisting of an object trajectory detection module and an interaction reasoning module. Furthermore, we construct the first dataset named VidOR-HOID for ST-HOID evaluation, which contains 10,831 spatial-temporal HOI instances. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our method. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the baselines generated by the state-of-the-art methods of image human-object interaction detection, video visual relation detection and video human-object interaction recognition.</p></details> |  |
| **[Development of an isotropic segmentation model for medial temporal lobe subregions on anisotropic MRI atlas using implicit neural representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17171v1)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imaging biomarkers in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are important tools for diagnosing and tracking Alzheimer's disease (AD). As medial temporal lobe (MTL) is the earliest region to show AD-related hallmarks, brain atrophy caused by AD can first be observed in the MTL. Accurate segmentation of MTL subregions and extraction of imaging biomarkers from them are important. However, due to imaging limitations, the resolution of T2-weighted (T2w) MRI is anisotropic, which makes it difficult to accurately extract the thickness of cortical subregions in the MTL. In this study, we used an implicit neural representation method to combine the resolution advantages of T1-weighted and T2w MRI to accurately upsample an MTL subregion atlas set from anisotropic space to isotropic space, establishing a multi-modality, high-resolution atlas set. Based on this atlas, we developed an isotropic MTL subregion segmentation model. In an independent test set, the cortical subregion thickness extracted using this isotropic model showed higher significance than an anisotropic method in distinguishing between participants with mild cognitive impairment and cognitively unimpaired (CU) participants. In longitudinal analysis, the biomarkers extracted using isotropic method showed greater stability in CU participants. This study improved the accuracy of AD imaging biomarkers without increasing the amount of atlas annotation work, which may help to more accurately quantify the relationship between AD and brain atrophy and provide more accurate measures for disease tracking.</p></details> |  |

The sensitivity of mainstream OAD models to varying video viewpoints often hampers their generalization when confronted with unseen sources. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Probabilistic Temporal Masked Attention (PTMA) model, which leverages probabilistic modeling to derive latent compressed representations of video frames in a cross-view setting. The PTMA model incorporates a GRU-based temporal masked attention (TMA) cell, which leverages these representations to effectively query the input video sequence, thereby enhancing information interaction and facilitating autoregressive frame-level video analysis. Additionally, multi-view information can be integrated into the probabilistic modeling to facilitate the extraction of view-invariant features. Experiments conducted under three evaluation protocols: cross-subject (cs), cross-view (cv), and cross-subject-view (csv) show that PTMA achieves state-of-the-art performance on the DAHLIA, IKEA ASM, and Breakfast datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 6 figures, accepted at IEEE Transactions on Multimedia (TMM), in press</p></details> |
| **[Boosting Temporal Sentence Grounding via Causal Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04958v2)** | 2025-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal Sentence Grounding (TSG) aims to identify relevant moments in an untrimmed video that semantically correspond to a given textual query. Despite existing studies having made substantial progress, they often overlook the issue of spurious correlations between video and textual queries. These spurious correlations arise from two primary factors: (1) inherent biases in the textual data, such as frequent co-occurrences of specific verbs or phrases, and (2) the model's tendency to overfit to salient or repetitive patterns in video content. Such biases mislead the model into associating textual cues with incorrect visual moments, resulting in unreliable predictions and poor generalization to out-of-distribution examples. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel TSG framework, causal intervention and counterfactual reasoning that utilizes causal inference to eliminate spurious correlations and enhance the model's robustness. Specifically, we first formulate the TSG task from a causal perspective with a structural causal model. Then, to address unobserved confounders reflecting textual biases toward specific verbs or phrases, a textual causal intervention is proposed, utilizing do-calculus to estimate the causal effects. Furthermore, visual counterfactual reasoning is performed by constructing a counterfactual scenario that focuses solely on video features, excluding the query and fused multi-modal features. This allows us to debias the model by isolating and removing the influence of the video from the overall effect. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.

To address this challenge, we construct the Thematic Representation Set (TRS), an extended dataset that begins with real-world thematic ETFs and expands upon them by incorporating industry classifications and financial news to overcome their coverage limitations. The final dataset contains both the explicit mapping of themes to their constituent stocks and the rich textual profiles for each. Building on this dataset, we introduce \textsc{THEME}, a hierarchical contrastive learning framework. By representing the textual profiles of themes and stocks as embeddings, \textsc{THEME} first leverages their hierarchical relationship to achieve semantic alignment. Subsequently, it refines these semantic embeddings through a temporal refinement stage that incorporates individual stock returns. The final stock representations are designed for effective retrieval of thematically aligned assets with strong return potential. Empirical results show that \textsc{THEME} outperforms strong baselines across multiple retrieval metrics and significantly improves performance in portfolio construction. By jointly modeling thematic relationships from text and market dynamics from returns, \textsc{THEME} provides a scalable and adaptive solution for navigating complex investment themes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM)</p></details> |

Traditional models often rely on parametric kernels, limiting their ability to capture heterogeneous, nonstationary dynamics. Recent innovations integrate deep neural architectures -- either by modeling the conditional intensity function directly or by learning flexible, data-driven influence kernels, substantially broadening their expressive power. This article reviews the development of the deep influence kernel approach, which enjoys statistical explainability, since the influence kernel remains in the model to capture the spatiotemporal propagation of event influence and its impact on future events, while also possessing strong expressive power, thereby benefiting from both worlds. We explain the main components in developing deep kernel point processes, leveraging tools such as functional basis decomposition and graph neural networks to encode complex spatial or network structures, as well as estimation using both likelihood-based and likelihood-free methods, and address computational scalability for large-scale data. We also discuss the theoretical foundation of kernel identifiability.

| **[MuST2-Learn: Multi-view Spatial-Temporal-Type Learning for Heterogeneous Municipal Service Time Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16503v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Non-emergency municipal services such as city 311 systems have been widely implemented across cities in Canada and the United States to enhance residents' quality of life. These systems enable residents to report issues, e.g., noise complaints, missed garbage collection, and potholes, via phone calls, mobile applications, or webpages. However, residents are often given limited information about when their service requests will be addressed, which can reduce transparency, lower resident satisfaction, and increase the number of follow-up inquiries. Predicting the service time for municipal service requests is challenging due to several complex factors: dynamic spatial-temporal correlations, underlying interactions among heterogeneous service request types, and high variation in service duration even within the same request category. In this work, we propose MuST2-Learn: a Multi-view Spatial-Temporal-Type Learning framework designed to address the aforementioned challenges by jointly modeling spatial, temporal, and service type dimensions. In detail, it incorporates an inter-type encoder to capture relationships among heterogeneous service request types and an intra-type variation encoder to model service time variation within homogeneous types. In addition, a spatiotemporal encoder is integrated to capture spatial and temporal correlations in each request type. The proposed framework is evaluated with extensive experiments using two real-world datasets.

| **[Not Only Consistency: Enhance Test-Time Adaptation with Spatio-temporal Inconsistency for Remote Physiological Measurement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07908v2)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote physiological measurement (RPM) has emerged as a promising non-invasive method for monitoring physiological signals using the non-contact device. Although various domain adaptation and generalization methods were proposed to promote the adaptability of deep-based RPM models in unseen deployment environments, considerations in aspects such as privacy concerns and real-time adaptation restrict their application in real-world deployment. Thus, we aim to propose a novel fully Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) strategy tailored for RPM tasks in this work. Specifically, based on prior knowledge in physiology and our observations, we noticed not only there is spatio-temporal consistency in the frequency domain of BVP signals, but also that inconsistency in the time domain was significant. Given this, by leveraging both consistency and inconsistency priors, we introduce an innovative expert knowledge-based self-supervised \textbf{C}onsistency-\textbf{i}n\textbf{C}onsistency-\textbf{i}ntegration (\textbf{CiCi}) framework to enhances model adaptation during inference. Besides, our approach further incorporates a gradient dynamic control mechanism to mitigate potential conflicts between priors, ensuring stable adaptation across instances. Through extensive experiments on five diverse datasets under the TTA protocol, our method consistently outperforms existing techniques, presenting state-of-the-art performance in real-time self-supervised adaptation without accessing source data. The code will be released later.</p></details> |  |

Unsupervised VOS (UVOS) has the additional challenge of finding an initial segmentation of salient objects, which affects the entire process and keeps a permanent uncertainty about the object proposals. Moreover, deformation and fast motion can lead to temporal inconsistencies. To address these problems, we propose Frequent Temporally Integrated Objects (FTIO), a post-processing framework with two key components. First, we introduce a combined criterion to improve object selection, mitigating failures common in UVOS--particularly when objects are small or structurally complex--by extracting frequently appearing salient objects. Second, we present a three-stage method to correct temporal inconsistencies by integrating missing object mask regions. Experimental results demonstrate that FTIO achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-object UVOS.

However, current models struggle with ensuring the validity and generalizability of inferred spatio-temporal patterns, especially in capturing dynamic spatial dependencies and temporal shifts, and optimizing the generalizability of unknown sensors. To overcome these limitations, we propose Spatio-Temporal Aware Graph Adversarial Neural Network (STA-GANN), a novel GNN-based kriging framework that improves spatio-temporal pattern validity and generalization. STA-GANN integrates (i) Decoupled Phase Module that senses and adjusts for timestamp shifts. (ii) Dynamic Data-Driven Metadata Graph Modeling to update spatial relationships using temporal data and metadata; (iii) An adversarial transfer learning strategy to ensure generalizability. Extensive validation across nine datasets from four fields and theoretical evidence both demonstrate the superior performance of STA-GANN.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Hybrid Discontinuous Galerkin Neural Network Method for Solving Hyperbolic Conservation Laws with Temporal Progressive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16032v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For hyperbolic conservation laws, traditional methods and physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) often encounter difficulties in capturing sharp discontinuities and maintaining temporal consistency. To address these challenges, we introduce a hybrid computational framework by coupling discontinuous Galerkin (DG) discretizations with a temporally progressive neural network architecture. Our method incorporates a structure-preserving weak-form loss -- combining DG residuals and Rankine-Hugoniot jump conditions -- with a causality-respecting progressive training strategy. The proposed framework trains neural networks sequentially across temporally decomposed subintervals, leveraging pseudo-label supervision to ensure temporal coherence and solution continuity. This approach mitigates error accumulation and enhances the model's capacity to resolve shock waves and steep gradients without explicit limiters. Besides, a theoretical analysis establishes error bounds for the proposed framework, demonstrating convergence toward the physical solution under mesh refinement and regularized training. Numerical experiments on Burgers and Euler equations show that our method consistently outperforms standard PINNs, PINNs-WE, and first-order DG schemes in both accuracy and robustness, particularly in capturing shocks and steep gradients. These results highlight the promise of combining classical discretization techniques with machine learning to develop robust and accurate solvers for nonlinear hyperbolic systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transforming Causality: Transformer-Based Temporal Causal Discovery with Prior Knowledge Integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15928v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel framework for temporal causal discovery and inference that addresses two key challenges: complex nonlinear dependencies and spurious correlations. Our approach employs a multi-layer Transformer-based time-series forecaster to capture long-range, nonlinear temporal relationships among variables. After training, we extract the underlying causal structure and associated time lags from the forecaster using gradient-based analysis, enabling the construction of a causal graph. To mitigate the impact of spurious causal relationships, we introduce a prior knowledge integration mechanism based on attention masking, which consistently enforces user-excluded causal links across multiple Transformer layers. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches, achieving a 12.8% improvement in F1-score for causal discovery and 98.9% accuracy in estimating causal lags.</p></details> |  |
| **[VT-LVLM-AR: A Video-Temporal Large Vision-Language Model Adapter for Fine-Grained Action Recognition in Long-Term Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15903v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human action recognition in long-term videos, characterized by complex backgrounds and subtle action differences, poses significant challenges for traditional deep learning models due to computational overhead, difficulty in capturing long-range temporal dependencies, and limited semantic understanding. While Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in multi-modal understanding and reasoning, their direct application to continuous video streams for fine-grained action recognition remains an open problem. This paper introduces VT-LVLM-AR (Video-Temporal Large Vision-Language Model Adapter for Action Recognition), a novel framework designed to bridge this gap. VT-LVLM-AR comprises a Video-to-Event Mapper (VTEM) that efficiently transforms raw video into compact, semantically rich, and temporally coherent "visual event sequences" through lightweight spatio-temporal feature extraction, adaptive temporal pooling, and conceptual quantization with an event coherence bias. These visual event sequences are then fed into an LVLM-based Action Reasoning module, specifically a frozen LLaVA-1.5 model, adapted using parameter-efficient Prompt Tuning (P-Tuning v2) for action classification. Comprehensive evaluations on the NTU RGB+D and NTU RGB+D 120 datasets demonstrate that VT-LVLM-AR consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing methods (e.g., 94.1% accuracy on NTU RGB+D X-Sub). Ablation studies confirm the critical contributions of VTEM's components and the efficacy of Prompt Tuning, while human evaluations underscore the interpretability of our visual event representations. This work highlights the immense potential of leveraging LVLMs for robust and interpretable video action understanding through effective video-to-language translation and efficient model adaptation.</p></details> |  |
| **[STGAtt: A Spatial-Temporal Unified Graph Attention Network for Traffic Flow Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16685v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and timely traffic flow forecasting is crucial for intelligent transportation systems. This paper presents a novel deep learning model, the Spatial-Temporal Unified Graph Attention Network (STGAtt). By leveraging a unified graph representation and an attention mechanism, STGAtt effectively captures complex spatial-temporal dependencies. Unlike methods relying on separate spatial and temporal dependency modeling modules, STGAtt directly models correlations within a Spatial-Temporal Unified Graph, dynamically weighing connections across both dimensions. To further enhance its capabilities, STGAtt partitions traffic flow observation signal into neighborhood subsets and employs a novel exchanging mechanism, enabling effective capture of both short-range and long-range correlations. Extensive experiments on the PEMS-BAY and SHMetro datasets demonstrate STGAtt's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines across various prediction horizons. Visualization of attention weights confirms STGAtt's ability to adapt to dynamic traffic patterns and capture long-range dependencies, highlighting its potential for real-world traffic flow forecasting applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Structural Temporal Logic for Mechanized Program Verification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14906v7)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mechanized verification of liveness properties for infinite programs with effects and nondeterminism is challenging. Existing temporal reasoning frameworks operate at the level of models such as traces and automata. Reasoning happens at a very low-level, requiring complex nested (co-)inductive proof techniques and familiarity with proof assistant mechanics (e.g., the guardedness checker). Further, reasoning at the level of models instead of program constructs creates a verification gap that loses the benefits of modularity and composition enjoyed by structural program logics such as Hoare Logic. To address this verification gap, and the lack of compositional proof techniques for temporal specifications, we propose Ticl, a new structural temporal logic. Using ticl, we encode complex (co-)inductive proof techniques as structural lemmas and focus our reasoning on variants and invariants. We show that it is possible to perform compositional proofs of general temporal properties in a proof assistant, while working at a high level of abstraction. We demonstrate the benefits of Ticl by giving mechanized proofs of safety and liveness properties for programs with scheduling, concurrent shared memory, and distributed consensus, demonstrating a low proof-to-code ratio.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Spatial-Temporal Dynamics in Event-based Facial Micro-Expression Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11988v2)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Micro-expression analysis has applications in domains such as Human-Robot Interaction and Driver Monitoring Systems. Accurately capturing subtle and fast facial movements remains difficult when relying solely on RGB cameras, due to limitations in temporal resolution and sensitivity to motion blur. Event cameras offer an alternative, with microsecond-level precision, high dynamic range, and low latency. However, public datasets featuring event-based recordings of Action Units are still scarce. In this work, we introduce a novel, preliminary multi-resolution and multi-modal micro-expression dataset recorded with synchronized RGB and event cameras under variable lighting conditions. Two baseline tasks are evaluated to explore the spatial-temporal dynamics of micro-expressions: Action Unit classification using Spiking Neural Networks (51.23\% accuracy with events vs. 23.12\% with RGB), and frame reconstruction using Conditional Variational Autoencoders, achieving SSIM = 0.8513 and PSNR = 26.89 dB with high-resolution event input. These promising results show that event-based data can be used for micro-expression recognition and frame reconstruction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bidirectional Temporal Information Propagation for Moving Infrared Small Target Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15415v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Moving infrared small target detection is broadly adopted in infrared search and track systems, and has attracted considerable research focus in recent years. The existing learning-based multi-frame methods mainly aggregate the information of adjacent frames in a sliding window fashion to assist the detection of the current frame. However, the sliding-window-based methods do not consider joint optimization of the entire video clip and ignore the global temporal information outside the sliding window, resulting in redundant computation and sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose a Bidirectional temporal information propagation method for moving InfraRed small target Detection, dubbed BIRD. The bidirectional propagation strategy simultaneously utilizes local temporal information of adjacent frames and global temporal information of past and future frames in a recursive fashion. Specifically, in the forward and backward propagation branches, we first design a Local Temporal Motion Fusion (LTMF) module to model local spatio-temporal dependency between a target frame and its two adjacent frames. Then, a Global Temporal Motion Fusion (GTMF) module is developed to further aggregate the global propagation feature with the local fusion feature. Finally, the bidirectional aggregated features are fused and input into the detection head for detection. In addition, the entire video clip is jointly optimized by the traditional detection loss and the additional Spatio-Temporal Fusion (STF) loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed BIRD method not only achieves the state-of-the-art performance but also shows a fast inference speed.</p></details> |  |
| **[EvoFormer: Learning Dynamic Graph-Level Representations with Structural and Temporal Bias Correction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15378v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic graph-level embedding aims to capture structural evolution in networks, which is essential for modeling real-world scenarios. However, existing methods face two critical yet under-explored issues: Structural Visit Bias, where random walk sampling disproportionately emphasizes high-degree nodes, leading to redundant and noisy structural representations; and Abrupt Evolution Blindness, the failure to effectively detect sudden structural changes due to rigid or overly simplistic temporal modeling strategies, resulting in inconsistent temporal embeddings. To overcome these challenges, we propose EvoFormer, an evolution-aware Transformer framework tailored for dynamic graph-level representation learning. To mitigate Structural Visit Bias, EvoFormer introduces a Structure-Aware Transformer Module that incorporates positional encoding based on node structural roles, allowing the model to globally differentiate and accurately represent node structures. To overcome Abrupt Evolution Blindness, EvoFormer employs an Evolution-Sensitive Temporal Module, which explicitly models temporal evolution through a sequential three-step strategy: (I) Random Walk Timestamp Classification, generating initial timestamp-aware graph-level embeddings; (II) Graph-Level Temporal Segmentation, partitioning the graph stream into segments reflecting structurally coherent periods; and (III) Segment-Aware Temporal Self-Attention combined with an Edge Evolution Prediction task, enabling the model to precisely capture segment boundaries and perceive structural evolution trends, effectively adapting to rapid temporal shifts. Extensive evaluations on five benchmark datasets confirm that EvoFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance in graph similarity ranking, temporal anomaly detection, and temporal segmentation tasks, validating its effectiveness in correcting structural and temporal biases.</p></details> |  |
| **[TComQA: Extracting Temporal Commonsense from Text](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15274v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding events necessitates grasping their temporal context, which is often not explicitly stated in natural language. For example, it is not a trivial task for a machine to infer that a museum tour may last for a few hours, but can not take months. Recent studies indicate that even advanced large language models (LLMs) struggle in generating text that require reasoning with temporal commonsense due to its infrequent explicit mention in text. Therefore, automatically mining temporal commonsense for events enables the creation of robust language models. In this work, we investigate the capacity of LLMs to extract temporal commonsense from text and evaluate multiple experimental setups to assess their effectiveness. Here, we propose a temporal commonsense extraction pipeline that leverages LLMs to automatically mine temporal commonsense and use it to construct TComQA, a dataset derived from SAMSum and RealNews corpora. TComQA has been validated through crowdsourcing and achieves over 80\% precision in extracting temporal commonsense. The model trained with TComQA also outperforms an LLM fine-tuned on existing dataset of temporal question answering task.</p></details> |  |

While current spatial media technologies have primarily focused on capturing or replaying content as static assets, often disconnected from the viewer's environment or offering limited interactivity, the means to describe an experience's underlying semantic and interactive structure remains underexplored. We propose a descriptive framework called MAR-ED based on three core primitives: 1) Event Primitives for semantic scene graph representation, 2) Keyframe Primitives for efficient and meaningful data access, and 3) Playback Primitives for user-driven adaptive interactive playback of recorded MAR experience. The proposed flowchart of the three-stage process of the proposed MAR-ED framework transforms a recorded experience into a unique adaptive MAR experience during playback, where its spatio-temporal structure dynamically conforms to a new environment and its narrative can be altered by live user input. Drawing on this framework, personal digital memories and recorded events can evolve beyond passive 2D/3D videos into immersive, spatially-integrated group experiences, opening new paradigms for training, cultural heritage, and interactive storytelling without requiring complex, per-user adaptive rendering.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 2 figures, Accepted in the IEEE ISMAR 2025 XRStand Workshop</p></details> |

In this paper, we introduce Grounded-VideoLLM, a novel Video-LLM adept at perceiving and reasoning over specific video moments in a fine-grained manner. We identify that current Video-LLMs have limitations for fine-grained video understanding since they lack effective temporal modeling and timestamp representation. In light of this, we sharpen our model by incorporating (1) an additional temporal stream to encode the relationships between frames and (2) discrete temporal tokens enriched with specific time knowledge to represent timestamps. To optimize the training of Grounded-VideoLLM, we employ a multi-stage training scheme, beginning with simple video-captioning tasks and progressively introducing video temporal grounding tasks of increasing complexity. To further enhance Grounded-VideoLLM's temporal reasoning capability, we also curate a grounded VideoQA dataset by an automatic annotation pipeline. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Grounded-VideoLLM not only excels in fine-grained grounding tasks such as temporal sentence grounding, dense video captioning, and grounded VideoQA, but also shows great potential as a versatile video assistant for general video understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP 2025 Findings</p></details> |
| **[Temporal $k$-Core Query, Revisited](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15238v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Querying cohesive subgraphs in temporal graphs is essential for understanding the dynamic structure of real-world networks, such as evolving communities in social platforms, shifting hyperlink structures on the Web, and transient communication patterns in call networks. Recently, research has focused on the temporal $k$-core query, which aims to identify all $k$-cores across all possible time sub-intervals within a given query interval. The state-of-the-art algorithm OTCD mitigates redundant computations over overlapping sub-intervals by exploiting inclusion relationships among $k$-cores in different time intervals. Nevertheless, OTCD remains limited in scalability due to the combinatorial growth in interval enumeration and repeated processing. In this paper, we revisit the temporal $k$-core query problem and introduce a novel algorithm CoreT, which dynamically records the earliest timestamp at which each vertex or edge enters a $k$-core. This strategy enables substantial pruning of redundant computations. As a result, CoreT requires only a single pass over the query interval and achieves improved time complexity, which is linear in both the number of temporal edges within the query interval and the duration of the interval, making it highly scalable for long-term temporal analysis. Experimental results on large real-world datasets show that CoreT achieves up to four orders of magnitude speedup compared to the existing state-of-the-art OTCD, demonstrating its effectiveness and scalability for temporal $k$-core analysis.</p></details> |  |

It proposes a risk assessment framework based on federated learning. Without sharing raw data, the method enables joint modeling and risk identification across multiple institutions. This is achieved by incorporating a feature attention mechanism and temporal modeling structure. Specifically, the model adopts a distributed optimization strategy. Each financial institution trains a local sub-model. The model parameters are protected using differential privacy and noise injection before being uploaded. A central server then aggregates these parameters to generate a global model. This global model is used for systemic risk identification. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, multiple experiments are conducted. These evaluate communication efficiency, model accuracy, systemic risk detection, and cross-market generalization. The results show that the proposed model outperforms both traditional centralized methods and existing federated learning variants across all evaluation metrics. It demonstrates strong modeling capabilities and practical value in sensitive financial environments. The method enhances the scope and efficiency of risk identification while preserving data sovereignty. It offers a secure and efficient solution for intelligent financial risk analysis.</p></details> |  |

Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) are designed to support human drivers and are especially useful when they can anticipate potential accidents before they happen. While many existing systems depend on a range of sensors such as LiDAR, radar, and GPS, relying solely on dash-cam video input presents a more challenging but a more cost-effective and easily deployable solution. In this work, we incorporate better spatio-temporal features and aggregate them through a recurrent network to improve upon state-of-the-art graph neural networks for predicting accidents from dash-cam videos. Experiments using three publicly available datasets show that our proposed STAGNet model achieves higher average precision and mean time-to-collision values than previous methods, both when cross-validated on a given dataset and when trained and tested on different datasets.</p></details> |  |

Linear temporal logic (LTL) offers a unified formalism to specify such requirements, yet existing methods are limited in their abilities to handle nested long-horizon tasks and safety constraints, and cannot identify situations when a subgoal is not satisfiable and an alternative should be sought. In this paper, we introduce GenZ-LTL, a method that enables zero-shot generalization to arbitrary LTL specifications. GenZ-LTL leverages the structure of B\"uchi automata to decompose an LTL task specification into sequences of reach-avoid subgoals. Contrary to the current state-of-the-art method that conditions on subgoal sequences, we show that it is more effective to achieve zero-shot generalization by solving these reach-avoid problems \textit{one subgoal at a time} through proper safe RL formulations. In addition, we introduce a novel subgoal-induced observation reduction technique that can mitigate the exponential complexity of subgoal-state combinations under realistic assumptions. Empirical results show that GenZ-LTL substantially outperforms existing methods in zero-shot generalization to unseen LTL specifications.</p></details> |  |

We design a novel two-step GSL-based structural enhancer to enrich and optimize node neighborhoods and demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency through theoretical proofs and experiments. The TGIB refines the optimized graph by extending the information bottleneck principle to temporal graphs, regularizing both edges and features based on our derived tractable TGIB objective function via variational approximation, enabling stable and efficient optimization. GTGIB-based models are evaluated to predict links on four real-world datasets; they outperform existing methods in all datasets under the inductive setting, with significant and consistent improvement in the transductive setting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in the 28th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI), 2025</p></details> |

A common class of approaches formulates these hybrid problems, which involve discrete task scheduling and continuous motion planning, as mixed-integer programs (MIP).

In this work, we present a method based on Benders Decomposition to address scenarios where solving the entire monolithic optimization problem is prohibitively intractable. Benders Decomposition proposes an iterative cutting-plane technique that partitions the problem into a master problem to prototype a plan that meets the task specification, and a series of subproblems for kinematics and dynamics feasibility checks.

To address these challenges, we present TRUST-Planner, a topology-guided hierarchical planning framework for robust spatial-temporal obstacle avoidance. In the frontend, a dynamic enhanced visible probabilistic roadmap (DEV-PRM) is proposed to rapidly explore topological paths for global guidance. The backend utilizes a uniform terminal-free minimum control polynomial (UTF-MINCO) and dynamic distance field (DDF) to enable efficient predictive obstacle avoidance and fast parallel computation. Furthermore, an incremental multi-branch trajectory management framework is introduced to enable spatio-temporal topological decision-making, while efficiently leveraging historical information to reduce replanning time. Simulation results show that TRUST-Planner outperforms baseline competitors, achieving a 96\% success rate and millisecond-level computation efficiency in tested complex environments. Real-world experiments further validate the feasibility and practicality of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |

Although Selective State Space Models (SSMs) have shown good performance in sequence modeling with linear complexity, the spatio-temporal disorder of point cloud videos hinders their unidirectional modeling when directly unfolding the point cloud video into a 1D sequence through temporally sequential scanning. To address this challenge, we propose the Unified Spatio-Temporal State Space Model (UST-SSM), which extends the latest advancements in SSMs to point cloud videos. Specifically, we introduce Spatial-Temporal Selection Scanning (STSS), which reorganizes unordered points into semantic-aware sequences through prompt-guided clustering, thereby enabling the effective utilization of points that are spatially and temporally distant yet similar within the sequence. For missing 4D geometric and motion details, Spatio-Temporal Structure Aggregation (STSA) aggregates spatio-temporal features and compensates. To improve temporal interaction within the sampled sequence, Temporal Interaction Sampling (TIS) enhances fine-grained temporal dependencies through non-anchor frame utilization and expanded receptive fields. Experimental results on the MSR-Action3D, NTU RGB+D, and Synthia 4D datasets validate the effectiveness of our method.

However, existing LLM-based methods fail to sufficiently leverage the rich temporal information inherent in users' historical interaction sequences, stemming from fundamental architectural constraints: LLMs process information through self-attention mechanisms that lack inherent sequence ordering and rely on position embeddings designed primarily for natural language rather than user interaction sequences. This limitation significantly impairs their ability to capture the evolution of user preferences over time and predict future interests accurately. To address this critical gap, we propose \underline{C}ounterfactual \underline{E}nhanced \underline{T}emporal Framework for LLM-Based \underline{Rec}ommendation (CETRec). CETRec is grounded in causal inference principles, which allow it to isolate and measure the specific impact of temporal information on recommendation outcomes. Combined with our counterfactual tuning task derived from causal analysis, CETRec effectively enhances LLMs' awareness of both absolute order (how recently items were interacted with) and relative order (the sequential relationships between items). Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our CETRec. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CETRec-B9CE/.</p></details> |  |

It proposes a unified prediction framework that integrates structural perception and temporal modeling. The method leverages graph neural networks to model the structural relationships among multimodal clinical symptoms and introduces graph-based representations to capture semantic dependencies between symptoms. It also incorporates a Transformer architecture to model dynamic temporal features during disease progression. To fuse structural and temporal information, a structure-aware gating mechanism is designed to dynamically adjust the fusion weights between structural encodings and temporal features, enhancing the model's ability to identify key progression stages. To improve classification accuracy and stability, the framework includes a multi-component modeling pipeline, consisting of a graph construction module, a temporal encoding module, and a prediction output layer. The model is evaluated on real-world longitudinal Parkinson's disease data. The experiments involve comparisons with mainstream models, sensitivity analysis of hyperparameters, and graph connection density control. Results show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches in AUC, RMSE, and IPW-F1 metrics. It effectively distinguishes progression stages and improves the model's ability to capture personalized symptom trajectories.

Interpretation of digital subtraction angiography (DSA) sequences poses challenges due to anatomical complexity and time constraints. This work proposes OccluNet, a spatio-temporal deep learning model that integrates YOLOX, a single-stage object detector, with transformer-based temporal attention mechanisms to automate occlusion detection in DSA sequences. We compared OccluNet with a YOLOv11 baseline trained on either individual DSA frames or minimum intensity projections. Two spatio-temporal variants were explored for OccluNet: pure temporal attention and divided space-time attention. Evaluation on DSA images from the MR CLEAN Registry revealed the model's capability to capture temporally consistent features, achieving precision and recall of 89.02% and 74.87%, respectively. OccluNet significantly outperformed the baseline models, and both attention variants attained similar performance.

| **[Hierarchical Temporal Point Process Modeling of Aggressive Behavior Onset in Psychiatric Inpatient Youth with Autism for Branching Factor Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12424v3)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aggressive behavior in autistic inpatient youth often arises in temporally clustered bursts complicating efforts to distinguish external triggers from internal escalation. The sample population branching factor-the expected number of new onsets triggered by a given event-is a key summary of self-excitation in behavior dynamics. Prior pooled models overestimate this quantity by ignoring patient-specific variability. We addressed this using a hierarchical Hawkes process with an exponential kernel and edge-effect correction allowing partial pooling across patients. This approach reduces bias from high-frequency individuals and stabilizes estimates for those with sparse data. Bayesian inference was performed using the No U-Turn Sampler with model evaluation via convergence diagnostics, power-scaling sensitivity analysis, and multiple Goodness-of-Fit (GOF) metrics: PSIS-LOO the Lewis test with Durbin's modification and residual analysis based on the Random Time Change Theorem (RTCT). The hierarchical model yielded a significantly lower and more precise branching factor estimate mean (0.742 +- 0.026) than the pooled model (0.899 +- 0.015) and narrower intervals than the unpooled model (0.717 +- 0.139). This led to a threefold smaller cascade of events per onset under the hierarchical model. Sensitivity analyses confirmed robustness to prior and likelihood perturbations while the unpooled model showed instability for sparse individuals. GOF measures consistently favored or on par to the hierarchical model. Hierarchical Hawkes modeling with edge-effect correction provides robust estimation of branching dynamics by capturing both within- and between-patient variability. This enables clearer separation of endogenous from exogenous events supports linkage to physiological signals and enhances early warning systems individualized treatment and resource allocation in inpatient care.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to BMC Medical Research Methodology</p></details> |

Motivated by an existing concept called core times, we propose a novel algorithm to compute all temporal $k$-cores based on core times and prove that the algorithmic running time is bounded by the size of all resulting temporal k-cores, which is optimal in this scenario. Meanwhile, we show that the cost of computing core times is much lower, which demonstrates the close relevance between our overall running time and the result size.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial-Temporal Transformer with Curriculum Learning for EEG-Based Emotion Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14698v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>EEG-based emotion recognition plays an important role in developing adaptive brain-computer communication systems, yet faces two fundamental challenges in practical implementations: (1) effective integration of non-stationary spatial-temporal neural patterns, (2) robust adaptation to dynamic emotional intensity variations in real-world scenarios. This paper proposes SST-CL, a novel framework integrating spatial-temporal transformers with curriculum learning. Our method introduces two core components: a spatial encoder that models inter-channel relationships and a temporal encoder that captures multi-scale dependencies through windowed attention mechanisms, enabling simultaneous extraction of spatial correlations and temporal dynamics from EEG signals. Complementing this architecture, an intensity-aware curriculum learning strategy progressively guides training from high-intensity to low-intensity emotional states through dynamic sample scheduling based on a dual difficulty assessment. Comprehensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across various emotional intensity levels, with ablation studies confirming the necessity of both architectural components and the curriculum learning mechanism.</p></details> |  |
| **[Forecasting Smog Events Using ConvLSTM: A Spatio-Temporal Approach for Aerosol Index Prediction in South Asia](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13891v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The South Asian Smog refers to the recurring annual air pollution events marked by high contaminant levels, reduced visibility, and significant socio-economic impacts, primarily affecting the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) from November to February. Over the past decade, increased air pollution sources such as crop residue burning, motor vehicles, and changing weather patterns have intensified these smog events. However, real-time forecasting systems for increased particulate matter concentrations are still not established at regional scale. The Aerosol Index, closely tied to smog formation and a key component in calculating the Air Quality Index (AQI), reflects particulate matter concentrations. This study forecasts aerosol events using Sentinel-5P air constituent data (2019-2023) and a Convolutional Long-Short Term Memory (ConvLSTM) neural network, which captures spatial and temporal correlations more effectively than previous models. Using the Ultraviolet (UV) Aerosol Index at 340-380 nm as the predictor, results show the Aerosol Index can be forecasted at five-day intervals with a Mean Squared Error of ~0.0018, loss of ~0.3995, and Structural Similarity Index of ~0.74. While effective, the model can be improved by integrating additional data and refining its architecture.</p></details> |  |
| **[Where to Go Next Day: Multi-scale Spatial-Temporal Decoupled Model for Mid-term Human Mobility Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06561v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting individual mobility patterns is crucial across various applications. While current methods mainly focus on predicting the next location for personalized services like recommendations, they often fall short in supporting broader applications such as traffic management and epidemic control, which require longer period forecasts of human mobility. This study addresses mid-term mobility prediction, aiming to capture daily travel patterns and forecast trajectories for the upcoming day or week. We propose a novel Multi-scale Spatial-Temporal Decoupled Predictor (MSTDP) designed to efficiently extract spatial and temporal information by decoupling daily trajectories into distinct location-duration chains. Our approach employs a hierarchical encoder to model multi-scale temporal patterns, including daily recurrence and weekly periodicity, and utilizes a transformer-based decoder to globally attend to predicted information in the location or duration chain. Additionally, we introduce a spatial heterogeneous graph learner to capture multi-scale spatial relationships, enhancing semantic-rich representations. Extensive experiments, including statistical physics analysis, are conducted on large-scale mobile phone records in five cities (Boston, Los Angeles, SF Bay Area, Shanghai, and Tokyo), to demonstrate MSTDP's advantages. Applied to epidemic modeling in Boston, MSTDP significantly outperforms the best-performing baseline, achieving a remarkable 62.8% reduction in MAE for cumulative new cases.</p></details> |  |
| **[STAS: Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Computation Time for Spiking Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14138v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer energy efficiency over artificial neural networks (ANNs) but suffer from high latency and computational overhead due to their multi-timestep operational nature. While various dynamic computation methods have been developed to mitigate this by targeting spatial, temporal, or architecture-specific redundancies, they remain fragmented. While the principles of adaptive computation time (ACT) offer a robust foundation for a unified approach, its application to SNN-based vision Transformers (ViTs) is hindered by two core issues: the violation of its temporal similarity prerequisite and a static architecture fundamentally unsuited for its principles. To address these challenges, we propose STAS (Spatio-Temporal Adaptive computation time for Spiking transformers), a framework that co-designs the static architecture and dynamic computation policy. STAS introduces an integrated spike patch splitting (I-SPS) module to establish temporal stability by creating a unified input representation, thereby solving the architectural problem of temporal dissimilarity. This stability, in turn, allows our adaptive spiking self-attention (A-SSA) module to perform two-dimensional token pruning across both spatial and temporal axes. Implemented on spiking Transformer architectures and validated on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, STAS reduces energy consumption by up to 45.9%, 43.8%, and 30.1%, respectively, while simultaneously improving accuracy over SOTA models.</p></details> | 8 pages |

However, estimating event-based HTR optical flow faces two key challenges: the absence of HTR ground-truth data and the intrinsic sparsity of event data. Most existing approaches rely on the flow accumulation paradigms to indirectly supervise intermediate flows, often resulting in accumulation errors and optimization difficulties. To address these challenges, we propose a residual-based paradigm for estimating HTR optical flow with event data. Our approach separates HTR flow estimation into two stages: global linear motion estimation and HTR residual flow refinement. The residual paradigm effectively mitigates the impacts of event sparsity on optimization and is compatible with any LTR algorithm. Next, to address the challenge posed by the absence of HTR ground truth, we incorporate novel learning strategies. Specifically, we initially employ a shared refiner to estimate the residual flows, enabling both LTR supervision and HTR inference. Subsequently, we introduce regional noise to simulate the residual patterns of intermediate flows, facilitating the adaptation from LTR supervision to HTR inference. Additionally, we show that the noise-based strategy supports in-domain self-supervised training. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in both LTR and HTR metrics, highlighting its effectiveness and superiority.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Spatially-guided Temporal Aggregation for Robust Event-RGB Optical Flow Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00838v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current optical flow methods exploit the stable appearance of frame (or RGB) data to establish robust correspondences across time. Event cameras, on the other hand, provide high-temporal-resolution motion cues and excel in challenging scenarios. These complementary characteristics underscore the potential of integrating frame and event data for optical flow estimation. However, most cross-modal approaches fail to fully utilize the complementary advantages, relying instead on simply stacking information. This study introduces a novel approach that uses a spatially dense modality to guide the aggregation of the temporally dense event modality, achieving effective cross-modal fusion. Specifically, we propose an event-enhanced frame representation that preserves the rich texture of frames and the basic structure of events. We use the enhanced representation as the guiding modality and employ events to capture temporally dense motion information. The robust motion features derived from the guiding modality direct the aggregation of motion information from events. To further enhance fusion, we propose a transformer-based module that complements sparse event motion features with spatially rich frame information and enhances global information propagation. Additionally, a mix-fusion encoder is designed to extract comprehensive spatiotemporal contextual features from both modalities. Extensive experiments on the MVSEC and DSEC-Flow datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. Leveraging the complementary strengths of frames and events, our method achieves leading performance on the DSEC-Flow dataset. Compared to the event-only model, frame guidance improves accuracy by 10\%. Furthermore, it outperforms the state-of-the-art fusion-based method with a 4\% accuracy gain and a 45\% reduction in inference time.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 8 figures, under review</p></details> |

We observe that recent RVOS approaches often place excessive emphasis on feature extraction and temporal modeling, while relatively neglecting the design of the segmentation head. In fact, there remains considerable room for improvement in segmentation head design. To address this, we propose a Temporal-Conditional Referring Video Object Segmentation model, which innovatively integrates existing segmentation methods to effectively enhance boundary segmentation capability. Furthermore, our model leverages a text-to-video diffusion model for feature extraction. On top of this, we remove the traditional noise prediction module to avoid the randomness of noise from degrading segmentation accuracy, thereby simplifying the model while improving performance. Finally, to overcome the limited feature extraction capability of the VAE, we design a Temporal Context Mask Refinement (TCMR) module, which significantly improves segmentation quality without introducing complex designs. We evaluate our method on four public RVOS benchmarks, where it consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | 11 pages, 7 figures |
| **[MedKGent: A Large Language Model Agent Framework for Constructing Temporally Evolving Medical Knowledge Graph](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12393v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid expansion of medical literature presents growing challenges for structuring and integrating domain knowledge at scale. Knowledge Graphs (KGs) offer a promising solution by enabling efficient retrieval, automated reasoning, and knowledge discovery. However, current KG construction methods often rely on supervised pipelines with limited generalizability or naively aggregate outputs from Large Language Models (LLMs), treating biomedical corpora as static and ignoring the temporal dynamics and contextual uncertainty of evolving knowledge. To address these limitations, we introduce MedKGent, a LLM agent framework for constructing temporally evolving medical KGs. Leveraging over 10 million PubMed abstracts published between 1975 and 2023, we simulate the emergence of biomedical knowledge via a fine-grained daily time series. MedKGent incrementally builds the KG in a day-by-day manner using two specialized agents powered by the Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct model. The Extractor Agent identifies knowledge triples and assigns confidence scores via sampling-based estimation, which are used to filter low-confidence extractions and inform downstream processing. The Constructor Agent incrementally integrates the retained triples into a temporally evolving graph, guided by confidence scores and timestamps to reinforce recurring knowledge and resolve conflicts. The resulting KG contains 156,275 entities and 2,971,384 relational triples. Quality assessments by two SOTA LLMs and three domain experts demonstrate an accuracy approaching 90%, with strong inter-rater agreement. To evaluate downstream utility, we conduct RAG across seven medical question answering benchmarks using five leading LLMs, consistently observing significant improvements over non-augmented baselines. Case studies further demonstrate the KG's value in literature-based drug repurposing via confidence-aware causal inference.</p></details> |  |

This will be done utilizing the monotone rearrangement and the nonparametric estimation. We capitalize the Gaussian approximation for the nonparametric monotone estimator and construct the asymptotically correct simultaneous confidence bands (SCBs) using designed bootstrap methods. We investigate two general and practical scenarios. The first is the simultaneous inference of monotone smooth trends from moderately high-dimensional time series. The proposed algorithm has been employed for the joint inference of temperature curves from multiple areas. Specifically, most existing methods are designed for a single monotone smooth trend. In such cases, our proposed SCB empirically exhibits the narrowest width among existing approaches while maintaining confidence levels. It has also been used for testing several hypotheses tailored to global warming. The second scenario involves simultaneous inference of monotone and smoothly time-varying regression coefficients in time-varying coefficient linear models. The proposed algorithm has been utilized for testing the impact of sunshine duration on temperature which is believed to be increasing due to severe greenhouse effect. The validity of the proposed methods has been justified in theory as well as by extensive simulations.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces STER-VLM, a computationally efficient framework that enhances VLM performance through (1) caption decomposition to tackle spatial and temporal information separately, (2) temporal frame selection with best-view filtering for sufficient temporal information, and (3) reference-driven understanding for capturing fine-grained motion and dynamic context and (4) curated visual/textual prompt techniques. Experimental results on the WTS \cite{kong2024wts} and BDD \cite{BDD} datasets demonstrate substantial gains in semantic richness and traffic scene interpretation. Our framework is validated through a decent test score of 55.655 in the AI City Challenge 2025 Track 2, showing its effectiveness in advancing resource-efficient and accurate traffic analysis for real-world applications.</p></details> | ICCV Workshop 2025 |

Although Transformer-based models offer strong global modeling, they often struggle with rigid temporal encoding and weak space-time fusion. We propose STPFormer, a Spatio-Temporal Pattern-Aware Transformer that achieves state-of-the-art performance via unified and interpretable representation learning. It integrates four modules: Temporal Position Aggregator (TPA) for pattern-aware temporal encoding, Spatial Sequence Aggregator (SSA) for sequential spatial learning, Spatial-Temporal Graph Matching (STGM) for cross-domain alignment, and an Attention Mixer for multi-scale fusion. Experiments on five real-world datasets show that STPFormer consistently sets new SOTA results, with ablation and visualizations confirming its effectiveness and generalizability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contrastive Representations for Temporal Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13113v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In classical AI, perception relies on learning state-based representations, while planning, which can be thought of as temporal reasoning over action sequences, is typically achieved through search. We study whether such reasoning can instead emerge from representations that capture both perceptual and temporal structure. We show that standard temporal contrastive learning, despite its popularity, often fails to capture temporal structure due to its reliance on spurious features. To address this, we introduce Combinatorial Representations for Temporal Reasoning (CRTR), a method that uses a negative sampling scheme to provably remove these spurious features and facilitate temporal reasoning. CRTR achieves strong results on domains with complex temporal structure, such as Sokoban and Rubik's Cube. In particular, for the Rubik's Cube, CRTR learns representations that generalize across all initial states and allow it to solve the puzzle using fewer search steps than BestFS, though with longer solutions. To our knowledge, this is the first method that efficiently solves arbitrary Cube states using only learned representations, without relying on an external search algorithm.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://princeton-rl.github.io/CRTR/</p></details> |

This paper presents a contrasting viewpoint, perceiving data points as interconnected and employing a Markov reward process (MRP) for data modeling. We reformulate the typical supervised learning as an on-policy policy evaluation problem within reinforcement learning (RL), introducing a generalized temporal difference (TD) learning algorithm as a resolution. Theoretically, our analysis establishes connections between the solutions of linear TD learning and ordinary least squares (OLS). Under specific conditions -- particularly when the noise is correlated -- the TD solution serves as a more effective estimator than OLS. Furthermore, we show that when our algorithm is applied with many commonly used loss functions -- such as those found in generalized linear models -- it corresponds to the application of a novel and generalized Bellman operator. We prove that this operator admits a unique fixed point, and based on this, we establish convergence guarantees for our generalized TD algorithm under linear function approximation. Empirical studies verify our theoretical results, examine the vital design of our TD algorithm and show practical utility across various datasets, encompassing tasks such as regression and image classification with deep learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by JAIR.

Current approaches, such as factorized attention and fixed sparse patterns, fail to fully exploit the inherent spatio-temporal redundancies in video data. Through systematic analysis of video diffusion transformers (DiT), we uncover a key insight: Attention matrices exhibit structured, yet heterogeneous sparsity patterns, where specialized heads dynamically attend to distinct spatiotemporal regions (e.g., local pattern, cross-shaped pattern, or global pattern). Existing sparse attention methods either impose rigid constraints or introduce significant overhead, limiting their effectiveness. To address this, we propose Compact Attention, a hardware-aware acceleration framework featuring three innovations: 1) Adaptive tiling strategies that approximate diverse spatial interaction patterns via dynamic tile grouping, 2) Temporally varying windows that adjust sparsity levels based on frame proximity, and 3) An automated configuration search algorithm that optimizes sparse patterns while preserving critical attention pathways. Our method achieves 1.6~2.5x acceleration in attention computation on single-GPU setups while maintaining comparable visual quality with full-attention baselines. This work provides a principled approach to unlocking efficient long-form video generation through structured sparsity exploitation.

A streaming conformal layer turns this score into a budgeted accept/abstain rule, yielding calibrated behavior without online labels or extra forward passes. On microcontrollers, TCUQ fits comfortably on kilobyte scale devices and reduces footprint and latency versus early exit and deep ensembles (typically about 50 to 60% smaller and about 30 to 45% faster), while methods of similar accuracy often run out of memory. Under corrupted in distribution streams, TCUQ improves accuracy drop detection by 3 to 7 AUPRC points and reaches up to 0.86 AUPRC at high severities; for failure detection it attains up to 0.92 AUROC. These results show that temporal consistency, coupled with streaming conformal calibration, provides a practical and resource efficient foundation for on device monitoring in TinyML.</p></details> |  |

PTMT integrates a tree-based framework with the temporal zone partitioning (TZP) strategy, which partitions temporal graphs by time and structure while preserving lossless motif transitions and enabling massive parallelism. PTMT comprises three phases: growth zone parallel expansion, overlap-aware result aggregation, and deterministic encoding of motif transitions, ensuring accurate tracking of dynamic transitions and interactions.

While recent advances in multimodal learning have improved alignment and fusion, current approaches remain limited by two prevalent but fundamentally flawed strategies: (1) task-agnostic sampling indiscriminately processes all frames, overwhelming key events with irrelevant content; and (2) heuristic retrieval captures superficial patterns but misses causal-temporal structures needed for complex reasoning. To address these challenges, we introduce LeAdQA, an innovative approach that bridges these gaps through synergizing causal-aware query refinement with fine-grained visual grounding. Our method first leverages LLMs to reformulate question-option pairs, resolving causal ambiguities and sharpening temporal focus. These refined queries subsequently direct a temporal grounding model to precisely retrieve the most salient segments, complemented by an adaptive fusion mechanism dynamically integrating the evidence to maximize relevance. The integrated visual-textual cues are then processed by an MLLM to generate accurate, contextually-grounded answers. Experiments on NExT-QA, IntentQA, and NExT-GQA demonstrate that our method's precise visual grounding substantially enhances the understanding of video-question relationships, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on complex reasoning tasks while maintaining computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |

In contrast to existing methods that utilize prior knowledge of EL model parameters and uncertainty bounds, this study proposes an approximation-free adaptive barrier function-based control policy to ensure local prescribed time convergence of tracking error under state and input constraints. The proposed approach uses smooth time-based generator functions embedded in the filtered tracking error, which is combined with a saturation function that limits control action and confines states within the prescribed limits by enforcing the time-varying bounds on the filtered tracking error. Importantly, corresponding feasibility conditions are derived pertaining to the minimum control authority, the maximum disturbance rejection capability of the control policy, and the viable set of initial conditions, illuminating the narrow operating domain of EL systems arising from the interplay of SIT constraints. Finally, the efficacy of the proposed approach is demonstrated using experimental and comparison studies.</p></details> |  |

However, their potential for spatial modeling in multivariate time-series forecasting remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce a brand new SNN architecture, which is among the first to seamlessly integrate graph structural learning with spike-based temporal processing for multivariate time-series forecasting. Specifically, we first embed time features and an adaptive matrix, eliminating the need for predefined graph structures. We then further learn sequence features through the Observation (OBS) Block. Building upon this, our Multi-Scale Spike Aggregation (MSSA) hierarchically aggregates neighborhood information through spiking SAGE layers, enabling multi-hop feature extraction while eliminating the need for floating-point operations. Finally, we propose a Dual-Path Spike Fusion (DSF) Block to integrate spatial graph features and temporal dynamics via a spike-gated mechanism, combining LSTM-processed sequences with spiking self-attention outputs, effectively improve the model accuracy of long sequence datasets. Experiments show that our model surpasses the state-of-the-art SNN-based iSpikformer on all datasets and outperforms traditional temporal models at long horizons, thereby establishing a new paradigm for efficient spatial-temporal modeling.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Temporal and Rotational Calibration for Event-Centric Multi-Sensor Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12564v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event cameras generate asynchronous signals in response to pixel-level brightness changes, offering a sensing paradigm with theoretically microsecond-scale latency that can significantly enhance the performance of multi-sensor systems. Extrinsic calibration is a critical prerequisite for effective sensor fusion; however, the configuration that involves event cameras remains an understudied topic. In this paper, we propose a motion-based temporal and rotational calibration framework tailored for event-centric multi-sensor systems, eliminating the need for dedicated calibration targets. Our method uses as input the rotational motion estimates obtained from event cameras and other heterogeneous sensors, respectively. Different from conventional approaches that rely on event-to-frame conversion, our method efficiently estimates angular velocity from normal flow observations, which are derived from the spatio-temporal profile of event data. The overall calibration pipeline adopts a two-step approach: it first initializes the temporal offset and rotational extrinsics by exploiting kinematic correlations in the spirit of Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA), and then refines both temporal and rotational parameters through a joint non-linear optimization using a continuous-time parametrization in SO(3). Extensive evaluations on both publicly available and self-collected datasets validate that the proposed method achieves calibration accuracy comparable to target-based methods, while exhibiting superior stability over purely CCA-based methods, and highlighting its precision, robustness and flexibility. To facilitate future research, our implementation will be made open-source. Code: https://github.com/NAIL-HNU/EvMultiCalib.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Root Cause Analysis of Hydrogen Bond Separation in Spatio-Temporal Molecular Dynamics using Causal Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12500v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular dynamics simulations (MDS) face challenges, including resource-heavy computations and the need to manually scan outputs to detect "interesting events," such as the formation and persistence of hydrogen bonds between atoms of different molecules. A critical research gap lies in identifying the underlying causes of hydrogen bond formation and separation -understanding which interactions or prior events contribute to their emergence over time. With this challenge in mind, we propose leveraging spatio-temporal data analytics and machine learning models to enhance the detection of these phenomena. In this paper, our approach is inspired by causal modeling and aims to identify the root cause variables of hydrogen bond formation and separation events. Specifically, we treat the separation of hydrogen bonds as an "intervention" occurring and represent the causal structure of the bonding and separation events in the MDS as graphical causal models. These causal models are built using a variational autoencoder-inspired architecture that enables us to infer causal relationships across samples with diverse underlying causal graphs while leveraging shared dynamic information. We further include a step to infer the root causes of changes in the joint distribution of the causal models. By constructing causal models that capture shifts in the conditional distributions of molecular interactions during bond formation or separation, this framework provides a novel perspective on root cause analysis in molecular dynamic systems. We validate the efficacy of our model empirically on the atomic trajectories that used MDS for chiral separation, demonstrating that we can predict many steps in the future and also find the variables driving the observed changes in the system.</p></details> | Submitted to ACM |

However, existing MLLMs in this domain primarily focus on coarse-grained image-level or video-level comprehension and often struggle to handle fine-grained visual details or localized scene components, limiting their applicability in complex accident scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose SafePLUG, a novel framework that empowers MLLMs with both Pixel-Level Understanding and temporal Grounding for comprehensive traffic accident analysis. SafePLUG supports both arbitrary-shaped visual prompts for region-aware question answering and pixel-level segmentation based on language instructions, while also enabling the recognition of temporally anchored events in traffic accident scenarios. To advance the development of MLLMs for traffic accident understanding, we curate a new dataset containing multimodal question-answer pairs centered on diverse accident scenarios, with detailed pixel-level annotations and temporal event boundaries. Experimental results show that SafePLUG achieves strong performance on multiple tasks, including region-based question answering, pixel-level segmentation, temporal event localization, and accident event understanding. These capabilities lay a foundation for fine-grained understanding of complex traffic scenes, with the potential to improve driving safety and enhance situational awareness in smart transportation systems.

| **[EgoLoc: A Generalizable Solution for Temporal Interaction Localization in Egocentric Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12349v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Analyzing hand-object interaction in egocentric vision facilitates VR/AR applications and human-robot policy transfer. Existing research has mostly focused on modeling the behavior paradigm of interactive actions (i.e., ``how to interact''). However, the more challenging and fine-grained problem of capturing the critical moments of contact and separation between the hand and the target object (i.e., ``when to interact'') is still underexplored, which is crucial for immersive interactive experiences in mixed reality and robotic motion planning. Therefore, we formulate this problem as temporal interaction localization (TIL). Some recent works extract semantic masks as TIL references, but suffer from inaccurate object grounding and cluttered scenarios. Although current temporal action localization (TAL) methods perform well in detecting verb-noun action segments, they rely on category annotations during training and exhibit limited precision in localizing hand-object contact/separation moments. To address these issues, we propose a novel zero-shot approach dubbed EgoLoc to localize hand-object contact and separation timestamps in egocentric videos. EgoLoc introduces hand-dynamics-guided sampling to generate high-quality visual prompts. It exploits the vision-language model to identify contact/separation attributes, localize specific timestamps, and provide closed-loop feedback for further refinement. EgoLoc eliminates the need for object masks and verb-noun taxonomies, leading to generalizable zero-shot implementation. Comprehensive experiments on the public dataset and our novel benchmarks demonstrate that EgoLoc achieves plausible TIL for egocentric videos. It is also validated to effectively facilitate multiple downstream applications in egocentric vision and robotic manipulation tasks. Code and relevant data will be released at https://github.com/IRMVLab/EgoLoc.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended journal version of arXiv:2506.03662</p></details> |

This paper introduces the Trajectory-to-Action Pipeline (TAP), a scalable and automated method for extracting SDL labels from large trajectory datasets. TAP applies a rules-based cross-entropy optimization approach to learn parameters directly from data, enhancing generalization across diverse driving contexts. Using the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD), TAP achieves 30% greater precision than Average Displacement Error (ADE) and 24% over Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) in identifying behaviorally similar trajectories. Additionally, TAP enables automated detection of unique driving behaviors, streamlining safety evaluation processes for AV testing. This work provides a foundation for scalable scenario-based AV behavior analysis, with potential extensions for integrating multi-agent contexts.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |

Medical doctors guide these conversations through targeted questioning to efficiently gather the information required to provide the best possible outcomes for patients. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that studies physician intent trajectories in doctor-patient dialogues. We use the `Ambient Clinical Intelligence Benchmark' (Aci-bench) dataset for our study. We collaborate with medical professionals to develop a fine-grained taxonomy of physician intents based on the SOAP framework (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan). We then conduct a large-scale annotation effort to label over 5000 doctor-patient turns with the help of a large number of medical experts recruited using Prolific, a popular crowd-sourcing platform. This large labeled dataset is an important resource contribution that we use for benchmarking the state-of-the-art generative and encoder models for medical intent classification tasks. Our findings show that our models understand the general structure of medical dialogues with high accuracy, but often fail to identify transitions between SOAP categories. We also report for the first time common trajectories in medical dialogue structures that provide valuable insights for designing `differential diagnosis' systems. Finally, we extensively study the impact of intent filtering for medical dialogue summarization and observe a significant boost in performance. We make the codes and data, including annotation guidelines, publicly available at https://github.com/DATEXIS/medical-intent-classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ECAI 2025</p></details> |

By segmenting pedestrian trajectories into fixed time bins and applying a Transformer-based pair classification model, we identify cohesive groups and isolate single pedestrians over a structured sequence-based filtering process. To prepare for deeper analysis, we establish a comprehensive metric framework incorporating both spatial and behavioral dimensions. Spatial utilization metrics include convex hull area, smallest enclosing circle radius, and heatmap-based spatial densities to characterize how different pedestrian types occupy and interact with space. Behavioral metrics such as velocity change, motion angle deviation, clearance radius, and trajectory straightness are designed to capture local adaptations and responses during interactions. Furthermore, we introduce a typology of encounter types-single-to-single, single-to-group, and group-to-group to categorize and later quantify different interaction scenarios. Although this version focuses primarily on the classification pipeline and dataset structuring, it establishes the groundwork for scalable analysis across different sequence lengths 60, 100, and 200 frames. Future versions will incorporate complete quantitative analysis of the proposed metrics and their implications for pedestrian simulation and space design validation in crowd dynamics research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Optimization for UAV-Based Medical Delivery with Temporal Logic Constraints and Convex Feasible Set Collision Avoidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06038v2)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the problem of trajectory optimization for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) performing time-sensitive medical deliveries in urban environments. Specifically, we consider a single UAV with 3 degree-of-freedom dynamics tasked with delivering blood packages to multiple hospitals, each with a predefined time window and priority. Mission objectives are encoded using Signal Temporal Logic (STL), enabling the formal specification of spatial-temporal constraints. To ensure safety, city buildings are modeled as 3D convex obstacles, and obstacle avoidance is handled through a Convex Feasible Set (CFS) method. The entire planning problem-combining UAV dynamics, STL satisfaction, and collision avoidance-is formulated as a convex optimization problem that ensures tractability and can be solved efficiently using standard convex programming techniques. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method generates dynamically feasible, collision-free trajectories that satisfy temporal mission goals, providing a scalable and reliable approach for autonomous UAV-based medical logistics.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Dynamic Trajectory Optimization and Power Control for Hierarchical UAV Swarms in 6G Aerial Access Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18702v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can serve as aerial base stations (BSs) to extend the ubiquitous connectivity for ground users (GUs) in the sixth-generation (6G) era. However, it is challenging to cooperatively deploy multiple UAV swarms in large-scale remote areas. Hence, in this paper, we propose a hierarchical UAV swarms structure for 6G aerial access networks, where the head UAVs serve as aerial BSs, and tail UAVs (T-UAVs) are responsible for relay. In detail, we jointly optimize the dynamic deployment and trajectory of UAV swarms, which is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem (MOP) to concurrently minimize the energy consumption of UAV swarms and GUs, as well as the delay of GUs. However, the proposed MOP is a mixed integer nonlinear programming and NP-hard to solve. Therefore, we develop a K-means and Voronoi diagram based area division method, and construct Fermat points to establish connections between GUs and T-UAVs. Then, an improved non-dominated sorting whale optimization algorithm is proposed to seek Pareto optimal solutions for the transformed MOP. Finally, extensive simulations are conducted to verify the performance of proposed algorithms by comparing with baseline mechanisms, resulting in a 50% complexity reduction.</p></details> |  |

Our framework features a unified trajectory representation that encapsulates the kinematic models of both $SO(3)\times\mathbb{R}^3$ and $SE(3)$ pose representations. This encapsulation strategy allows users to use the same implementation of measurement-based factors for either choice of pose representation, which facilitates experimentation and comparison to achieve the best model for the ME task. In addition, unique to our framework, we derive the kinematic models with the closed-form temporal derivatives of the local variable of $SO(3)$ and $SE(3)$, which so far has only been approximated based on the Taylor expansion in the literature. Our experiments show that these kinematic models can improve the estimation accuracy in high-speed scenarios. All analytical Jacobians of the interpolated states with respect to the support states of the trajectory representation, as well as the motion prior factors, are also provided for accelerated Gauss-Newton (GN) optimization. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of the framework in various motion estimation tasks such as localization, calibration, and odometry, facilitating fast prototyping for ME researchers. We release the source code for the benefit of the community.

Recent diffusion-based policy learning approaches have achieved promising performance in modeling action distributions for bimanual manipulation. However, they ignored the physical safety constraints of bimanual manipulation, which leads to the dangerous behaviors with damage to robots and objects. To this end, we propose a test-time trajectory optimization framework named SafeBimanual for any pre-trained diffusion-based bimanual manipulation policies, which imposes the safety constraints on bimanual actions to avoid dangerous robot behaviors with improved success rate. Specifically, we design diverse cost functions for safety constraints in different dual-arm cooperation patterns including avoidance of tearing objects and collision between arms and objects, which optimizes the manipulator trajectories with guided sampling of diffusion denoising process. Moreover, we employ a vision-language model (VLM) to schedule the cost functions by specifying keypoints and corresponding pairwise relationship, so that the optimal safety constraint is dynamically generated in the entire bimanual manipulation process. SafeBimanual demonstrates superiority on 8 simulated tasks in RoboTwin with a 13.7% increase in success rate and a 18.8% reduction in unsafe interactions over state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods. Extensive experiments on 4 real-world tasks further verify its practical value by improving the success rate by 32.5%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website is at: https://denghaoyuan123.github.io/SafeBimanip/</p></details> |
| **[Adaptive Output Steps: FlexiSteps Network for Dynamic Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17797v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate trajectory prediction is vital for autonomous driving, robotics, and intelligent decision-making systems, yet traditional models typically rely on fixed-length output predictions, limiting their adaptability to dynamic real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce the FlexiSteps Network (FSN), a novel framework that dynamically adjusts prediction output time steps based on varying contextual conditions. Inspired by recent advancements addressing observation length discrepancies and dynamic feature extraction, FSN incorporates an pre-trained Adaptive Prediction Module (APM) to evaluate and adjust the output steps dynamically, ensuring optimal prediction accuracy and efficiency. To guarantee the plug-and-play of our FSN, we also design a Dynamic Decoder(DD). Additionally, to balance the prediction time steps and prediction accuracy, we design a scoring mechanism, which not only introduces the Fr\'echet distance to evaluate the geometric similarity between the predicted trajectories and the ground truth trajectories but the length of predicted steps is also considered. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets including Argoverse and INTERACTION demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of our proposed FSN framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[OmniCache: A Trajectory-Oriented Global Perspective on Training-Free Cache Reuse for Diffusion Transformer Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16212v2)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for generative tasks such as image synthesis and video generation, with Transformer architectures further enhancing performance. However, the high computational cost of diffusion Transformers-stemming from a large number of sampling steps and complex per-step computations-presents significant challenges for real-time deployment. In this paper, we introduce OmniCache, a training-free acceleration method that exploits the global redundancy inherent in the denoising process. Unlike existing methods that determine caching strategies based on inter-step similarities and tend to prioritize reusing later sampling steps, our approach originates from the sampling perspective of DIT models. We systematically analyze the model's sampling trajectories and strategically distribute cache reuse across the entire sampling process. This global perspective enables more effective utilization of cached computations throughout the diffusion trajectory, rather than concentrating reuse within limited segments of the sampling procedure. In addition, during cache reuse, we dynamically estimate the corresponding noise and filter it out to reduce its impact on the sampling direction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach accelerates the sampling process while maintaining competitive generative quality, offering a promising and practical solution for efficient deployment of diffusion-based generative models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[Preference Trajectory Modeling via Flow Matching for Sequential Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17618v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential recommendation predicts each user's next item based on their historical interaction sequence. Recently, diffusion models have attracted significant attention in this area due to their strong ability to model user interest distributions. They typically generate target items by denoising Gaussian noise conditioned on historical interactions. However, these models face two critical limitations. First, they exhibit high sensitivity to the condition, making it difficult to recover target items from pure Gaussian noise. Second, the inference process is computationally expensive, limiting practical deployment. To address these issues, we propose FlowRec, a simple yet effective sequential recommendation framework which leverages flow matching to explicitly model user preference trajectories from current states to future interests. Flow matching is an emerging generative paradigm, which offers greater flexibility in initial distributions and enables more efficient sampling. Based on this, we construct a personalized behavior-based prior distribution to replace Gaussian noise and learn a vector field to model user preference trajectories. To better align flow matching with the recommendation objective, we further design a single-step alignment loss incorporating both positive and negative samples, improving sampling efficiency and generation quality. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets verify the superiority of FlowRec over the state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[SE-Agent: Self-Evolution Trajectory Optimization in Multi-Step Reasoning with LLM-Based Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02085v5)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have recently shown impressive capabilities in complex reasoning and tool use via multi-step interactions with their environments. While these agents have the potential to tackle complicated tasks, their problem-solving process, i.e., agents' interaction trajectory leading to task completion, remains underexploited. These trajectories contain rich feedback that can navigate agents toward the right directions for solving problems correctly. Although prevailing approaches, such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), can effectively balance exploration and exploitation, they ignore the interdependence among various trajectories and lack the diversity of search spaces, which leads to redundant reasoning and suboptimal outcomes. To address these challenges, we propose SE-Agent, a Self-Evolution framework that enables Agents to optimize their reasoning processes iteratively. Our approach revisits and enhances former pilot trajectories through three key operations: revision, recombination, and refinement. This evolutionary mechanism enables two critical advantages: (1) it expands the search space beyond local optima by intelligently exploring diverse solution paths guided by previous trajectories, and (2) it leverages cross-trajectory inspiration to efficiently enhance performance while mitigating the impact of suboptimal reasoning paths. Through these mechanisms, SE-Agent achieves continuous self-evolution that incrementally improves reasoning quality. We evaluate SE-Agent on SWE-bench Verified to resolve real-world GitHub issues. Experimental results across five strong LLMs show that integrating SE-Agent delivers up to 55% relative improvement, achieving state-of-the-art performance among all open-source agents on SWE-bench Verified. Our code and demonstration materials are publicly available at https://github.com/JARVIS-Xs/SE-Agent.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional heuristics for branching often fail to generalize across heterogeneous problem instances, while existing learning-based methods such as imitation learning (IL) suffers from dependence on expert demonstration quality, and reinforcement learning (RL) struggles with limitations in sparse rewards and dynamic state representation challenges. To address these issues, we propose ReviBranch, a novel deep RL framework that constructs revived trajectories by reviving explicit historical correspondences between branching decisions and their corresponding graph states along search-tree paths. During training, ReviBranch enables agents to learn from complete structural evolution and temporal dependencies within the branching process. Additionally, we introduce an importance-weighted reward redistribution mechanism that transforms sparse terminal rewards into dense stepwise feedback, addressing the sparse reward challenge. Extensive experiments on different MILP benchmarks demonstrate that ReviBranch outperforms state-of-the-art RL methods, reducing B&B nodes by 4.0% and LP iterations by 2.2% on large-scale instances. The results highlight the robustness and generalizability of ReviBranch across heterogeneous MILP problem classes.</p></details> | conference |

OVITA leverages multiple pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to integrate user commands into trajectories generated by motion planners or those learned through demonstrations. OVITA employs code as an adaptation policy generated by an LLM, enabling users to adjust individual waypoints, thus providing flexible control. Another LLM, which acts as a code explainer, removes the need for expert users, enabling intuitive interactions. The efficacy and significance of the proposed OVITA framework is demonstrated through extensive simulations and real-world environments with diverse tasks involving spatiotemporal variations on heterogeneous robotic platforms such as a KUKA IIWA robot manipulator, Clearpath Jackal ground robot, and CrazyFlie drone.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Robotics and Automation Letters 2025.

Recent methods leverage generative priors as pseudo ground truth, but often lead to poor geometric consistency and over-smoothed renderings. To address these limitations, we propose ExtraGS, a holistic framework for trajectory extrapolation that integrates both geometric and generative priors. At the core of ExtraGS is a novel Road Surface Gaussian(RSG) representation based on a hybrid Gaussian-Signed Distance Function (SDF) design, and Far Field Gaussians (FFG) that use learnable scaling factors to efficiently handle distant objects. Furthermore, we develop a self-supervised uncertainty estimation framework based on spherical harmonics that enables selective integration of generative priors only where extrapolation artifacts occur. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets, diverse multi-camera setups, and various generative priors demonstrate that ExtraGS significantly enhances the realism and geometric consistency of extrapolated views, while preserving high fidelity along the original trajectory.</p></details> |  |

However, significant challenges arise when implementing path velocity decomposition (PVD) trajectory planning for automated parking. The primary challenge is ensuring rapid and precise collision-free trajectory planning, which is often in conflict. The secondary challenge involves maintaining sufficient control feasibility of the planned trajectory, particularly at gear shifting points (GSP). This paper proposes a PVD-based rapid iterative trajectory planning (RITP) method to solve the above challenges. The proposed method effectively balances the necessity for time efficiency and precise collision avoidance through a novel collision avoidance framework. Moreover, it enhances the overall control feasibility of the planned trajectory by incorporating the vehicle kinematics model and including terminal smoothing constraints (TSC) at GSP during path planning. Specifically, the proposed method leverages differential flatness to ensure the planned path adheres to the vehicle kinematic model. Additionally, it utilizes TSC to maintain curvature continuity at GSP, thereby enhancing the control feasibility of the overall trajectory. The simulation results demonstrate superior time efficiency and tracking errors compared to model-integrated and other iteration-based trajectory planning methods. In the real-world experiment, the proposed method was implemented and validated on a ROS-based vehicle, demonstrating the applicability of the RITP method for real vehicles.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the journal Robotics and Autonomous Systems</p></details> |

The framework is built upon Large Language Models (LLMs), incorporating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) empowered by Agentic AI and integrated with a UAV-specific knowledge base. Through the Agentic RAG, the LLM autonomously interprets high-level task requirements and identifies the key components necessary for trajectory optimization, including model inputs and outputs, network architecture, reward functions, and task constraints. To support efficient modeling across different system scales, we introduce the Mamba-Attention Integrated Transformer (MAIT), a hybrid neural architecture that combines the long-range dependency modeling capability of attention mechanisms with the efficient temporal dynamic representation of Mamba. Furthermore, a Trajectory-Group Relative Policy Optimization (T-GRPO) method is proposed to achieve unified policy gradient optimization in both discrete and continuous trajectory spaces for MAIT training. Extensive experimental results validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed ARMAIT framework.</p></details> |  |

While general-purpose deep research agents have shown impressive capabilities, they struggle significantly with medical domain challenges, as evidenced by leading proprietary systems achieving limited accuracy on complex medical benchmarks. The key limitations are: (1) the model lacks sufficient dense medical knowledge for clinical reasoning, and (2) the framework is constrained by the absence of specialized retrieval tools tailored for medical contexts. We present a medical deep research agent that addresses these challenges through two core innovations. First, we develop a novel data synthesis framework using medical knowledge graphs, extracting the longest chains from subgraphs around rare medical entities to generate complex multi-hop question-answer pairs. Second, we integrate a custom-built private medical retrieval engine alongside general-purpose tools, enabling accurate medical information synthesis. Our approach generates 2100+ diverse trajectories across 12 medical specialties, each averaging 4.2 tool interactions. Through a two-stage training paradigm combining supervised fine-tuning and online reinforcement learning with composite rewards, our MedResearcher-R1-32B model demonstrates exceptional performance, establishing new state-of-the-art results on medical benchmarks while maintaining competitive performance on general deep research tasks. Our work demonstrates that strategic domain-specific innovations in architecture, tool design, and training data construction can enable smaller open-source models to outperform much larger proprietary systems in specialized domains.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 figures |

Take-off and merging phases are critical for air corridor operations, requiring the coordination of take-off aircraft and corridor traffic while ensuring safety and seamless transition. This paper proposes an integrated take-off management and trajectory optimization for merging control in UAM corridors. We first introduce a novel take-off airspace design. To our knowledge, this paper is one of the first to propose a structured design for take-off airspace. Based on the take-off airspace design, we devise a hierarchical coordinated take-off and merging management (HCTMM) strategy. To be specific, the take-off airspace design can simplify aircraft dynamics and thus reduce the dimensionality of the trajectory optimization problem whilst mitigating obstacle avoidance complexities. The HCTMM strategy strictly ensures safety and improves the efficiency of take-off and merging operations. At the tactical level, a scheduling algorithm coordinates aircraft take-off times and selects dynamic merging points to reduce conflicts and ensure smooth take-off and merging processes. At the operational level, a trajectory optimization strategy ensures that each aircraft reaches the dynamic merging point efficiently while satisfying safety constraints. Simulation results show that, compared to representative strategies with fixed or dynamic merging points, the HCTMM strategy significantly improves operational efficiency and reduces computational burden, while ensuring safety under various corridor traffic conditions. Further results confirm the scalability of the HCTMM strategy and the computational efficiency enabled by the proposed take-off airspace design.</p></details> | 31 pages |

Most models predict chronological age, an imperfect surrogate for biological aging, or generate synthetic MRIs that enhance data diversity but fail to capture subject-specific trajectories. Here, we present BrainPath, a 3D generative framework that learns longitudinal brain aging dynamics during training and, at inference, predicts anatomically faithful MRIs at arbitrary timepoints from a single baseline scan. BrainPath integrates an age calibration loss, a swap learning strategy, and an age perceptual loss to preserve subtle, biologically meaningful variations. Across held-out ADNI and an independent NACC dataset, BrainPath outperforms state-of-the-art reference models in structural similarity (SSIM), mean squared error (MSE), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and MRI age-difference accuracy, while capturing realistic and temporally consistent aging patterns.

This paper proposes a trajectory tracking controller based on Active Disturbance Rejection Control (ADRC) implemented on the DUS V2500. A custom simulation incorporating realistic waves and current disturbances is developed to validate the controller's performance, supported by further validation through field tests in the harbour of Scheveningen, the Netherlands, and at sea. Simulation results demonstrate that ADRC significantly reduces cross-track error across all tested conditions compared to a baseline PID controller but increases control effort and energy consumption. Field trials confirm these findings while revealing a further increase in energy consumption during sea trials compared to the baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at IROS 2025.

| **[TRUST-Planner: Topology-guided Robust Trajectory Planner for AAVs with Uncertain Obstacle Spatial-temporal Avoidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14610v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite extensive developments in motion planning of autonomous aerial vehicles (AAVs), existing frameworks faces the challenges of local minima and deadlock in complex dynamic environments, leading to increased collision risks. To address these challenges, we present TRUST-Planner, a topology-guided hierarchical planning framework for robust spatial-temporal obstacle avoidance. In the frontend, a dynamic enhanced visible probabilistic roadmap (DEV-PRM) is proposed to rapidly explore topological paths for global guidance. The backend utilizes a uniform terminal-free minimum control polynomial (UTF-MINCO) and dynamic distance field (DDF) to enable efficient predictive obstacle avoidance and fast parallel computation. Furthermore, an incremental multi-branch trajectory management framework is introduced to enable spatio-temporal topological decision-making, while efficiently leveraging historical information to reduce replanning time. Simulation results show that TRUST-Planner outperforms baseline competitors, achieving a 96\% success rate and millisecond-level computation efficiency in tested complex environments. Real-world experiments further validate the feasibility and practicality of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |

Even though most traffic accident fatalities account to bicycles, they have received little attention, as previous work focused mainly on pedestrians and motorized vehicles. In this work, we present the Great GATsBi, a domain-knowledge-based, hybrid, multimodal trajectory prediction framework for bicycles. The model incorporates both physics-based modeling (inspired by motorized vehicles) and social-based modeling (inspired by pedestrian movements) to explicitly account for the dual nature of bicycle movement. The social interactions are modeled with a graph attention network, and include decayed historical, but also anticipated, future trajectory data of a bicycles neighborhood, following recent insights from psychological and social studies. The results indicate that the proposed ensemble of physics models -- performing well in the short-term predictions -- and social models -- performing well in the long-term predictions -- exceeds state-of-the-art performance. We also conducted a controlled mass-cycling experiment to demonstrate the framework's performance when forecasting bicycle trajectories and modeling social interactions with road users.</p></details> |  |
| **[FlightPatchNet: Multi-Scale Patch Network with Differential Coding for Flight Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16200v3)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate multi-step flight trajectory prediction plays an important role in Air Traffic Control, which can ensure the safety of air transportation. Two main issues limit the flight trajectory prediction performance of existing works. The first issue is the negative impact on prediction accuracy caused by the significant differences in data range. The second issue is that real-world flight trajectories involve underlying temporal dependencies, and most existing methods fail to reveal the hidden complex temporal variations and extract features from one single time scale. To address the above issues, we propose FlightPatchNet, a multi-scale patch network with differential coding for flight trajectory prediction. Specifically, FlightPatchNet first utilizes differential coding to encode the original values of longitude and latitude into first-order differences and generates embeddings for all variables at each time step. Then, global temporal attention is introduced to explore the dependencies between different time steps. To fully explore the diverse temporal patterns in flight trajectories, a multi-scale patch network is delicately designed to serve as the backbone. The multi-scale patch network exploits stacked patch mixer blocks to capture inter- and intra-patch dependencies under different time scales, and further integrates multi-scale temporal features across different scales and variables. Finally, FlightPatchNet ensembles multiple predictors to make direct multi-step prediction. Extensive experiments on ADS-B datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms the competitive baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by UAI 2025.

The objective is to assess model performance in diverse traffic complexities and compare the reliability of the approaches. While previous VTP models overlook the specific traffic situation complexity and lack reliability assessments, this research uses a probability of detection analysis to quantify model reliability in varying traffic scenarios, thus going beyond common error distribution analyses. All models are evaluated on test samples categorized according to their traffic situation during the prediction horizon, with performance metrics and reliability estimates obtained for each category. The results of this comprehensive evaluation provide a deeper understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the different prediction approaches, along with their reliability in terms of the prediction horizon lengths for which safe forecasts can be guaranteed. These findings can inform the development of more reliable vessel trajectory prediction approaches, enhancing safety and efficiency in future inland waterways navigation.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)</p></details> |
| **[Trajectory Tracking and Stabilization of Quadrotors Using Deep Koopman Model Predictive Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13795v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a data-driven control framework for quadrotor systems that integrates a deep Koopman operator with model predictive control (DK-MPC). The deep Koopman operator is trained on sampled flight data to construct a high-dimensional latent representation in which the nonlinear quadrotor dynamics are approximated by linear models. This linearization enables the application of MPC to efficiently optimize control actions over a finite prediction horizon, ensuring accurate trajectory tracking and stabilization. The proposed DK-MPC approach is validated through a series of trajectory-following and point-stabilization numerical experiments, where it demonstrates superior tracking accuracy and significantly lower computation time compared to conventional nonlinear MPC. These results highlight the potential of Koopman-based learning methods to handle complex quadrotor dynamics while meeting the real-time requirements of embedded flight control. Future work will focus on extending the framework to more agile flight scenarios and improving robustness against external disturbances.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hybrid Machine Learning Model with a Constrained Action Space for Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03666v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is crucial to advance autonomous driving, improving safety, and efficiency. Although end-to-end models based on deep learning have great potential, they often do not consider vehicle dynamic limitations, leading to unrealistic predictions. To address this problem, this work introduces a novel hybrid model that combines deep learning with a kinematic motion model. It is able to predict object attributes such as acceleration and yaw rate and generate trajectories based on them. A key contribution is the incorporation of expert knowledge into the learning objective of the deep learning model. This results in the constraint of the available action space, thus enabling the prediction of physically feasible object attributes and trajectories, thereby increasing safety and robustness. The proposed hybrid model facilitates enhanced interpretability, thereby reinforcing the trustworthiness of deep learning methods and promoting the development of safe planning solutions. Experiments conducted on the publicly available real-world Argoverse dataset demonstrate realistic driving behaviour, with benchmark comparisons and ablation studies showing promising results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Copyr...</summary><p>Copyright 2025 IEEE.

| **[Rapid Urban Visibility Hotspots: Quantifying Building Vertex Visibility from Connected Vehicle Trajectories using Spatial Indexing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03365v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective placement of Out-of-Home advertising and street furniture requires accurate identification of locations offering maximum visual exposure to target audiences, particularly vehicular traffic. Traditional site selection methods often rely on static traffic counts or subjective assessments. This research introduces a data-driven methodology to objectively quantify location visibility by analyzing large-scale connected vehicle trajectory data (sourced from Compass IoT) within urban environments. We model the dynamic driver field-of-view using a forward-projected visibility area for each vehicle position derived from interpolated trajectories. By integrating this with building vertex locations extracted from OpenStreetMap, we quantify the cumulative visual exposure, or ``visibility count'', for thousands of potential points of interest near roadways. The analysis reveals that visibility is highly concentrated, identifying specific ``visual hotspots'' that receive disproportionately high exposure compared to average locations. The core technical contribution involves the construction of a BallTree spatial index over building vertices. This enables highly efficient (O(logN) complexity) radius queries to determine which vertices fall within the viewing circles of millions of trajectory points across numerous trips, significantly outperforming brute-force geometric checks. Analysis reveals two key findings: 1) Visibility is highly concentrated, identifying distinct 'visual hotspots' receiving disproportionately high exposure compared to average locations. 2) The aggregated visibility counts across vertices conform to a Log-Normal distribution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncertainty Tube Visualization of Particle Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13505v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting particle trajectories with neural networks (NNs) has substantially enhanced many scientific and engineering domains. However, effectively quantifying and visualizing the inherent uncertainty in predictions remains challenging. Without an understanding of the uncertainty, the reliability of NN models in applications where trustworthiness is paramount is significantly compromised. This paper introduces the uncertainty tube, a novel, computationally efficient visualization method designed to represent this uncertainty in NN-derived particle paths. Our key innovation is the design and implementation of a superelliptical tube that accurately captures and intuitively conveys nonsymmetric uncertainty. By integrating well-established uncertainty quantification techniques, such as Deep Ensembles, Monte Carlo Dropout (MC Dropout), and Stochastic Weight Averaging-Gaussian (SWAG), we demonstrate the practical utility of the uncertainty tube, showcasing its application on both synthetic and simulation datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[ROVER: Robust Loop Closure Verification with Trajectory Prior in Repetitive Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13488v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Loop closure detection is important for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), which associates current observations with historical keyframes, achieving drift correction and global relocalization. However, a falsely detected loop can be fatal, and this is especially difficult in repetitive environments where appearance-based features fail due to the high similarity. Therefore, verification of a loop closure is a critical step in avoiding false positive detections. Existing works in loop closure verification predominantly focus on learning invariant appearance features, neglecting the prior knowledge of the robot's spatial-temporal motion cue, i.e., trajectory. In this letter, we propose ROVER, a loop closure verification method that leverages the historical trajectory as a prior constraint to reject false loops in challenging repetitive environments. For each loop candidate, it is first used to estimate the robot trajectory with pose-graph optimization. This trajectory is then submitted to a scoring scheme that assesses its compliance with the trajectory without the loop, which we refer to as the trajectory prior, to determine if the loop candidate should be accepted. Benchmark comparisons and real-world experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Furthermore, we integrate ROVER into state-of-the-art SLAM systems to verify its robustness and efficiency. Our source code and self-collected dataset are available at https://github.com/jarvisyjw/ROVER.</p></details> | 8 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Adaptive Conformal Prediction Intervals Over Trajectory Ensembles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13362v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Future trajectories play an important role across domains such as autonomous driving, hurricane forecasting, and epidemic modeling, where practitioners commonly generate ensemble paths by sampling probabilistic models or leveraging multiple autoregressive predictors. While these trajectories reflect inherent uncertainty, they are typically uncalibrated. We propose a unified framework based on conformal prediction that transforms sampled trajectories into calibrated prediction intervals with theoretical coverage guarantees. By introducing a novel online update step and an optimization step that captures inter-step dependencies, our method can produce discontinuous prediction intervals around each trajectory, naturally capture temporal dependencies, and yield sharper, more adaptive uncertainty estimates.</p></details> |  |
| **[STRAP: Robot Sub-Trajectory Retrieval for Augmented Policy Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15182v2)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robot learning is witnessing a significant increase in the size, diversity, and complexity of pre-collected datasets, mirroring trends in domains such as natural language processing and computer vision. Many robot learning methods treat such datasets as multi-task expert data and learn a multi-task, generalist policy by training broadly across them. Notably, while these generalist policies can improve the average performance across many tasks, the performance of generalist policies on any one task is often suboptimal due to negative transfer between partitions of the data, compared to task-specific specialist policies. In this work, we argue for the paradigm of training policies during deployment given the scenarios they encounter: rather than deploying pre-trained policies to unseen problems in a zero-shot manner, we non-parametrically retrieve and train models directly on relevant data at test time. Furthermore, we show that many robotics tasks share considerable amounts of low-level behaviors and that retrieval at the "sub"-trajectory granularity enables significantly improved data utilization, generalization, and robustness in adapting policies to novel problems. In contrast, existing full-trajectory retrieval methods tend to underutilize the data and miss out on shared cross-task content. This work proposes STRAP, a technique for leveraging pre-trained vision foundation models and dynamic time warping to retrieve sub-sequences of trajectories from large training corpora in a robust fashion. STRAP outperforms both prior retrieval algorithms and multi-task learning methods in simulated and real experiments, showing the ability to scale to much larger offline datasets in the real world as well as the ability to learn robust control policies with just a handful of real-world demonstrations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website at https://weirdlabuw.github.io/strap/</p></details> |

We study generative modeling for planning with datasets repurposed from offline reinforcement learning. Specifically, we identify temporal consistency in the absence of step-wise rewards as one key technical challenge. We introduce the Latent Plan Transformer (LPT), a novel model that leverages a latent variable to connect a Transformer-based trajectory generator and the final return. LPT can be learned with maximum likelihood estimation on trajectory-return pairs. In learning, posterior sampling of the latent variable naturally integrates sub-trajectories to form a consistent abstraction despite the finite context. At test time, the latent variable is inferred from an expected return before policy execution, realizing the idea of planning as inference. Our experiments demonstrate that LPT can discover improved decisions from sub-optimal trajectories, achieving competitive performance across several benchmarks, including Gym-Mujoco, Franka Kitchen, Maze2D, and Connect Four. It exhibits capabilities in nuanced credit assignments, trajectory stitching, and adaptation to environmental contingencies. These results validate that latent variable inference can be a strong alternative to step-wise reward prompting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Autonomous Oil Spill Response Through Liquid Neural Trajectory Modeling and Coordinated Marine Robotics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12456v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Marine oil spills pose grave environmental and economic risks, threatening marine ecosystems, coastlines, and dependent industries. Predicting and managing oil spill trajectories is highly complex, due to the interplay of physical, chemical, and environmental factors such as wind, currents, and temperature, which makes timely and effective response challenging. Accurate real-time trajectory forecasting and coordinated mitigation are vital for minimizing the impact of these disasters. This study introduces an integrated framework combining a multi-agent swarm robotics system built on the MOOS-IvP platform with Liquid Time-Constant Neural Networks (LTCNs). The proposed system fuses adaptive machine learning with autonomous marine robotics, enabling real-time prediction, dynamic tracking, and rapid response to evolving oil spills. By leveraging LTCNs--well-suited for modeling complex, time-dependent processes--the framework achieves real-time, high-accuracy forecasts of spill movement. Swarm intelligence enables decentralized, scalable, and resilient decision-making among robot agents, enhancing collective monitoring and containment efforts. Our approach was validated using data from the Deepwater Horizon spill, where the LTC-RK4 model achieved 0.96 spatial accuracy, surpassing LSTM approaches by 23%. The integration of advanced neural modeling with autonomous, coordinated robotics demonstrates substantial improvements in prediction precision, flexibility, and operational scalability. Ultimately, this research advances the state-of-the-art for sustainable, autonomous oil spill management and environmental protection by enhancing both trajectory prediction and response coordination.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 40 figures.

| **[Belief-Conditioned One-Step Diffusion: Real-Time Trajectory Planning with Just-Enough Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12166v1)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robots equipped with rich sensor suites can localize reliably in partially-observable environments, but powering every sensor continuously is wasteful and often infeasible. Belief-space planners address this by propagating pose-belief covariance through analytic models and switching sensors heuristically--a brittle, runtime-expensive approach. Data-driven approaches--including diffusion models--learn multi-modal trajectories from demonstrations, but presuppose an accurate, always-on state estimate. We address the largely open problem: for a given task in a mapped environment, which \textit{minimal sensor subset} must be active at each location to maintain state uncertainty \textit{just low enough} to complete the task? Our key insight is that when a diffusion planner is explicitly conditioned on a pose-belief raster and a sensor mask, the spread of its denoising trajectories yields a calibrated, differentiable proxy for the expected localisation error. Building on this insight, we present Belief-Conditioned One-Step Diffusion (B-COD), the first planner that, in a 10 ms forward pass, returns a short-horizon trajectory, per-waypoint aleatoric variances, and a proxy for localisation error--eliminating external covariance rollouts. We show that this single proxy suffices for a soft-actor-critic to choose sensors online, optimising energy while bounding pose-covariance growth. We deploy B-COD in real-time marine trials on an unmanned surface vehicle and show that it reduces sensing energy consumption while matching the goal-reach performance of an always-on baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CoRL 2025 (Conference on Robot Learning)</p></details> |

This work proposes the Fast and Safe Data-Driven Planner to address this challenge. Sparse Gaussian predictions are introduced to improve both the computational efficiency and accuracy of opponent predictions. Furthermore, the proposed approach employs a bi-level quadratic programming framework to generate an overtaking trajectory leveraging the opponent predictions. The first level uses polynomial fitting to generate a rough trajectory, from which reference states and control inputs are derived for the second level. The second level formulates a model predictive control optimization problem in the Frenet frame, generating a trajectory that satisfies both kinematic feasibility and safety. Experimental results on the F1TENTH platform show that our method outperforms the State-of-the-Art, achieving an 8.93% higher overtaking success rate, allowing the maximum opponent speed, ensuring a smoother ego trajectory, and reducing 74.04% computational time compared to the Predictive Spliner method.

| **[On Delta-Homology Analogy: Memory as Structured Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04203v2)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the \emph{delta-homology analogy}, which formalizes memory as a set of sparse, topologically irreducible attractors. A \emph{Dirac delta-like memory trace} \( \delta_\gamma \) is identified with a nontrivial homology generator \( [\gamma] \in H_1(\mathcal{Z}) \) on a latent manifold of cognitive states. Such traces are sharply localized along reproducible topological cycles and are only activated when inference trajectories complete a full cycle. They encode minimal, path-dependent memory units that cannot be synthesized from local features alone. Based on the analogy, we propose a topological framework for memory and inference grounded in the structure of spike-timing dynamics and persistent homology. Starting from the observation that polychronous neural groups (PNGs) encode reproducible, time-locked spike sequences shaped by axonal delays and synaptic plasticity, we construct \emph{spatiotemporal complexes} whose temporally consistent transitions define chain complexes over which robust activation cycles emerge. These activation loops are abstracted into \emph{cell posets}, enabling a compact and causally ordered representation of neural activity with overlapping and compositional memory traces.</p></details> |  |
| **[Two-Impulse Trajectory Design in Two-Body Systems With Riemannian Geometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11612v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work presents a new method for generating impulsive trajectories in restricted two-body systems by leveraging Riemannian geometry. The proposed method transforms the standard trajectory optimization problem into a purely geometric one that involves computing a set of geodesics for a suitable Riemannian metric. This transformation is achieved by defining a metric, specifically the Jacobi metric, that embeds the dynamics directly into the metric, so any geodesic of the metric is also a dynamically feasible trajectory. The method finds the fuel-optimal transfer trajectory by sampling candidate energy ($\Delta V$) changes for different points on the current and desired orbit, and efficiently computing and evaluating each candidate geodesic, which are equivalent to candidate orbit transfer trajectories via the Jacobi metric. The method bypasses the known issues of optimization-based methods, e.g., sensitivity to the initial guess, and can be applied to more complex two-body systems. The approach is demonstrated on the minimum-$\Delta V$ two-impulse phase-free orbit transfer problem, first on a Keplerian system and second on a system with a modeled $J_2$ perturbation. The proposed method is shown to meet or exceed the state-of-the-art methods in the minimum-$\Delta V$ problem in the Keplerian system. The generality and versatility of the approach is demonstrated by seamlessly including the $J_2$ perturbation, a case that many existing methods cannot handle. Numerical simulations and performance comparisons showcase the effectiveness of the approach.</p></details> |  |

Despite the growing interest and efforts in this field, several issues remain unresolved, including (1) data unavailability, (2) lack of an effective trajectory-based framework, and (3) requirement for sufficient supervision labels. In this paper, we present TrajSV, a trajectory-based framework that addresses various issues in existing studies. TrajSV comprises three components: data preprocessing, Clip Representation Network (CRNet), and Video Representation Network (VRNet). The data preprocessing module extracts player and ball trajectories from sports broadcast videos. CRNet utilizes a trajectory-enhanced Transformer module to learn clip representations based on these trajectories. Additionally, VRNet learns video representations by aggregating clip representations and visual features with an encoder-decoder architecture. Finally, a triple contrastive loss is introduced to optimize both video and clip representations in an unsupervised manner. The experiments are conducted on three broadcast video datasets to verify the effectiveness of TrajSV for three types of sports (i.e., soccer, basketball, and volleyball) with three downstream applications (i.e., sports video retrieval, action spotting, and video captioning). The results demonstrate that TrajSV achieves state-of-the-art performance in sports video retrieval, showcasing a nearly 70% improvement. It outperforms baselines in action spotting, achieving state-of-the-art results in 9 out of 17 action categories, and demonstrates a nearly 20% improvement in video captioning. Additionally, we introduce a deployed system along with the three applications based on TrajSV.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by TCSVT</p></details> |

Existing methods encode map and agent positions and decode future trajectories in Cartesian coordinates. However, modeling the relationships between the ego vehicle and surrounding traffic elements in Cartesian space can be suboptimal, as it does not naturally capture the varying influence of different elements based on their relative distances and directions. To address this limitation, we adopt the Polar coordinate system, where positions are represented by radius and angle. This representation provides a more intuitive and effective way to model spatial changes and relative relationships, especially in terms of distance and directional influence. Based on this insight, we propose Polaris, a novel method that operates entirely in Polar coordinates, distinguishing itself from conventional Cartesian-based approaches. By leveraging the Polar representation, this method explicitly models distance and direction variations and captures relative relationships through dedicated encoding and refinement modules, enabling more structured and spatially aware trajectory prediction and planning. Extensive experiments on the challenging prediction (Argoverse 2) and planning benchmarks (nuPlan) demonstrate that Polaris achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[KDPE: A Kernel Density Estimation Strategy for Diffusion Policy Trajectory Selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10511v2)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning robot policies that capture multimodality in the training data has been a long-standing open challenge for behavior cloning. Recent approaches tackle the problem by modeling the conditional action distribution with generative models. One of these approaches is Diffusion Policy, which relies on a diffusion model to denoise random points into robot action trajectories. While achieving state-of-the-art performance, it has two main drawbacks that may lead the robot out of the data distribution during policy execution. First, the stochasticity of the denoising process can highly impact on the quality of generated trajectory of actions. Second, being a supervised learning approach, it can learn data outliers from the dataset used for training. Recent work focuses on mitigating these limitations by combining Diffusion Policy either with large-scale training or with classical behavior cloning algorithms. Instead, we propose KDPE, a Kernel Density Estimation-based strategy that filters out potentially harmful trajectories output of Diffusion Policy while keeping a low test-time computational overhead. For Kernel Density Estimation, we propose a manifold-aware kernel to model a probability density function for actions composed of end-effector Cartesian position, orientation, and gripper state. KDPE overall achieves better performance than Diffusion Policy on simulated single-arm tasks and real robot experiments.

This phenomena diminishes utility in production applications that repeatedly rely on common prompt templates or applications that frequently rely on LLMs for specific tasks (e.g. sentiment analysis, language translation). Through comprehensive evaluation, we demonstrate that LLMs still tend to refuse responses to harmful instructions when those instructions are reframed to appear as benign tasks. Our mechanistic analysis reveal that LLMs follow distinct "constellation" patterns in embedding space as representations traverse layers, with each task maintaining consistent trajectories that shift predictably between refusal and non-refusal cases. We introduce SafeConstellations, an inference-time trajectory-shifting approach that tracks task-specific trajectory patterns and guides representations toward non-refusal pathways. By selectively guiding model behavior only on tasks prone to over-refusal, and by preserving general model behavior, our method reduces over-refusal rates by up to 73% with minimal impact on utility-offering a principled approach to mitigating over-refusals.</p></details> | Preprint |

However, existing fault-tolerant control methods exhibit significant oscillations during docking and separation, impacting system stability. To address this issue, we propose a novel fault-tolerant control reallocation method that adapts to an arbitrary number of modular robots and their assembly formations. The algorithm redistributes the expected collective force and torque required for MARS to individual units according to their moment arm relative to the center of MARS mass. Furthermore, we propose an agile trajectory planning method for MARS of arbitrary configurations, which is collision-avoiding and dynamically feasible. Our work represents the first comprehensive approach to enable fault-tolerant and collision avoidance flight for MARS. We validate our method through extensive simulations, demonstrating improved fault tolerance, enhanced trajectory tracking accuracy, and greater robustness in cluttered environments.

Our improvements also include the implementation of a distance-bounded interactive voting strategy to reduce computational complexity, as well as modifications to address missing data in the road network. Furthermore, we incorporate a custom-built asset derived from OpenStreetMap, enabling this approach to be smoothly applied in any geographic region covered by OpenStreetMap's road network. These advancements preserve the core strengths of the original algorithm while significantly extending its applicability to diverse real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforcement Learning meets Masked Video Modeling : Trajectory-Guided Adaptive Token Selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08561v2)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masked video modeling~(MVM) has emerged as a highly effective pre-training strategy for visual foundation models, whereby the model reconstructs masked spatiotemporal tokens using information from visible tokens. However, a key challenge in such approaches lies in selecting an appropriate masking strategy. Previous studies have explored predefined masking techniques, including random and tube-based masking, as well as approaches that leverage key motion priors, optical flow and semantic cues from externally pre-trained models. In this work, we introduce a novel and generalizable Trajectory-Aware Adaptive Token Sampler (TATS), which models the motion dynamics of tokens and can be seamlessly integrated into the masked autoencoder (MAE) framework to select motion-centric tokens in videos. Additionally, we propose a unified training strategy that enables joint optimization of both MAE and TATS from scratch using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). We show that our model allows for aggressive masking without compromising performance on the downstream task of action recognition while also ensuring that the pre-training remains memory efficient. Extensive experiments of the proposed approach across four benchmarks, including Something-Something v2, Kinetics-400, UCF101, and HMDB51, demonstrate the effectiveness, transferability, generalization, and efficiency of our work compared to other state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ICCVW 2025 - Long Multi-Scene Video Foundations Workshop</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Methods for Accurate Sparse Trajectory Recovery and Map Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10460v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world trajectories are often sparse with low-sampling rates (i.e., long intervals between consecutive GPS points) and misaligned with road networks, yet many applications demand high-quality data for optimal performance. To improve data quality with sparse trajectories as input, we systematically study two related research problems: trajectory recovery on road network, which aims to infer missing points to recover high-sampling trajectories, and map matching, which aims to map GPS points to road segments to determine underlying routes. In this paper, we present efficient methods TRMMA and MMA for accurate trajectory recovery and map matching, respectively, where MMA serves as the first step of TRMMA. In MMA, we carefully formulate a classification task to map a GPS point from sparse trajectories to a road segment over a small candidate segment set, rather than the entire road network. We develop techniques in MMA to generate effective embeddings that capture the patterns of GPS data, directional information, and road segments, to accurately align sparse trajectories to routes. For trajectory recovery, TRMMA focuses on the segments in the route returned by MMA to infer missing points with position ratios on road segments, producing high-sampling trajectories efficiently by avoiding evaluation of all road segments. Specifically, in TRMMA, we design a dual-transformer encoding process to cohesively capture latent patterns in trajectories and routes, and an effective decoding technique to sequentially predict the position ratios and road segments of missing points. We conduct extensive experiments to compare TRMMA and MMA with numerous existing methods for trajectory recovery and map matching, respectively, on 4 large real-world datasets. TRMMA and MMA consistently achieve the best result quality, often by a significant margin.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, accepted by 2025 IEEE 41st International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE)</p></details> |
| **[Trajectory-aware Shifted State Space Models for Online Video Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10453v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online video super-resolution (VSR) is an important technique for many real-world video processing applications, which aims to restore the current high-resolution video frame based on temporally previous frames. Most of the existing online VSR methods solely employ one neighboring previous frame to achieve temporal alignment, which limits long-range temporal modeling of videos. Recently, state space models (SSMs) have been proposed with linear computational complexity and a global receptive field, which significantly improve computational efficiency and performance. In this context, this paper presents a novel online VSR method based on Trajectory-aware Shifted SSMs (TS-Mamba), leveraging both long-term trajectory modeling and low-complexity Mamba to achieve efficient spatio-temporal information aggregation. Specifically, TS-Mamba first constructs the trajectories within a video to select the most similar tokens from the previous frames. Then, a Trajectory-aware Shifted Mamba Aggregation (TSMA) module consisting of proposed shifted SSMs blocks is employed to aggregate the selected tokens. The shifted SSMs blocks are designed based on Hilbert scannings and corresponding shift operations to compensate for scanning losses and strengthen the spatial continuity of Mamba. Additionally, we propose a trajectory-aware loss function to supervise the trajectory generation, ensuring the accuracy of token selection when training our model. Extensive experiments on three widely used VSR test datasets demonstrate that compared with six online VSR benchmark models, our TS-Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance in most cases and over 22.7\% complexity reduction (in MACs). The source code for TS-Mamba will be available at https://github.com.</p></details> |  |

The many spatial and temporal constraints make finding an initial guess for a numerical solver difficult. Graphs of Convex Sets (GCS) and the recently developed Space-Time Graphs of Convex Sets formulation (ST-GCS) enable us to generate optimal minimum distance collision-free trajectories without providing an initial guess to the solver. We also explore the derivation of general GCS-compatible constraints and document an intuitive strategy for adapting general constraints to the framework. We show that ST-GCS produces equivalent trajectories to the standard GCS formulation when the environment is static. We then show ST-GCS operating in dynamic environments to find minimum distance collision-free trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages with references, 20 figures</p></details> |

However, uncertainties introduced by inherent driving behaviors -- such as acceleration, deceleration, and left and right maneuvers -- pose significant challenges for reliable trajectory prediction. We introduce a Maneuver-Intention-Aware Transformer (MIAT) architecture, which integrates a maneuver intention awareness control mechanism with spatiotemporal interaction modeling to enhance long-horizon trajectory predictions. We systematically investigate the impact of varying awareness of maneuver intention on both short- and long-horizon trajectory predictions. Evaluated on the real-world NGSIM dataset and benchmarked against various transformer- and LSTM-based methods, our approach achieves an improvement of up to 4.7% in short-horizon predictions and a 1.6% in long-horizon predictions compared to other intention-aware benchmark methods. Moreover, by leveraging intention awareness control mechanism, MIAT realizes an 11.1% performance boost in long-horizon predictions, with a modest drop in short-horizon performance.

Despite its significance, research in this domain remains relatively limited, with most existing studies concentrating on single-modal trajectory prediction of vehicles. In this work, we propose ParkDiffusion, a novel approach that predicts the trajectories of both vehicles and pedestrians in automated parking scenarios. ParkDiffusion employs diffusion models to capture the inherent uncertainty and multi-modality of future trajectories, incorporating several key innovations. First, we propose a dual map encoder that processes soft semantic cues and hard geometric constraints using a two-step cross-attention mechanism. Second, we introduce an adaptive agent type embedding module, which dynamically conditions the prediction process on the distinct characteristics of vehicles and pedestrians. Third, to ensure kinematic feasibility, our model outputs control signals that are subsequently used within a kinematic framework to generate physically feasible trajectories. We evaluate ParkDiffusion on the Dragon Lake Parking (DLP) dataset and the Intersections Drone (inD) dataset. Our work establishes a new baseline for heterogeneous trajectory prediction in parking scenarios, outperforming existing methods by a considerable margin.</p></details> | <details><summary>IROS ...</summary><p>IROS 2025 Camera-Ready Version</p></details> |

To provide a quantitative basis for understanding these behaviours, we investigate the global dynamics of such automata and we describe a method that allows us to compute the number of all configurations leading to short attractors in a limited number of time steps. This computation yields exact results in the thermodynamic limit (as the CA grid size grows to infinity), and is based on the Transfer Matrix Method (TMM) that we adapt for our purposes. Specifically, given two parameters $(p, c)$ we are able to compute the entropy of all initial configurations converging to an attractor of size $c$ after $p$ time-steps. By calculating such statistics for various ECA rules, we establish a quantitative connection between the entropy and the qualitative Wolfram classification scheme. Class 1 rules rapidly converge to maximal entropy for stationary states ($c=1$) as $p$ increases. Class 2 rules also approach maximal entropy quickly for appropriate cycle lengths $c$, potentially requiring consideration of translations. Class 3 rules exhibit zero or low finite entropy that saturates after a short transient. Class 4 rules show finite positive entropy, similar to some Class 3 rules. This method provides a precise framework for quantifying trajectory statistics, although its exponential computational cost in $p+c$ restricts practical analysis to short trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 8 figures, 1 table, accepted to ALife 2025</p></details> |
| **[MetaFold: Language-Guided Multi-Category Garment Folding Framework via Trajectory Generation and Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08372v2)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Garment folding is a common yet challenging task in robotic manipulation. The deformability of garments leads to a vast state space and complex dynamics, which complicates precise and fine-grained manipulation. Previous approaches often rely on predefined key points or demonstrations, limiting their generalization across diverse garment categories. This paper presents a framework, MetaFold, that disentangles task planning from action prediction, learning each independently to enhance model generalization. It employs language-guided point cloud trajectory generation for task planning and a low-level foundation model for action prediction. This structure facilitates multi-category learning, enabling the model to adapt flexibly to various user instructions and folding tasks. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework. Supplementary materials are available on our website: https://meta-fold.github.io/.</p></details> |  |
| **[GTPO: Trajectory-Based Policy Optimization in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03772v2)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Policy-based optimizations are widely adopted today for the training and alignment of language models, where one of the most recent and effective approaches is Group-relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). In this paper, we reveals and analyze two major limitations of GRPO: (i) tokens frequently appear in completions with both positive and negative rewards, leading to conflicting gradient updates that can reduce their output probability, even though can be essential for maintaining proper structure; (ii) negatively rewarded completions may penalize confident responses and shift model decisions toward unlikely tokens, progressively flattening the output distribution and degrading learning. To address these issues and provide a more stable and effective policy optimization strategy, we introduce GTPO (Group-relative Trajectory-based Policy Optimization), which identifies conflict tokens, tokens appearing in the same position across completions with opposite rewards, protects them by skipping negative updates, while amplifying positive ones. To further prevent policy collapse, GTPO filters out completions whose entropy exceeds a provable threshold. Unlike GRPO, GTPO does not rely on KL-divergence regularization, eliminating the need for a reference model during training, while still ensuring greater training stability and improved performance, validated through multiple experiments on GSM8K, MATH and AIME 2024 benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents ESCoT, an enhanced step-based coordinate trajectory planning method for multiple car-like robots. ESCoT incorporates two key strategies: collaborative planning for local robot groups and replanning for duplicate configurations. These strategies effectively enhance the performance of step-based MVTP methods. Through extensive experiments, we show that ESCoT 1) in sparse scenarios, significantly improves solution quality compared to baseline step-based method, achieving up to 70% improvement in typical conflict scenarios and 34% in randomly generated scenarios, while maintaining high solving efficiency; and 2) in dense scenarios, outperforms all baseline methods, maintains a success rate of over 50% even in the most challenging configurations. The results demonstrate that ESCoT effectively solves MVTP, further extending the capabilities of step-based methods. Finally, practical robot tests validate the algorithm's applicability in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, it has seen limited usage in spaceflight applications due to its heavy computational demands that exceed the capability of most flight computers. In this work, we provide results on the first flight demonstration of using machine learning-based warm starts for accelerating trajectory optimization for the Astrobee free-flying robot on-board the International Space Station (ISS). We formulate a data-driven optimal control approach that trains a neural network to learn the structure of the trajectory generation problem being solved for by sequential convex programming (SCP). On-board, this trained neural network predicts solutions for the trajectory generation problem and relies on using the SCP solver to enforce safety constraints for the system. Our trained network reduces the number of solver iterations required for convergence in cases including rotational dynamics by 60% and in cases with obstacles drawn from the training distribution of the warm start model by 50%. This work represents a significant milestone in the use of learning-based control for spaceflight applications and a stepping stone for future advances in the use of machine learning for autonomous guidance, navigation, & control.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to 2025 International Conference on Space Robotics (iSpaRo).

In developing regions where access to multimodal data is limited, relying solely on onboard GPS data remains indispensable despite inherent challenges. To address this problem, we propose GSMT, a hybrid model that integrates a Graph Attention Network (GAT) with a sequence-to-sequence Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and incorporates a task corrector capable of extracting complex behavioral patterns from large-scale trajectory data. The task corrector clusters historical trajectories to identify distinct motion patterns and fine-tunes the predictions generated by the GAT and RNN. Specifically, GSMT fuses dynamic bus information and static station information through embedded hybrid networks to perform trajectory prediction, and applies the task corrector for secondary refinement after the initial predictions are generated. This two-stage approach enables multi-node trajectory prediction among buses operating in dense urban traffic environments under complex conditions. Experiments conducted on a real-world dataset from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving superior performance in both short-term and long-term trajectory prediction tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by ITSC 2025</p></details> |

When performing such structural edits, these methods either fail to achieve the intended shape change or inadvertently alter non-target regions, resulting in degraded background quality. We propose Follow-Your-Shape, a training-free and mask-free framework that supports precise and controllable editing of object shapes while strictly preserving non-target content. Motivated by the divergence between inversion and editing trajectories, we compute a Trajectory Divergence Map (TDM) by comparing token-wise velocity differences between the inversion and denoising paths. The TDM enables precise localization of editable regions and guides a Scheduled KV Injection mechanism that ensures stable and faithful editing. To facilitate a rigorous evaluation, we introduce ReShapeBench, a new benchmark comprising 120 new images and enriched prompt pairs specifically curated for shape-aware editing. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior editability and visual fidelity, particularly in tasks requiring large-scale shape replacement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project webpage is available at https://follow-your-shape.github.io/</p></details> |

To address this limitation, we propose the Multidimensional Adaptive Coefficient (MAC), a plug-in module for flow and diffusion models that extends conventional unidimensional coefficients to multidimensional ones and enables inference trajectory-wise adaptation. MAC is trained via simulation-based feedback through adversarial refinement. Empirical results across diverse frameworks and datasets demonstrate that MAC enhances generative quality with high training efficiency. Consequently, our work offers a new perspective on inference trajectory optimality, encouraging future research to move beyond vector field design and to leverage training-efficient, simulation-based optimization.</p></details> | ICML 2025 Paper |
| **[Capsizing-Guided Trajectory Optimization for Autonomous Navigation with Rough Terrain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08108v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is a challenging task for ground robots to autonomously navigate in harsh environments due to the presence of non-trivial obstacles and uneven terrain. This requires trajectory planning that balances safety and efficiency. The primary challenge is to generate a feasible trajectory that prevents robot from tip-over while ensuring effective navigation. In this paper, we propose a capsizing-aware trajectory planner (CAP) to achieve trajectory planning on the uneven terrain. The tip-over stability of the robot on rough terrain is analyzed. Based on the tip-over stability, we define the traversable orientation, which indicates the safe range of robot orientations. This orientation is then incorporated into a capsizing-safety constraint for trajectory optimization. We employ a graph-based solver to compute a robust and feasible trajectory while adhering to the capsizing-safety constraint. Extensive simulation and real-world experiments validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method. The results demonstrate that CAP outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, providing enhanced navigation performance on uneven terrains.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches tend to address these tasks individually, making it difficult to holistically consider complex maritime situations. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework, AIS-LLM, which integrates time-series AIS data with a large language model (LLM). AIS-LLM consists of a Time-Series Encoder for processing AIS sequences, an LLM-based Prompt Encoder, a Cross-Modality Alignment Module for semantic alignment between time-series data and textual prompts, and an LLM-based Multi-Task Decoder. This architecture enables the simultaneous execution of three key tasks: trajectory prediction, anomaly detection, and risk assessment of vessel collisions within a single end-to-end system. Experimental results demonstrate that AIS-LLM outperforms existing methods across individual tasks, validating its effectiveness. Furthermore, by integratively analyzing task outputs to generate situation summaries and briefings, AIS-LLM presents the potential for more intelligent and efficient maritime traffic management.</p></details> |  |

This paper investigates the use of sequential deep learning models, including Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Transformers, for real-time flock detection in multi-pedestrian trajectories. Our proposed approach consists of a two-stage process: first, a pre-trained binary classification model is used for pairwise trajectory classification, and second, the learned representations are applied to identify multi-agent flocks dynamically. We validate our method using real-world group movement datasets, demonstrating its robustness across varying sequence lengths and diverse movement patterns. Experimental results indicate that our model consistently detects pedestrian flocks with high accuracy and stability, even in dynamic and noisy environments. Furthermore, we extend our approach to identify other forms of collective motion, such as convoys and swarms, paving the way for more comprehensive multi-agent behavior analysis.</p></details> |  |

Traditional path planner, such as Artificial Potential Field (APF), offer computational efficiency but suffer from local minima issue due to position-based potential field functions and oscillatory motion near the obstacles due to Newtonian mechanics. To address this limitation, an Energy-based Artificial Potential Field (APF) framework is proposed in this paper that integrates position and velocity-dependent potential functions. E-APF ensures dynamic adaptability and mitigates local minima, enabling uninterrupted progression toward the goal. The proposed framework integrates E-APF with a hybrid trajectory optimizer that jointly minimizes jerk and execution time under velocity and acceleration constraints, ensuring geometric smoothness and time efficiency. The entire framework is validated in simulation using the 7-degree-of-freedom Kinova Gen3 robotic manipulator. The results demonstrate collision-free, smooth, time-efficient, and oscillation-free trajectory in the presence of obstacles, highlighting the efficacy of the combined trajectory optimization and real-time obstacle avoidance approach. This work lays the foundation for future integration with reactive control strategies and physical hardware deployment in real-world manipulation tasks.</p></details> |  |

Although Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have demonstrated remarkable success in rendering static scenes, extending them to reconstruct dynamic scenes remains challenging. In this work, we introduce a novel approach that combines 3DGS with a motion trajectory field, enabling precise handling of complex object motions and achieving physically plausible motion trajectories. By decoupling dynamic objects from static background, our method compactly optimizes the motion trajectory field. The approach incorporates time-invariant motion coefficients and shared motion trajectory bases to capture intricate motion patterns while minimizing optimization complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results in both novel-view synthesis and motion trajectory recovery from monocular video, advancing the capabilities of dynamic scene reconstruction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Intention-Aware Diffusion Model for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07146v1)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting pedestrian motion trajectories is critical for the path planning and motion control of autonomous vehicles. Recent diffusion-based models have shown promising results in capturing the inherent stochasticity of pedestrian behavior for trajectory prediction. However, the absence of explicit semantic modelling of pedestrian intent in many diffusion-based methods may result in misinterpreted behaviors and reduced prediction accuracy. To address the above challenges, we propose a diffusion-based pedestrian trajectory prediction framework that incorporates both short-term and long-term motion intentions. Short-term intent is modelled using a residual polar representation, which decouples direction and magnitude to capture fine-grained local motion patterns. Long-term intent is estimated through a learnable, token-based endpoint predictor that generates multiple candidate goals with associated probabilities, enabling multimodal and context-aware intention modelling. Furthermore, we enhance the diffusion process by incorporating adaptive guidance and a residual noise predictor that dynamically refines denoising accuracy. The proposed framework is evaluated on the widely used ETH, UCY, and SDD benchmarks, demonstrating competitive results against state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

To interact effectively, robots must recognize the possible interaction modes and adapt to the one preferred by other agents. In this work, we propose MultiNash-PF, an efficient algorithm for capturing the multimodality in multi-agent interactions. We model interaction outcomes as equilibria of a game-theoretic planner, where each equilibrium corresponds to a distinct interaction mode. Our framework formulates interactive planning as Constrained Potential Trajectory Games (CPTGs), in which local Generalized Nash Equilibria (GNEs) represent plausible interaction outcomes. We propose to integrate the potential game approach with implicit particle filtering, a sample-efficient method for non-convex trajectory optimization. We utilize implicit particle filtering to identify the coarse estimates of multiple local minimizers of the game's potential function. MultiNash-PF then refines these estimates with optimization solvers, obtaining different local GNEs. We show through numerical simulations that MultiNash-PF reduces computation time by up to 50\% compared to a baseline. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in real-world human-robot interaction scenarios, where it successfully accounts for the multi-modal nature of interactions and resolves potential conflicts in real-time.</p></details> |  |

Traditional approaches treat detection and forecasting as separate sequential tasks, limiting their ability to leverage temporal cues. ForeSight addresses this limitation with a multi-task streaming and bidirectional learning approach, allowing detection and forecasting to share query memory and propagate information seamlessly. The forecast-aware detection transformer enhances spatial reasoning by integrating trajectory predictions from a multiple hypothesis forecast memory queue, while the streaming forecast transformer improves temporal consistency using past forecasts and refined detections. Unlike tracking-based methods, ForeSight eliminates the need for explicit object association, reducing error propagation with a tracking-free model that efficiently scales across multi-frame sequences. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset show that ForeSight achieves state-of-the-art performance, achieving an EPA of 54.9%, surpassing previous methods by 9.3%, while also attaining the best mAP and minADE among multi-view detection and forecasting models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025</p></details> |

This work evaluates the integration of a deep learning-based Social-Implicit (SI) pedestrian trajectory predictor within a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework on the physical Continental Corriere robot. Tested across varied pedestrian densities, the SI-MPC system is compared to a traditional Constant Velocity (CV) model in both open-loop prediction and closed-loop navigation. Results show that SI improves trajectory prediction - reducing errors by up to 76% in low-density settings - and enhances safety and motion smoothness in crowded scenes. Moreover, real-world deployment reveals discrepancies between open-loop metrics and closed-loop performance, as the SI model yields broader, more cautious predictions. These findings emphasize the importance of system-level evaluation and highlight the SI-MPC framework's promise for safer, more adaptive navigation in dynamic, human-populated environments.</p></details> |  |

However, most DL-based methods suffer from catastrophic forgetting, where adapting to a new distribution may cause significant performance degradation in previously learned ones. Such inability to retain learned knowledge limits their applicability in the real world, where AD systems need to operate across varying scenarios with dynamic distributions. As revealed by neuroscience, the hippocampal circuit plays a crucial role in memory replay, effectively reconstructing learned knowledge based on limited resources. Inspired by this, we propose a hippocampal circuit-inspired continual learning method (H2C) for trajectory prediction across varying scenarios. H2C retains prior knowledge by selectively recalling a small subset of learned samples. First, two complementary strategies are developed to select the subset to represent learned knowledge. Specifically, one strategy maximizes inter-sample diversity to represent the distinctive knowledge, and the other estimates the overall knowledge by equiprobable sampling. Then, H2C updates via a memory replay loss function calculated by these selected samples to retain knowledge while learning new data. Experiments based on various scenarios from the INTERACTION dataset are designed to evaluate H2C.

| **[Zero-Shot Cellular Trajectory Map Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06674v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cellular Trajectory Map-Matching (CTMM) aims to align cellular location sequences to road networks, which is a necessary preprocessing in location-based services on web platforms like Google Maps, including navigation and route optimization. Current approaches mainly rely on ID-based features and region-specific data to learn correlations between cell towers and roads, limiting their adaptability to unexplored areas. To enable high-accuracy CTMM without additional training in target regions, Zero-shot CTMM requires to extract not only region-adaptive features, but also sequential and location uncertainty to alleviate positioning errors in cellular data. In this paper, we propose a pixel-based trajectory calibration assistant for zero-shot CTMM, which takes advantage of transferable geospatial knowledge to calibrate pixelated trajectory, and then guide the path-finding process at the road network level. To enhance knowledge sharing across similar regions, a Gaussian mixture model is incorporated into VAE, enabling the identification of scenario-adaptive experts through soft clustering. To mitigate high positioning errors, a spatial-temporal awareness module is designed to capture sequential features and location uncertainty, thereby facilitating the inference of approximate user positions. Finally, a constrained path-finding algorithm is employed to reconstruct the road ID sequence, ensuring topological validity within the road network. This process is guided by the calibrated trajectory while optimizing for the shortest feasible path, thus minimizing unnecessary detours. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms existing methods in zero-shot CTMM by 16.8\%.</p></details> |  |

To overcome these challenges, we present the Neural-Enhanced Trajectory Planner (NEO-Planner), a novel approach that leverages a Neural Network (NN) Planner to provide informed initial values for trajectory optimization. The NN-Planner is trained on a dataset generated by an expert planner using batch sampling, capturing multimodal trajectory solutions. It learns to predict spatial and temporal parameters for trajectories directly from raw sensor observations. NEO-Planner starts optimization from these predictions, accelerating computation speed while maintaining explainability. Furthermore, we introduce a robust online replanning framework that accommodates planning latency for smooth trajectory tracking. Extensive simulations demonstrate that NEO-Planner reduces optimization iterations by 20%, leading to a 26% decrease in computation time compared with pure optimization-based methods. It maintains trajectory quality comparable to baseline approaches and generalizes well to unseen environments. Real-world experiments validate its effectiveness for autonomous drone navigation in cluttered, unknown environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IROS 2025.

| **[A Linear Differential Inclusion for Contraction Analysis to Known Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11587v2)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Infinitesimal contraction analysis provides exponential convergence rates between arbitrary pairs of trajectories of a system by studying the system's linearization. An essentially equivalent viewpoint arises through stability analysis of a linear differential inclusion (LDI) encompassing the incremental behavior of the system. In this note, we use contraction tools to study the exponential stability of a system to a particular known trajectory, deriving a new LDI characterizing the error between arbitrary trajectories and this known trajectory. As with classical contraction analysis, this new inclusion is constructed via first partial derivatives of the system's vector field, and convergence rates are obtained with familiar tools: uniform bounding of the logarithmic norm and LMI-based Lyapunov conditions. Our LDI is guaranteed to outperform a usual contraction analysis in two special circumstances: i) when the bound on the logarithmic norm arises from an interval overapproximation of the Jacobian matrix, and ii) when the norm considered is the $\ell_1$ norm. Finally, we demonstrate how the proposed approach strictly improves an existing framework for ellipsoidal reachable set computation.</p></details> |  |

While many distillation methods that are solely based on trajectory-preserving or distribution-matching have been developed to accelerate video generation models, these approaches often suffer from performance breakdown or increased artifacts under few-step settings. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{\emph{SwiftVideo}}, a unified and stable distillation framework that combines the advantages of trajectory-preserving and distribution-matching strategies. Our approach introduces continuous-time consistency distillation to ensure precise preservation of ODE trajectories. Subsequently, we propose a dual-perspective alignment that includes distribution alignment between synthetic and real data along with trajectory alignment across different inference steps. Our method maintains high-quality video generation while substantially reducing the number of inference steps. Quantitative evaluations on the OpenVid-1M benchmark demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in few-step video generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trustworthy Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction via Pattern-Aware Interaction Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13397v2)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and reliable pedestrian trajectory prediction is critical for the safety and robustness of intelligent applications, yet achieving trustworthy prediction remains highly challenging due to the complexity of interactions among pedestrians. Previous methods often adopt black-box modeling of pedestrian interactions, treating all neighbors uniformly. Despite their strong performance, such opaque modeling limits the reliability of predictions in safety-critical real-world deployments. To address this issue, we propose InSyn (Interaction-Synchronization Network), a novel Transformer-based model that explicitly captures diverse interaction patterns (e.g., walking in sync or conflicting) while effectively modeling direction-sensitive social behaviors. Additionally, we introduce a training strategy, termed Seq-Start of Seq (SSOS), designed to alleviate the common issue of initial-step divergence in numerical time-series prediction. Experiments on the ETH and UCY datasets demonstrate that our model not only outperforms recent black-box baselines in prediction accuracy, especially under high-density scenarios, but also provides stronger interpretability, achieving a favorable trade-off between reliability and accuracy. Furthermore, the SSOS strategy proves to be effective in improving sequential prediction performance, reducing the initial-step prediction error by approximately 6.58%.</p></details> |  |

To enhance the robustness of trajectory planning under environmental disturbances, this paper presents a disturbance-aware planning framework that incorporates real-time disturbance estimation into both path searching and trajectory optimization. A key component of the framework is a disturbance-adaptive safety boundary adjustment mechanism, which dynamically modifies the vehicle's feasible dynamic boundaries based on estimated disturbances to ensure trajectory feasibility. Leveraging the dynamics model of the bimodal vehicle, the proposed approach achieves adaptive and reliable motion planning across different terrains and operating conditions. A series of real-world experiments and benchmark comparisons on a custom-built platform validate the effectiveness and robustness of the method, demonstrating improvements in tracking accuracy, task efficiency, and energy performance under both ground and aerial disturbances.</p></details> |  |

Traditional heuristics based on handcrafted rules often lack accuracy and generalizability. Although deep learning approaches offer improved performance, they typically suffer from high computational cost, limited explainability, and, importantly, poor generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. In this paper, we introduce TrajEvo, a framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically design trajectory prediction heuristics. TrajEvo employs an evolutionary algorithm to generate and refine prediction heuristics from past trajectory data. We propose two key innovations: Cross-Generation Elite Sampling to encourage population diversity, and a Statistics Feedback Loop that enables the LLM to analyze and improve alternative predictions. Our evaluations demonstrate that TrajEvo outperforms existing heuristic methods across multiple real-world datasets, and notably surpasses both heuristic and deep learning methods in generalizing to an unseen OOD real-world dataset. TrajEvo marks a promising step toward the automated design of fast, explainable, and generalizable trajectory prediction heuristics. We release our source code to facilitate future research at https://github.com/ai4co/trajevo.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2505.04480</p></details> |

To address this critical gap, we introduce NaturalGAIA, a novel benchmark engineered on the principle of Causal Pathways. This design paradigm structures complex tasks into a series of programmatically verifiable atomic steps, ensuring a rigorous, fully automated, and reproducible standard for assessment. Concurrently, to mitigate the inherent capability deficits of agents, we developed LightManus, a hierarchical agent architecture specifically optimized for long-horizon tasks. We leveraged this agent to generate a high-quality, human-verified trajectory dataset that uniquely captures diverse and even self-correcting interaction patterns of LLMs. We then utilized this dataset to perform Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) on the Qwen2.5-VL-7B model. Our experiments reveal that NaturalGAIA presents a formidable challenge to current state-of-the-art LLMs; even the top-performing Claude-sonnet-4 achieved a Weighted Pathway Success Rate (WPSR) of only 34.6%. Moreover, while RFT substantially improved the smaller model's GUI execution capabilities (WPSR increased from 3.3% to 10.8%), its performance degraded sharply when handling complex scenarios. This outcome highlights the inherent capability ceiling of smaller models when faced with comprehensive tasks that integrate perception, decision-making, and execution. This research contributes a rigorous evaluation standard and a high-quality dataset to the community, aiming to guide the future development of GUI agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unified Linear Parametric Map Modeling and Perception-aware Trajectory Planning for Mobile Robotics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09340v2)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous navigation in mobile robots, reliant on perception and planning, faces major hurdles in large-scale, complex environments. These include heavy computational burdens for mapping, sensor occlusion failures for UAVs, and traversal challenges on irregular terrain for UGVs, all compounded by a lack of perception-aware strategies. To address these challenges, we introduce Random Mapping and Random Projection (RMRP). This method constructs a lightweight linear parametric map by first mapping data to a high-dimensional space, followed by a sparse random projection for dimensionality reduction. Our novel Residual Energy Preservation Theorem provides theoretical guarantees for this process, ensuring critical geometric properties are preserved. Based on this map, we propose the RPATR (Robust Perception-Aware Trajectory Planner) framework. For UAVs, our method unifies grid and Euclidean Signed Distance Field (ESDF) maps. The front-end uses an analytical occupancy gradient to refine initial paths for safety and smoothness, while the back-end uses a closed-form ESDF for trajectory optimization. Leveraging the trained RMRP model's generalization, the planner predicts unobserved areas for proactive navigation. For UGVs, the model characterizes terrain and provides closed-form gradients, enabling online planning to circumvent large holes. Validated in diverse scenarios, our framework demonstrates superior mapping performance in time, memory, and accuracy, and enables computationally efficient, safe navigation for high-speed UAVs and UGVs. The code will be released to foster community collaboration.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Theory and Practice of GRPO: A Trajectory-Corrected Approach with Fast Convergence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02833v2)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), recently proposed by DeepSeek, is a critic-free reinforcement learning algorithm for fine tuning large language models. It replaces the value function in Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with group normalized rewards, while retaining PPO style token level importance sampling based on an old policy. We show that GRPO update rule in fact estimates the policy gradient at the old policy rather than the current one. However, since the old policy is refreshed every few steps, the discrepancy between the two remains small limiting the impact of this bias in practice. We validate this through an ablation study in which importance sampling is entirely removed, and updates are instead performed using the gradient estimated at a fixed old policy across multiple optimization steps. Remarkably, this simplification results in performance comparable to standard GRPO. Motivated by these findings, we propose a new algorithm: Trajectory level Importance Corrected GRPO (TIC GRPO). TIC GRPO replaces token level importance ratios with a single trajectory level probability ratio, yielding an unbiased estimate of the current policy gradient while preserving the critic free structure. Furthermore, we present the first theoretical convergence analysis for GRPO style methods, covering both the original GRPO and our proposed variant.</p></details> | 12 pages |

Previous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of various prompting strategies in aiding LLMs in reasoning (called "reasoning actions"), such as step-by-step thinking, reflecting before answering, solving with programs, and their combinations. However, these approaches often applied static, predefined reasoning actions uniformly to all questions, without considering the specific characteristics of each question or the capability of the task-solving LLM. In this paper, we propose DOTS, an approach enabling LLMs to reason dynamically via optimal reasoning trajectory search, tailored to the specific characteristics of each question and the inherent capability of the task-solving LLM. Our approach involves three key steps: i) defining atomic reasoning action modules that can be composed into various reasoning action trajectories; ii) searching for the optimal action trajectory for each training question through iterative exploration and evaluation for the specific task-solving LLM; and iii) using the collected optimal trajectories to train an LLM to plan for the reasoning trajectories of unseen questions. In particular, we propose two learning paradigms, i.e., fine-tuning an external LLM as a planner to guide the task-solving LLM, or directly fine-tuning the task-solving LLM with an internalized capability for reasoning actions planning. Our experiments across eight reasoning tasks show that our method consistently outperforms static reasoning techniques and the vanilla instruction tuning approach. Further analysis reveals that our method enables LLMs to adjust their computation based on problem complexity, allocating deeper thinking and reasoning to harder problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025</p></details> |

This paper proposes a hybrid trajectory planning framework that integrates the adaptability of learning-based methods with the formal safety guarantees of optimization-based approaches. The framework features a two-layer architecture: an upper layer employing a graph neural network (GNN) trained on real-world highway data to predict human-like longitudinal velocity profiles, and a lower layer utilizing path optimization formulated as a mixed-integer quadratic programming (MIQP) problem. The primary contribution is the lower-layer path optimization model, which introduces a linear approximation of discretized vehicle geometry to substantially reduce computational complexity, while enforcing strict spatiotemporal non-overlapping constraints to formally guarantee collision avoidance throughout the planning horizon. Experimental results demonstrate that the planner generates highly smooth, collision-free trajectories in complex real-world emergency scenarios, achieving success rates exceeding 97% with average planning times of 54 ms, thereby confirming real-time capability.</p></details> |  |

However, accurately forecasting crowd trajectories remains a challenging task due to the inherently multimodal and uncertain nature of human motion. Recent diffusion-based models have shown promising results in capturing the stochasticity of pedestrian behavior for trajectory prediction. However, few diffusion-based approaches explicitly incorporate the underlying motion intentions of pedestrians, which can limit the interpretability and precision of prediction models. In this work, we propose a diffusion-based multimodal trajectory prediction model that incorporates pedestrians' motion intentions into the prediction framework. The motion intentions are decomposed into lateral and longitudinal components, and a pedestrian intention recognition module is introduced to enable the model to effectively capture these intentions. Furthermore, we adopt an efficient guidance mechanism that facilitates the generation of interpretable trajectories. The proposed framework is evaluated on two widely used human trajectory prediction benchmarks, ETH and UCY, on which it is compared against state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be presented at the 28th IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC), 2025</p></details> |

Most community models and datasets in the T2V domain are designed for single-object motion, limiting the performance of current generative models in multi-object tasks. Additionally, existing motion control methods in T2V either lack support for multi-object motion scenes or experience severe performance degradation when object trajectories intersect, primarily due to the semantic conflicts in colliding regions. To address these limitations, we introduce LayerT2V, the first approach for generating video by compositing background and foreground objects layer by layer. This layered generation enables flexible integration of multiple independent elements within a video, positioning each element on a distinct "layer" and thus facilitating coherent multi-object synthesis while enhancing control over the generation process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of LayerT2V in generating complex multi-object scenarios, showcasing 1.4x and 4.5x improvements in mIoU and AP50 metrics over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

This paper introduces the Trajectory-to-Action Pipeline (TAP), a scalable and automated method for extracting SDL labels from large trajectory datasets. TAP applies a rules-based cross-entropy optimization approach to learn parameters directly from data, enhancing generalization across diverse driving contexts. Using the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD), TAP achieves 30% greater precision than Average Displacement Error (ADE) and 24% over Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) in identifying behaviorally similar trajectories. Additionally, TAP enables automated detection of unique driving behaviors, streamlining safety evaluation processes for AV testing. This work provides a foundation for scalable scenario-based AV behavior analysis, with potential extensions for integrating multi-agent contexts.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |

Medical doctors guide these conversations through targeted questioning to efficiently gather the information required to provide the best possible outcomes for patients. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that studies physician intent trajectories in doctor-patient dialogues. We use the `Ambient Clinical Intelligence Benchmark' (Aci-bench) dataset for our study. We collaborate with medical professionals to develop a fine-grained taxonomy of physician intents based on the SOAP framework (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan). We then conduct a large-scale annotation effort to label over 5000 doctor-patient turns with the help of a large number of medical experts recruited using Prolific, a popular crowd-sourcing platform. This large labeled dataset is an important resource contribution that we use for benchmarking the state-of-the-art generative and encoder models for medical intent classification tasks. Our findings show that our models understand the general structure of medical dialogues with high accuracy, but often fail to identify transitions between SOAP categories. We also report for the first time common trajectories in medical dialogue structures that provide valuable insights for designing `differential diagnosis' systems. Finally, we extensively study the impact of intent filtering for medical dialogue summarization and observe a significant boost in performance. We make the codes and data, including annotation guidelines, publicly available at https://github.com/DATEXIS/medical-intent-classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ECAI 2025</p></details> |

By segmenting pedestrian trajectories into fixed time bins and applying a Transformer-based pair classification model, we identify cohesive groups and isolate single pedestrians over a structured sequence-based filtering process. To prepare for deeper analysis, we establish a comprehensive metric framework incorporating both spatial and behavioral dimensions. Spatial utilization metrics include convex hull area, smallest enclosing circle radius, and heatmap-based spatial densities to characterize how different pedestrian types occupy and interact with space. Behavioral metrics such as velocity change, motion angle deviation, clearance radius, and trajectory straightness are designed to capture local adaptations and responses during interactions. Furthermore, we introduce a typology of encounter types-single-to-single, single-to-group, and group-to-group to categorize and later quantify different interaction scenarios. Although this version focuses primarily on the classification pipeline and dataset structuring, it establishes the groundwork for scalable analysis across different sequence lengths 60, 100, and 200 frames. Future versions will incorporate complete quantitative analysis of the proposed metrics and their implications for pedestrian simulation and space design validation in crowd dynamics research.</p></details> |  |

Mission objectives are encoded using Signal Temporal Logic (STL), enabling the formal specification of spatial-temporal constraints. To ensure safety, city buildings are modeled as 3D convex obstacles, and obstacle avoidance is handled through a Convex Feasible Set (CFS) method. The entire planning problem-combining UAV dynamics, STL satisfaction, and collision avoidance-is formulated as a convex optimization problem that ensures tractability and can be solved efficiently using standard convex programming techniques. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method generates dynamically feasible, collision-free trajectories that satisfy temporal mission goals, providing a scalable and reliable approach for autonomous UAV-based medical logistics.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |

However, it is challenging to cooperatively deploy multiple UAV swarms in large-scale remote areas. Hence, in this paper, we propose a hierarchical UAV swarms structure for 6G aerial access networks, where the head UAVs serve as aerial BSs, and tail UAVs (T-UAVs) are responsible for relay. In detail, we jointly optimize the dynamic deployment and trajectory of UAV swarms, which is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem (MOP) to concurrently minimize the energy consumption of UAV swarms and GUs, as well as the delay of GUs. However, the proposed MOP is a mixed integer nonlinear programming and NP-hard to solve. Therefore, we develop a K-means and Voronoi diagram based area division method, and construct Fermat points to establish connections between GUs and T-UAVs. Then, an improved non-dominated sorting whale optimization algorithm is proposed to seek Pareto optimal solutions for the transformed MOP. Finally, extensive simulations are conducted to verify the performance of proposed algorithms by comparing with baseline mechanisms, resulting in a 50% complexity reduction.</p></details> |  |

Our framework features a unified trajectory representation that encapsulates the kinematic models of both $SO(3)\times\mathbb{R}^3$ and $SE(3)$ pose representations. This encapsulation strategy allows users to use the same implementation of measurement-based factors for either choice of pose representation, which facilitates experimentation and comparison to achieve the best model for the ME task. In addition, unique to our framework, we derive the kinematic models with the closed-form temporal derivatives of the local variable of $SO(3)$ and $SE(3)$, which so far has only been approximated based on the Taylor expansion in the literature. Our experiments show that these kinematic models can improve the estimation accuracy in high-speed scenarios. All analytical Jacobians of the interpolated states with respect to the support states of the trajectory representation, as well as the motion prior factors, are also provided for accelerated Gauss-Newton (GN) optimization. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of the framework in various motion estimation tasks such as localization, calibration, and odometry, facilitating fast prototyping for ME researchers.

Recent diffusion-based policy learning approaches have achieved promising performance in modeling action distributions for bimanual manipulation. However, they ignored the physical safety constraints of bimanual manipulation, which leads to the dangerous behaviors with damage to robots and objects. To this end, we propose a test-time trajectory optimization framework named SafeBimanual for any pre-trained diffusion-based bimanual manipulation policies, which imposes the safety constraints on bimanual actions to avoid dangerous robot behaviors with improved success rate. Specifically, we design diverse cost functions for safety constraints in different dual-arm cooperation patterns including avoidance of tearing objects and collision between arms and objects, which optimizes the manipulator trajectories with guided sampling of diffusion denoising process. Moreover, we employ a vision-language model (VLM) to schedule the cost functions by specifying keypoints and corresponding pairwise relationship, so that the optimal safety constraint is dynamically generated in the entire bimanual manipulation process. SafeBimanual demonstrates superiority on 8 simulated tasks in RoboTwin with a 13.7% increase in success rate and a 18.8% reduction in unsafe interactions over state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods. Extensive experiments on 4 real-world tasks further verify its practical value by improving the success rate by 32.5%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website is at: https://denghaoyuan123.github.io/SafeBimanip/</p></details> |

In this paper, we introduce the FlexiSteps Network (FSN), a novel framework that dynamically adjusts prediction output time steps based on varying contextual conditions. Inspired by recent advancements addressing observation length discrepancies and dynamic feature extraction, FSN incorporates an pre-trained Adaptive Prediction Module (APM) to evaluate and adjust the output steps dynamically, ensuring optimal prediction accuracy and efficiency. To guarantee the plug-and-play of our FSN, we also design a Dynamic Decoder(DD). Additionally, to balance the prediction time steps and prediction accuracy, we design a scoring mechanism, which not only introduces the Fr\'echet distance to evaluate the geometric similarity between the predicted trajectories and the ground truth trajectories but the length of predicted steps is also considered. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets including Argoverse and INTERACTION demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of our proposed FSN framework.</p></details> |  |

However, the high computational cost of diffusion Transformers-stemming from a large number of sampling steps and complex per-step computations-presents significant challenges for real-time deployment. In this paper, we introduce OmniCache, a training-free acceleration method that exploits the global redundancy inherent in the denoising process. Unlike existing methods that determine caching strategies based on inter-step similarities and tend to prioritize reusing later sampling steps, our approach originates from the sampling perspective of DIT models. We systematically analyze the model's sampling trajectories and strategically distribute cache reuse across the entire sampling process. This global perspective enables more effective utilization of cached computations throughout the diffusion trajectory, rather than concentrating reuse within limited segments of the sampling procedure. In addition, during cache reuse, we dynamically estimate the corresponding noise and filter it out to reduce its impact on the sampling direction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach accelerates the sampling process while maintaining competitive generative quality, offering a promising and practical solution for efficient deployment of diffusion-based generative models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[Preference Trajectory Modeling via Flow Matching for Sequential Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17618v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential recommendation predicts each user's next item based on their historical interaction sequence. Recently, diffusion models have attracted significant attention in this area due to their strong ability to model user interest distributions. They typically generate target items by denoising Gaussian noise conditioned on historical interactions. However, these models face two critical limitations. First, they exhibit high sensitivity to the condition, making it difficult to recover target items from pure Gaussian noise. Second, the inference process is computationally expensive, limiting practical deployment. To address these issues, we propose FlowRec, a simple yet effective sequential recommendation framework which leverages flow matching to explicitly model user preference trajectories from current states to future interests. Flow matching is an emerging generative paradigm, which offers greater flexibility in initial distributions and enables more efficient sampling. Based on this, we construct a personalized behavior-based prior distribution to replace Gaussian noise and learn a vector field to model user preference trajectories. To better align flow matching with the recommendation objective, we further design a single-step alignment loss incorporating both positive and negative samples, improving sampling efficiency and generation quality. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets verify the superiority of FlowRec over the state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[SE-Agent: Self-Evolution Trajectory Optimization in Multi-Step Reasoning with LLM-Based Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02085v5)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have recently shown impressive capabilities in complex reasoning and tool use via multi-step interactions with their environments. While these agents have the potential to tackle complicated tasks, their problem-solving process, i.e., agents' interaction trajectory leading to task completion, remains underexploited. These trajectories contain rich feedback that can navigate agents toward the right directions for solving problems correctly. Although prevailing approaches, such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), can effectively balance exploration and exploitation, they ignore the interdependence among various trajectories and lack the diversity of search spaces, which leads to redundant reasoning and suboptimal outcomes. To address these challenges, we propose SE-Agent, a Self-Evolution framework that enables Agents to optimize their reasoning processes iteratively. Our approach revisits and enhances former pilot trajectories through three key operations: revision, recombination, and refinement. This evolutionary mechanism enables two critical advantages: (1) it expands the search space beyond local optima by intelligently exploring diverse solution paths guided by previous trajectories, and (2) it leverages cross-trajectory inspiration to efficiently enhance performance while mitigating the impact of suboptimal reasoning paths. Through these mechanisms, SE-Agent achieves continuous self-evolution that incrementally improves reasoning quality. We evaluate SE-Agent on SWE-bench Verified to resolve real-world GitHub issues. Experimental results across five strong LLMs show that integrating SE-Agent delivers up to 55% relative improvement, achieving state-of-the-art performance among all open-source agents on SWE-bench Verified. Our code and demonstration materials are publicly available at https://github.com/JARVIS-Xs/SE-Agent.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReviBranch: Deep Reinforcement Learning for Branch-and-Bound with Revived Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17452v1)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Branch-and-bound (B&B) algorithm is the main solver for Mixed Integer Linear Programs (MILPs), where the selection of branching variable is essential to computational efficiency. However, traditional heuristics for branching often fail to generalize across heterogeneous problem instances, while existing learning-based methods such as imitation learning (IL) suffers from dependence on expert demonstration quality, and reinforcement learning (RL) struggles with limitations in sparse rewards and dynamic state representation challenges. To address these issues, we propose ReviBranch, a novel deep RL framework that constructs revived trajectories by reviving explicit historical correspondences between branching decisions and their corresponding graph states along search-tree paths. During training, ReviBranch enables agents to learn from complete structural evolution and temporal dependencies within the branching process. Additionally, we introduce an importance-weighted reward redistribution mechanism that transforms sparse terminal rewards into dense stepwise feedback, addressing the sparse reward challenge. Extensive experiments on different MILP benchmarks demonstrate that ReviBranch outperforms state-of-the-art RL methods, reducing B&B nodes by 4.0% and LP iterations by 2.2% on large-scale instances. The results highlight the robustness and generalizability of ReviBranch across heterogeneous MILP problem classes.</p></details> | conference |

Natural language enables users to express these adjustments in an interactive manner. We introduce OVITA, an interpretable, open-vocabulary, language-driven framework designed for adapting robot trajectories in dynamic and novel situations based on human instructions. OVITA leverages multiple pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to integrate user commands into trajectories generated by motion planners or those learned through demonstrations. OVITA employs code as an adaptation policy generated by an LLM, enabling users to adjust individual waypoints, thus providing flexible control. Another LLM, which acts as a code explainer, removes the need for expert users, enabling intuitive interactions. The efficacy and significance of the proposed OVITA framework is demonstrated through extensive simulations and real-world environments with diverse tasks involving spatiotemporal variations on heterogeneous robotic platforms such as a KUKA IIWA robot manipulator, Clearpath Jackal ground robot, and CrazyFlie drone.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Robotics and Automation Letters 2025.

Recent methods leverage generative priors as pseudo ground truth, but often lead to poor geometric consistency and over-smoothed renderings. To address these limitations, we propose ExtraGS, a holistic framework for trajectory extrapolation that integrates both geometric and generative priors. At the core of ExtraGS is a novel Road Surface Gaussian(RSG) representation based on a hybrid Gaussian-Signed Distance Function (SDF) design, and Far Field Gaussians (FFG) that use learnable scaling factors to efficiently handle distant objects. Furthermore, we develop a self-supervised uncertainty estimation framework based on spherical harmonics that enables selective integration of generative priors only where extrapolation artifacts occur. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets, diverse multi-camera setups, and various generative priors demonstrate that ExtraGS significantly enhances the realism and geometric consistency of extrapolated views, while preserving high fidelity along the original trajectory.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Rapid Iterative Trajectory Planning Method for Automated Parking through Differential Flatness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17038v1)** | 2025-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As autonomous driving continues to advance, automated parking is becoming increasingly essential. However, significant challenges arise when implementing path velocity decomposition (PVD) trajectory planning for automated parking. The primary challenge is ensuring rapid and precise collision-free trajectory planning, which is often in conflict. The secondary challenge involves maintaining sufficient control feasibility of the planned trajectory, particularly at gear shifting points (GSP). This paper proposes a PVD-based rapid iterative trajectory planning (RITP) method to solve the above challenges. The proposed method effectively balances the necessity for time efficiency and precise collision avoidance through a novel collision avoidance framework. Moreover, it enhances the overall control feasibility of the planned trajectory by incorporating the vehicle kinematics model and including terminal smoothing constraints (TSC) at GSP during path planning. Specifically, the proposed method leverages differential flatness to ensure the planned path adheres to the vehicle kinematic model. Additionally, it utilizes TSC to maintain curvature continuity at GSP, thereby enhancing the control feasibility of the overall trajectory. The simulation results demonstrate superior time efficiency and tracking errors compared to model-integrated and other iteration-based trajectory planning methods. In the real-world experiment, the proposed method was implemented and validated on a ROS-based vehicle, demonstrating the applicability of the RITP method for real vehicles.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the journal Robotics and Autonomous Systems</p></details> |

The framework is built upon Large Language Models (LLMs), incorporating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) empowered by Agentic AI and integrated with a UAV-specific knowledge base. Through the Agentic RAG, the LLM autonomously interprets high-level task requirements and identifies the key components necessary for trajectory optimization, including model inputs and outputs, network architecture, reward functions, and task constraints. To support efficient modeling across different system scales, we introduce the Mamba-Attention Integrated Transformer (MAIT), a hybrid neural architecture that combines the long-range dependency modeling capability of attention mechanisms with the efficient temporal dynamic representation of Mamba. Furthermore, a Trajectory-Group Relative Policy Optimization (T-GRPO) method is proposed to achieve unified policy gradient optimization in both discrete and continuous trajectory spaces for MAIT training. Extensive experimental results validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed ARMAIT framework.</p></details> |  |

While general-purpose deep research agents have shown impressive capabilities, they struggle significantly with medical domain challenges, as evidenced by leading proprietary systems achieving limited accuracy on complex medical benchmarks. The key limitations are: (1) the model lacks sufficient dense medical knowledge for clinical reasoning, and (2) the framework is constrained by the absence of specialized retrieval tools tailored for medical contexts. We present a medical deep research agent that addresses these challenges through two core innovations. First, we develop a novel data synthesis framework using medical knowledge graphs, extracting the longest chains from subgraphs around rare medical entities to generate complex multi-hop question-answer pairs. Second, we integrate a custom-built private medical retrieval engine alongside general-purpose tools, enabling accurate medical information synthesis. Our approach generates 2100+ diverse trajectories across 12 medical specialties, each averaging 4.2 tool interactions. Through a two-stage training paradigm combining supervised fine-tuning and online reinforcement learning with composite rewards, our MedResearcher-R1-32B model demonstrates exceptional performance, establishing new state-of-the-art results on medical benchmarks while maintaining competitive performance on general deep research tasks. Our work demonstrates that strategic domain-specific innovations in architecture, tool design, and training data construction can enable smaller open-source models to outperform much larger proprietary systems in specialized domains.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Integrated Take-off Management and Trajectory Optimization for Merging Control in Urban Air Mobility Corridors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15395v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban Air Mobility (UAM) has the potential to revolutionize daily transportation, offering rapid and efficient aerial mobility services. Take-off and merging phases are critical for air corridor operations, requiring the coordination of take-off aircraft and corridor traffic while ensuring safety and seamless transition. This paper proposes an integrated take-off management and trajectory optimization for merging control in UAM corridors. We first introduce a novel take-off airspace design. To our knowledge, this paper is one of the first to propose a structured design for take-off airspace. Based on the take-off airspace design, we devise a hierarchical coordinated take-off and merging management (HCTMM) strategy. To be specific, the take-off airspace design can simplify aircraft dynamics and thus reduce the dimensionality of the trajectory optimization problem whilst mitigating obstacle avoidance complexities. The HCTMM strategy strictly ensures safety and improves the efficiency of take-off and merging operations. At the tactical level, a scheduling algorithm coordinates aircraft take-off times and selects dynamic merging points to reduce conflicts and ensure smooth take-off and merging processes. At the operational level, a trajectory optimization strategy ensures that each aircraft reaches the dynamic merging point efficiently while satisfying safety constraints. Simulation results show that, compared to representative strategies with fixed or dynamic merging points, the HCTMM strategy significantly improves operational efficiency and reduces computational burden, while ensuring safety under various corridor traffic conditions. Further results confirm the scalability of the HCTMM strategy and the computational efficiency enabled by the proposed take-off airspace design.</p></details> | 31 pages |

Most models predict chronological age, an imperfect surrogate for biological aging, or generate synthetic MRIs that enhance data diversity but fail to capture subject-specific trajectories. Here, we present BrainPath, a 3D generative framework that learns longitudinal brain aging dynamics during training and, at inference, predicts anatomically faithful MRIs at arbitrary timepoints from a single baseline scan. BrainPath integrates an age calibration loss, a swap learning strategy, and an age perceptual loss to preserve subtle, biologically meaningful variations. Across held-out ADNI and an independent NACC dataset, BrainPath outperforms state-of-the-art reference models in structural similarity (SSIM), mean squared error (MSE), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and MRI age-difference accuracy, while capturing realistic and temporally consistent aging patterns. Beyond methodological innovation, BrainPath enables personalized mapping of brain aging, synthetic follow-up scan prediction, and trajectory-based analyses, providing a foundation for precision modeling of brain aging and supporting research into neurodegeneration and aging interventions.</p></details> |  |

A custom simulation incorporating realistic waves and current disturbances is developed to validate the controller's performance, supported by further validation through field tests in the harbour of Scheveningen, the Netherlands, and at sea. Simulation results demonstrate that ADRC significantly reduces cross-track error across all tested conditions compared to a baseline PID controller but increases control effort and energy consumption. Field trials confirm these findings while revealing a further increase in energy consumption during sea trials compared to the baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at IROS 2025.

To address these challenges, we present TRUST-Planner, a topology-guided hierarchical planning framework for robust spatial-temporal obstacle avoidance. In the frontend, a dynamic enhanced visible probabilistic roadmap (DEV-PRM) is proposed to rapidly explore topological paths for global guidance. The backend utilizes a uniform terminal-free minimum control polynomial (UTF-MINCO) and dynamic distance field (DDF) to enable efficient predictive obstacle avoidance and fast parallel computation. Furthermore, an incremental multi-branch trajectory management framework is introduced to enable spatio-temporal topological decision-making, while efficiently leveraging historical information to reduce replanning time. Simulation results show that TRUST-Planner outperforms baseline competitors, achieving a 96\% success rate and millisecond-level computation efficiency in tested complex environments. Real-world experiments further validate the feasibility and practicality of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |

Even though most traffic accident fatalities account to bicycles, they have received little attention, as previous work focused mainly on pedestrians and motorized vehicles. In this work, we present the Great GATsBi, a domain-knowledge-based, hybrid, multimodal trajectory prediction framework for bicycles. The model incorporates both physics-based modeling (inspired by motorized vehicles) and social-based modeling (inspired by pedestrian movements) to explicitly account for the dual nature of bicycle movement. The social interactions are modeled with a graph attention network, and include decayed historical, but also anticipated, future trajectory data of a bicycles neighborhood, following recent insights from psychological and social studies. The results indicate that the proposed ensemble of physics models -- performing well in the short-term predictions -- and social models -- performing well in the long-term predictions -- exceeds state-of-the-art performance. We also conducted a controlled mass-cycling experiment to demonstrate the framework's performance when forecasting bicycle trajectories and modeling social interactions with road users.</p></details> |  |

Two main issues limit the flight trajectory prediction performance of existing works. The first issue is the negative impact on prediction accuracy caused by the significant differences in data range. The second issue is that real-world flight trajectories involve underlying temporal dependencies, and most existing methods fail to reveal the hidden complex temporal variations and extract features from one single time scale. To address the above issues, we propose FlightPatchNet, a multi-scale patch network with differential coding for flight trajectory prediction. Specifically, FlightPatchNet first utilizes differential coding to encode the original values of longitude and latitude into first-order differences and generates embeddings for all variables at each time step. Then, global temporal attention is introduced to explore the dependencies between different time steps. To fully explore the diverse temporal patterns in flight trajectories, a multi-scale patch network is delicately designed to serve as the backbone. The multi-scale patch network exploits stacked patch mixer blocks to capture inter- and intra-patch dependencies under different time scales, and further integrates multi-scale temporal features across different scales and variables. Finally, FlightPatchNet ensembles multiple predictors to make direct multi-step prediction. Extensive experiments on ADS-B datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms the competitive baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by UAI 2025.

The objective is to assess model performance in diverse traffic complexities and compare the reliability of the approaches. While previous VTP models overlook the specific traffic situation complexity and lack reliability assessments, this research uses a probability of detection analysis to quantify model reliability in varying traffic scenarios, thus going beyond common error distribution analyses. All models are evaluated on test samples categorized according to their traffic situation during the prediction horizon, with performance metrics and reliability estimates obtained for each category. The results of this comprehensive evaluation provide a deeper understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the different prediction approaches, along with their reliability in terms of the prediction horizon lengths for which safe forecasts can be guaranteed. These findings can inform the development of more reliable vessel trajectory prediction approaches, enhancing safety and efficiency in future inland waterways navigation.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)</p></details> |

The deep Koopman operator is trained on sampled flight data to construct a high-dimensional latent representation in which the nonlinear quadrotor dynamics are approximated by linear models. This linearization enables the application of MPC to efficiently optimize control actions over a finite prediction horizon, ensuring accurate trajectory tracking and stabilization. The proposed DK-MPC approach is validated through a series of trajectory-following and point-stabilization numerical experiments, where it demonstrates superior tracking accuracy and significantly lower computation time compared to conventional nonlinear MPC. These results highlight the potential of Koopman-based learning methods to handle complex quadrotor dynamics while meeting the real-time requirements of embedded flight control. Future work will focus on extending the framework to more agile flight scenarios and improving robustness against external disturbances.</p></details> |  |

Although end-to-end models based on deep learning have great potential, they often do not consider vehicle dynamic limitations, leading to unrealistic predictions. To address this problem, this work introduces a novel hybrid model that combines deep learning with a kinematic motion model. It is able to predict object attributes such as acceleration and yaw rate and generate trajectories based on them. A key contribution is the incorporation of expert knowledge into the learning objective of the deep learning model. This results in the constraint of the available action space, thus enabling the prediction of physically feasible object attributes and trajectories, thereby increasing safety and robustness. The proposed hybrid model facilitates enhanced interpretability, thereby reinforcing the trustworthiness of deep learning methods and promoting the development of safe planning solutions. Experiments conducted on the publicly available real-world Argoverse dataset demonstrate realistic driving behaviour, with benchmark comparisons and ablation studies showing promising results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Copyr...</summary><p>Copyright 2025 IEEE.

Traditional site selection methods often rely on static traffic counts or subjective assessments. This research introduces a data-driven methodology to objectively quantify location visibility by analyzing large-scale connected vehicle trajectory data (sourced from Compass IoT) within urban environments. We model the dynamic driver field-of-view using a forward-projected visibility area for each vehicle position derived from interpolated trajectories. By integrating this with building vertex locations extracted from OpenStreetMap, we quantify the cumulative visual exposure, or ``visibility count'', for thousands of potential points of interest near roadways. The analysis reveals that visibility is highly concentrated, identifying specific ``visual hotspots'' that receive disproportionately high exposure compared to average locations. The core technical contribution involves the construction of a BallTree spatial index over building vertices. This enables highly efficient (O(logN) complexity) radius queries to determine which vertices fall within the viewing circles of millions of trajectory points across numerous trips, significantly outperforming brute-force geometric checks. Analysis reveals two key findings: 1) Visibility is highly concentrated, identifying distinct 'visual hotspots' receiving disproportionately high exposure compared to average locations. 2) The aggregated visibility counts across vertices conform to a Log-Normal distribution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncertainty Tube Visualization of Particle Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13505v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting particle trajectories with neural networks (NNs) has substantially enhanced many scientific and engineering domains. However, effectively quantifying and visualizing the inherent uncertainty in predictions remains challenging. Without an understanding of the uncertainty, the reliability of NN models in applications where trustworthiness is paramount is significantly compromised. This paper introduces the uncertainty tube, a novel, computationally efficient visualization method designed to represent this uncertainty in NN-derived particle paths. Our key innovation is the design and implementation of a superelliptical tube that accurately captures and intuitively conveys nonsymmetric uncertainty. By integrating well-established uncertainty quantification techniques, such as Deep Ensembles, Monte Carlo Dropout (MC Dropout), and Stochastic Weight Averaging-Gaussian (SWAG), we demonstrate the practical utility of the uncertainty tube, showcasing its application on both synthetic and simulation datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[ROVER: Robust Loop Closure Verification with Trajectory Prior in Repetitive Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13488v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Loop closure detection is important for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), which associates current observations with historical keyframes, achieving drift correction and global relocalization. However, a falsely detected loop can be fatal, and this is especially difficult in repetitive environments where appearance-based features fail due to the high similarity. Therefore, verification of a loop closure is a critical step in avoiding false positive detections. Existing works in loop closure verification predominantly focus on learning invariant appearance features, neglecting the prior knowledge of the robot's spatial-temporal motion cue, i.e., trajectory. In this letter, we propose ROVER, a loop closure verification method that leverages the historical trajectory as a prior constraint to reject false loops in challenging repetitive environments. For each loop candidate, it is first used to estimate the robot trajectory with pose-graph optimization. This trajectory is then submitted to a scoring scheme that assesses its compliance with the trajectory without the loop, which we refer to as the trajectory prior, to determine if the loop candidate should be accepted. Benchmark comparisons and real-world experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Furthermore, we integrate ROVER into state-of-the-art SLAM systems to verify its robustness and efficiency. Our source code and self-collected dataset are available at https://github.com/jarvisyjw/ROVER.</p></details> | 8 pages, 9 figures |

While these trajectories reflect inherent uncertainty, they are typically uncalibrated. We propose a unified framework based on conformal prediction that transforms sampled trajectories into calibrated prediction intervals with theoretical coverage guarantees. By introducing a novel online update step and an optimization step that captures inter-step dependencies, our method can produce discontinuous prediction intervals around each trajectory, naturally capture temporal dependencies, and yield sharper, more adaptive uncertainty estimates.</p></details> |  |
| **[STRAP: Robot Sub-Trajectory Retrieval for Augmented Policy Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15182v2)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robot learning is witnessing a significant increase in the size, diversity, and complexity of pre-collected datasets, mirroring trends in domains such as natural language processing and computer vision. Many robot learning methods treat such datasets as multi-task expert data and learn a multi-task, generalist policy by training broadly across them. Notably, while these generalist policies can improve the average performance across many tasks, the performance of generalist policies on any one task is often suboptimal due to negative transfer between partitions of the data, compared to task-specific specialist policies. In this work, we argue for the paradigm of training policies during deployment given the scenarios they encounter: rather than deploying pre-trained policies to unseen problems in a zero-shot manner, we non-parametrically retrieve and train models directly on relevant data at test time. Furthermore, we show that many robotics tasks share considerable amounts of low-level behaviors and that retrieval at the "sub"-trajectory granularity enables significantly improved data utilization, generalization, and robustness in adapting policies to novel problems. In contrast, existing full-trajectory retrieval methods tend to underutilize the data and miss out on shared cross-task content. This work proposes STRAP, a technique for leveraging pre-trained vision foundation models and dynamic time warping to retrieve sub-sequences of trajectories from large training corpora in a robust fashion. STRAP outperforms both prior retrieval algorithms and multi-task learning methods in simulated and real experiments, showing the ability to scale to much larger offline datasets in the real world as well as the ability to learn robust control policies with just a handful of real-world demonstrations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website at https://weirdlabuw.github.io/strap/</p></details> |

We study generative modeling for planning with datasets repurposed from offline reinforcement learning. Specifically, we identify temporal consistency in the absence of step-wise rewards as one key technical challenge. We introduce the Latent Plan Transformer (LPT), a novel model that leverages a latent variable to connect a Transformer-based trajectory generator and the final return. LPT can be learned with maximum likelihood estimation on trajectory-return pairs. In learning, posterior sampling of the latent variable naturally integrates sub-trajectories to form a consistent abstraction despite the finite context. At test time, the latent variable is inferred from an expected return before policy execution, realizing the idea of planning as inference. Our experiments demonstrate that LPT can discover improved decisions from sub-optimal trajectories, achieving competitive performance across several benchmarks, including Gym-Mujoco, Franka Kitchen, Maze2D, and Connect Four. It exhibits capabilities in nuanced credit assignments, trajectory stitching, and adaptation to environmental contingencies. These results validate that latent variable inference can be a strong alternative to step-wise reward prompting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Autonomous Oil Spill Response Through Liquid Neural Trajectory Modeling and Coordinated Marine Robotics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12456v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Marine oil spills pose grave environmental and economic risks, threatening marine ecosystems, coastlines, and dependent industries. Predicting and managing oil spill trajectories is highly complex, due to the interplay of physical, chemical, and environmental factors such as wind, currents, and temperature, which makes timely and effective response challenging. Accurate real-time trajectory forecasting and coordinated mitigation are vital for minimizing the impact of these disasters. This study introduces an integrated framework combining a multi-agent swarm robotics system built on the MOOS-IvP platform with Liquid Time-Constant Neural Networks (LTCNs). The proposed system fuses adaptive machine learning with autonomous marine robotics, enabling real-time prediction, dynamic tracking, and rapid response to evolving oil spills. By leveraging LTCNs--well-suited for modeling complex, time-dependent processes--the framework achieves real-time, high-accuracy forecasts of spill movement. Swarm intelligence enables decentralized, scalable, and resilient decision-making among robot agents, enhancing collective monitoring and containment efforts. Our approach was validated using data from the Deepwater Horizon spill, where the LTC-RK4 model achieved 0.96 spatial accuracy, surpassing LSTM approaches by 23%.

| **[Belief-Conditioned One-Step Diffusion: Real-Time Trajectory Planning with Just-Enough Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12166v1)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robots equipped with rich sensor suites can localize reliably in partially-observable environments, but powering every sensor continuously is wasteful and often infeasible. Belief-space planners address this by propagating pose-belief covariance through analytic models and switching sensors heuristically--a brittle, runtime-expensive approach. Data-driven approaches--including diffusion models--learn multi-modal trajectories from demonstrations, but presuppose an accurate, always-on state estimate. We address the largely open problem: for a given task in a mapped environment, which \textit{minimal sensor subset} must be active at each location to maintain state uncertainty \textit{just low enough} to complete the task? Our key insight is that when a diffusion planner is explicitly conditioned on a pose-belief raster and a sensor mask, the spread of its denoising trajectories yields a calibrated, differentiable proxy for the expected localisation error. Building on this insight, we present Belief-Conditioned One-Step Diffusion (B-COD), the first planner that, in a 10 ms forward pass, returns a short-horizon trajectory, per-waypoint aleatoric variances, and a proxy for localisation error--eliminating external covariance rollouts. We show that this single proxy suffices for a soft-actor-critic to choose sensors online, optimising energy while bounding pose-covariance growth. We deploy B-COD in real-time marine trials on an unmanned surface vehicle and show that it reduces sensing energy consumption while matching the goal-reach performance of an always-on baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CoRL 2025 (Conference on Robot Learning)</p></details> |

This work proposes the Fast and Safe Data-Driven Planner to address this challenge. Sparse Gaussian predictions are introduced to improve both the computational efficiency and accuracy of opponent predictions. Furthermore, the proposed approach employs a bi-level quadratic programming framework to generate an overtaking trajectory leveraging the opponent predictions. The first level uses polynomial fitting to generate a rough trajectory, from which reference states and control inputs are derived for the second level. The second level formulates a model predictive control optimization problem in the Frenet frame, generating a trajectory that satisfies both kinematic feasibility and safety. Experimental results on the F1TENTH platform show that our method outperforms the State-of-the-Art, achieving an 8.93% higher overtaking success rate, allowing the maximum opponent speed, ensuring a smoother ego trajectory, and reducing 74.04% computational time compared to the Predictive Spliner method.

| **[On Delta-Homology Analogy: Memory as Structured Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04203v2)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the \emph{delta-homology analogy}, which formalizes memory as a set of sparse, topologically irreducible attractors. A \emph{Dirac delta-like memory trace} \( \delta_\gamma \) is identified with a nontrivial homology generator \( [\gamma] \in H_1(\mathcal{Z}) \) on a latent manifold of cognitive states. Such traces are sharply localized along reproducible topological cycles and are only activated when inference trajectories complete a full cycle. They encode minimal, path-dependent memory units that cannot be synthesized from local features alone. Based on the analogy, we propose a topological framework for memory and inference grounded in the structure of spike-timing dynamics and persistent homology. Starting from the observation that polychronous neural groups (PNGs) encode reproducible, time-locked spike sequences shaped by axonal delays and synaptic plasticity, we construct \emph{spatiotemporal complexes} whose temporally consistent transitions define chain complexes over which robust activation cycles emerge. These activation loops are abstracted into \emph{cell posets}, enabling a compact and causally ordered representation of neural activity with overlapping and compositional memory traces.</p></details> |  |
| **[Two-Impulse Trajectory Design in Two-Body Systems With Riemannian Geometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11612v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work presents a new method for generating impulsive trajectories in restricted two-body systems by leveraging Riemannian geometry. The proposed method transforms the standard trajectory optimization problem into a purely geometric one that involves computing a set of geodesics for a suitable Riemannian metric. This transformation is achieved by defining a metric, specifically the Jacobi metric, that embeds the dynamics directly into the metric, so any geodesic of the metric is also a dynamically feasible trajectory. The method finds the fuel-optimal transfer trajectory by sampling candidate energy ($\Delta V$) changes for different points on the current and desired orbit, and efficiently computing and evaluating each candidate geodesic, which are equivalent to candidate orbit transfer trajectories via the Jacobi metric. The method bypasses the known issues of optimization-based methods, e.g., sensitivity to the initial guess, and can be applied to more complex two-body systems. The approach is demonstrated on the minimum-$\Delta V$ two-impulse phase-free orbit transfer problem, first on a Keplerian system and second on a system with a modeled $J_2$ perturbation. The proposed method is shown to meet or exceed the state-of-the-art methods in the minimum-$\Delta V$ problem in the Keplerian system. The generality and versatility of the approach is demonstrated by seamlessly including the $J_2$ perturbation, a case that many existing methods cannot handle. Numerical simulations and performance comparisons showcase the effectiveness of the approach.</p></details> |  |

Despite the growing interest and efforts in this field, several issues remain unresolved, including (1) data unavailability, (2) lack of an effective trajectory-based framework, and (3) requirement for sufficient supervision labels. In this paper, we present TrajSV, a trajectory-based framework that addresses various issues in existing studies. TrajSV comprises three components: data preprocessing, Clip Representation Network (CRNet), and Video Representation Network (VRNet). The data preprocessing module extracts player and ball trajectories from sports broadcast videos. CRNet utilizes a trajectory-enhanced Transformer module to learn clip representations based on these trajectories. Additionally, VRNet learns video representations by aggregating clip representations and visual features with an encoder-decoder architecture. Finally, a triple contrastive loss is introduced to optimize both video and clip representations in an unsupervised manner. The experiments are conducted on three broadcast video datasets to verify the effectiveness of TrajSV for three types of sports (i.e., soccer, basketball, and volleyball) with three downstream applications (i.e., sports video retrieval, action spotting, and video captioning). The results demonstrate that TrajSV achieves state-of-the-art performance in sports video retrieval, showcasing a nearly 70% improvement. It outperforms baselines in action spotting, achieving state-of-the-art results in 9 out of 17 action categories, and demonstrates a nearly 20% improvement in video captioning. Additionally, we introduce a deployed system along with the three applications based on TrajSV.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by TCSVT</p></details> |
| **[Relative Position Matters: Trajectory Prediction and Planning with Polar Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11492v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction and planning in autonomous driving are highly challenging due to the complexity of predicting surrounding agents' movements and planning the ego agent's actions in dynamic environments. Existing methods encode map and agent positions and decode future trajectories in Cartesian coordinates. However, modeling the relationships between the ego vehicle and surrounding traffic elements in Cartesian space can be suboptimal, as it does not naturally capture the varying influence of different elements based on their relative distances and directions. To address this limitation, we adopt the Polar coordinate system, where positions are represented by radius and angle. This representation provides a more intuitive and effective way to model spatial changes and relative relationships, especially in terms of distance and directional influence. Based on this insight, we propose Polaris, a novel method that operates entirely in Polar coordinates, distinguishing itself from conventional Cartesian-based approaches. By leveraging the Polar representation, this method explicitly models distance and direction variations and captures relative relationships through dedicated encoding and refinement modules, enabling more structured and spatially aware trajectory prediction and planning. Extensive experiments on the challenging prediction (Argoverse 2) and planning benchmarks (nuPlan) demonstrate that Polaris achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[KDPE: A Kernel Density Estimation Strategy for Diffusion Policy Trajectory Selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10511v2)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning robot policies that capture multimodality in the training data has been a long-standing open challenge for behavior cloning. Recent approaches tackle the problem by modeling the conditional action distribution with generative models. One of these approaches is Diffusion Policy, which relies on a diffusion model to denoise random points into robot action trajectories. While achieving state-of-the-art performance, it has two main drawbacks that may lead the robot out of the data distribution during policy execution. First, the stochasticity of the denoising process can highly impact on the quality of generated trajectory of actions. Second, being a supervised learning approach, it can learn data outliers from the dataset used for training. Recent work focuses on mitigating these limitations by combining Diffusion Policy either with large-scale training or with classical behavior cloning algorithms. Instead, we propose KDPE, a Kernel Density Estimation-based strategy that filters out potentially harmful trajectories output of Diffusion Policy while keeping a low test-time computational overhead. For Kernel Density Estimation, we propose a manifold-aware kernel to model a probability density function for actions composed of end-effector Cartesian position, orientation, and gripper state. KDPE overall achieves better performance than Diffusion Policy on simulated single-arm tasks and real robot experiments.

This phenomena diminishes utility in production applications that repeatedly rely on common prompt templates or applications that frequently rely on LLMs for specific tasks (e.g. sentiment analysis, language translation). Through comprehensive evaluation, we demonstrate that LLMs still tend to refuse responses to harmful instructions when those instructions are reframed to appear as benign tasks. Our mechanistic analysis reveal that LLMs follow distinct "constellation" patterns in embedding space as representations traverse layers, with each task maintaining consistent trajectories that shift predictably between refusal and non-refusal cases. We introduce SafeConstellations, an inference-time trajectory-shifting approach that tracks task-specific trajectory patterns and guides representations toward non-refusal pathways. By selectively guiding model behavior only on tasks prone to over-refusal, and by preserving general model behavior, our method reduces over-refusal rates by up to 73% with minimal impact on utility-offering a principled approach to mitigating over-refusals.</p></details> | Preprint |

However, existing fault-tolerant control methods exhibit significant oscillations during docking and separation, impacting system stability. To address this issue, we propose a novel fault-tolerant control reallocation method that adapts to an arbitrary number of modular robots and their assembly formations. The algorithm redistributes the expected collective force and torque required for MARS to individual units according to their moment arm relative to the center of MARS mass. Furthermore, we propose an agile trajectory planning method for MARS of arbitrary configurations, which is collision-avoiding and dynamically feasible. Our work represents the first comprehensive approach to enable fault-tolerant and collision avoidance flight for MARS. We validate our method through extensive simulations, demonstrating improved fault tolerance, enhanced trajectory tracking accuracy, and greater robustness in cluttered environments.

The main aim is to reconstruct GPS trajectories with high accuracy, independent of input data quality. Building upon the original algorithm, developed exclusively for aligning GPS signals to road networks, we extend its capabilities by integrating trajectory imputation. Our improvements also include the implementation of a distance-bounded interactive voting strategy to reduce computational complexity, as well as modifications to address missing data in the road network. Furthermore, we incorporate a custom-built asset derived from OpenStreetMap, enabling this approach to be smoothly applied in any geographic region covered by OpenStreetMap's road network. These advancements preserve the core strengths of the original algorithm while significantly extending its applicability to diverse real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, a key challenge in such approaches lies in selecting an appropriate masking strategy. Previous studies have explored predefined masking techniques, including random and tube-based masking, as well as approaches that leverage key motion priors, optical flow and semantic cues from externally pre-trained models. In this work, we introduce a novel and generalizable Trajectory-Aware Adaptive Token Sampler (TATS), which models the motion dynamics of tokens and can be seamlessly integrated into the masked autoencoder (MAE) framework to select motion-centric tokens in videos. Additionally, we propose a unified training strategy that enables joint optimization of both MAE and TATS from scratch using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). We show that our model allows for aggressive masking without compromising performance on the downstream task of action recognition while also ensuring that the pre-training remains memory efficient. Extensive experiments of the proposed approach across four benchmarks, including Something-Something v2, Kinetics-400, UCF101, and HMDB51, demonstrate the effectiveness, transferability, generalization, and efficiency of our work compared to other state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ICCVW 2025 - Long Multi-Scene Video Foundations Workshop</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Methods for Accurate Sparse Trajectory Recovery and Map Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10460v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world trajectories are often sparse with low-sampling rates (i.e., long intervals between consecutive GPS points) and misaligned with road networks, yet many applications demand high-quality data for optimal performance. To improve data quality with sparse trajectories as input, we systematically study two related research problems: trajectory recovery on road network, which aims to infer missing points to recover high-sampling trajectories, and map matching, which aims to map GPS points to road segments to determine underlying routes. In this paper, we present efficient methods TRMMA and MMA for accurate trajectory recovery and map matching, respectively, where MMA serves as the first step of TRMMA. In MMA, we carefully formulate a classification task to map a GPS point from sparse trajectories to a road segment over a small candidate segment set, rather than the entire road network. We develop techniques in MMA to generate effective embeddings that capture the patterns of GPS data, directional information, and road segments, to accurately align sparse trajectories to routes. For trajectory recovery, TRMMA focuses on the segments in the route returned by MMA to infer missing points with position ratios on road segments, producing high-sampling trajectories efficiently by avoiding evaluation of all road segments. Specifically, in TRMMA, we design a dual-transformer encoding process to cohesively capture latent patterns in trajectories and routes, and an effective decoding technique to sequentially predict the position ratios and road segments of missing points. We conduct extensive experiments to compare TRMMA and MMA with numerous existing methods for trajectory recovery and map matching, respectively, on 4 large real-world datasets. TRMMA and MMA consistently achieve the best result quality, often by a significant margin.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, accepted by 2025 IEEE 41st International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE)</p></details> |
| **[Trajectory-aware Shifted State Space Models for Online Video Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10453v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online video super-resolution (VSR) is an important technique for many real-world video processing applications, which aims to restore the current high-resolution video frame based on temporally previous frames. Most of the existing online VSR methods solely employ one neighboring previous frame to achieve temporal alignment, which limits long-range temporal modeling of videos. Recently, state space models (SSMs) have been proposed with linear computational complexity and a global receptive field, which significantly improve computational efficiency and performance. In this context, this paper presents a novel online VSR method based on Trajectory-aware Shifted SSMs (TS-Mamba), leveraging both long-term trajectory modeling and low-complexity Mamba to achieve efficient spatio-temporal information aggregation. Specifically, TS-Mamba first constructs the trajectories within a video to select the most similar tokens from the previous frames. Then, a Trajectory-aware Shifted Mamba Aggregation (TSMA) module consisting of proposed shifted SSMs blocks is employed to aggregate the selected tokens. The shifted SSMs blocks are designed based on Hilbert scannings and corresponding shift operations to compensate for scanning losses and strengthen the spatial continuity of Mamba. Additionally, we propose a trajectory-aware loss function to supervise the trajectory generation, ensuring the accuracy of token selection when training our model. Extensive experiments on three widely used VSR test datasets demonstrate that compared with six online VSR benchmark models, our TS-Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance in most cases and over 22.7\% complexity reduction (in MACs). The source code for TS-Mamba will be available at https://github.com.</p></details> |  |

The many spatial and temporal constraints make finding an initial guess for a numerical solver difficult. Graphs of Convex Sets (GCS) and the recently developed Space-Time Graphs of Convex Sets formulation (ST-GCS) enable us to generate optimal minimum distance collision-free trajectories without providing an initial guess to the solver. We also explore the derivation of general GCS-compatible constraints and document an intuitive strategy for adapting general constraints to the framework. We show that ST-GCS produces equivalent trajectories to the standard GCS formulation when the environment is static. We then show ST-GCS operating in dynamic environments to find minimum distance collision-free trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages with references, 20 figures</p></details> |

However, uncertainties introduced by inherent driving behaviors -- such as acceleration, deceleration, and left and right maneuvers -- pose significant challenges for reliable trajectory prediction. We introduce a Maneuver-Intention-Aware Transformer (MIAT) architecture, which integrates a maneuver intention awareness control mechanism with spatiotemporal interaction modeling to enhance long-horizon trajectory predictions. We systematically investigate the impact of varying awareness of maneuver intention on both short- and long-horizon trajectory predictions. Evaluated on the real-world NGSIM dataset and benchmarked against various transformer- and LSTM-based methods, our approach achieves an improvement of up to 4.7% in short-horizon predictions and a 1.6% in long-horizon predictions compared to other intention-aware benchmark methods. Moreover, by leveraging intention awareness control mechanism, MIAT realizes an 11.1% performance boost in long-horizon predictions, with a modest drop in short-horizon performance.

Despite its significance, research in this domain remains relatively limited, with most existing studies concentrating on single-modal trajectory prediction of vehicles. In this work, we propose ParkDiffusion, a novel approach that predicts the trajectories of both vehicles and pedestrians in automated parking scenarios. ParkDiffusion employs diffusion models to capture the inherent uncertainty and multi-modality of future trajectories, incorporating several key innovations. First, we propose a dual map encoder that processes soft semantic cues and hard geometric constraints using a two-step cross-attention mechanism. Second, we introduce an adaptive agent type embedding module, which dynamically conditions the prediction process on the distinct characteristics of vehicles and pedestrians. Third, to ensure kinematic feasibility, our model outputs control signals that are subsequently used within a kinematic framework to generate physically feasible trajectories. We evaluate ParkDiffusion on the Dragon Lake Parking (DLP) dataset and the Intersections Drone (inD) dataset. Our work establishes a new baseline for heterogeneous trajectory prediction in parking scenarios, outperforming existing methods by a considerable margin.</p></details> | <details><summary>IROS ...</summary><p>IROS 2025 Camera-Ready Version</p></details> |

To provide a quantitative basis for understanding these behaviours, we investigate the global dynamics of such automata and we describe a method that allows us to compute the number of all configurations leading to short attractors in a limited number of time steps. This computation yields exact results in the thermodynamic limit (as the CA grid size grows to infinity), and is based on the Transfer Matrix Method (TMM) that we adapt for our purposes. Specifically, given two parameters $(p, c)$ we are able to compute the entropy of all initial configurations converging to an attractor of size $c$ after $p$ time-steps. By calculating such statistics for various ECA rules, we establish a quantitative connection between the entropy and the qualitative Wolfram classification scheme. Class 1 rules rapidly converge to maximal entropy for stationary states ($c=1$) as $p$ increases. Class 2 rules also approach maximal entropy quickly for appropriate cycle lengths $c$, potentially requiring consideration of translations. Class 3 rules exhibit zero or low finite entropy that saturates after a short transient. Class 4 rules show finite positive entropy, similar to some Class 3 rules. This method provides a precise framework for quantifying trajectory statistics, although its exponential computational cost in $p+c$ restricts practical analysis to short trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 8 figures, 1 table, accepted to ALife 2025</p></details> |

The deformability of garments leads to a vast state space and complex dynamics, which complicates precise and fine-grained manipulation. Previous approaches often rely on predefined key points or demonstrations, limiting their generalization across diverse garment categories. This paper presents a framework, MetaFold, that disentangles task planning from action prediction, learning each independently to enhance model generalization. It employs language-guided point cloud trajectory generation for task planning and a low-level foundation model for action prediction. This structure facilitates multi-category learning, enabling the model to adapt flexibly to various user instructions and folding tasks.

In this paper, we reveals and analyze two major limitations of GRPO: (i) tokens frequently appear in completions with both positive and negative rewards, leading to conflicting gradient updates that can reduce their output probability, even though can be essential for maintaining proper structure; (ii) negatively rewarded completions may penalize confident responses and shift model decisions toward unlikely tokens, progressively flattening the output distribution and degrading learning. To address these issues and provide a more stable and effective policy optimization strategy, we introduce GTPO (Group-relative Trajectory-based Policy Optimization), which identifies conflict tokens, tokens appearing in the same position across completions with opposite rewards, protects them by skipping negative updates, while amplifying positive ones. To further prevent policy collapse, GTPO filters out completions whose entropy exceeds a provable threshold. Unlike GRPO, GTPO does not rely on KL-divergence regularization, eliminating the need for a reference model during training, while still ensuring greater training stability and improved performance, validated through multiple experiments on GSM8K, MATH and AIME 2024 benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents ESCoT, an enhanced step-based coordinate trajectory planning method for multiple car-like robots. ESCoT incorporates two key strategies: collaborative planning for local robot groups and replanning for duplicate configurations. These strategies effectively enhance the performance of step-based MVTP methods. Through extensive experiments, we show that ESCoT 1) in sparse scenarios, significantly improves solution quality compared to baseline step-based method, achieving up to 70% improvement in typical conflict scenarios and 34% in randomly generated scenarios, while maintaining high solving efficiency; and 2) in dense scenarios, outperforms all baseline methods, maintains a success rate of over 50% even in the most challenging configurations. The results demonstrate that ESCoT effectively solves MVTP, further extending the capabilities of step-based methods. Finally, practical robot tests validate the algorithm's applicability in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, it has seen limited usage in spaceflight applications due to its heavy computational demands that exceed the capability of most flight computers. In this work, we provide results on the first flight demonstration of using machine learning-based warm starts for accelerating trajectory optimization for the Astrobee free-flying robot on-board the International Space Station (ISS). We formulate a data-driven optimal control approach that trains a neural network to learn the structure of the trajectory generation problem being solved for by sequential convex programming (SCP). On-board, this trained neural network predicts solutions for the trajectory generation problem and relies on using the SCP solver to enforce safety constraints for the system. Our trained network reduces the number of solver iterations required for convergence in cases including rotational dynamics by 60% and in cases with obstacles drawn from the training distribution of the warm start model by 50%. This work represents a significant milestone in the use of learning-based control for spaceflight applications and a stepping stone for future advances in the use of machine learning for autonomous guidance, navigation, & control.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to 2025 International Conference on Space Robotics (iSpaRo).

In developing regions where access to multimodal data is limited, relying solely on onboard GPS data remains indispensable despite inherent challenges. To address this problem, we propose GSMT, a hybrid model that integrates a Graph Attention Network (GAT) with a sequence-to-sequence Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and incorporates a task corrector capable of extracting complex behavioral patterns from large-scale trajectory data. The task corrector clusters historical trajectories to identify distinct motion patterns and fine-tunes the predictions generated by the GAT and RNN. Specifically, GSMT fuses dynamic bus information and static station information through embedded hybrid networks to perform trajectory prediction, and applies the task corrector for secondary refinement after the initial predictions are generated. This two-stage approach enables multi-node trajectory prediction among buses operating in dense urban traffic environments under complex conditions. Experiments conducted on a real-world dataset from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving superior performance in both short-term and long-term trajectory prediction tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by ITSC 2025</p></details> |

We propose Follow-Your-Shape, a training-free and mask-free framework that supports precise and controllable editing of object shapes while strictly preserving non-target content. Motivated by the divergence between inversion and editing trajectories, we compute a Trajectory Divergence Map (TDM) by comparing token-wise velocity differences between the inversion and denoising paths. The TDM enables precise localization of editable regions and guides a Scheduled KV Injection mechanism that ensures stable and faithful editing. To facilitate a rigorous evaluation, we introduce ReShapeBench, a new benchmark comprising 120 new images and enriched prompt pairs specifically curated for shape-aware editing. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior editability and visual fidelity, particularly in tasks requiring large-scale shape replacement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project webpage is available at https://follow-your-shape.github.io/</p></details> |

To address this limitation, we propose the Multidimensional Adaptive Coefficient (MAC), a plug-in module for flow and diffusion models that extends conventional unidimensional coefficients to multidimensional ones and enables inference trajectory-wise adaptation. MAC is trained via simulation-based feedback through adversarial refinement. Empirical results across diverse frameworks and datasets demonstrate that MAC enhances generative quality with high training efficiency. Consequently, our work offers a new perspective on inference trajectory optimality, encouraging future research to move beyond vector field design and to leverage training-efficient, simulation-based optimization.</p></details> | ICML 2025 Paper |
| **[Capsizing-Guided Trajectory Optimization for Autonomous Navigation with Rough Terrain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08108v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is a challenging task for ground robots to autonomously navigate in harsh environments due to the presence of non-trivial obstacles and uneven terrain. This requires trajectory planning that balances safety and efficiency. The primary challenge is to generate a feasible trajectory that prevents robot from tip-over while ensuring effective navigation. In this paper, we propose a capsizing-aware trajectory planner (CAP) to achieve trajectory planning on the uneven terrain. The tip-over stability of the robot on rough terrain is analyzed. Based on the tip-over stability, we define the traversable orientation, which indicates the safe range of robot orientations. This orientation is then incorporated into a capsizing-safety constraint for trajectory optimization. We employ a graph-based solver to compute a robust and feasible trajectory while adhering to the capsizing-safety constraint. Extensive simulation and real-world experiments validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method. The results demonstrate that CAP outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, providing enhanced navigation performance on uneven terrains.</p></details> |  |
| **[AIS-LLM: A Unified Framework for Maritime Trajectory Prediction, Anomaly Detection, and Collision Risk Assessment with Explainable Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07668v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increase in maritime traffic and the mandatory implementation of the Automatic Identification System (AIS), the importance and diversity of maritime traffic analysis tasks based on AIS data, such as vessel trajectory prediction, anomaly detection, and collision risk assessment, is rapidly growing. However, existing approaches tend to address these tasks individually, making it difficult to holistically consider complex maritime situations. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework, AIS-LLM, which integrates time-series AIS data with a large language model (LLM). AIS-LLM consists of a Time-Series Encoder for processing AIS sequences, an LLM-based Prompt Encoder, a Cross-Modality Alignment Module for semantic alignment between time-series data and textual prompts, and an LLM-based Multi-Task Decoder. This architecture enables the simultaneous execution of three key tasks: trajectory prediction, anomaly detection, and risk assessment of vessel collisions within a single end-to-end system. Experimental results demonstrate that AIS-LLM outperforms existing methods across individual tasks, validating its effectiveness. Furthermore, by integratively analyzing task outputs to generate situation summaries and briefings, AIS-LLM presents the potential for more intelligent and efficient maritime traffic management.</p></details> |  |

This paper investigates the use of sequential deep learning models, including Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Transformers, for real-time flock detection in multi-pedestrian trajectories. Our proposed approach consists of a two-stage process: first, a pre-trained binary classification model is used for pairwise trajectory classification, and second, the learned representations are applied to identify multi-agent flocks dynamically. We validate our method using real-world group movement datasets, demonstrating its robustness across varying sequence lengths and diverse movement patterns. Experimental results indicate that our model consistently detects pedestrian flocks with high accuracy and stability, even in dynamic and noisy environments. Furthermore, we extend our approach to identify other forms of collective motion, such as convoys and swarms, paving the way for more comprehensive multi-agent behavior analysis.</p></details> |  |

Traditional path planner, such as Artificial Potential Field (APF), offer computational efficiency but suffer from local minima issue due to position-based potential field functions and oscillatory motion near the obstacles due to Newtonian mechanics. To address this limitation, an Energy-based Artificial Potential Field (APF) framework is proposed in this paper that integrates position and velocity-dependent potential functions. E-APF ensures dynamic adaptability and mitigates local minima, enabling uninterrupted progression toward the goal. The proposed framework integrates E-APF with a hybrid trajectory optimizer that jointly minimizes jerk and execution time under velocity and acceleration constraints, ensuring geometric smoothness and time efficiency. The entire framework is validated in simulation using the 7-degree-of-freedom Kinova Gen3 robotic manipulator. The results demonstrate collision-free, smooth, time-efficient, and oscillation-free trajectory in the presence of obstacles, highlighting the efficacy of the combined trajectory optimization and real-time obstacle avoidance approach. This work lays the foundation for future integration with reactive control strategies and physical hardware deployment in real-world manipulation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[3D Gaussian Representations with Motion Trajectory Field for Dynamic Scene Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07182v1)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the challenge of novel-view synthesis and motion reconstruction of dynamic scenes from monocular video, which is critical for many robotic applications. Although Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have demonstrated remarkable success in rendering static scenes, extending them to reconstruct dynamic scenes remains challenging. In this work, we introduce a novel approach that combines 3DGS with a motion trajectory field, enabling precise handling of complex object motions and achieving physically plausible motion trajectories. By decoupling dynamic objects from static background, our method compactly optimizes the motion trajectory field. The approach incorporates time-invariant motion coefficients and shared motion trajectory bases to capture intricate motion patterns while minimizing optimization complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results in both novel-view synthesis and motion trajectory recovery from monocular video, advancing the capabilities of dynamic scene reconstruction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Intention-Aware Diffusion Model for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07146v1)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting pedestrian motion trajectories is critical for the path planning and motion control of autonomous vehicles. Recent diffusion-based models have shown promising results in capturing the inherent stochasticity of pedestrian behavior for trajectory prediction. However, the absence of explicit semantic modelling of pedestrian intent in many diffusion-based methods may result in misinterpreted behaviors and reduced prediction accuracy. To address the above challenges, we propose a diffusion-based pedestrian trajectory prediction framework that incorporates both short-term and long-term motion intentions. Short-term intent is modelled using a residual polar representation, which decouples direction and magnitude to capture fine-grained local motion patterns. Long-term intent is estimated through a learnable, token-based endpoint predictor that generates multiple candidate goals with associated probabilities, enabling multimodal and context-aware intention modelling. Furthermore, we enhance the diffusion process by incorporating adaptive guidance and a residual noise predictor that dynamically refines denoising accuracy. The proposed framework is evaluated on the widely used ETH, UCY, and SDD benchmarks, demonstrating competitive results against state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[MultiNash-PF: A Particle Filtering Approach for Computing Multiple Local Generalized Nash Equilibria in Trajectory Games](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05554v3)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern robotic systems frequently engage in complex multi-agent interactions, many of which are inherently multi-modal, i.e., they can lead to multiple distinct outcomes. To interact effectively, robots must recognize the possible interaction modes and adapt to the one preferred by other agents. In this work, we propose MultiNash-PF, an efficient algorithm for capturing the multimodality in multi-agent interactions. We model interaction outcomes as equilibria of a game-theoretic planner, where each equilibrium corresponds to a distinct interaction mode. Our framework formulates interactive planning as Constrained Potential Trajectory Games (CPTGs), in which local Generalized Nash Equilibria (GNEs) represent plausible interaction outcomes. We propose to integrate the potential game approach with implicit particle filtering, a sample-efficient method for non-convex trajectory optimization. We utilize implicit particle filtering to identify the coarse estimates of multiple local minimizers of the game's potential function. MultiNash-PF then refines these estimates with optimization solvers, obtaining different local GNEs. We show through numerical simulations that MultiNash-PF reduces computation time by up to 50\% compared to a baseline. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in real-world human-robot interaction scenarios, where it successfully accounts for the multi-modal nature of interactions and resolves potential conflicts in real-time.</p></details> |  |

Traditional approaches treat detection and forecasting as separate sequential tasks, limiting their ability to leverage temporal cues. ForeSight addresses this limitation with a multi-task streaming and bidirectional learning approach, allowing detection and forecasting to share query memory and propagate information seamlessly. The forecast-aware detection transformer enhances spatial reasoning by integrating trajectory predictions from a multiple hypothesis forecast memory queue, while the streaming forecast transformer improves temporal consistency using past forecasts and refined detections. Unlike tracking-based methods, ForeSight eliminates the need for explicit object association, reducing error propagation with a tracking-free model that efficiently scales across multi-frame sequences. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset show that ForeSight achieves state-of-the-art performance, achieving an EPA of 54.9%, surpassing previous methods by 9.3%, while also attaining the best mAP and minADE among multi-view detection and forecasting models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025</p></details> |

This work evaluates the integration of a deep learning-based Social-Implicit (SI) pedestrian trajectory predictor within a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework on the physical Continental Corriere robot. Tested across varied pedestrian densities, the SI-MPC system is compared to a traditional Constant Velocity (CV) model in both open-loop prediction and closed-loop navigation. Results show that SI improves trajectory prediction - reducing errors by up to 76% in low-density settings - and enhances safety and motion smoothness in crowded scenes. Moreover, real-world deployment reveals discrepancies between open-loop metrics and closed-loop performance, as the SI model yields broader, more cautious predictions. These findings emphasize the importance of system-level evaluation and highlight the SI-MPC framework's promise for safer, more adaptive navigation in dynamic, human-populated environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[H2C: Hippocampal Circuit-inspired Continual Learning for Lifelong Trajectory Prediction in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01158v2)** | 2025-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning (DL) has shown state-of-the-art performance in trajectory prediction, which is critical to safe navigation in autonomous driving (AD). However, most DL-based methods suffer from catastrophic forgetting, where adapting to a new distribution may cause significant performance degradation in previously learned ones. Such inability to retain learned knowledge limits their applicability in the real world, where AD systems need to operate across varying scenarios with dynamic distributions. As revealed by neuroscience, the hippocampal circuit plays a crucial role in memory replay, effectively reconstructing learned knowledge based on limited resources. Inspired by this, we propose a hippocampal circuit-inspired continual learning method (H2C) for trajectory prediction across varying scenarios. H2C retains prior knowledge by selectively recalling a small subset of learned samples. First, two complementary strategies are developed to select the subset to represent learned knowledge. Specifically, one strategy maximizes inter-sample diversity to represent the distinctive knowledge, and the other estimates the overall knowledge by equiprobable sampling. Then, H2C updates via a memory replay loss function calculated by these selected samples to retain knowledge while learning new data. Experiments based on various scenarios from the INTERACTION dataset are designed to evaluate H2C. Experimental results show that H2C reduces catastrophic forgetting of DL baselines by 22.71% on average in a task-free manner, without relying on manually informed distributional shifts. The implementation is available at https://github.com/BIT-Jack/H2C-lifelong.</p></details> | <details><summary>Open ...</summary><p>Open source code: https://github.com/BIT-Jack/H2C-lifelong</p></details> |
| **[Zero-Shot Cellular Trajectory Map Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06674v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cellular Trajectory Map-Matching (CTMM) aims to align cellular location sequences to road networks, which is a necessary preprocessing in location-based services on web platforms like Google Maps, including navigation and route optimization. Current approaches mainly rely on ID-based features and region-specific data to learn correlations between cell towers and roads, limiting their adaptability to unexplored areas. To enable high-accuracy CTMM without additional training in target regions, Zero-shot CTMM requires to extract not only region-adaptive features, but also sequential and location uncertainty to alleviate positioning errors in cellular data. In this paper, we propose a pixel-based trajectory calibration assistant for zero-shot CTMM, which takes advantage of transferable geospatial knowledge to calibrate pixelated trajectory, and then guide the path-finding process at the road network level. To enhance knowledge sharing across similar regions, a Gaussian mixture model is incorporated into VAE, enabling the identification of scenario-adaptive experts through soft clustering. To mitigate high positioning errors, a spatial-temporal awareness module is designed to capture sequential features and location uncertainty, thereby facilitating the inference of approximate user positions. Finally, a constrained path-finding algorithm is employed to reconstruct the road ID sequence, ensuring topological validity within the road network. This process is guided by the calibrated trajectory while optimizing for the shortest feasible path, thus minimizing unnecessary detours. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms existing methods in zero-shot CTMM by 16.8\%.</p></details> |  |

To overcome these challenges, we present the Neural-Enhanced Trajectory Planner (NEO-Planner), a novel approach that leverages a Neural Network (NN) Planner to provide informed initial values for trajectory optimization. The NN-Planner is trained on a dataset generated by an expert planner using batch sampling, capturing multimodal trajectory solutions. It learns to predict spatial and temporal parameters for trajectories directly from raw sensor observations. NEO-Planner starts optimization from these predictions, accelerating computation speed while maintaining explainability. Furthermore, we introduce a robust online replanning framework that accommodates planning latency for smooth trajectory tracking. Extensive simulations demonstrate that NEO-Planner reduces optimization iterations by 20%, leading to a 26% decrease in computation time compared with pure optimization-based methods. It maintains trajectory quality comparable to baseline approaches and generalizes well to unseen environments. Real-world experiments validate its effectiveness for autonomous drone navigation in cluttered, unknown environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IROS 2025.

An essentially equivalent viewpoint arises through stability analysis of a linear differential inclusion (LDI) encompassing the incremental behavior of the system. In this note, we use contraction tools to study the exponential stability of a system to a particular known trajectory, deriving a new LDI characterizing the error between arbitrary trajectories and this known trajectory. As with classical contraction analysis, this new inclusion is constructed via first partial derivatives of the system's vector field, and convergence rates are obtained with familiar tools: uniform bounding of the logarithmic norm and LMI-based Lyapunov conditions. Our LDI is guaranteed to outperform a usual contraction analysis in two special circumstances: i) when the bound on the logarithmic norm arises from an interval overapproximation of the Jacobian matrix, and ii) when the norm considered is the $\ell_1$ norm. Finally, we demonstrate how the proposed approach strictly improves an existing framework for ellipsoidal reachable set computation.</p></details> |  |
| **[SwiftVideo: A Unified Framework for Few-Step Video Generation through Trajectory-Distribution Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06082v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based or flow-based models have achieved significant progress in video synthesis but require multiple iterative sampling steps, which incurs substantial computational overhead. While many distillation methods that are solely based on trajectory-preserving or distribution-matching have been developed to accelerate video generation models, these approaches often suffer from performance breakdown or increased artifacts under few-step settings. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{\emph{SwiftVideo}}, a unified and stable distillation framework that combines the advantages of trajectory-preserving and distribution-matching strategies. Our approach introduces continuous-time consistency distillation to ensure precise preservation of ODE trajectories. Subsequently, we propose a dual-perspective alignment that includes distribution alignment between synthetic and real data along with trajectory alignment across different inference steps. Our method maintains high-quality video generation while substantially reducing the number of inference steps. Quantitative evaluations on the OpenVid-1M benchmark demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in few-step video generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trustworthy Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction via Pattern-Aware Interaction Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13397v2)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and reliable pedestrian trajectory prediction is critical for the safety and robustness of intelligent applications, yet achieving trustworthy prediction remains highly challenging due to the complexity of interactions among pedestrians. Previous methods often adopt black-box modeling of pedestrian interactions, treating all neighbors uniformly. Despite their strong performance, such opaque modeling limits the reliability of predictions in safety-critical real-world deployments. To address this issue, we propose InSyn (Interaction-Synchronization Network), a novel Transformer-based model that explicitly captures diverse interaction patterns (e.g., walking in sync or conflicting) while effectively modeling direction-sensitive social behaviors. Additionally, we introduce a training strategy, termed Seq-Start of Seq (SSOS), designed to alleviate the common issue of initial-step divergence in numerical time-series prediction. Experiments on the ETH and UCY datasets demonstrate that our model not only outperforms recent black-box baselines in prediction accuracy, especially under high-density scenarios, but also provides stronger interpretability, achieving a favorable trade-off between reliability and accuracy. Furthermore, the SSOS strategy proves to be effective in improving sequential prediction performance, reducing the initial-step prediction error by approximately 6.58%.</p></details> |  |

To enhance the robustness of trajectory planning under environmental disturbances, this paper presents a disturbance-aware planning framework that incorporates real-time disturbance estimation into both path searching and trajectory optimization. A key component of the framework is a disturbance-adaptive safety boundary adjustment mechanism, which dynamically modifies the vehicle's feasible dynamic boundaries based on estimated disturbances to ensure trajectory feasibility. Leveraging the dynamics model of the bimodal vehicle, the proposed approach achieves adaptive and reliable motion planning across different terrains and operating conditions. A series of real-world experiments and benchmark comparisons on a custom-built platform validate the effectiveness and robustness of the method, demonstrating improvements in tracking accuracy, task efficiency, and energy performance under both ground and aerial disturbances.</p></details> |  |

Traditional heuristics based on handcrafted rules often lack accuracy and generalizability. Although deep learning approaches offer improved performance, they typically suffer from high computational cost, limited explainability, and, importantly, poor generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. In this paper, we introduce TrajEvo, a framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically design trajectory prediction heuristics. TrajEvo employs an evolutionary algorithm to generate and refine prediction heuristics from past trajectory data. We propose two key innovations: Cross-Generation Elite Sampling to encourage population diversity, and a Statistics Feedback Loop that enables the LLM to analyze and improve alternative predictions. Our evaluations demonstrate that TrajEvo outperforms existing heuristic methods across multiple real-world datasets, and notably surpasses both heuristic and deep learning methods in generalizing to an unseen OOD real-world dataset. TrajEvo marks a promising step toward the automated design of fast, explainable, and generalizable trajectory prediction heuristics.

To address this critical gap, we introduce NaturalGAIA, a novel benchmark engineered on the principle of Causal Pathways. This design paradigm structures complex tasks into a series of programmatically verifiable atomic steps, ensuring a rigorous, fully automated, and reproducible standard for assessment. Concurrently, to mitigate the inherent capability deficits of agents, we developed LightManus, a hierarchical agent architecture specifically optimized for long-horizon tasks. We leveraged this agent to generate a high-quality, human-verified trajectory dataset that uniquely captures diverse and even self-correcting interaction patterns of LLMs. We then utilized this dataset to perform Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) on the Qwen2.5-VL-7B model. Our experiments reveal that NaturalGAIA presents a formidable challenge to current state-of-the-art LLMs; even the top-performing Claude-sonnet-4 achieved a Weighted Pathway Success Rate (WPSR) of only 34.6%. Moreover, while RFT substantially improved the smaller model's GUI execution capabilities (WPSR increased from 3.3% to 10.8%), its performance degraded sharply when handling complex scenarios. This outcome highlights the inherent capability ceiling of smaller models when faced with comprehensive tasks that integrate perception, decision-making, and execution. This research contributes a rigorous evaluation standard and a high-quality dataset to the community, aiming to guide the future development of GUI agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unified Linear Parametric Map Modeling and Perception-aware Trajectory Planning for Mobile Robotics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09340v2)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous navigation in mobile robots, reliant on perception and planning, faces major hurdles in large-scale, complex environments. These include heavy computational burdens for mapping, sensor occlusion failures for UAVs, and traversal challenges on irregular terrain for UGVs, all compounded by a lack of perception-aware strategies. To address these challenges, we introduce Random Mapping and Random Projection (RMRP). This method constructs a lightweight linear parametric map by first mapping data to a high-dimensional space, followed by a sparse random projection for dimensionality reduction. Our novel Residual Energy Preservation Theorem provides theoretical guarantees for this process, ensuring critical geometric properties are preserved. Based on this map, we propose the RPATR (Robust Perception-Aware Trajectory Planner) framework. For UAVs, our method unifies grid and Euclidean Signed Distance Field (ESDF) maps. The front-end uses an analytical occupancy gradient to refine initial paths for safety and smoothness, while the back-end uses a closed-form ESDF for trajectory optimization. Leveraging the trained RMRP model's generalization, the planner predicts unobserved areas for proactive navigation. For UGVs, the model characterizes terrain and provides closed-form gradients, enabling online planning to circumvent large holes. Validated in diverse scenarios, our framework demonstrates superior mapping performance in time, memory, and accuracy, and enables computationally efficient, safe navigation for high-speed UAVs and UGVs. The code will be released to foster community collaboration.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Theory and Practice of GRPO: A Trajectory-Corrected Approach with Fast Convergence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02833v2)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), recently proposed by DeepSeek, is a critic-free reinforcement learning algorithm for fine tuning large language models. It replaces the value function in Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with group normalized rewards, while retaining PPO style token level importance sampling based on an old policy. We show that GRPO update rule in fact estimates the policy gradient at the old policy rather than the current one. However, since the old policy is refreshed every few steps, the discrepancy between the two remains small limiting the impact of this bias in practice. We validate this through an ablation study in which importance sampling is entirely removed, and updates are instead performed using the gradient estimated at a fixed old policy across multiple optimization steps. Remarkably, this simplification results in performance comparable to standard GRPO. Motivated by these findings, we propose a new algorithm: Trajectory level Importance Corrected GRPO (TIC GRPO). TIC GRPO replaces token level importance ratios with a single trajectory level probability ratio, yielding an unbiased estimate of the current policy gradient while preserving the critic free structure. Furthermore, we present the first theoretical convergence analysis for GRPO style methods, covering both the original GRPO and our proposed variant.</p></details> | 12 pages |

Previous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of various prompting strategies in aiding LLMs in reasoning (called "reasoning actions"), such as step-by-step thinking, reflecting before answering, solving with programs, and their combinations. However, these approaches often applied static, predefined reasoning actions uniformly to all questions, without considering the specific characteristics of each question or the capability of the task-solving LLM. In this paper, we propose DOTS, an approach enabling LLMs to reason dynamically via optimal reasoning trajectory search, tailored to the specific characteristics of each question and the inherent capability of the task-solving LLM. Our approach involves three key steps: i) defining atomic reasoning action modules that can be composed into various reasoning action trajectories; ii) searching for the optimal action trajectory for each training question through iterative exploration and evaluation for the specific task-solving LLM; and iii) using the collected optimal trajectories to train an LLM to plan for the reasoning trajectories of unseen questions. In particular, we propose two learning paradigms, i.e., fine-tuning an external LLM as a planner to guide the task-solving LLM, or directly fine-tuning the task-solving LLM with an internalized capability for reasoning actions planning. Our experiments across eight reasoning tasks show that our method consistently outperforms static reasoning techniques and the vanilla instruction tuning approach. Further analysis reveals that our method enables LLMs to adjust their computation based on problem complexity, allocating deeper thinking and reasoning to harder problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025</p></details> |

This paper proposes a hybrid trajectory planning framework that integrates the adaptability of learning-based methods with the formal safety guarantees of optimization-based approaches. The framework features a two-layer architecture: an upper layer employing a graph neural network (GNN) trained on real-world highway data to predict human-like longitudinal velocity profiles, and a lower layer utilizing path optimization formulated as a mixed-integer quadratic programming (MIQP) problem. The primary contribution is the lower-layer path optimization model, which introduces a linear approximation of discretized vehicle geometry to substantially reduce computational complexity, while enforcing strict spatiotemporal non-overlapping constraints to formally guarantee collision avoidance throughout the planning horizon. Experimental results demonstrate that the planner generates highly smooth, collision-free trajectories in complex real-world emergency scenarios, achieving success rates exceeding 97% with average planning times of 54 ms, thereby confirming real-time capability.</p></details> |  |

However, accurately forecasting crowd trajectories remains a challenging task due to the inherently multimodal and uncertain nature of human motion. Recent diffusion-based models have shown promising results in capturing the stochasticity of pedestrian behavior for trajectory prediction. However, few diffusion-based approaches explicitly incorporate the underlying motion intentions of pedestrians, which can limit the interpretability and precision of prediction models. In this work, we propose a diffusion-based multimodal trajectory prediction model that incorporates pedestrians' motion intentions into the prediction framework. The motion intentions are decomposed into lateral and longitudinal components, and a pedestrian intention recognition module is introduced to enable the model to effectively capture these intentions. Furthermore, we adopt an efficient guidance mechanism that facilitates the generation of interpretable trajectories. The proposed framework is evaluated on two widely used human trajectory prediction benchmarks, ETH and UCY, on which it is compared against state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be presented at the 28th IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC), 2025</p></details> |

Most community models and datasets in the T2V domain are designed for single-object motion, limiting the performance of current generative models in multi-object tasks. Additionally, existing motion control methods in T2V either lack support for multi-object motion scenes or experience severe performance degradation when object trajectories intersect, primarily due to the semantic conflicts in colliding regions. To address these limitations, we introduce LayerT2V, the first approach for generating video by compositing background and foreground objects layer by layer. This layered generation enables flexible integration of multiple independent elements within a video, positioning each element on a distinct "layer" and thus facilitating coherent multi-object synthesis while enhancing control over the generation process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of LayerT2V in generating complex multi-object scenarios, showcasing 1.4x and 4.5x improvements in mIoU and AP50 metrics over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

| **[LSD-3D: Large-Scale 3D Driving Scene Generation with Geometry Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19204v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale scene data is essential for training and testing in robot learning. Neural reconstruction methods have promised the capability of reconstructing large physically-grounded outdoor scenes from captured sensor data. However, these methods have baked-in static environments and only allow for limited scene control -- they are functionally constrained in scene and trajectory diversity by the captures from which they are reconstructed. In contrast, generating driving data with recent image or video diffusion models offers control, however, at the cost of geometry grounding and causality. In this work, we aim to bridge this gap and present a method that directly generates large-scale 3D driving scenes with accurate geometry, allowing for causal novel view synthesis with object permanence and explicit 3D geometry estimation. The proposed method combines the generation of a proxy geometry and environment representation with score distillation from learned 2D image priors. We find that this approach allows for high controllability, enabling the prompt-guided geometry and high-fidelity texture and structure that can be conditioned on map layouts -- producing realistic and geometrically consistent 3D generations of complex driving scenes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project webpage: https://light.princeton.edu/LSD-3D</p></details> |

However, the standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) approach, which relies on large-scale datasets, often overlooks task-specific characteristics in tool use, leading to performance bottlenecks. To address this issue, we analyze three existing LLMs and uncover key insights: training data can inadvertently impede tool-use behavior, token importance is distributed unevenly, and errors in tool calls fall into a small set of categories. Building on these findings, we propose~\emph{TL-Training}, a task-feature-based framework that mitigates the effects of suboptimal training data, dynamically adjusts token weights to prioritize key tokens during SFT, and incorporates a robust reward mechanism tailored to error categories, optimized through proximal policy optimization. We validate TL-Training by training CodeLLaMA-2-7B and evaluating it on four open-source test sets. Our results demonstrate that the LLM trained by our method matches or surpasses both open- and closed-source LLMs in tool-use performance using only 1,217 training data points. Additionally, our method enhances robustness in noisy environments and improves general task performance, offering a scalable and efficient paradigm for tool-use training in LLMs. Code and data are available at https://github.com/Junjie-Ye/TL-Training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Federated Fine-Tuning of Sparsely-Activated Large Language Models on Resource-Constrained Devices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19078v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated fine-tuning of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based large language models (LLMs) is challenging due to their massive computational requirements and the resource constraints of participants. Existing working attempts to fill this gap through model quantization, computation offloading, or expert pruning. However, they cannot achieve desired performance due to impractical system assumptions and a lack of consideration for MoE-specific characteristics. In this paper, we propose FLUX, a system designed to enable federated fine-tuning of MoE-based LLMs across participants with constrained computing resources (e.g., consumer-grade GPUs), aiming to minimize time-to-accuracy. FLUX introduces three key innovations: (1) quantization-based local profiling to estimate expert activation with minimal overhead, (2) adaptive layer-aware expert merging to reduce resource consumption while preserving accuracy, and (3) dynamic expert role assignment using an exploration-exploitation strategy to balance tuning and non-tuning experts. Extensive experiments on LLaMA-MoE and DeepSeek-MoE with multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that FLUX significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving up to 4.75X speedup in time-to-accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EuroSys'26.

| **[Large Language Model Aided QoS Prediction for Service Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02223v3)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have seen rapid improvement in the recent years, and have been used in a wider range of applications. After being trained on large text corpus, LLMs obtain the capability of extracting rich features from textual data. Such capability is potentially useful for the web service recommendation task, where the web users and services have intrinsic attributes that can be described using natural language sentences and are useful for recommendation. In this paper, we explore the possibility and practicality of using LLMs for web service recommendation. We propose the large language model aided QoS prediction (llmQoS) model, which use LLMs to extract useful information from attributes of web users and services via descriptive sentences. This information is then used in combination with the QoS values of historical interactions of users and services, to predict QoS values for any given user-service pair. On the WSDream dataset, llmQoS is shown to overcome the data sparsity issue inherent to the QoS prediction problem, and outperforms comparable baseline models consistently.</p></details> |  |
| **[Investigating Advanced Reasoning of Large Language Models via Black-Box Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19035v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing tasks fall short in evaluating reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in an interactive, unknown environment. This deficiency leads to the isolated assessment of deductive, inductive, and abductive reasoning, neglecting the integrated reasoning process that is indispensable for humans discovery of real world. We introduce a novel evaluation paradigm, \textit{black-box interaction}, to tackle this challenge. A black-box is defined by a hidden function that maps a specific set of inputs to outputs. LLMs are required to unravel the hidden function behind the black-box by interacting with it in given exploration turns, and reasoning over observed input-output pairs. Leveraging this idea, we build the \textsc{Oracle} benchmark which comprises 6 types of black-box task and 96 black-boxes. 19 modern LLMs are benchmarked. o3 ranks first in 5 of the 6 tasks, achieving over 70\% accuracy on most easy black-boxes. But it still struggles with some hard black-box tasks, where its average performance drops below 40\%. Further analysis indicates a universal difficulty among LLMs: They lack the high-level planning capability to develop efficient and adaptive exploration strategies for hypothesis refinement.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interleaving Large Language Models for Compiler Testing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18955v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Testing compilers with AI models, especially large language models (LLMs), has shown great promise. However, current approaches struggle with two key problems: The generated programs for testing compilers are often too simple, and extensive testing with the LLMs is computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose a novel compiler testing framework that decouples the testing process into two distinct phases: an offline phase and an online phase. In the offline phase, we use LLMs to generate a collection of small but feature-rich code pieces. In the online phase, we reuse these code pieces by strategically combining them to build high-quality and valid test programs, which are then used to test compilers. We implement this idea in a tool, LegoFuzz, for testing C compilers. The results are striking: we found 66 bugs in GCC and LLVM, the most widely used C compilers. Almost half of the bugs are miscompilation bugs, which are serious and hard-to-find bugs that none of the existing LLM-based tools could find. We believe this efficient design opens up new possibilities for using AI models in software testing beyond just C compilers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Integrating Large Language Model for Improved Causal Discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16902v2)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recovering the structure of causal graphical models from observational data is an essential yet challenging task for causal discovery in scientific scenarios. Domain-specific causal discovery usually relies on expert validation or prior analysis to improve the reliability of recovered causality, which is yet limited by the scarcity of expert resources. Recently, Large Language Models (LLM) have been used for causal analysis across various domain-specific scenarios, suggesting its potential as autonomous expert roles in guiding data-based structure learning. However, integrating LLMs into causal discovery faces challenges due to inaccuracies in LLM-based reasoning on revealing the actual causal structure. To address this challenge, we propose an error-tolerant LLM-driven causal discovery framework. The error-tolerant mechanism is designed three-fold with sufficient consideration on potential inaccuracies. In the LLM-based reasoning process, an accuracy-oriented prompting strategy restricts causal analysis to a reliable range. Next, a knowledge-to-structure transition aligns LLM-derived causal statements with structural causal interactions. In the structure learning process, the goodness-of-fit to data and adherence to LLM-derived priors are balanced to further address prior inaccuracies. Evaluation of eight real-world causal structures demonstrates the efficacy of our LLM-driven approach in improving data-based causal discovery, along with its robustness to inaccurate LLM-derived priors.

The large number of EVs facilitates the development of the emerging vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology, which realizes bidirectional energy exchanges between EVs and the power grid. This has led to the setting up of electricity markets that are usually confined to a small geographical location, often with a small number of participants. Usually, these markets are manipulated by intermediaries responsible for collecting bids from prosumers, determining the market-clearing price, incorporating grid constraints, and accounting for network losses. While centralized models can be highly efficient, they grant excessive power to the intermediary by allowing them to gain exclusive access to prosumers \textquotesingle price preferences. This opens the door to potential market manipulation and raises significant privacy concerns for users, such as the location of energy providers. This lack of protection exposes users to potential risks, as untrustworthy servers and malicious adversaries can exploit this information to infer trading activities and real identities. This work proposes a secure, decentralized exchange market built on blockchain technology, utilizing a privacy-preserving Automated Market Maker (AMM) model to offer open and fair, and equal access to traders, and mitigates the most common trading-manipulation attacks. Additionally, it incorporates a scalable architecture based on geographical dynamic sharding, allowing for efficient resource allocation and improved performance as the market grows.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 7 figures, 1 table, 1 algorithm, Paper accepted in 27th MSWiM Conference</p></details> |

Unlike conventional image captioning and retrieval datasets that focus on surface-level descriptions, OpenEvents V1 dataset emphasizes contextual and temporal grounding through three primary tasks: (1) generating rich, event-aware image captions, (2) retrieving event-relevant news articles from image queries, and (3) retrieving event-relevant images from narrative-style textual queries. The dataset comprises over 200,000 news articles and 400,000 associated images sourced from CNN and The Guardian, spanning diverse domains and time periods. We provide extensive baseline results and standardized evaluation protocols for all tasks. OpenEvents V1 establishes a robust foundation for developing multimodal AI systems capable of deep reasoning over complex real-world events.

| **[Interactive Evaluation of Large Language Models for Multi-Requirement Software Engineering Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18905v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Standard single-turn, static benchmarks fall short in evaluating the nuanced capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) on complex tasks such as software engineering. In this work, we propose a novel interactive evaluation framework that assesses LLMs on multi-requirement programming tasks through structured, feedback-driven dialogue. Each task is modeled as a requirement dependency graph, and an ``interviewer'' LLM, aware of the ground-truth solution, provides minimal, targeted hints to an ``interviewee'' model to help correct errors and fulfill target constraints. This dynamic protocol enables fine-grained diagnostic insights into model behavior, uncovering strengths and systematic weaknesses that static benchmarks fail to measure. We build on DevAI, a benchmark of 55 curated programming tasks, by adding ground-truth solutions and evaluating the relevance and utility of interviewer hints through expert annotation. Our results highlight the importance of dynamic evaluation in advancing the development of collaborative code-generating agents.</p></details> |  |

Despite advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) that enhance automated reasoning, their application to misinformation detection remains hindered by issues of logical inconsistency and superficial verification. In response, we introduce Debate-to-Detect (D2D), a novel Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) framework that reformulates misinformation detection as a structured adversarial debate. Inspired by fact-checking workflows, D2D assigns domain-specific profiles to each agent and orchestrates a five-stage debate process, including Opening Statement, Rebuttal, Free Debate, Closing Statement, and Judgment. To transcend traditional binary classification, D2D introduces a multi-dimensional evaluation mechanism that assesses each claim across five distinct dimensions: Factuality, Source Reliability, Reasoning Quality, Clarity, and Ethics. Experiments with GPT-4o on two datasets demonstrate significant improvements over baseline methods, and the case study highlight D2D's capability to iteratively refine evidence while improving decision transparency, representing a substantial advancement towards interpretable misinformation detection. The code will be released publicly after the official publication.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted to EMNLP 2025 (Main Conference)</p></details> |
| **[ConfTuner: Training Large Language Models to Express Their Confidence Verbally](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18847v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains such as science, law, and healthcare, where accurate expressions of uncertainty are essential for reliability and trust. However, current LLMs are often observed to generate incorrect answers with high confidence, a phenomenon known as "overconfidence". Recent efforts have focused on calibrating LLMs' verbalized confidence: i.e., their expressions of confidence in text form, such as "I am 80% confident that...". Existing approaches either rely on prompt engineering or fine-tuning with heuristically generated uncertainty estimates, both of which have limited effectiveness and generalizability. Motivated by the notion of proper scoring rules for calibration in classical machine learning models, we introduce ConfTuner, a simple and efficient fine-tuning method that introduces minimal overhead and does not require ground-truth confidence scores or proxy confidence estimates. ConfTuner relies on a new loss function, tokenized Brier score, which we theoretically prove to be a proper scoring rule, intuitively meaning that it "correctly incentivizes the model to report its true probability of being correct". ConfTuner improves calibration across diverse reasoning tasks and generalizes to black-box models such as GPT-4o. Our results further show that better-calibrated confidence enables downstream gains in self-correction and model cascade, advancing the development of trustworthy LLM systems. The code is available at https://github.com/liushiliushi/ConfTuner.</p></details> |  |
| **[Arrows of Math Reasoning Data Synthesis for Large Language Models: Diversity, Complexity and Correctness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18824v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enhancing the mathematical reasoning of large language models (LLMs) demands high-quality training data, yet conventional methods face critical challenges in scalability, cost, and data reliability. To address these limitations, we propose a novel program-assisted synthesis framework that systematically generates a high-quality mathematical corpus with guaranteed diversity, complexity, and correctness. This framework integrates mathematical knowledge systems and domain-specific tools to create executable programs. These programs are then translated into natural language problem-solution pairs and vetted by a bilateral validation mechanism that verifies solution correctness against program outputs and ensures program-problem consistency. We have generated 12.3 million such problem-solving triples. Experiments demonstrate that models fine-tuned on our data significantly improve their inference capabilities, achieving state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets and showcasing the effectiveness of our synthesis approach.</p></details> |  |

These methods exhibited excellent generalization capabilities in instruction understanding and task reasoning. However, they were constrained by the fixed knowledge bases and reasoning abilities of LLMs, preventing fully incorporating experiential knowledge and thus resulting in a lack of efficient evolutionary capacity. To address this, we drew inspiration from the evolution capabilities of natural agents, and proposed a self-evolving VLN framework (SE-VLN) to endow VLN agents with the ability to continuously evolve during testing. To the best of our knowledge, it was the first time that an multimodal LLM-powered self-evolving VLN framework was proposed. Specifically, SE-VLN comprised three core modules, i.e., a hierarchical memory module to transfer successful and failure cases into reusable knowledge, a retrieval-augmented thought-based reasoning module to retrieve experience and enable multi-step decision-making, and a reflection module to realize continual evolution. Comprehensive tests illustrated that the SE-VLN achieved navigation success rates of 57% and 35.2% in unseen environments, representing absolute performance improvements of 23.9% and 15.0% over current state-of-the-art methods on R2R and REVERSE datasets, respectively. Moreover, the SE-VLN showed performance improvement with increasing experience repository, elucidating its great potential as a self-evolving agent framework for VLN.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dimension Reduction for Large-Scale Federated Data: Statistical Rate and Asymptotic Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06857v2)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In light of the rapidly growing large-scale data in federated ecosystems, the traditional principal component analysis (PCA) is often not applicable due to privacy protection considerations and large computational burden. Algorithms were proposed to lower the computational cost, but few can handle both high dimensionality and massive sample size under distributed settings. In this paper, we propose the FAst DIstributed (FADI) PCA method for federated data when both the dimension $d$ and the sample size $n$ are ultra-large, by simultaneously performing parallel computing along $d$ and distributed computing along $n$. Specifically, we utilize $L$ parallel copies of $p$-dimensional fast sketches to divide the computing burden along $d$ and aggregate the results distributively along the split samples. We present a general framework applicable to multiple statistical problems, and establish comprehensive theoretical results under the general framework. We show that FADI accelerates the computation while enjoying the same non-asymptotic error rate as the traditional PCA when $Lp \ge d$. We also derive inferential results that characterize the asymptotic distribution of FADI, and show a phase-transition phenomenon as $Lp$ increases. We perform extensive simulations to empirically validate our theoretical findings, and apply FADI to the 1000 Genomes data to study the population structure.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce a novel social simulator called YuLan-OneSim. Compared to previous works, YuLan-OneSim distinguishes itself in five key aspects: (1) Code-free scenario construction: Users can simply describe and refine their simulation scenarios through natural language interactions with our simulator. All simulation code is automatically generated, significantly reducing the need for programming expertise. (2) Comprehensive default scenarios: We implement 50 default simulation scenarios spanning 8 domains, including economics, sociology, politics, psychology, organization, demographics, law, and communication, broadening access for a diverse range of social researchers. (3) Evolvable simulation: Our simulator is capable of receiving external feedback and automatically fine-tuning the backbone LLMs, significantly enhancing the simulation quality. (4) Large-scale simulation: By developing a fully responsive agent framework and a distributed simulation architecture, our simulator can handle up to 100,000 agents, ensuring more stable and reliable simulation results. (5) AI social researcher: Leveraging the above features, we develop an AI social researcher. Users only need to propose a research topic, and the AI researcher will automatically analyze the input, construct simulation environments, summarize results, generate technical reports, review and refine the reports--completing the social science research loop. To demonstrate the advantages of YuLan-OneSim, we conduct experiments to evaluate the quality of the automatically generated scenarios, the reliability, efficiency, and scalability of the simulation process, as well as the performance of the AI social researcher.</p></details> |  |

Recent proprietary systems like OpenAI's gpt-oss series have introduced discrete operational modes for intuitive reasoning control, but the open-source community has largely failed to achieve such capabilities. In this paper, we introduce ThinkDial, the first open-recipe end-to-end framework that successfully implements gpt-oss-style controllable reasoning through discrete operational modes. Our system enables seamless switching between three distinct reasoning regimes: High mode (full reasoning capability), Medium mode (50 percent token reduction with <10 percent performance degradation), and Low mode (75 percent token reduction with <15 percent performance degradation). We achieve this through an end-to-end training paradigm that integrates budget-mode control throughout the entire pipeline: budget-mode supervised fine-tuning that embeds controllable reasoning capabilities directly into the learning process, and two-phase budget-aware reinforcement learning with adaptive reward shaping. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ThinkDial achieves target compression-performance trade-offs with clear response length reductions while maintaining performance thresholds. The framework also exhibits strong generalization capabilities on out-of-distribution tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, some questions posed to LRMs are inherently unanswerable, such as math problems lacking sufficient conditions. We find that LRMs continually fail to provide appropriate abstentions when confronted with these unanswerable questions. In this paper, we systematically analyze, investigate, and resolve this issue for trustworthy AI. We first conduct a detailed analysis of the distinct response behaviors of LRMs when facing unanswerable questions. Then, we show that LRMs possess sufficient cognitive capabilities to recognize the flaws in these questions. However, they fail to exhibit appropriate abstention behavior, revealing a misalignment between their internal cognition and external response. Finally, to resolve this issue, we propose a lightweight, two-stage method that combines cognitive monitoring with inference-time intervention. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the abstention rate while maintaining the overall reasoning performance.</p></details> |  |

Text-to-SQL approaches have shown promising performance on benchmark data; however, they inherit SQL's drawbacks, including inefficiency with large datasets and limited support for complex data analyses beyond basic querying. We propose a novel framework that transforms natural language queries into query plans. Our solution is implemented outside traditional databases, allowing us to support classical SQL commands while avoiding SQL's inherent limitations. Additionally, we enable complex analytical functions, such as principal component analysis and anomaly detection, providing greater flexibility and extensibility than traditional SQL capabilities. We leverage LLMs to iteratively interpret queries and construct operation sequences, addressing computational complexity by incrementally building solutions. By executing operations directly on the data, we overcome context length limitations without requiring the entire dataset to be processed by the model. We validate our framework through experiments on both standard databases and large scientific tables, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling extensive datasets and performing sophisticated data analyses.</p></details> |  |

Current approaches primarily optimize language models for headline quality or click-through rates (CTR), often overlooking the need for diversity and resulting in homogeneous outputs. To address this limitation, we propose DIVER, a novel framework based on large language models (LLMs) that are jointly optimized for both diversity and quality. We first design a semantic- and stylistic-aware data generation pipeline that automatically produces high-quality training pairs with ad content and multiple diverse headlines. To achieve the goal of generating high-quality and diversified ad headlines within a single forward pass, we propose a multi-stage multi-objective optimization framework with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). Experiments on real-world industrial datasets demonstrate that DIVER effectively balances quality and diversity. Deployed on a large-scale content-sharing platform serving hundreds of millions of users, our framework improves advertiser value (ADVV) and CTR by 4.0% and 1.4%.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods for MLLMs are frequently subject-specific, demanding a data-intensive fine-tuning process for every new subject, which limits their scalability. In this paper, we introduce MM-R1, a framework that integrates a cross-modal Chain-of-Thought (X-CoT) reasoning strategy to unlock the inherent potential of unified MLLMs for personalized image generation. Specifically, we structure personalization as an integrated visual reasoning and generation process: (1) grounding subject concepts by interpreting and understanding user-provided images and contextual cues, and (2) generating personalized images conditioned on both the extracted subject representations and user prompts. To further enhance the reasoning capability, we adopt Grouped Reward Proximal Policy Optimization (GRPO) to explicitly align the generation. Experiments demonstrate that MM-R1 unleashes the personalization capability of unified MLLMs to generate images with high subject fidelity and strong text alignment in a zero-shot manner.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we reveal a critical safety inconsistency: LLMs can more effectively identify harmful requests as discriminators than defend against them as generators. This insight inspires us to explore aligning the model's inherent discrimination and generation capabilities. To this end, we propose SDGO (Self-Discrimination-Guided Optimization), a reinforcement learning framework that leverages the model's own discrimination capabilities as a reward signal to enhance generation safety through iterative self-improvement. Our method does not require any additional annotated data or external models during the training phase. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SDGO significantly improves model safety compared to both prompt-based and training-based baselines while maintaining helpfulness on general benchmarks. By aligning LLMs' discrimination and generation capabilities, SDGO brings robust performance against out-of-distribution (OOD) jailbreaking attacks. This alignment achieves tighter coupling between these two capabilities, enabling the model's generation capability to be further enhanced with only a small amount of discriminative samples.

CMPhysBench is composed of more than 520 graduate-level meticulously curated questions covering both representative subfields and foundational theoretical frameworks of condensed matter physics, such as magnetism, superconductivity, strongly correlated systems, etc. To ensure a deep understanding of the problem-solving process,we focus exclusively on calculation problems, requiring LLMs to independently generate comprehensive solutions. Meanwhile, leveraging tree-based representations of expressions, we introduce the Scalable Expression Edit Distance (SEED) score, which provides fine-grained (non-binary) partial credit and yields a more accurate assessment of similarity between prediction and ground-truth. Our results show that even the best models, Grok-4, reach only 36 average SEED score and 28% accuracy on CMPhysBench, underscoring a significant capability gap, especially for this practical and frontier domain relative to traditional physics. The code anddataset are publicly available at https://github.com/CMPhysBench/CMPhysBench.</p></details> | 29 pages, 7 figures |

However, most existing models simply convert the response content into speech without fully understanding the rich emotional and paralinguistic cues embedded in the user's query. In many cases, the same sentence can have different meanings depending on the emotional expression. Furthermore, emotional understanding is essential for improving user experience in human-machine interaction. Currently, most speech LLMs with empathetic capabilities are trained on massive datasets. This approach requires vast amounts of data and significant computational resources. Therefore, a key challenge lies in how to develop a speech LLM capable of generating empathetic responses with limited data and without the need for large-scale training. To address this challenge, we propose Emotion Omni, a novel model architecture designed to understand the emotional content of user speech input and generate empathetic speech responses. Additionally, we developed a data generation pipeline based on an open-source TTS framework to construct a 200k emotional dialogue dataset, which supports the construction of an empathetic speech assistant.

| **[Breaking the Trade-Off Between Faithfulness and Expressiveness for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18651v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Grounding responses in external knowledge represents an effective strategy for mitigating hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, current LLMs struggle to seamlessly integrate knowledge while simultaneously maintaining faithfulness (or fidelity) and expressiveness, capabilities that humans naturally possess. This limitation results in outputs that either lack support from external knowledge, thereby compromising faithfulness, or appear overly verbose and unnatural, thus sacrificing expressiveness. In this work, to break the trade-off between faithfulness and expressiveness, we propose Collaborative Decoding (CoDe), a novel approach that dynamically integrates output probabilities generated with and without external knowledge. This integration is guided by distribution divergence and model confidence, enabling the selective activation of relevant and reliable expressions from the model's internal parameters. Furthermore, we introduce a knowledge-aware reranking mechanism that prevents over-reliance on prior parametric knowledge while ensuring proper utilization of provided external information. Through comprehensive experiments, our plug-and-play CoDe framework demonstrates superior performance in enhancing faithfulness without compromising expressiveness across diverse LLMs and evaluation metrics, validating both its effectiveness and generalizability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adapting Large Language Models to Log Analysis with Interpretable Domain Knowledge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01377v2)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Log analysis represents a critical sub-domain within AI applications that facilitates automatic approaches to fault and error management of large-scaled software systems, saving labors of traditional manual methods. While existing solutions using large language models (LLMs) show promise, they are limited by a significant domain gap between natural and log languages (the latter contains rich domain-specific tokens such as status codes, IP addresses, resource pathes), which restricts their effectiveness in real-world applications. However, directly adapting general-purpose LLMs to log analysis using raw logs may degrade their performance due to inconsistent token distribution. In this paper, we present a domain adaptation approach that addresses these limitations by integrating interpretable domain knowledge into open-source LLMs through continual pre-training (CPT), which bridges this domain gap by adapting LLMs on interpretable natural texts with log knowledge (instead of raw logs) to reduce distribution discrepancy. To achieve this, we developed NLPLog, a comprehensive dataset containing over 250,000 question-answer pairs on log-related knowledge. Our resulting model, SuperLog, achieves the best performance across four log analysis tasks, with an average accuracy improvement of 12.01% over the second-best model. Ablation study also suggests advantages of domain adaption using interpretable log knowledge over using raw logs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM 2025</p></details> |

However, most existing approaches focus on mainstream languages such as Python and Java, neglecting the Solidity language, the predominant programming language for Ethereum smart contracts. Due to the lack of adequate benchmarks for Solidity, LLMs' ability to generate secure, cost-effective smart contracts remains unexplored. To fill this gap, we construct SolEval, the first repository-level benchmark designed for Solidity smart contract generation, to evaluate the performance of LLMs on Solidity. SolEval consists of 1,507 samples from 28 different repositories, covering 6 popular domains, providing LLMs with a comprehensive evaluation benchmark. Unlike the existing Solidity benchmark, SolEval not only includes complex function calls but also reflects the real-world complexity of the Ethereum ecosystem by incorporating Gas@k and Vul@k. We evaluate 16 LLMs on SolEval, and our results show that the best-performing LLM achieves only 26.29% Pass@10, highlighting substantial room for improvement in Solidity code generation by LLMs. Additionally, we conduct supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on Qwen-7B using SolEval, resulting in a significant performance improvement, with Pass@5 increasing from 16.67% to 58.33%, demonstrating the effectiveness of fine-tuning LLMs on our benchmark. We release our data and code at https://github.com/pzy2000/SolEval.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted By EMNLP'25-Main</p></details> |

We achieve novel and significant findings that, despite high benchmark scores, LLMs exhibit severe accuracy drops and unexpected biases (e.g., preference for longer distractors) when faced with these minor but content-preserving modifications. For example, Qwen 2.5 1.5B's MMLU score rises from 60 to 89 and drops from 89 to 36 when option lengths are changed without altering the question. Even GPT4o experiences a 25-point accuracy loss when problem types are changed, with a 6-point drop across all three modification categories. These analyses suggest that LLMs rely heavily on superficial cues rather than forming robust, abstract representations that generalize across formats, lexical variations, and irrelevant content shifts.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 Main Conference</p></details> |

However, a comprehensive understanding of how PTQ precisely impacts diverse LLM knowledge capabilities remains elusive, and existing scaling laws for quantized models often overlook crucial PTQ-specific parameters and task-specific sensitivities. This paper addresses these gaps by conducting an extensive empirical investigation to establish task-stratified scaling laws. We disentangle LLM knowledge into memorization and utilization capabilities and develop a unified quantitative framework that incorporates model size, effective bit-width, calibration set size, and group size. Our central finding reveals that knowledge memorization exhibits markedly greater sensitivity to variations in effective bit-width, calibration set size, and model size compared to the more robust knowledge utilization. These findings offer a fine-grained understanding of PTQ's impact and provide guidance for developing knowledge-aware quantization strategies that can better preserve targeted cognitive functions.</p></details> |  |
| **[DLLMQuant: Quantizing Diffusion-based Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14090v2)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based large language models (DLLMs) have shown promise for non-autoregressive text generation, but their deployment is constrained by large model sizes and heavy computational costs. Post-training quantization (PTQ), a widely used method for compressing and accelerating Large Language Models (LLMs), suffers from severe accuracy degradation and reduced generalization performance when directly applied to DLLMs (e.g., AWQ suffers a 16% accuracy drop on LLADA under W4A4). This paper explores how DLLMs' key mechanisms - dynamic masking, iterative generation, bidirectional attention - clash with quantization. We identify three core issues: 1) Iterative generation and dynamic masking ratios lead to distinct token distributions across decoding steps, which are not adequately captured by existing PTQ calibration methods; 2) Quantization errors are accumulated and amplified progressively during iteration in DLLMs, causing quantized models to perform worse as decoding steps progress; 3) Unmasked tokens stabilize while masked remain probabilistic, making overall feature distribution incompatible with existing PTQ methods. To address these issues, we propose DLLMQuant, a PTQ framework tailored for DLLMs, which incorporates three novel techniques: 1) Temporal-Mask Adaptive Sampling (TMAS), a calibration method that accounts for both time and mask factors, with the capacity to capture distributions across timesteps. 2) Interaction-Aware Activation Quantization (IA-AQ), which utilizes bidirectional attention's interaction signals to dynamically allocate quantization resources. 3) Certainty-Guided Quantization (CGQ), which integrates mask status and token scores as key weighting criteria into error compensation, making weight quantization more suitable for DLLMs. Experiments show that DLLMQuant achieves significant performance gains while enhancing efficiency.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures |
| **[CALR: Corrective Adaptive Low-Rank Decomposition for Efficient Large Language Model Layer Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16680v2)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) present significant deployment challenges due to their immense size and computational requirements. Model compression techniques are essential for making these models practical for resource-constrained environments. A prominent compression strategy is low-rank factorization via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to reduce model parameters by approximating weight matrices. However, standard SVD focuses on minimizing matrix reconstruction error, often leading to a substantial loss of the model's functional performance. This performance degradation occurs because existing methods do not adequately correct for the functional information lost during compression. To address this gap, we introduce Corrective Adaptive Low-Rank Decomposition (CALR), a two-component compression approach. CALR combines a primary path of SVD-compressed layers with a parallel, learnable, low-rank corrective module that is explicitly trained to recover the functional residual error. Our experimental evaluation on SmolLM2-135M, Qwen3-0.6B, and Llama-3.2-1B, demonstrates that CALR can reduce parameter counts by 26.93% to 51.77% while retaining 59.45% to 90.42% of the original model's performance, consistently outperforming LaCo, ShortGPT, and LoSparse. CALR's success shows that treating functional information loss as a learnable signal is a highly effective compression paradigm. This approach enables the creation of significantly smaller, more efficient LLMs, advancing their accessibility and practical deployment in real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Artificial Intelligence.

| **[Large Language Model-Based Framework for Explainable Cyberattack Detection in Automatic Generation Control Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22239v2)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing digitization of smart grids has improved operational efficiency but also introduced new cybersecurity vulnerabilities, such as False Data Injection Attacks (FDIAs) targeting Automatic Generation Control (AGC) systems. While machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models have shown promise in detecting such attacks, their opaque decision-making limits operator trust and real-world applicability. This paper proposes a hybrid framework that integrates lightweight ML-based attack detection with natural language explanations generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). Classifiers such as LightGBM achieve up to 95.13% attack detection accuracy with only 0.004 s inference latency. Upon detecting a cyberattack, the system invokes LLMs, including GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4 Turbo, and GPT-4o mini, to generate human-readable explanation of the event. Evaluated on 100 test samples, GPT-4o mini with 20-shot prompting achieved 93% accuracy in identifying the attack target, a mean absolute error of 0.075 pu in estimating attack magnitude, and 2.19 seconds mean absolute error (MAE) in estimating attack onset. These results demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively balances real-time detection with interpretable, high-fidelity explanations, addressing a critical need for actionable AI in smart grid cybersecurity.</p></details> | Accepted Paper |
| **[DiskJoin: Large-scale Vector Similarity Join with SSD](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18494v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Similarity join--a widely used operation in data science--finds all pairs of items that have distance smaller than a threshold. Prior work has explored distributed computation methods to scale similarity join to large data volumes but these methods require a cluster deployment, and efficiency suffers from expensive inter-machine communication. On the other hand, disk-based solutions are more cost-effective by using a single machine and storing the large dataset on high-performance external storage, such as NVMe SSDs, but in these methods the disk I/O time is a serious bottleneck. In this paper, we propose DiskJoin, the first disk-based similarity join algorithm that can process billion-scale vector datasets efficiently on a single machine. DiskJoin improves disk I/O by tailoring the data access patterns to avoid repetitive accesses and read amplification. It also uses main memory as a dynamic cache and carefully manages cache eviction to improve cache hit rate and reduce disk retrieval time. For further acceleration, we adopt a probabilistic pruning technique that can effectively prune a large number of vector pairs from computation. Our evaluation on real-world, large-scale datasets shows that DiskJoin significantly outperforms alternatives, achieving speedups from 50x to 1000x.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at SIGMOD 2026</p></details> |

The goal is to better understand how these specialists voluntarily use this tool. Background: Human-automation teams have been extensively studied, but transformer-based language models have sparked a new wave of collaboration. SOC personnel at a major cybersecurity provider used an LLM to support live security operations. This study examines how these specialists incorporated the LLM into their work. Method: Our data set is the result of 10 months of SOC operators accessing GPT-4 over an internally deployed HTTP-based chat application. We performed two topic modelling exercises, first using the established BERTopic model (Grootendorst, 2022), and second, using a novel topic modeling workflow. Results: Both the BERTopic analysis and novel modelling approach revealed that SOC operators primarily used the LLM to facilitate their understanding of complex text strings. Variations on this use-case accounted for ~40% of SOC LLM usage. Conclusion: SOC operators are required to rapidly interpret complex commands and similar information. Their natural tendency to leverage LLMs to support this activity indicates that their workflow can be supported and augmented by designing collaborative LLM tools for use in the SOC. Application: This work can aid in creating next-generation tools for Security Operations Centres. By understanding common use-cases, we can develop workflows supporting SOC task flow. One example is a right-click context menu for executing a command line analysis LLM call directly in the SOC environment.</p></details> |  |

This paper addresses the need for LLMs to recognize and refuse infeasible tasks due to the requests surpassing their capabilities. We conceptualize four main categories of infeasible tasks for LLMs, which cover a broad spectrum of hallucination-related challenges identified in prior literature. We develop and benchmark a new dataset comprising diverse infeasible and feasible tasks to evaluate multiple LLMs' abilities to decline infeasible tasks. Furthermore, we explore the potential of increasing LLMs' refusal capabilities with fine-tuning. Our experiments validate the effectiveness of the trained models, suggesting promising directions for improving the performance of LLMs in real-world applications.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 Findings |

We propose a multiple-testing-inspired method to solve the hallucination detection problem, and provide extensive experimental results to validate the robustness of our approach against state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 16 pages |

This is the reality of contemporary Polish. A social consequence of this unfair linguistic system is that large language models (LLMs) trained on Polish texts inherit and reinforce this masculine bias, generating gender-imbalanced outputs. This study addresses this issue by tuning LLMs using the IPIS dataset, a collection of human-crafted gender-inclusive proofreading in Polish and Polish-to-English translation instructions. Grounded in a theoretical linguistic framework, we design a system prompt with explicit gender-inclusive guidelines for Polish. In our experiments, we IPIS-tune multilingual LLMs (Llama-8B, Mistral-7B and Mistral-Nemo) and Polish-specific LLMs (Bielik and PLLuM). Our approach aims to integrate gender inclusivity as an inherent feature of these models, offering a systematic solution to mitigate gender bias in Polish language generation.</p></details> |  |

Existing research has predominantly focused on prompt-level attacks while largely ignoring the underexplored attack surface of user-controlled response prefilling. This functionality allows an attacker to dictate the beginning of a model's output, thereby shifting the attack paradigm from persuasion to direct state manipulation.In this paper, we present a systematic black-box security analysis of prefill-level jailbreak attacks. We categorize these new attacks and evaluate their effectiveness across fourteen language models. Our experiments show that prefill-level attacks achieve high success rates, with adaptive methods exceeding 99% on several models. Token-level probability analysis reveals that these attacks work through initial-state manipulation by changing the first-token probability from refusal to compliance.Furthermore, we show that prefill-level jailbreak can act as effective enhancers, increasing the success of existing prompt-level attacks by 10 to 15 percentage points. Our evaluation of several defense strategies indicates that conventional content filters offer limited protection. We find that a detection method focusing on the manipulative relationship between the prompt and the prefill is more effective. Our findings reveal a gap in current LLM safety alignment and highlight the need to address the prefill attack surface in future safety training.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we delve into the multilingual working pattern of LVLMs and identify a salient correlation between the multilingual understanding ability of LVLMs and language-specific neuron activations in shallow layers. Building on this insight, we introduce PLAST, a training recipe that achieves efficient multilingual enhancement for LVLMs by Precise LAnguage-Specific layers fine-Tuning. PLAST first identifies layers involved in multilingual understanding by monitoring language-specific neuron activations. These layers are then precisely fine-tuned with question-translation pairs to achieve multilingual alignment. Our empirical results on MM-Bench and MMMB demonstrate that PLAST effectively improves the multilingual capabilities of LVLMs and achieves significant efficiency with only 14% of the parameters tuned. Further analysis reveals that PLAST can be generalized to low-resource and complex visual reasoning tasks, facilitating the language-specific visual information engagement in shallow layers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP 2025 findings</p></details> |

Previous studies have shown that these models contain biases that do not accurately reflect reality, especially for minority groups. Despite various efforts to improve the detection of sexist content, this task remains a significant challenge due to its subjective nature and the biases present in automated models. We explore the capabilities of different LLMs to detect sexism in social media text using the EXIST 2024 tweet dataset. It includes annotations from six distinct profiles for each tweet, allowing us to evaluate to what extent LLMs can mimic these groups' perceptions in sexism detection. Additionally, we analyze the demographic biases present in the models and conduct a statistical analysis to identify which demographic characteristics (age, gender) contribute most effectively to this task. Our results show that, while LLMs can to some extent detect sexism when considering the overall opinion of populations, they do not accurately replicate the diversity of perceptions among different demographic groups. This highlights the need for better-calibrated models that account for the diversity of perspectives across different populations.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work was presented as a poster at the Latin American Meeting in Artificial Intelligence KHIPU 2025, Santiago, Chile, March 10th - 14th 2025, https://khipu.ai/khipu2025/poster-sessions-2025/</p></details> |

We further propose a row-to-column (ROW2COL) optimization that improves join efficiency in matrix operations. Evaluated on Llama3-8B and DeepSeekMoE models, TranSQL+ achieves up to 20x lower prefill latency and 4x higher decoding speed compared to DeepSpeed Inference and Llama.cpp in low-memory and CPU-only configurations.

Despite their ubiquity and utility, the underlying mechanisms of LLM remain concealed within billions of parameters and complex structures, making their inner architecture and cognitive processes challenging to comprehend. We address this gap by adopting approaches to understanding emerging cognition in biology and developing a network-based framework that links cognitive skills, LLM architectures, and datasets, ushering in a paradigm shift in foundation model analysis. The skill distribution in the module communities demonstrates that while LLMs do not strictly parallel the focalized specialization observed in specific biological systems, they exhibit unique communities of modules whose emergent skill patterns partially mirror the distributed yet interconnected cognitive organization seen in avian and small mammalian brains. Our numerical results highlight a key divergence from biological systems to LLMs, where skill acquisition benefits substantially from dynamic, cross-regional interactions and neural plasticity. By integrating cognitive science principles with machine learning, our framework provides new insights into LLM interpretability and suggests that effective fine-tuning strategies should leverage distributed learning dynamics rather than rigid modular interventions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Large Language Models for Accurate Sign Language Translation in Low-Resource Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18183v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Translating natural languages into sign languages is a highly complex and underexplored task. Despite growing interest in accessibility and inclusivity, the development of robust translation systems remains hindered by the limited availability of parallel corpora which align natural language with sign language data. Existing methods often struggle to generalize in these data-scarce environments, as the few datasets available are typically domain-specific, lack standardization, or fail to capture the full linguistic richness of sign languages. To address this limitation, we propose Advanced Use of LLMs for Sign Language Translation (AulSign), a novel method that leverages Large Language Models via dynamic prompting and in-context learning with sample selection and subsequent sign association. Despite their impressive abilities in processing text, LLMs lack intrinsic knowledge of sign languages; therefore, they are unable to natively perform this kind of translation. To overcome this limitation, we associate the signs with compact descriptions in natural language and instruct the model to use them. We evaluate our method on both English and Italian languages using SignBank+, a recognized benchmark in the field, as well as the Italian LaCAM CNR-ISTC dataset. We demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art models in low-data scenario. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of AulSign, with the potential to enhance accessibility and inclusivity in communication technologies for underrepresented linguistic communities.</p></details> |  |

While existing methods such as DiLoCo have demonstrated promising results, they often fail to fully exploit computational clusters under dynamic workloads. To address this limitation, we propose a three-stage method that combines Multi-Instance Training (MIT), Adaptive Batched DiLoCo, and switch mode mechanism. MIT allows individual nodes to run multiple lightweight training streams with different model instances in parallel and merge them to combine knowledge, increasing throughput and reducing idle time. Adaptive Batched DiLoCo dynamically adjusts local batch sizes to balance computation and communication, substantially lowering synchronization delays. Switch mode further stabilizes training by seamlessly introducing gradient accumulation once adaptive batch sizes grow beyond hardware-friendly limits. Together, these innovations improve both convergence speed and system efficiency.

Existing static, text-based, or text-image benchmarks overlook the multimodal complexities of real-world interactions and fail to capture the dynamic, multimodal nature of emotional expressions, making them inadequate for evaluating MLLMs' EI. Based on established psychological theories of EI, we build EmoBench-M, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the EI capability of MLLMs across 13 valuation scenarios from three key dimensions: foundational emotion recognition, conversational emotion understanding, and socially complex emotion analysis. Evaluations of both open-source and closed-source MLLMs on EmoBench-M reveal a significant performance gap between them and humans, highlighting the need to further advance their EI capabilities. All benchmark resources, including code and datasets, are publicly available at https://emo-gml.github.io/.</p></details> |  |
| **[HeteroTune: Efficient Federated Learning for Large Heterogeneous Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16796v2)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large pre-trained models have achieved impressive performance across AI tasks, their deployment in privacy-sensitive and distributed environments remains challenging. Federated learning (FL) offers a viable solution by enabling decentralized fine-tuning without data sharing, but real-world applications face significant obstacles due to heterogeneous client resources in compute and memory. To address this, we propose HeteroTune, a novel federated fine-tuning paradigm for large, heterogeneous models operating under limited communication and computation budgets. The core of our method lies in a novel architecture, DeMA (Dense Mixture of Adapters), which enables flexible and efficient aggregation of heterogeneous models by preserving their full representational capacity while facilitating seamless cross-model knowledge fusion. We further introduce CMGA (Cross-Model Gradient Alignment), a lightweight yet effective mechanism that enhances training stability by harmonizing gradient directions across heterogeneous client models during aggregation, mitigating update conflicts and promoting more consistent convergence in federated settings. We provide both theoretical analysis and empirical evidence showing that HeteroTune achieves state-of-the-art performance and efficiency across diverse tasks and model architectures. For example, on LLaMA models, it reduces communication overhead by 99.5%, cuts peak memory usage by ~50%, and improves performance by 4.61%.</p></details> | 16 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Large-scale Multi-sequence Pretraining for Generalizable MRI Analysis in Versatile Clinical Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07165v2)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-sequence Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) offers remarkable versatility, enabling the distinct visualization of different tissue types. Nevertheless, the inherent heterogeneity among MRI sequences poses significant challenges to the generalization capability of deep learning models. These challenges undermine model performance when faced with varying acquisition parameters, thereby severely restricting their clinical utility. In this study, we present PRISM, a foundation model PRe-trained with large-scale multI-Sequence MRI. We collected a total of 64 datasets from both public and private sources, encompassing a wide range of whole-body anatomical structures, with scans spanning diverse MRI sequences. Among them, 336,476 volumetric MRI scans from 34 datasets (8 public and 26 private) were curated to construct the largest multi-organ multi-sequence MRI pretraining corpus to date. We propose a novel pretraining paradigm that disentangles anatomically invariant features from sequence-specific variations in MRI, while preserving high-level semantic representations. We established a benchmark comprising 44 downstream tasks, including disease diagnosis, image segmentation, registration, progression prediction, and report generation. These tasks were evaluated on 32 public datasets and 5 private cohorts. PRISM consistently outperformed both non-pretrained models and existing foundation models, achieving first-rank results in 39 out of 44 downstream benchmarks with statistical significance improvements. These results underscore its ability to learn robust and generalizable representations across unseen data acquired under diverse MRI protocols. PRISM provides a scalable framework for multi-sequence MRI analysis, thereby enhancing the translational potential of AI in radiology. It delivers consistent performance across diverse imaging protocols, reinforcing its clinical applicability.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiscussLLM: Teaching Large Language Models When to Speak](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18167v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating human-like text, yet they largely operate as reactive agents, responding only when directly prompted. This passivity creates an "awareness gap," limiting their potential as truly collaborative partners in dynamic human discussions. We introduce $\textit{DiscussLLM}$, a framework designed to bridge this gap by training models to proactively decide not just $\textit{what}$ to say, but critically, $\textit{when}$ to speak. Our primary contribution is a scalable two-stage data generation pipeline that synthesizes a large-scale dataset of realistic multi-turn human discussions. Each discussion is annotated with one of five intervention types (e.g., Factual Correction, Concept Definition) and contains an explicit conversational trigger where an AI intervention adds value. By training models to predict a special silent token when no intervention is needed, they learn to remain quiet until a helpful contribution can be made. We explore two architectural baselines: an integrated end-to-end model and a decoupled classifier-generator system optimized for low-latency inference. We evaluate these models on their ability to accurately time interventions and generate helpful responses, paving the way for more situationally aware and proactive conversational AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluation of Large Language Models via Coupled Token Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01754v2)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State of the art large language models rely on randomization to respond to a prompt. As an immediate consequence, a model may respond differently to the same prompt if asked multiple times. In this work, we argue that the evaluation and ranking of large language models should control for the randomization underpinning their functioning. Our starting point is the development of a causal model for coupled autoregressive generation, which allows different large language models to sample responses with the same source of randomness. Building upon our causal model, we first show that, on evaluations based on benchmark datasets, coupled autoregressive generation leads to the same conclusions as vanilla autoregressive generation but using provably fewer samples. However, we further show that, on evaluations based on (human) pairwise comparisons, coupled and vanilla autoregressive generation can surprisingly lead to different rankings when comparing more than two models, even with an infinite amount of samples. This suggests that the apparent advantage of a model over others in existing evaluation protocols may not be genuine but rather confounded by the randomness inherent to the generation process. To illustrate and complement our theoretical results, we conduct experiments with several large language models from the Llama, Mistral and Qwen families. We find that, across multiple benchmark datasets, coupled autoregressive generation requires up to 75% fewer samples to reach the same conclusions as vanilla autoregressive generation. Further, we find that the win-rates derived from pairwise comparisons by a strong large language model to prompts from the LMSYS Chatbot Arena platform differ under coupled and vanilla autoregressive generation.</p></details> |  |

To tackle these challenges and save many researchers from annoying, time-consuming tasks, we present QUEENS (Quantification of Uncertain Effects in Engineering Systems), an open-source Python framework for composing and managing simulation analyses with arbitrary (physics-based) solvers on distributed computing infrastructures. Besides simulation management capabilities, QUEENS offers a comprehensive collection of efficiently implemented state-of-the-art algorithms ranging from routines for convergence studies and common optimization algorithms to more advanced sampling algorithms for uncertainty quantification and Bayesian inverse analysis. Additionally, we provide our latest cutting-edge research in multi-fidelity uncertainty quantification, efficient multi-fidelity Bayesian inverse analysis, and probabilistic machine learning. QUEENS adopts a Bayesian, probabilistic mindset but equally supports standard deterministic analysis without requiring prior knowledge of probability theory. The modular architecture allows rapid switching between common types of analyses and facilitates building sophisticated hierarchical algorithms. Encouraging natural incremental steps and scaling towards complexity allows researchers to consider the big picture while building towards it through smaller, manageable steps.

| **[Named Entity Recognition of Historical Text via Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18090v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models have demonstrated remarkable versatility across a wide range of natural language processing tasks and domains. One such task is Named Entity Recognition (NER), which involves identifying and classifying proper names in text, such as people, organizations, locations, dates, and other specific entities. NER plays a crucial role in extracting information from unstructured textual data, enabling downstream applications such as information retrieval from unstructured text. Traditionally, NER is addressed using supervised machine learning approaches, which require large amounts of annotated training data. However, historical texts present a unique challenge, as the annotated datasets are often scarce or nonexistent, due to the high cost and expertise required for manual labeling. In addition, the variability and noise inherent in historical language, such as inconsistent spelling and archaic vocabulary, further complicate the development of reliable NER systems for these sources. In this study, we explore the feasibility of applying LLMs to NER in historical documents using zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies, which require little to no task-specific training data. Our experiments, conducted on the HIPE-2022 (Identifying Historical People, Places and other Entities) dataset, show that LLMs can achieve reasonably strong performance on NER tasks in this setting. While their performance falls short of fully supervised models trained on domain-specific annotations, the results are nevertheless promising. These findings suggest that LLMs offer a viable and efficient alternative for information extraction in low-resource or historically significant corpora, where traditional supervised methods are infeasible.</p></details> |  |
| **[Recursively Summarizing Enables Long-Term Dialogue Memory in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15022v4)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, stand out remarkable conversational abilities, enabling them to engage in dynamic and contextually relevant dialogues across a wide range of topics. However, given a long conversation, these chatbots fail to recall past information and tend to generate inconsistent responses. To address this, we propose to recursively generate summaries/ memory using large language models (LLMs) to enhance long-term memory ability. Specifically, our method first stimulates LLMs to memorize small dialogue contexts and then recursively produce new memory using previous memory and following contexts. Finally, the chatbot can easily generate a highly consistent response with the help of the latest memory. We evaluate our method on both open and closed LLMs, and the experiments on the widely-used public dataset show that our method can generate more consistent responses in a long-context conversation. Also, we show that our strategy could nicely complement both long-context (e.g., 8K and 16K) and retrieval-enhanced LLMs, bringing further long-term dialogue performance. Notably, our method is a potential solution to enable the LLM to model the extremely long context. The code and scripts are released.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by Neurocomputing</p></details> |
| **[Forgotten Polygons: Multimodal Large Language Models are Shape-Blind](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15969v4)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite strong performance on vision-language tasks, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with mathematical problem-solving, with both open-source and state-of-the-art models falling short of human performance on visual-math benchmarks. To systematically examine visual-mathematical reasoning in MLLMs, we (1) evaluate their understanding of geometric primitives, (2) test multi-step reasoning, and (3) explore a potential solution to improve visual reasoning capabilities. Our findings reveal fundamental shortcomings in shape recognition, with top models achieving under 50% accuracy in identifying regular polygons. We analyze these failures through the lens of dual-process theory and show that MLLMs rely on System 1 (intuitive, memorized associations) rather than System 2 (deliberate reasoning). Consequently, MLLMs fail to count the sides of both familiar and novel shapes, suggesting they have neither learned the concept of sides nor effectively process visual inputs. Finally, we propose Visually Cued Chain-of-Thought (VC-CoT) prompting, which enhances multi-step mathematical reasoning by explicitly referencing visual annotations in diagrams, boosting GPT-4o's accuracy on an irregular polygon side-counting task from 7% to 93%. Our findings suggest that System 2 reasoning in MLLMs remains an open problem, and visually-guided prompting is essential for successfully engaging visual reasoning.

| **[Large Language Models in the Task of Automatic Validation of Text Classifier Predictions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18688v2)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning models for text classification are trained to predict a class for a given text. To do this, training and validation samples must be prepared: a set of texts is collected, and each text is assigned a class. These classes are usually assigned by human annotators with different expertise levels, depending on the specific classification task. Collecting such samples from scratch is labor-intensive because it requires finding specialists and compensating them for their work; moreover, the number of available specialists is limited, and their productivity is constrained by human factors. While it may not be too resource-intensive to collect samples once, the ongoing need to retrain models (especially in incremental learning pipelines) to address data drift (also called model drift) makes the data collection process crucial and costly over the model's entire lifecycle. This paper proposes several approaches to replace human annotators with Large Language Models (LLMs) to test classifier predictions for correctness, helping ensure model quality and support high-quality incremental learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Detecting Knowledge Boundary of Vision Large Language Models by Sampling-Based Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18023v3)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the advancements made in Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs), like text Large Language Models (LLMs), they have limitations in addressing questions that require real-time information or are knowledge-intensive. Indiscriminately adopting Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques is an effective yet expensive way to enable models to answer queries beyond their knowledge scopes. To mitigate the dependence on retrieval and simultaneously maintain, or even improve, the performance benefits provided by retrieval, we propose a method to detect the knowledge boundary of VLLMs, allowing for more efficient use of techniques like RAG. Specifically, we propose a method with two variants that fine-tune a VLLM on an automatically constructed dataset for boundary identification. Experimental results on various types of Visual Question Answering datasets show that our method successfully depicts a VLLM's knowledge boundary, based on which we are able to reduce indiscriminate retrieval while maintaining or improving the performance. In addition, we show that the knowledge boundary identified by our method for one VLLM can be used as a surrogate boundary for other VLLMs. Code will be released at https://github.com/Chord-Chen-30/VLLM-KnowledgeBoundary</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP2025 Main Conference</p></details> |

Here we investigate whether a prominent scientific computing algorithm, the Kalman Filter, can be discovered through an automated, data-driven, evolutionary process that relies on Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP) and Large Language Models (LLM). We evaluate the contributions of both modalities (CGP and LLM) in discovering the Kalman filter under varying conditions. Our results demonstrate that our framework of CGP and LLM-assisted evolution converges to near-optimal solutions when Kalman optimality assumptions hold. When these assumptions are violated, our framework evolves interpretable alternatives that outperform the Kalman filter. These results demonstrate that combining evolutionary algorithms and generative models for interpretable, data-driven synthesis of simple computational modules is a potent approach for algorithmic discovery in scientific computing.</p></details> |  |

They demonstrate impressive performance in handling images under extreme viewpoint changes. However, these methods struggle to handle a large number of input images. To address this problem, we introduce SAIL-Recon, a feed-forward Transformer for large scale SfM, by augmenting the scene regression network with visual localization capabilities. Specifically, our method first computes a neural scene representation from a subset of anchor images. The regression network is then fine-tuned to reconstruct all input images conditioned on this neural scene representation. Comprehensive experiments show that our method not only scales efficiently to large-scale scenes, but also achieves state-of-the-art results on both camera pose estimation and novel view synthesis benchmarks, including TUM-RGBD, CO3Dv2, and Tanks & Temples. We will publish our model and code. Code and models are publicly available at: https://hkust-sail.github.io/ sail-recon/.</p></details> |  |

However, their performance in multi-agent path finding (MAPF) tasks has been less than satisfactory, with only a few studies exploring this area. MAPF is a complex problem requiring both planning and multi-agent coordination. To improve the performance of LLM in MAPF tasks, we propose a novel framework, LLM-NAR, which leverages neural algorithmic reasoners (NAR) to inform LLM for MAPF. LLM-NAR consists of three key components: an LLM for MAPF, a pre-trained graph neural network-based NAR, and a cross-attention mechanism. This is the first work to propose using a neural algorithmic reasoner to integrate GNNs with the map information for MAPF, thereby guiding LLM to achieve superior performance. LLM-NAR can be easily adapted to various LLM models. Both simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing LLM-based approaches in solving MAPF problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCNN 2025</p></details> |

In this paper, we present a comprehensive set of experiments to probe how LLMs compose subword information, focusing on three key aspects: structural similarity, semantic decomposability, and form retention. Our analysis of the experiments suggests that these five LLM families can be classified into three distinct groups, likely reflecting difference in their underlying composition strategies. Specifically, we observe (i) three distinct patterns in the evolution of structural similarity between subword compositions and whole-word representations across layers; (ii) great performance when probing layer by layer their sensitivity to semantic decompositionality; and (iii) three distinct patterns when probing sensitivity to formal features, e.g., character sequence length. These findings provide valuable insights into the compositional dynamics of LLMs and highlight different compositional pattens in how LLMs encode and integrate subword information.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 Main |
| **[Learning Heterogeneous Mixture of Scene Experts for Large-scale Neural Radiance Fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02005v2)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent NeRF methods on large-scale scenes have underlined the importance of scene decomposition for scalable NeRFs. Although achieving reasonable scalability, there are several critical problems remaining unexplored, i.e., learnable decomposition, modeling scene heterogeneity, and modeling efficiency. In this paper, we introduce Switch-NeRF++, a Heterogeneous Mixture of Hash Experts (HMoHE) network that addresses these challenges within a unified framework. It is a highly scalable NeRF that learns heterogeneous decomposition and heterogeneous NeRFs efficiently for large-scale scenes in an end-to-end manner. In our framework, a gating network learns to decompose scenes and allocates 3D points to specialized NeRF experts. This gating network is co-optimized with the experts by our proposed Sparsely Gated Mixture of Experts (MoE) NeRF framework. We incorporate a hash-based gating network and distinct heterogeneous hash experts. The hash-based gating efficiently learns the decomposition of the large-scale scene. The distinct heterogeneous hash experts consist of hash grids of different resolution ranges, enabling effective learning of the heterogeneous representation of different scene parts. These design choices make our framework an end-to-end and highly scalable NeRF solution for real-world large-scale scene modeling to achieve both quality and efficiency. We evaluate our accuracy and scalability on existing large-scale NeRF datasets and a new dataset with very large-scale scenes ($>6.5km^2$) from UrbanBIS. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach can be easily scaled to various large-scale scenes and achieve state-of-the-art scene rendering accuracy. Furthermore, our method exhibits significant efficiency, with an 8x acceleration in training and a 16x acceleration in rendering compared to Switch-NeRF.

In this paper, we argue that affordance should be task-/instruction-dependent, which is overlooked by many previous works. That is, different instructions can lead to different manipulation regions and directions even for the same object. According to this observation, we present a new dataset comprising fifteen thousand object-instruction-affordance triplets. All scenes in the dataset are from an egocentric viewpoint, designed to approximate the perspective of a human-like robot. Furthermore, we investigate how to enable large multimodal models (LMMs) to serve as affordance predictors by implementing a ``search against verifiers'' pipeline. An LMM is asked to progressively predict affordances, with the output at each step being verified by itself during the iterative process, imitating a reasoning process. Experiments show that our method not only unlocks new instruction-oriented affordance prediction capabilities, but also achieves outstanding performance broadly.</p></details> |  |

Computational auditory scene analysis, disentangling acoustic scenes by detecting and classifying events, focuses on objective attributes of sounds, such as their category and temporal characteristics, ignoring their effects on people, such as the emotions they evoke within a context. To fill this gap, we propose the affective soundscape captioning (ASSC) task, which enables automated soundscape analysis, thus avoiding labour-intensive subjective ratings and surveys in conventional methods. With soundscape captioning, context-aware descriptions are generated for soundscape by capturing the acoustic scenes (ASs), audio events (AEs) information, and the corresponding human affective qualities (AQs). To this end, we propose an automatic soundscape captioner (SoundSCaper) system composed of an acoustic model, i.e. SoundAQnet, and a large language model (LLM). SoundAQnet simultaneously models multi-scale information about ASs, AEs, and perceived AQs, while the LLM describes the soundscape with captions by parsing the information captured with SoundAQnet. SoundSCaper is assessed by two juries of 32 people. In expert evaluation, the average score of SoundSCaper-generated captions is slightly lower than that of two soundscape experts on the evaluation set D1 and the external mixed dataset D2, but not statistically significant. In layperson evaluation, SoundSCaper outperforms soundscape experts in several metrics. In addition to human evaluation, compared to other automated audio captioning systems with and without LLM, SoundSCaper performs better on the ASSC task in several NLP-based metrics. Overall, SoundSCaper performs well in human subjective evaluation and various objective captioning metrics, and the generated captions are comparable to those annotated by soundscape experts.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Transactions on Multimedia, Code: https://github.com/Yuanbo2020/SoundSCaper</p></details> |

However, the lack of QA datasets in specific domains and languages hinders the development of robust AI models able to generalize across various domains and languages. To this end, we introduce MedQARo, the first large-scale medical QA benchmark in Romanian, alongside a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). We construct a high-quality and large-scale dataset comprising 102,646 QA pairs related to cancer patients. The questions regard medical case summaries of 1,011 patients, requiring either keyword extraction or reasoning to be answered correctly. MedQARo is the result of a time-consuming manual annotation process carried out by seven physicians specialized in oncology or radiotherapy, who spent a total of about 2,100 work hours to generate the QA pairs. We experiment with four LLMs from distinct families of models on MedQARo. Each model is employed in two scenarios, namely one based on zero-shot prompting and one based on supervised fine-tuning. Our results show that fine-tuned models significantly outperform their zero-shot counterparts, clearly indicating that pretrained models fail to generalize on MedQARo. Our findings demonstrate the importance of both domain-specific and language-specific fine-tuning for reliable clinical QA in Romanian. We publicly release our dataset and code at https://github.com/ana-rogoz/MedQARo.</p></details> |  |

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) augments the generation process by retrieving externally stored knowledge absent from the models internal parameters. However, RAG methods face challenges such as information loss and redundant retrievals during multi-round queries, accompanying the difficulties in precisely characterizing knowledge gaps for complex tasks. To address these problems, we propose Retrieval Feedback and Memory Retrieval Augmented Generation(RFM-RAG), which transforms the stateless retrieval of previous methods into stateful continuous knowledge management by constructing a dynamic evidence pool. Specifically, our method generates refined queries describing the models knowledge gaps using relational triples from questions and evidence from the dynamic evidence pool; Retrieves critical external knowledge to iteratively update this evidence pool; Employs a R-Feedback Model to evaluate evidence completeness until convergence. Compared to traditional RAG methods, our approach enables persistent storage of retrieved passages and effectively distills key information from passages to construct clearly new queries. Experiments on three public QA benchmarks demonstrate that RFM-RAG outperforms previous methods and improves overall system accuracy.</p></details> |  |

However, the increased number of images in MVQA inevitably introduces substantial visual redundancy that is irrelevant to question answering, negatively impacting both accuracy and efficiency. To address this issue, existing methods lack flexibility in controlling the number of compressed visual tokens and tend to produce discrete visual fragments, which hinder MLLMs' ability to comprehend images holistically. In this paper, we propose a straightforward yet universal Adaptive Visual Anchoring strategy, which can be seamlessly integrated into existing MLLMs, offering significant accuracy improvements through adaptive compression. Meanwhile, to balance the results derived from both global and compressed visual input, we further introduce a novel collaborative decoding mechanism, enabling optimal performance. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method, demonstrating consistent performance improvements across various MLLMs. The code will be publicly available.</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures |

However, LLMs' trustworthiness in this application has not been sufficiently explored. In this paper, we reveal that the models' inherent social biases can directly damage game balance in real-world gaming environments. To this end, we present FairGamer, the first bias evaluation Benchmark for LLMs in video game scenarios, featuring six tasks and a novel metrics ${D_lstd}$. It covers three key scenarios in games where LLMs' social biases are particularly likely to manifest: Serving as Non-Player Characters, Interacting as Competitive Opponents, and Generating Game Scenes. FairGamer utilizes both reality-grounded and fully fictional game content, covering a variety of video game genres. Experiments reveal: (1) Decision biases directly cause game balance degradation, with Grok-3 (average ${D_lstd}$ score=0.431) exhibiting the most severe degradation; (2) LLMs demonstrate isomorphic social/cultural biases toward both real and virtual world content, suggesting their biases nature may stem from inherent model characteristics. These findings expose critical reliability gaps in LLMs' gaming applications. Our code and data are available at anonymous GitHub https://github.com/Anonymous999-xxx/FairGamer .</p></details> |  |

In this paper, a novel robust knowledge distillation based semantic communication (RKD-SC) framework is proposed to enable efficient and \textcolor{black}{channel-noise-robust} LSM-powered SC. The framework addresses two key challenges: determining optimal compact model architectures and effectively transferring knowledge while maintaining robustness against channel noise. First, a knowledge distillation-based lightweight differentiable architecture search (KDL-DARTS) algorithm is proposed. This algorithm integrates knowledge distillation loss and a complexity penalty into the neural architecture search process to identify high-performance, lightweight semantic encoder architectures. Second, a novel two-stage robust knowledge distillation (RKD) algorithm is developed to transfer semantic capabilities from an LSM (teacher) to a compact encoder (student) and subsequently enhance system robustness. To further improve resilience to channel impairments, a channel-aware transformer (CAT) block is introduced as the channel codec, trained under diverse channel conditions with variable-length outputs. Extensive simulations on image classification tasks demonstrate that the RKD-SC framework significantly reduces model parameters while preserving a high degree of the teacher model's performance and exhibiting superior robustness compared to existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 8 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[DRQA: Dynamic Reasoning Quota Allocation for Controlling Overthinking in Reasoning Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17803v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning large language models (RLLMs), such as OpenAI-O3 and DeepSeek-R1, have recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities by performing structured and multi-step reasoning. However, recent studies reveal that RLLMs often suffer from overthinking, i.e., producing unnecessarily lengthy reasoning chains even for simple questions, leading to excessive token consumption and computational inefficiency. Interestingly, we observe that when processing multiple questions in batch mode, RLLMs exhibit more resource-efficient behavior by dynamically compressing reasoning steps for easier problems, due to implicit resource competition. Inspired by this, we propose Dynamic Reasoning Quota Allocation (DRQA), a novel method that transfers the benefits of resource competition from batch processing to single-question inference. Specifically, DRQA leverages batch-generated preference data and reinforcement learning to train the model to allocate reasoning resources adaptively. By encouraging the model to internalize a preference for responses that are both accurate and concise, DRQA enables it to generate concise answers for simple questions while retaining sufficient reasoning depth for more challenging ones. Extensive experiments on a wide range of mathematical and scientific reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that DRQA significantly reduces token usage while maintaining, and in many cases improving, answer accuracy. By effectively mitigating the overthinking problem, DRQA offers a promising direction for more efficient and scalable deployment of RLLMs, and we hope it inspires further exploration into fine-grained control of reasoning behaviors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaling Capability in Token Space: An Analysis of Large Vision Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18387v3)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models have demonstrated predictable scaling behaviors with respect to model parameters and training data. This study investigates whether a similar scaling relationship exist for vision-language models with respect to the number of vision tokens. A mathematical framework is developed to characterize a relationship between vision token number and the expected divergence of distance between vision-referencing sequences. The theoretical analysis reveals two distinct scaling regimes: sublinear scaling for less vision tokens and linear scaling for more vision tokens. This aligns with model performance relationships of the form \(S(n) \approx c / n^{\alpha(n)}\), where the scaling exponent relates to the correlation structure between vision token representations. Empirical validations across multiple vision-language benchmarks show that model performance matches the prediction from scaling relationship. The findings contribute to understanding vision token scaling in transformers through a theoretical framework that complements empirical observations.</p></details> |  |

However, it remains unclear to which extent LLMs, in both informal and autoformalisation methods, are robust on logical deduction tasks. Moreover, while many LLM-based deduction methods have been proposed, a systematic study that analyses the impact of their design components is lacking. Addressing these two challenges, we propose the first study of the robustness of formal and informal LLM-based deductive reasoning methods. We devise a framework with two families of perturbations: adversarial noise and counterfactual statements, which jointly generate seven perturbed datasets. We organize the landscape of LLM reasoners according to their reasoning format, formalisation syntax, and feedback for error recovery. The results show that adversarial noise affects autoformalisation, while counterfactual statements influence all approaches. Detailed feedback does not improve overall accuracy despite reducing syntax errors, pointing to the challenge of LLM-based methods to self-correct effectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>to be...</summary><p>to be published in ECAI 2025</p></details> |

In contrast to previous studies, we demonstrate that inference-time activation interventions can bypass safety alignments and effectively steer model generations towards harmful AI coordination. Our method applies fine-grained interventions at specific attention heads, which we identify by probing each head in a simple binary choice task. We then show that interventions on these heads generalise to the open-ended generation setting, effectively circumventing safety guardrails. We demonstrate that intervening on a few attention heads is more effective than intervening on full layers or supervised fine-tuning. We further show that only a few example completions are needed to compute effective steering directions, which is an advantage over classical fine-tuning. We also demonstrate that applying interventions in the negative direction can prevent a common jailbreak attack. Our results suggest that, at the attention head level, activations encode fine-grained linearly separable behaviours. Practically, the approach offers a straightforward methodology to steer large language model behaviour, which could be extended to diverse domains beyond safety, requiring fine-grained control over the model output. The code and datasets for this study can be found on https://github.com/PaulDrm/targeted_intervention.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at Transaction of Machine Learning Research 08/2025, Large Language Models (LLMs), Interference-time activation shifting, Steerability, Explainability, AI alignment, Interpretability</p></details> |

OpenHuEval is constructed from a vast collection of Hungarian-specific materials sourced from multiple origins. In the construction, we incorporated the latest design principles for evaluating LLMs, such as using real user queries from the internet, emphasizing the assessment of LLMs' generative capabilities, and employing LLM-as-judge to enhance the multidimensionality and accuracy of evaluations. Ultimately, OpenHuEval encompasses eight Hungarian-specific dimensions, featuring five tasks and 3953 questions. Consequently, OpenHuEval provides the comprehensive, in-depth, and scientifically accurate assessment of LLM performance in the context of the Hungarian language and its specifics. We evaluated current mainstream LLMs, including both traditional LLMs and recently developed Large Reasoning Models. The results demonstrate the significant necessity for evaluation and model optimization tailored to the Hungarian language and specifics. We also established the framework for analyzing the thinking processes of LRMs with OpenHuEval, revealing intrinsic patterns and mechanisms of these models in non-English languages, with Hungarian serving as a representative example. We will release OpenHuEval at https://github.com/opendatalab/OpenHuEval .</p></details> |  |

However, large-scale UAM operations connecting multiple origin-destination pairs raise concerns about air traffic safety and efficiency due to potential conflict movements, particularly at major conflict points analogous to roadway junctions. To meet the safety and efficiency requirements of future UAM operations, this work proposes an air traffic management framework that integrates route guidance and collision avoidance. The route guidance mechanism optimizes aircraft distribution across both spatial and temporal dimensions by regulating their paths (composed of waypoints). Given the optimized paths, the collision avoidance algorithm generates collision-free aircraft trajectories between waypoints in the 3D space. To enable large-scale applications, we develop fast approximation methods for centralized path planning and adopt the velocity obstacle model for distributed collision avoidance. To our knowledge, this work is one of the first to integrate route guidance and collision avoidance for UAM. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework enables efficient and flexible UAM operations, including air traffic assignment, local congestion mitigation, and dynamic no-fly zone management. Compared with a collision-free baseline strategy, the proposed framework achieves considerable improvements in traffic safety and efficiency, with increases in the average minimum separation (+98.2%), the average travel speed (+70.2%), and the trip completion rate (+130%), along with a reduction in the energy consumption (-23.0%). The proposed framework demonstrates its potential for real-time traffic simulation and management in large-scale UAM systems.</p></details> | 26 pages |
| **[Seeing Sarcasm Through Different Eyes: Analyzing Multimodal Sarcasm Perception in Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12149v3)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the advent of large vision-language models (LVLMs) demonstrating increasingly human-like abilities, a pivotal question emerges: do different LVLMs interpret multimodal sarcasm differently, and can a single model grasp sarcasm from multiple perspectives like humans? To explore this, we introduce an analytical framework using systematically designed prompts on existing multimodal sarcasm datasets. Evaluating 12 state-of-the-art LVLMs over 2,409 samples, we examine interpretive variations within and across models, focusing on confidence levels, alignment with dataset labels, and recognition of ambiguous "neutral" cases. We further validate our findings on a diverse 100-sample mini-benchmark, incorporating multiple datasets, expanded prompt variants, and representative commercial LVLMs. Our findings reveal notable discrepancies -- across LVLMs and within the same model under varied prompts. While classification-oriented prompts yield higher internal consistency, models diverge markedly when tasked with interpretive reasoning. These results challenge binary labeling paradigms by highlighting sarcasm's subjectivity. We advocate moving beyond rigid annotation schemes toward multi-perspective, uncertainty-aware modeling, offering deeper insights into multimodal sarcasm comprehension. Our code and data are available at: https://github.com/CoderChen01/LVLMSarcasmAnalysis</p></details> |  |

We propose $\textbf{L}$able-Free $\textbf{E}$valuation of LLM on $\textbf{T}$ourism using Expert $\textbf{T}$ree-$\textbf{o}$f-$\textbf{T}$hought (LETToT), a framework that leverages expert-derived reasoning structures-instead of labeled data-to access LLMs in tourism. First, we iteratively refine and validate hierarchical ToT components through alignment with generic quality dimensions and expert feedback. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of our systematically optimized expert ToT with 4.99-14.15\% relative quality gains over baselines. Second, we apply LETToT's optimized expert ToT to evaluate models of varying scales (32B-671B parameters), revealing: (1) Scaling laws persist in specialized domains (DeepSeek-V3 leads), yet reasoning-enhanced smaller models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B) close this gap; (2) For sub-72B models, explicit reasoning architectures outperform counterparts in accuracy and conciseness ($p<0.05$). Our work established a scalable, label-free paradigm for domain-specific LLM evaluation, offering a robust alternative to conventional annotated benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[MALMM: Multi-Agent Large Language Models for Zero-Shot Robotics Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17636v2)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable planning abilities across various domains, including robotics manipulation and navigation. While recent efforts in robotics have leveraged LLMs both for high-level and low-level planning, these approaches often face significant challenges, such as hallucinations in long-horizon tasks and limited adaptability due to the generation of plans in a single pass without real-time feedback. To address these limitations, we propose a novel multi-agent LLM framework, Multi-Agent Large Language Model for Manipulation (MALMM) that distributes high-level planning and low-level control code generation across specialized LLM agents, supervised by an additional agent that dynamically manages transitions. By incorporating observations from the environment after each step, our framework effectively handles intermediate failures and enables adaptive re-planning. Unlike existing methods, our approach does not rely on pre-trained skill policies or in-context learning examples and generalizes to a variety of new tasks. We evaluate our approach on nine RLBench tasks, including long-horizon tasks, and demonstrate its ability to solve robotics manipulation in a zero-shot setting, thereby overcoming key limitations of existing LLM-based manipulation methods.</p></details> | 48 pages |

Although watermarking offers a promising solution, existing approaches struggle to simultaneously achieve three critical requirements: text quality preservation, model-agnostic detection, and message embedding capacity, which are crucial for practical implementation. To achieve these goals, the key challenge lies in balancing the trade-off between text quality preservation and message embedding capacity. To address this challenge, we propose BiMark, a novel watermarking framework that achieves these requirements through three key innovations: (1) a bit-flip unbiased reweighting mechanism enabling model-agnostic detection, (2) a multilayer architecture enhancing detectability without compromising generation quality, and (3) an information encoding approach supporting multi-bit watermarking. Through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments, we validate that, compared to state-of-the-art multi-bit watermarking methods, BiMark achieves up to 30% higher extraction rates for short texts while maintaining text quality indicated by lower perplexity, and performs comparably to non-watermarked text on downstream tasks such as summarization and translation.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) 2025</p></details> |
| **[Towards Synthesizing Normative Data for Cognitive Assessments Using Generative Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17675v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cognitive assessments require normative data as essential benchmarks for evaluating individual performance. Hence, developing new cognitive tests based on novel image stimuli is challenging due to the lack of readily available normative data. Traditional data collection methods are costly, time-consuming, and infrequently updated, limiting their practical utility. Recent advancements in generative multimodal large language models (MLLMs) offer a new approach to generate synthetic normative data from existing cognitive test images. We investigated the feasibility of using MLLMs, specifically GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini, to synthesize normative textual responses for established image-based cognitive assessments, such as the "Cookie Theft" picture description task. Two distinct prompting strategies-naive prompts with basic instructions and advanced prompts enriched with contextual guidance-were evaluated. Responses were analyzed using embeddings to assess their capacity to distinguish diagnostic groups and demographic variations. Performance metrics included BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore, and an LLM-as-a-judge evaluation. Advanced prompting strategies produced synthetic responses that more effectively distinguished between diagnostic groups and captured demographic diversity compared to naive prompts. Superior models generated responses exhibiting higher realism and diversity. BERTScore emerged as the most reliable metric for contextual similarity assessment, while BLEU was less effective for evaluating creative outputs. The LLM-as-a-judge approach provided promising preliminary validation results. Our study demonstrates that generative multimodal LLMs, guided by refined prompting methods, can feasibly generate robust synthetic normative data for existing cognitive tests, thereby laying the groundwork for developing novel image-based cognitive assessments without the traditional limitations.</p></details> | Preprint |

Existing contrastive decoding methods tuned specifically to handle conflict often lack adaptability and can degrade performance in low conflict settings. We introduce CoCoA (Confidence- and Context-Aware Adaptive Decoding), a novel token-level algorithm for principled conflict resolution and enhanced faithfulness. CoCoA resolves conflict by utilizing confidence-aware measures (entropy gap and contextual peakedness) and the generalized divergence between the parametric and contextual distributions. Crucially, CoCoA maintains strong performance even in low conflict settings. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs on diverse Question Answering (QA), Summarization, and Long-Form Question Answering (LFQA) benchmarks demonstrate CoCoA's state-of-the-art performance over strong baselines like AdaCAD. It yields significant gains in QA accuracy, up to 9.2 points on average compared to the strong baseline AdaCAD, and improves factuality in summarization and LFQA by up to 2.5 points on average across key benchmarks. Additionally, it demonstrates superior sensitivity to conflict variations. CoCoA enables more informed, context-aware, and ultimately more faithful token generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP'25, Main. 21 pages, 17 tables, 3 Figures</p></details> |

Jailbreak attacks can hinder the safety of Large Language Model (LLM) applications, especially chatbots. Studying jailbreak techniques is an important AI red teaming task for improving the safety of these applications. In this paper, we introduce TombRaider, a novel jailbreak technique that exploits the ability to store, retrieve, and use historical knowledge of LLMs. TombRaider employs two agents, the inspector agent to extract relevant historical information and the attacker agent to generate adversarial prompts, enabling effective bypassing of safety filters. We intensively evaluated TombRaider on six popular models. Experimental results showed that TombRaider could outperform state-of-the-art jailbreak techniques, achieving nearly 100% attack success rates (ASRs) on bare models and maintaining over 55.4% ASR against defence mechanisms. Our findings highlight critical vulnerabilities in existing LLM safeguards, underscoring the need for more robust safety defences.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main Conference of EMNLP</p></details> |

These models are typically constrained to specific species, failing to perform accurately across the broad spectrum of cultivated plants. To address this gap, we first introduce the FloraSyntropy Archive, a large-scale dataset of 178,922 images across 35 plant species, annotated with 97 distinct disease classes. We establish a benchmark by evaluating numerous existing models on this archive, revealing a significant performance gap. We then propose FloraSyntropy-Net, a novel federated learning framework (FL) that integrates a Memetic Algorithm (MAO) for optimal base model selection (DenseNet201), a novel Deep Block for enhanced feature representation, and a client-cloning strategy for scalable, privacy-preserving training. FloraSyntropy-Net achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 96.38% on the FloraSyntropy benchmark. Crucially, to validate its generalization capability, we test the model on the unrelated multiclass Pest dataset, where it demonstrates exceptional adaptability, achieving 99.84% accuracy. This work provides not only a valuable new resource but also a robust and highly generalizable framework that advances the field towards practical, large-scale agricultural AI applications.</p></details> |  |

While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating survey texts, the lack of standardized evaluation datasets critically hampers rigorous assessment of their performance against human-written surveys. In this work, we present SurveyGen, a large-scale dataset comprising over 4,200 human-written surveys across diverse scientific domains, along with 242,143 cited references and extensive quality-related metadata for both the surveys and the cited papers. Leveraging this resource, we build QUAL-SG, a novel quality-aware framework for survey generation that enhances the standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline by incorporating quality-aware indicators into literature retrieval to assess and select higher-quality source papers. Using this dataset and framework, we systematically evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs under varying levels of human involvement - from fully automatic generation to human-guided writing. Experimental results and human evaluations show that while semi-automatic pipelines can achieve partially competitive outcomes, fully automatic survey generation still suffers from low citation quality and limited critical analysis.</p></details> |  |

This issue emerges when LLMs excessively reduce the probability of rejected completions to achieve high rewards, without genuinely meeting their intended goals. As a result, this leads to overly lengthy generation lacking diversity, as well as catastrophic forgetting of knowledge. We investigate the underlying reason behind this issue, which is representation redundancy caused by neuron collapse in the parameter space. Hence, we propose a novel Weights-Rotated Preference Optimization (RoPO) algorithm, which implicitly constrains the output layer logits with the KL divergence inherited from DPO and explicitly constrains the intermediate hidden states by fine-tuning on a multi-granularity orthogonal matrix. This design prevents the policy model from deviating too far from the reference model, thereby retaining the knowledge and expressive capabilities acquired during pre-training and SFT stages. Our RoPO achieves up to a 3.27-point improvement on AlpacaEval 2, and surpasses the best baseline by 6.2 to 7.5 points on MT-Bench with merely 0.015% of the trainable parameters, demonstrating its effectiveness in alleviating the reward hacking problem of DPO.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 |

This study explores few-shot Adaptive Linguistic Prompting (ALP) in detecting phishing webpages through the multimodal capabilities of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro. ALP is a structured semantic reasoning method that guides LLMs to analyze textual deception by breaking down linguistic patterns, detecting urgency cues, and identifying manipulative diction commonly found in phishing content. By integrating textual, visual, and URL-based analysis, we propose a unified model capable of identifying sophisticated phishing attempts. Our experiments demonstrate that ALP significantly enhances phishing detection accuracy by guiding LLMs through structured reasoning and contextual analysis. The findings highlight the potential of ALP-integrated multimodal LLMs to advance phishing detection frameworks, achieving an F1-score of 0.93, surpassing traditional approaches. These results establish a foundation for more robust, interpretable, and adaptive linguistic-based phishing detection systems using LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ACL 2025 SRW, 9 pages, 3 figures</p></details> |

However, current generative models suffer from critical limitations: training objectives seldom target function directly, discrete sequences and continuous coordinates are optimized in isolation, and conformational ensembles are under-modeled. We present UniGenX, a unified generative foundation model that addresses these gaps by co-generating sequences and coordinates under direct functional and property objectives across proteins, molecules, and materials. UniGenX represents heterogeneous inputs as a mixed stream of symbolic and numeric tokens, where a decoder-only autoregressive transformer provides global context and a conditional diffusion head generates numeric fields steered by task-specific tokens. Besides the new high SOTAs on structure prediction tasks, the model demonstrates state-of-the-art or competitive performance for the function-aware generation across domains: in materials, it achieves "conflicted" multi-property conditional generation, yielding 436 crystal candidates meeting triple constraints, including 11 with novel compositions; in chemistry, it sets new benchmarks on five property targets and conformer ensemble generation on GEOM; and in biology, it improves success in modeling protein induced fit (RMSD < 2 {\AA}) by over 23-fold and enhances EC-conditioned enzyme design. Ablation studies and cross-domain transfer substantiate the benefits of joint discrete-continuous training, establishing UniGenX as a significant advance from prediction to controllable, function-aware generation.</p></details> |  |

The field faces challenges because electromagnetic signals differ greatly from text and images, showing high heterogeneity, strong background noise and complex joint time frequency structure, which prevents existing general models from direct use. Electromagnetic communication and sensing tasks are diverse, current methods lack cross task generalization and transfer efficiency, and the scarcity of large high quality datasets blocks the creation of a truly general multitask learning framework. To overcome these issue, we introduce EMind, an electromagnetic signals foundation model that bridges large scale pretraining and the unique nature of this modality. We build the first unified and largest standardized electromagnetic signal dataset covering multiple signal types and tasks. By exploiting the physical properties of electromagnetic signals, we devise a length adaptive multi-signal packing method and a hardware-aware training strategy that enable efficient use and representation learning from heterogeneous multi-source signals. Experiments show that EMind achieves strong performance and broad generalization across many downstream tasks, moving decisively from task specific models to a unified framework for electromagnetic intelligence.

However, building analogous models for human mobility remains challenging due to the privacy-sensitive nature of mobility data and the resulting data silos across institutions. To bridge this gap, we propose MoveGCL, a scalable and privacy-preserving framework for training mobility foundation models via generative continual learning. Without sharing raw data, MoveGCL enables decentralized and progressive model evolution by replaying synthetic trajectories generated from a frozen teacher model, and reinforces knowledge retention through a tailored distillation strategy that mitigates catastrophic forgetting. To address the heterogeneity of mobility patterns, MoveGCL incorporates a Mixture-of-Experts Transformer with a mobility-aware expert routing mechanism, and employs a layer-wise progressive adaptation strategy to stabilize continual updates. Experiments on six real-world urban datasets demonstrate that MoveGCL achieves performance comparable to joint training and significantly outperforms federated learning baselines, while offering strong privacy protection. MoveGCL marks a crucial step toward unlocking foundation models for mobility, offering a practical blueprint for open, scalable, and privacy-preserving model development in the era of foundation models. To facilitate reproducibility and future research, we have released the code and models at https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/MoveGCL.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 3...</summary><p>The 33rd ACM International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems</p></details> |

Both models are trained on large-scale multilingual and multimodal datasets sourced via responsible web crawling, licensed corpora, and high-quality synthetic data, then further refined with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning on a new asynchronous platform. The resulting models support several additional languages while understanding images and executing tool calls. In public benchmarks and human evaluations, both the server model and the on-device model match or surpass comparably sized open baselines.

| **[fLSA: Learning Semantic Structures in Document Collections Using Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05481v2)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans can learn to solve new tasks by inducing high-level strategies from example solutions to similar problems and then adapting these strategies to solve unseen problems. Can we use large language models to induce such high-level structure from example documents or solutions? We introduce fLSA, a foundation-model-based Latent Semantic Analysis method that iteratively clusters and tags document segments based on document-level contexts. These tags can be used to model the latent structure of given documents and for hierarchical sampling of new texts. Our experiments on story writing, math, and multi-step reasoning datasets demonstrate that fLSA tags are more informative in reconstructing the original texts than existing tagging methods. Moreover, when used for hierarchical sampling, fLSA tags help expand the output space in the right directions that lead to correct solutions more often than direct sampling and hierarchical sampling with existing tagging methods.

| **[Why Relational Graphs Will Save the Next Generation of Vision Foundation Models?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18421v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision foundation models (FMs) have become the predominant architecture in computer vision, providing highly transferable representations learned from large-scale, multimodal corpora. Nonetheless, they exhibit persistent limitations on tasks that require explicit reasoning over entities, roles, and spatio-temporal relations. Such relational competence is indispensable for fine-grained human activity recognition, egocentric video understanding, and multimodal medical image analysis, where spatial, temporal, and semantic dependencies are decisive for performance. We advance the position that next-generation FMs should incorporate explicit relational interfaces, instantiated as dynamic relational graphs (graphs whose topology and edge semantics are inferred from the input and task context). We illustrate this position with cross-domain evidence from recent systems in human manipulation action recognition and brain tumor segmentation, showing that augmenting FMs with lightweight, context-adaptive graph-reasoning modules improves fine-grained semantic fidelity, out of distribution robustness, interpretability, and computational efficiency relative to FM only baselines. Importantly, by reasoning sparsely over semantic nodes, such hybrids also achieve favorable memory and hardware efficiency, enabling deployment under practical resource constraints. We conclude with a targeted research agenda for FM graph hybrids, prioritizing learned dynamic graph construction, multi-level relational reasoning (e.g., part object scene in activity understanding, or region organ in medical imaging), cross-modal fusion, and evaluation protocols that directly probe relational competence in structured vision tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[TOMATO: Assessing Visual Temporal Reasoning Capabilities in Multimodal Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23266v2)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing benchmarks often highlight the remarkable performance achieved by state-of-the-art Multimodal Foundation Models (MFMs) in leveraging temporal context for video understanding. However, how well do the models truly perform visual temporal reasoning? Our study of existing benchmarks shows that this capability of MFMs is likely overestimated as many questions can be solved by using a single, few, or out-of-order frames. To systematically examine current visual temporal reasoning tasks, we propose three principles with corresponding metrics: (1) Multi-Frame Gain, (2) Frame Order Sensitivity, and (3) Frame Information Disparity. Following these principles, we introduce TOMATO, Temporal Reasoning Multimodal Evaluation, a novel benchmark crafted to rigorously assess MFMs' temporal reasoning capabilities in video understanding. TOMATO comprises 1,484 carefully curated, human-annotated questions spanning six tasks (i.e., action count, direction, rotation, shape & trend, velocity & frequency, and visual cues), applied to 1,417 videos, including 805 self-recorded and -generated videos, that encompass human-centric, real-world, and simulated scenarios. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals a human-model performance gap of 57.3% with the best-performing model. Moreover, our in-depth analysis uncovers more fundamental limitations beyond this gap in current MFMs. While they can accurately recognize events in isolated frames, they fail to interpret these frames as a continuous sequence. We believe TOMATO will serve as a crucial testbed for evaluating the next-generation MFMs and as a call to the community to develop AI systems capable of comprehending human world dynamics through the video modality.</p></details> |  |
| **[A foundation model with multi-variate parallel attention to generate neuronal activity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20354v2)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning from multi-variate time-series with heterogeneous channel configurations remains a fundamental challenge for deep neural networks, particularly in clinical domains such as intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG), where channel setups vary widely across subjects. In this work, we introduce multi-variate parallel attention (MVPA), a novel self-attention mechanism that disentangles content, temporal, and spatial attention, enabling flexible, generalizable, and efficient modeling of time-series data with varying channel counts and configurations. We use MVPA to build MVPFormer, a generative foundation model for human electrophysiology, trained to predict the evolution of iEEG signals across diverse subjects. To support this and future efforts by the community, we release the SWEC iEEG dataset, the largest publicly available iEEG dataset to date, comprising nearly 10,000 hours of recordings from heterogeneous clinical sources. MVPFormer leverages MVPA to achieve strong generalization across subjects, demonstrating expert-level performance in several iEEG tasks. MVPFormer surpasses state-of-the-art Transformer baselines in seizure detection across the SWEC, the MAYO, and the FNUSA datasets, while also achieving state-of-the-art performance on four Brain TreeBank iEEG decoding tasks. We further validate MVPA on standard time-series forecasting and classification tasks, where it matches or exceeds the performance of existing attention-based models. Together, our contributions establish MVPA as a general-purpose attention mechanism for heterogeneous time-series and MVPFormer as the first open-source, open-weights, and open-data iEEG foundation model with SOTA clinical performance.

However, existing monocular depth estimation techniques often exhibit limited performance to the varying illumination and complex textures of the surgical environment. While powerful visual foundation models offer a promising solution, their training on natural images leads to significant domain adaptability limitations and semantic perception deficiencies when applied to endoscopy. In this study, we introduce EndoUFM, an unsupervised monocular depth estimation framework that innovatively integrating dual foundation models for surgical scenes, which enhance the depth estimation performance by leveraging the powerful pre-learned priors. The framework features a novel adaptive fine-tuning strategy that incorporates Random Vector Low-Rank Adaptation (RVLoRA) to enhance model adaptability, and a Residual block based on Depthwise Separable Convolution (Res-DSC) to improve the capture of fine-grained local features. Furthermore, we design a mask-guided smoothness loss to enforce depth consistency within anatomical tissue structures. Extensive experiments on the SCARED, Hamlyn, SERV-CT, and EndoNeRF datasets confirm that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining an efficient model size. This work contributes to augmenting surgeons' spatial perception during minimally invasive procedures, thereby enhancing surgical precision and safety, with crucial implications for augmented reality and navigation systems.</p></details> | 12 pages |
| **[UniSino: Physics-Driven Foundational Model for Universal CT Sinogram Standardization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17816v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>During raw-data acquisition in CT imaging, diverse factors can degrade the collected sinograms, with undersampling and noise leading to severe artifacts and noise in reconstructed images and compromising diagnostic accuracy. Conventional correction methods rely on manually designed algorithms or fixed empirical parameters, but these approaches often lack generalizability across heterogeneous artifact types. To address these limitations, we propose UniSino, a foundation model for universal CT sinogram standardization. Unlike existing foundational models that operate in image domain, UniSino directly standardizes data in the projection domain, which enables stronger generalization across diverse undersampling scenarios. Its training framework incorporates the physical characteristics of sinograms, enhancing generalization and enabling robust performance across multiple subtasks spanning four benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate thatUniSino achieves superior reconstruction quality both single and mixed undersampling case, demonstrating exceptional robustness and generalization in sinogram enhancement for CT imaging. The code is available at: https://github.com/yqx7150/UniSino.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Mixture of Exemplars Approach for Efficient Out-of-Distribution Detection with Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17093v6)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the early weaknesses identified in deep neural networks trained for image classification tasks was their inability to provide low confidence predictions on out-of-distribution (OOD) data that was significantly different from the in-distribution (ID) data used to train them. Representation learning, where neural networks are trained in specific ways that improve their ability to detect OOD examples, has emerged as a promising solution. However, these approaches require long training times and can add additional overhead to detect OOD examples. Recent developments in Vision Transformer (ViT) foundation models$\unicode{x2013}$large networks trained on large and diverse datasets with self-supervised approaches$\unicode{x2013}$also show strong performance in OOD detection, and could address these challenges. This paper presents Mixture of Exemplars (MoLAR), an efficient approach to tackling OOD detection challenges that is designed to maximise the benefit of training a classifier with a high quality, frozen, pretrained foundation model backbone. MoLAR provides strong OOD detection performance when only comparing the similarity of OOD examples to the exemplars, a small set of images chosen to be representative of the dataset, leading to significantly reduced overhead for OOD detection inference over other methods that provide best performance when the full ID dataset is used. Extensive experiments demonstrate the improved OOD detection performance of MoLAR in comparison to comparable approaches in both supervised and semi-supervised settings, and code is available at github.com/emannix/molar-mixture-of-exemplars.</p></details> |  |
| **[EEG-FM-Bench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for the Systematic Evaluation of EEG Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17742v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electroencephalography (EEG) foundation models are poised to significantly advance brain signal analysis by learning robust representations from large-scale, unlabeled datasets. However, their rapid proliferation has outpaced the development of standardized evaluation benchmarks, which complicates direct model comparisons and hinders systematic scientific progress. This fragmentation fosters scientific inefficiency and obscures genuine architectural advancements. To address this critical gap, we introduce EEG-FM-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark for the systematic and standardized evaluation of EEG foundation models (EEG-FMs). Our contributions are threefold: (1) we curate a diverse suite of downstream tasks and datasets from canonical EEG paradigms, implementing standardized processing and evaluation protocols within a unified open-source framework; (2) we benchmark prominent state-of-the-art foundation models to establish comprehensive baseline results for a clear comparison of the current landscape; (3) we perform qualitative analyses of the learned representations to provide insights into model behavior and inform future architectural design. Through extensive experiments, we find that fine-grained spatio-temporal feature interaction, multitask unified training and neuropsychological priors would contribute to enhancing model performance and generalization capabilities. By offering a unified platform for fair comparison and reproducible research, EEG-FM-Bench seeks to catalyze progress and guide the community toward the development of more robust and generalizable EEG-FMs. Code is released at https://github.com/xw1216/EEG-FM-Bench.</p></details> | 17 pages, 7 pages |

While deep learning and pretrained foundation models show strong potential for improved generalization via lightweight adaptation of the final layers ('probing'), their robustness to unseen viewpoints remains underexplored. We study this challenge by adapting image foundation models to driver monitoring using a single training view, and evaluating them directly on unseen perspectives without further adaptation. We benchmark simple linear probes, advanced probing strategies, and compare two foundation models (DINOv2 and CLIP) against parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) and full fine-tuning. Building on these insights, we introduce T-MASK -- a new image-to-video probing method that leverages temporal token masking and emphasizes more dynamic video regions. Benchmarked on the public Drive&Act dataset, T-MASK improves cross-view top-1 accuracy by $+1.23\%$ over strong probing baselines and $+8.0\%$ over PEFT methods, without adding any parameters. It proves particularly effective for underrepresented secondary activities, boosting recognition by $+5.42\%$ under the trained view and $+1.36\%$ under cross-view settings. This work provides encouraging evidence that adapting foundation models with lightweight probing methods like T-MASK has strong potential in fine-grained driver observation, especially in cross-view and low-data settings. These results highlight the importance of temporal token selection when leveraging foundation models to build robust driver monitoring systems. Code and models will be made available at https://github.com/th-nesh/T-MASK to support ongoing research.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by 26th IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems ITSC 2025</p></details> |
| **[Longitudinal Progression Prediction of Alzheimer's Disease with Tabular Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17649v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that remains challenging to predict due to its multifactorial etiology and the complexity of multimodal clinical data. Accurate forecasting of clinically relevant biomarkers, including diagnostic and quantitative measures, is essential for effective monitoring of disease progression. This work introduces L2C-TabPFN, a method that integrates a longitudinal-to-cross-sectional (L2C) transformation with a pre-trained Tabular Foundation Model (TabPFN) to predict Alzheimer's disease outcomes using the TADPOLE dataset. L2C-TabPFN converts sequential patient records into fixed-length feature vectors, enabling robust prediction of diagnosis, cognitive scores, and ventricular volume. Experimental results demonstrate that, while L2C-TabPFN achieves competitive performance on diagnostic and cognitive outcomes, it provides state-of-the-art results in ventricular volume prediction. This key imaging biomarker reflects neurodegeneration and progression in Alzheimer's disease. These findings highlight the potential of tabular foundational models for advancing longitudinal prediction of clinically relevant imaging markers in Alzheimer's disease.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pixel Perfect MegaMed: A Megapixel-Scale Vision-Language Foundation Model for Generating High Resolution Medical Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12698v2)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical image synthesis presents unique challenges due to the inherent complexity and high-resolution details required in clinical contexts. Traditional generative architectures such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) or Variational Auto Encoder (VAEs) have shown great promise for high-resolution image generation but struggle with preserving fine-grained details that are key for accurate diagnosis. To address this issue, we introduce Pixel Perfect MegaMed, the first vision-language foundation model to synthesize images at resolutions of 1024x1024. Our method deploys a multi-scale transformer architecture designed specifically for ultra-high resolution medical image generation, enabling the preservation of both global anatomical context and local image-level details. By leveraging vision-language alignment techniques tailored to medical terminology and imaging modalities, Pixel Perfect MegaMed bridges the gap between textual descriptions and visual representations at unprecedented resolution levels. We apply our model to the CheXpert dataset and demonstrate its ability to generate clinically faithful chest X-rays from text prompts. Beyond visual quality, these high-resolution synthetic images prove valuable for downstream tasks such as classification, showing measurable performance gains when used for data augmentation, particularly in low-data regimes. Our code is accessible through the project website - https://tehraninasab.github.io/pixelperfect-megamed.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Foundation of Distributionally Robust Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09018v4)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by the need for a robust policy in the face of environment shifts between training and deployment, we contribute to the theoretical foundation of distributionally robust reinforcement learning (DRRL). This is accomplished through a comprehensive modeling framework centered around robust Markov decision processes (RMDPs). This framework obliges the decision maker to choose an optimal policy under the worst-case distributional shift orchestrated by an adversary. By unifying and extending existing formulations, we rigorously construct RMDPs that embrace various modeling attributes for both the decision maker and the adversary. These attributes include the structure of information availability-covering history-dependent, Markov, and Markov time-homogeneous dynamics-as well as constraints on the shifts induced by the adversary, with a focus on SA- and S-rectangularity. Within this RMDP framework, we investigate conditions for the existence or absence of the dynamic programming principle (DPP). From an algorithmic standpoint, the existence of DPP holds significant implications, as the vast majority of existing data and computationally efficient DRRL algorithms are reliant on the DPP. To investigate its existence, we systematically analyze various combinations of controller and adversary attributes, presenting streamlined proofs based on a unified methodology. We then construct counterexamples for settings where a fully general DPP fails to hold and establish asymptotically optimal history-dependent policies for key scenarios where the DPP is absent.</p></details> |  |
| **[OmniMRI: A Unified Vision--Language Foundation Model for Generalist MRI Interpretation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17524v1)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is indispensable in clinical practice but remains constrained by fragmented, multi-stage workflows encompassing acquisition, reconstruction, segmentation, detection, diagnosis, and reporting. While deep learning has achieved progress in individual tasks, existing approaches are often anatomy- or application-specific and lack generalizability across diverse clinical settings. Moreover, current pipelines rarely integrate imaging data with complementary language information that radiologists rely on in routine practice. Here, we introduce OmniMRI, a unified vision-language foundation model designed to generalize across the entire MRI workflow. OmniMRI is trained on a large-scale, heterogeneous corpus curated from 60 public datasets, over 220,000 MRI volumes and 19 million MRI slices, incorporating image-only data, paired vision-text data, and instruction-response data. Its multi-stage training paradigm, comprising self-supervised vision pretraining, vision-language alignment, multimodal pretraining, and multi-task instruction tuning, progressively equips the model with transferable visual representations, cross-modal reasoning, and robust instruction-following capabilities. Qualitative results demonstrate OmniMRI's ability to perform diverse tasks within a single architecture, including MRI reconstruction, anatomical and pathological segmentation, abnormality detection, diagnostic suggestion, and radiology report generation. These findings highlight OmniMRI's potential to consolidate fragmented pipelines into a scalable, generalist framework, paving the way toward foundation models that unify imaging and clinical language for comprehensive, end-to-end MRI interpretation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Intern-S1: A Scientific Multimodal Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15763v2)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, a plethora of open-source foundation models have emerged, achieving remarkable progress in some widely attended fields, with performance being quite close to that of closed-source models. However, in high-value but more challenging scientific professional fields, either the fields still rely on expert models, or the progress of general foundation models lags significantly compared to those in popular areas, far from sufficient for transforming scientific research and leaving substantial gap between open-source models and closed-source models in these scientific domains. To mitigate this gap and explore a step further toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), we introduce Intern-S1, a specialized generalist equipped with general understanding and reasoning capabilities with expertise to analyze multiple science modal data. Intern-S1 is a multimodal Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model with 28 billion activated parameters and 241 billion total parameters, continually pre-trained on 5T tokens, including over 2.5T tokens from scientific domains. In the post-training stage, Intern-S1 undergoes offline and then online reinforcement learning (RL) in InternBootCamp, where we propose Mixture-of-Rewards (MoR) to synergize the RL training on more than 1000 tasks simultaneously. Through integrated innovations in algorithms, data, and training systems, Intern-S1 achieved top-tier performance in online RL training. On comprehensive evaluation benchmarks, Intern-S1 demonstrates competitive performance on general reasoning tasks among open-source models and significantly outperforms open-source models in scientific domains, surpassing closed-source state-of-the-art models in professional tasks, such as molecular synthesis planning, reaction condition prediction, predicting thermodynamic stabilities for crystals.

Despite significant advancements driven by deep learning (DL) in recent years, existing DL-based methods, typically trained on a specific dose level and anatomical region, struggle to handle diverse noise characteristics and anatomical heterogeneity during varied scanning conditions, limiting their generalizability and robustness in clinical scenarios. In this paper, we propose FoundDiff, a foundational diffusion model for unified and generalizable LDCT denoising across various dose levels and anatomical regions. FoundDiff employs a two-stage strategy: (i) dose-anatomy perception and (ii) adaptive denoising. First, we develop a dose- and anatomy-aware contrastive language image pre-training model (DA-CLIP) to achieve robust dose and anatomy perception by leveraging specialized contrastive learning strategies to learn continuous representations that quantify ordinal dose variations and identify salient anatomical regions. Second, we design a dose- and anatomy-aware diffusion model (DA-Diff) to perform adaptive and generalizable denoising by synergistically integrating the learned dose and anatomy embeddings from DACLIP into diffusion process via a novel dose and anatomy conditional block (DACB) based on Mamba. Extensive experiments on two public LDCT datasets encompassing eight dose levels and three anatomical regions demonstrate superior denoising performance of FoundDiff over existing state-of-the-art methods and the remarkable generalization to unseen dose levels. The codes and models are available at https://github.com/hao1635/FoundDiff.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |

Built on the Quick-Tune hyperparameter optimization framework, QTT-SEG predicts high-performing configurations using meta-learned cost and performance models, efficiently navigating a search space of over 200 million possibilities. We evaluate QTT-SEG on eight binary and five multiclass segmentation datasets under tight time constraints. Our results show that QTT-SEG consistently improves upon SAM's zero-shot performance and surpasses AutoGluon Multimodal, a strong AutoML baseline, on most binary tasks within three minutes. On multiclass datasets, QTT-SEG delivers consistent gains as well. These findings highlight the promise of meta-learning in automating model adaptation for specialized segmentation tasks.

Accurate and reliable pain evaluation for the people suffering is crucial to developing effective and advanced pain management protocols. Automatic pain assessment systems provide continuous monitoring and support decision-making processes, ultimately aiming to alleviate distress and prevent functionality decline. This study introduces PainFormer, a vision foundation model based on multi-task learning principles trained simultaneously on 14 tasks/datasets with a total of 10.9 million samples. Functioning as an embedding extractor for various input modalities, the foundation model provides feature representations to the Embedding-Mixer, a transformer-based module that performs the final pain assessment. Extensive experiments employing behavioral modalities - including RGB, synthetic thermal, and estimated depth videos - and physiological modalities such as ECG, EMG, GSR, and fNIRS revealed that PainFormer effectively extracts high-quality embeddings from diverse input modalities. The proposed framework is evaluated on two pain datasets, BioVid and AI4Pain, and directly compared to 75 different methodologies documented in the literature. Experiments conducted in unimodal and multimodal settings demonstrate state-of-the-art performances across modalities and pave the way toward general-purpose models for automatic pain assessment.

We introduce Mantis, a foundation model trained entirely on mechanistic simulations, which enables out-of-the-box forecasting across diseases, regions, and outcomes, even in settings with limited historical data. Mantis is built on over 400 million simulated days of outbreak dynamics spanning diverse pathogens, transmission modes, interventions, and surveillance artifacts. Despite requiring no real-world data during training, Mantis outperformed 39 expert-tuned models we tested across six diseases, including all models in the CDC's COVID-19 Forecast Hub. Mantis generalized to novel epidemiological regimes, including diseases with held-out transmission mechanisms, demonstrating that it captures fundamental contagion dynamics. Critically, Mantis is mechanistically interpretable, enabling public health decision-makers to identify the latent drivers behind its predictions. Finally, Mantis delivers accurate forecasts at 8-week horizons, more than doubling the actionable range of most models, enabling proactive public health planning. Together, these capabilities position Mantis as a foundation for next-generation disease forecasting systems: general, interpretable, and deployable where traditional models fail.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |

These systems have evolved into complex, multilayered architectures that leverage vast datasets and often incorporate thousands of predictive models. The maintenance and enhancement of these models is a labor intensive process that requires extensive feature engineering. This approach not only exacerbates technical debt but also hampers innovation in extending these systems to emerging problem domains. In this report, we present our research to address these challenges by utilizing a large foundation model with a textual interface for ranking and recommendation tasks. We illustrate several key advantages of our approach: (1) a single model can manage multiple predictive tasks involved in ranking and recommendation, (2) decoder models with textual interface due to their comprehension of reasoning capabilities, can generalize to new recommendation surfaces and out-of-domain problems, and (3) by employing natural language interfaces for task definitions and verbalizing member behaviors and their social connections, we eliminate the need for feature engineering and the maintenance of complex directed acyclic graphs of model dependencies. We introduce our research pre-production model, 360Brew V1.0, a 150B parameter, decoder-only model that has been trained and fine-tuned on LinkedIn's data and tasks. This model is capable of solving over 30 predictive tasks across various segments of the LinkedIn platform, achieving performance levels comparable to or exceeding those of current production systems based on offline metrics, without task-specific fine-tuning. Notably, each of these tasks is conventionally addressed by dedicated models that have been developed and maintained over multiple years by teams of a similar or larger size than our own.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we developed and validated RenalCLIP using a dataset of 27,866 CT scans from 8,809 patients across nine Chinese medical centers and the public TCIA cohort, a visual-language foundation model for characterization, diagnosis and prognosis of renal mass. The model was developed via a two-stage pre-training strategy that first enhances the image and text encoders with domain-specific knowledge before aligning them through a contrastive learning objective, to create robust representations for superior generalization and diagnostic precision. RenalCLIP achieved better performance and superior generalizability across 10 core tasks spanning the full clinical workflow of kidney cancer, including anatomical assessment, diagnostic classification, and survival prediction, compared with other state-of-the-art general-purpose CT foundation models. Especially, for complicated task like recurrence-free survival prediction in the TCIA cohort, RenalCLIP achieved a C-index of 0.726, representing a substantial improvement of approximately 20% over the leading baselines. Furthermore, RenalCLIP's pre-training imparted remarkable data efficiency; in the diagnostic classification task, it only needs 20% training data to achieve the peak performance of all baseline models even after they were fully fine-tuned on 100% of the data. Additionally, it achieved superior performance in report generation, image-text retrieval and zero-shot diagnosis tasks. Our findings establish that RenalCLIP provides a robust tool with the potential to enhance diagnostic accuracy, refine prognostic stratification, and personalize the management of patients with kidney cancer.</p></details> |  |

Federated learning (FL) provides a privacy-aware alternative, but existing FL approaches overlook the constraints imposed by edge devices -- namely, limited computational resources and the scarcity of labeled data. To address these challenges, we introduce Practical Semi-Supervised Federated Learning (PSSFL), where edge devices hold only unlabeled, low-resolution data, while the server has limited labeled, high-resolution data. In this setting, we propose the Federated Mixture of Experts (FedMox), a novel framework that enhances FM adaptation in FL. FedMox tackles computational and resolution mismatch challenges via a sparse Mixture-of-Experts architecture, employing a spatial router to align features across resolutions and a Soft-Mixture strategy to stabilize semi-supervised learning. We take object detection as a case study, and experiments on real-world autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that FedMox effectively adapts FMs under PSSFL, significantly improving performance with constrained memory costs on edge devices. Our work paves the way for scalable and privacy-preserving FM adaptation in federated scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Investigation of Visual Foundation Models Robustness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16225v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) are becoming ubiquitous in computer vision, powering systems for diverse tasks such as object detection, image classification, segmentation, pose estimation, and motion tracking. VFMs are capitalizing on seminal innovations in deep learning models, such as LeNet-5, AlexNet, ResNet, VGGNet, InceptionNet, DenseNet, YOLO, and ViT, to deliver superior performance across a range of critical computer vision applications. These include security-sensitive domains like biometric verification, autonomous vehicle perception, and medical image analysis, where robustness is essential to fostering trust between technology and the end-users. This article investigates network robustness requirements crucial in computer vision systems to adapt effectively to dynamic environments influenced by factors such as lighting, weather conditions, and sensor characteristics. We examine the prevalent empirical defenses and robust training employed to enhance vision network robustness against real-world challenges such as distributional shifts, noisy and spatially distorted inputs, and adversarial attacks. Subsequently, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the challenges associated with these defense mechanisms, including network properties and components to guide ablation studies and benchmarking metrics to evaluate network robustness.</p></details> |  |

However, the rapid proliferation of these techniques has led to a fragmented research landscape, characterized by diverse model roles, inconsistent architectures, and a lack of systematic categorization. To bridge this gap, this study presents the first comprehensive modality-oriented taxonomy for foundation models in EEG analysis, systematically organizing research advances based on output modalities of the native EEG decoding, EEG-text, EEG-vision, EEG-audio, and broader multimodal frameworks. We rigorously analyze each category's research ideas, theoretical foundations, and architectural innovations, while highlighting open challenges such as model interpretability, cross-domain generalization, and real-world applicability in EEG-based systems. By unifying this dispersed field, our work not only provides a reference framework for future methodology development but accelerates the translation of EEG foundation models into scalable, interpretable, and online actionable solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Journals</p></details> |

Despite the promise of foundation models in medical diagnostics, comprehensive AI solutions for RBC analysis remain scarce. We present RedDino, a self-supervised foundation model designed for RBC image analysis. RedDino uses an RBC-specific adaptation of the DINOv2 self-supervised learning framework and is trained on a curated dataset of 1.25 million RBC images from diverse acquisition modalities and sources. Extensive evaluations show that RedDino outperforms existing state-of-the-art models on RBC shape classification. Through assessments including linear probing and nearest neighbor classification, we confirm its strong feature representations and generalization ability. Our main contributions are: (1) a foundation model tailored for RBC analysis, (2) ablation studies exploring DINOv2 configurations for RBC modeling, and (3) a detailed evaluation of generalization performance. RedDino addresses key challenges in computational hematology by capturing nuanced morphological features, advancing the development of reliable diagnostic tools. The source code and pretrained models for RedDino are available at https://github.com/Snarci/RedDino, and the pretrained models can be downloaded from our Hugging Face collection at https://huggingface.co/collections/Snarcy/reddino-689a13e29241d2e5690202fc</p></details> |  |
| **[Ensemble learning of foundation models for precision oncology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16085v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Histopathology is essential for disease diagnosis and treatment decision-making. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have enabled the development of pathology foundation models that learn rich visual representations from large-scale whole-slide images (WSIs). However, existing models are often trained on disparate datasets using varying strategies, leading to inconsistent performance and limited generalizability. Here, we introduce ELF (Ensemble Learning of Foundation models), a novel framework that integrates five state-of-the-art pathology foundation models to generate unified slide-level representations. Trained on 53,699 WSIs spanning 20 anatomical sites, ELF leverages ensemble learning to capture complementary information from diverse models while maintaining high data efficiency. Unlike traditional tile-level models, ELF's slide-level architecture is particularly advantageous in clinical contexts where data are limited, such as therapeutic response prediction. We evaluated ELF across a wide range of clinical applications, including disease classification, biomarker detection, and response prediction to major anticancer therapies, cytotoxic chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy, across multiple cancer types. ELF consistently outperformed all constituent foundation models and existing slide-level models, demonstrating superior accuracy and robustness. Our results highlight the power of ensemble learning for pathology foundation models and suggest ELF as a scalable and generalizable solution for advancing AI-assisted precision oncology.</p></details> | <details><summary>A con...</summary><p>A conceptual evaluation work; more studies are in progress; examples are here (https://github.com/lilab-stanford/ELF)</p></details> |
| **[Training a Foundation Model for Materials on a Budget](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16067v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models for materials modeling are advancing quickly, but their training remains expensive, often placing state-of-the-art methods out of reach for many research groups. We introduce Nequix, a compact E(3)-equivariant potential that pairs a simplified NequIP design with modern training practices, including equivariant root-mean-square layer normalization and the Muon optimizer, to retain accuracy while substantially reducing compute requirements. Built in JAX, Nequix has 700K parameters and was trained in 500 A100-GPU hours. On the Matbench-Discovery and MDR Phonon benchmarks, Nequix ranks third overall while requiring less than one quarter of the training cost of most other methods, and it delivers an order-of-magnitude faster inference speed than the current top-ranked model. We release model weights and fully reproducible codebase at https://github.com/atomicarchitects/nequix</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative Foundation Model for Structured and Unstructured Electronic Health Records](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16054v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electronic health records (EHRs) are rich clinical data sources but complex repositories of patient data, spanning structured elements (demographics, vitals, lab results, codes), unstructured clinical notes and other modalities of data. Harnessing this heterogeneity is critical for improving patient outcomes. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled foundation models that can learn from multiple data modalities and support clinical tasks. However, most current approaches simply serialize numeric EHR data into text, which risks losing temporal and quantitative detail. We introduce Generative Deep Patient (GDP), a multimodal foundation model that natively encodes structured EHR time-series via a CNN-Transformer encoder and fuses it with unstructured EHRs through cross-modal attention into a LLaMA-based decoder. GDP is trained in two stages: (1) generative pretraining, where it learns to produce clinical narratives from raw patient timelines while also performing masked feature prediction (MFP) and next time-step prediction (NTP) to capture temporal dynamics; and (2) multi-task fine-tuning for clinically meaningful predictions (e.g., heart failure, type 2 diabetes, 30-day readmission). In clinical prediction, GDP demonstrated superior performance on MIMIC-IV: heart failure AUROC = 0.923, type 2 diabetes AUROC = 0.817, and 30-day readmission AUROC = 0.627. For narrative generation, GDP achieved ROUGE-L = 0.135 and BERTScore-F1 = 0.545. In a blinded human evaluation, GDP-Instruct scored highest on faithfulness, fluency, and overall clinical utility, suggesting reduced hospital documentation workload without sacrificing accuracy. Our results demonstrate that a single multimodal foundation model can both predict clinically actionable events and generate high-quality clinical narratives. Furthermore, GDP's flexible architecture can be extended to additional modalities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Boosting Pathology Foundation Models via Few-shot Prompt-tuning for Rare Cancer Subtyping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15904v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rare cancers comprise 20-25% of all malignancies but face major diagnostic challenges due to limited expert availability-especially in pediatric oncology, where they represent over 70% of cases. While pathology vision-language (VL) foundation models show promising zero-shot capabilities for common cancer subtyping, their clinical performance for rare cancers remains limited. Existing multi-instance learning (MIL) methods rely only on visual features, overlooking cross-modal knowledge and compromising interpretability critical for rare cancer diagnosis. To address this limitation, we propose PathPT, a novel framework that fully exploits the potential of vision-language pathology foundation models through spatially-aware visual aggregation and task-specific prompt tuning. Unlike conventional MIL, PathPT converts WSI-level supervision into fine-grained tile-level guidance by leveraging the zero-shot capabilities of VL models, thereby preserving localization on cancerous regions and enabling cross-modal reasoning through prompts aligned with histopathological semantics. We benchmark PathPT on eight rare cancer datasets(four adult and four pediatric) spanning 56 subtypes and 2,910 WSIs, as well as three common cancer datasets, evaluating four state-of-the-art VL models and four MIL frameworks under three few-shot settings. Results show that PathPT consistently delivers superior performance, achieving substantial gains in subtyping accuracy and cancerous region grounding ability. This work advances AI-assisted diagnosis for rare cancers, offering a scalable solution for improving subtyping accuracy in settings with limited access to specialized expertise.</p></details> |  |
| **[Surya: Foundation Model for Heliophysics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14112v2)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heliophysics is central to understanding and forecasting space weather events and solar activity. Despite decades of high-resolution observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), most models remain task-specific and constrained by scarce labeled data, limiting their capacity to generalize across solar phenomena. We introduce Surya, a 366M parameter foundation model for heliophysics designed to learn general-purpose solar representations from multi-instrument SDO observations, including eight Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) channels and five Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) products. Surya employs a spatiotemporal transformer architecture with spectral gating and long--short range attention, pretrained on high-resolution solar image forecasting tasks and further optimized through autoregressive rollout tuning. Zero-shot evaluations demonstrate its ability to forecast solar dynamics and flare events, while downstream fine-tuning with parameter-efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) shows strong performance on solar wind forecasting, active region segmentation, solar flare forecasting, and EUV spectra. Surya is the first foundation model in heliophysics that uses time advancement as a pretext task on full-resolution SDO data. Its novel architecture and performance suggest that the model is able to learn the underlying physics behind solar evolution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Continuous and algebraic domains in univalent foundations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06956v4)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop the theory of continuous and algebraic domains in constructive and predicative univalent foundations, building upon our earlier work on basic domain theory in this setting. That we work predicatively means that we do not assume Voevodsky's propositional resizing axioms. Our work is constructive in the sense that we do not rely on excluded middle or the axiom of (countable) choice. To deal with size issues and give a predicatively suitable definition of continuity of a dcpo, we follow Johnstone and Joyal's work on continuous categories. Adhering to the univalent perspective, we explicitly distinguish between data and property. To ensure that being continuous is a property of a dcpo, we turn to the propositional truncation, although we explain that some care is needed to avoid needing the axiom of choice. We also adapt the notion of a domain-theoretic basis to the predicative setting by imposing suitable smallness conditions, analogous to the categorical concept of an accessible category. All our running examples of continuous dcpos are then actually examples of dcpos with small bases which we show to be well behaved predicatively. In particular, such dcpos are exactly those presented by small ideals. As an application of the theory, we show that Scott's $D_\infty$ model of the untyped $\lambda$-calculus is an example of an algebraic dcpo with a small basis. Our work is formalised in the Agda proof assistant and its ability to infer universe levels has been invaluable for our purposes.</p></details> | <details><summary>v4: A...</summary><p>v4: Accepted for publication in the Journal of Pure and Applied Algebra.

| **[LLaSO: A Foundational Framework for Reproducible Research in Large Language and Speech Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15418v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of Large Speech-Language Models (LSLMs) has been slowed by fragmented architectures and a lack of transparency, hindering the systematic comparison and reproducibility of research. Unlike in the vision-language domain, the LSLM field suffers from the common practice of releasing model weights without their corresponding training data and configurations. To address these critical gaps, we introduce LLaSO, the first fully open, end-to-end framework for large-scale speech-language modeling. LLaSO provides the community with three essential resources: (1) LLaSO-Align, a 12M-instance speech-text alignment corpus; (2) LLaSO-Instruct, a 13.5M-instance multi-task instruction-tuning dataset; and (3) LLaSO-Eval, a reproducible benchmark for standardized evaluation. To validate our framework, we build and release LLaSO-Base, a 3.8B-parameter reference model trained exclusively on our public data. It achieves a normalized score of 0.72, establishing a strong, reproducible baseline that surpasses comparable models. Our analysis reveals that while broader training coverage enhances performance, significant generalization gaps persist on unseen tasks, particularly in pure audio scenarios. By releasing the complete stack of data, benchmarks, and models, LLaSO establishes a foundational open standard to unify research efforts and accelerate community-driven progress in LSLMs. We release the code, dataset, pretrained models, and results in https://github.com/EIT-NLP/LLaSO.</p></details> |  |

However, GenAI faces several major challenges in developing reliable and efficient GenAI-empowered systems due to its unpredictability and inefficiency. This paper advocates for a paradigm shift: future GenAI-native systems should integrate GenAI's cognitive capabilities with traditional software engineering principles to create robust, adaptive, and efficient systems. We introduce foundational GenAI-native design principles centered around five key pillars -- reliability, excellence, evolvability, self-reliance, and assurance -- and propose architectural patterns such as GenAI-native cells, organic substrates, and programmable routers to guide the creation of resilient and self-evolving systems. Additionally, we outline the key ingredients of a GenAI-native software stack and discuss the impact of these systems from technical, user adoption, economic, and legal perspectives, underscoring the need for further validation and experimentation. Our work aims to inspire future research and encourage relevant communities to implement and refine this conceptual framework.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing foundation model based methods are developed for specific IoT tasks, making it difficult to compare approaches across IoT domains and limiting guidance for applying them to new tasks. This survey aims to bridge this gap by providing a comprehensive overview of current methodologies and organizing them around four shared performance objectives by different domains: efficiency, context-awareness, safety, and security & privacy. For each objective, we review representative works, summarize commonly-used techniques and evaluation metrics. This objective-centric organization enables meaningful cross-domain comparisons and offers practical insights for selecting and designing foundation model based solutions for new IoT tasks. We conclude with key directions for future research to guide both practitioners and researchers in advancing the use of foundation models in IoT applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CCF Transactions on Pervasive Computing and Interaction</p></details> |

We present a foundational model, PinFM, for understanding user activity sequences across multiple applications at a billion-scale visual discovery platform. We pretrain a transformer model with 20B+ parameters using extensive user activity data, then fine-tune it for specific applications, efficiently coupling it with existing models. While this pretraining-and-fine-tuning approach has been popular in other domains, such as Vision and NLP, its application in industrial recommender systems presents numerous challenges. The foundational model must be scalable enough to score millions of items every second while meeting tight cost and latency constraints imposed by these systems. Additionally, it should capture the interactions between user activities and other features and handle new items that were not present during the pretraining stage. We developed innovative techniques to address these challenges. Our infrastructure and algorithmic optimizations, such as the Deduplicated Cross-Attention Transformer (DCAT), improved our throughput by 600% on Pinterest internal data. We demonstrate that PinFM can learn interactions between user sequences and candidate items by altering input sequences, leading to a 20% increase in engagement with new items. PinFM is now deployed to help improve the experience of more than half a billion users across various applications.</p></details> | clean up typos |

Despite recent advancements in foundation model adaptation to monocular depth estimation of endoscopic scenes via self-supervised learning (SSL), no prior work has explored their use for pose estimation. These methods rely on low rank-based adaptation approaches, which constrain model updates to a low-rank space. We propose Endo-FASt3r, the first monocular SSL depth and pose estimation framework that uses foundation models for both tasks. We extend the Reloc3r relative pose estimation foundation model by designing Reloc3rX, introducing modifications necessary for convergence in SSL. We also present DoMoRA, a novel adaptation technique that enables higher-rank updates and faster convergence. Experiments on the SCARED dataset show that Endo-FASt3r achieves a substantial $10\%$ improvement in pose estimation and a $2\%$ improvement in depth estimation over prior work. Similar performance gains on the Hamlyn and StereoMIS datasets reinforce the generalisability of Endo-FASt3r across different datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[TransLLM: A Unified Multi-Task Foundation Framework for Urban Transportation via Learnable Prompting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14782v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban transportation systems encounter diverse challenges across multiple tasks, such as traffic forecasting, electric vehicle (EV) charging demand prediction, and taxi dispatch. Existing approaches suffer from two key limitations: small-scale deep learning models are task-specific and data-hungry, limiting their generalizability across diverse scenarios, while large language models (LLMs), despite offering flexibility through natural language interfaces, struggle with structured spatiotemporal data and numerical reasoning in transportation domains. To address these limitations, we propose TransLLM, a unified foundation framework that integrates spatiotemporal modeling with large language models through learnable prompt composition. Our approach features a lightweight spatiotemporal encoder that captures complex dependencies via dilated temporal convolutions and dual-adjacency graph attention networks, seamlessly interfacing with LLMs through structured embeddings. A novel instance-level prompt routing mechanism, trained via reinforcement learning, dynamically personalizes prompts based on input characteristics, moving beyond fixed task-specific templates. The framework operates by encoding spatiotemporal patterns into contextual representations, dynamically composing personalized prompts to guide LLM reasoning, and projecting the resulting representations through specialized output layers to generate task-specific predictions. Experiments across seven datasets and three tasks demonstrate the exceptional effectiveness of TransLLM in both supervised and zero-shot settings. Compared to ten baseline models, it delivers competitive performance on both regression and planning problems, showing strong generalization and cross-task adaptability. Our code is available at https://github.com/BiYunying/TransLLM.</p></details> |  |

These methods require training on vast amounts of data usually with high-quality labels, which poses a bottleneck for most institutions that lack both large-scale data and high-end GPUs. On the other hand, many open-source vision models have been pretrained on domain-specific data, enabling them to distill and represent core knowledge in a form that is transferable across diverse applications. Even though these models are highly valuable assets, they remain largely under-explored in empowering the development of a general-purpose VFM. In this paper, we presents a new model-driven approach for training VFMs through joint knowledge transfer and preservation. Our method unifies multiple pre-trained teacher models in a shared latent space to mitigate the ``imbalanced transfer'' issue caused by their distributional gaps. Besides, we introduce a knowledge preservation strategy to take a general-purpose teacher as a knowledge base for integrating knowledge from the remaining purpose-specific teachers using an adapter module. By unifying and aggregating existing models, we build a powerful VFM to inherit teachers' expertise without needing to train on a large amount of labeled data. Our model not only provides generalizable visual features, but also inherently supports multiple downstream tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our VFM outperforms existing data-centric models across four fundamental vision tasks, including image classification, object detection, semantic and instance segmentation.</p></details> | Technical report |

However, existing methods have critical limitations: they extract and transfer only user representations (URs), ignoring valuable item representations (IRs) and user-item cross representations (CRs); and they simply use a UR as a feature in downstream applications, which fails to bridge upstream-downstream gaps and overlooks more transfer granularities. In this paper, we propose LFM4Ads, an All-Representation Multi-Granularity transfer framework for ads recommendation. It first comprehensively transfers URs, IRs, and CRs, i.e., all available representations in the pre-trained foundation model. To effectively utilize the CRs, it identifies the optimal extraction layer and aggregates them into transferable coarse-grained forms. Furthermore, we enhance the transferability via multi-granularity mechanisms: non-linear adapters for feature-level transfer, an Isomorphic Interaction Module for module-level transfer, and Standalone Retrieval for model-level transfer. LFM4Ads has been successfully deployed in Tencent's industrial-scale advertising platform, processing tens of billions of daily samples while maintaining terabyte-scale model parameters with billions of sparse embedding keys across approximately two thousand features. Since its production deployment in Q4 2024, LFM4Ads has achieved 10+ successful production launches across various advertising scenarios, including primary ones like Weixin Moments and Channels. These launches achieve an overall GMV lift of 2.45% across the entire platform, translating to estimated annual revenue increases in the hundreds of millions of dollars.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we evaluate this potential in the context of prostate multiparametric MRI using ProFound, a recently developed domain-specific vision foundation model pretrained on large-scale prostate MRI datasets. We investigate the impact of variable image quality on the label-efficient finetuning, by quantifying the generalisability of the finetuned models. We conduct a comprehensive set of experiments by systematically varying the ratios of high- and low-quality images in the finetuning and evaluation sets. Our findings indicate that image quality distribution and its finetune-and-test mismatch significantly affect model performance. In particular: a) Varying the ratio of high- to low-quality images between finetuning and test sets leads to notable differences in downstream performance; and b) The presence of sufficient high-quality images in the finetuning set is critical for maintaining strong performance, whilst the importance of matched finetuning and testing distribution varies between different downstream tasks, such as automated radiology reporting and prostate cancer detection. Importantly, experimental results also show that, although finetuning requires significantly less labeled data compared to training from scratch when the quality ratio is consistent, this label efficiency is not independent of the image quality distribution. For example, we show cases that, without sufficient high-quality images in finetuning, finetuned models may fail to outperform those without pretraining.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was accepted to the 1st MICCAI Workshop on Efficient Medical AI (EMA4MICCAI2025) and selected for oral presentation</p></details> |

Our DuCos is the first to significantly improve generalization across diverse scenarios with foundation models as prompts. The prompt design consists of two key components: Correlative Fusion (CF) and Gradient Regulation (GR). CF facilitates precise geometric alignment and effective fusion between prompt and depth features, while GR refines depth predictions by enforcing consistency with sharp-edged depth maps derived from foundation models. Crucially, these prompts are seamlessly embedded into the Lagrangian constraint term, forming a synergistic and principled framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DuCos outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior accuracy, robustness, and generalization.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |

However, its effectiveness can be compromised by noise or unavailability of one or more leads of the standard 12-lead recordings, resulting in diagnostic errors or uncertainty. To address these challenges, we propose TolerantECG, a foundation model for ECG signals that is robust to noise and capable of functioning with arbitrary subsets of the standard 12-lead ECG. TolerantECG training combines contrastive and self-supervised learning frameworks to jointly learn ECG signal representations alongside their corresponding knowledge-retrieval-based text report descriptions and corrupted or lead-missing signals. Comprehensive benchmarking results demonstrate that TolerantECG consistently ranks as the best or second-best performer across various ECG signal conditions and class levels in the PTB-XL dataset, and achieves the highest performance on the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ACM MM 2025</p></details> |

Statistical and data-driven approaches remain the standard in industrial anomaly detection, yet their adaptability and usability are constrained by the dependence on extensive annotated datasets and limited flexibility under dynamic production conditions. Recent advances in the perception capabilities of foundation models provide promising opportunities for their adaptation to this downstream task. This paper presents PB-IAD (Prompt-based Industrial Anomaly Detection), a novel framework that leverages the multimodal and reasoning capabilities of foundation models for industrial anomaly detection. Specifically, PB-IAD addresses three key requirements of dynamic production environments: data sparsity, agile adaptability, and domain user centricity. In addition to the anomaly detection, the framework includes a prompt template that is specifically designed for iteratively implementing domain-specific process knowledge, as well as a pre-processing module that translates domain user inputs into effective system prompts. This user-centric design allows domain experts to customise the system flexibly without requiring data science expertise. The proposed framework is evaluated by utilizing GPT-4.1 across three distinct manufacturing scenarios, two data modalities, and an ablation study to systematically assess the contribution of semantic instructions. Furthermore, PB-IAD is benchmarked to state-of-the-art methods for anomaly detection such as PatchCore. The results demonstrate superior performance, particularly in data-sparse scenarios and low-shot settings, achieved solely through semantic instructions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Extending Foundational Monocular Depth Estimators to Fisheye Cameras with Calibration Tokens](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04928v3)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a method to extend foundational monocular depth estimators (FMDEs), trained on perspective images, to fisheye images. Despite being trained on tens of millions of images, FMDEs are susceptible to the covariate shift introduced by changes in camera calibration (intrinsic, distortion) parameters, leading to erroneous depth estimates. Our method aligns the distribution of latent embeddings encoding fisheye images to those of perspective images, enabling the reuse of FMDEs for fisheye cameras without retraining or finetuning. To this end, we introduce a set of Calibration Tokens as a light-weight adaptation mechanism that modulates the latent embeddings for alignment. By exploiting the already expressive latent space of FMDEs, we posit that modulating their embeddings avoids the negative impact of artifacts and loss introduced in conventional recalibration or map projection to a canonical reference frame in the image space. Our method is self-supervised and does not require fisheye images but leverages publicly available large-scale perspective image datasets. This is done by recalibrating perspective images to fisheye images, and enforcing consistency between their estimates during training. We evaluate our approach with several FMDEs, on both indoors and outdoors, where we consistently improve over state-of-the-art methods using a single set of tokens for both.

Motivated by emerging consumer and developer use cases - AI teammates, controllable NPCs, personalized live-streamers, assistive testers - we argue that an agent must rely on the same pixel stream available to players and generalize to new titles with minimal game-specific engineering. P2P0.1 is trained end-to-end with behavior cloning: labeled demonstrations collected from instrumented human game-play are complemented by unlabeled public videos, to which we impute actions via an inverse-dynamics model. A decoder-only transformer with auto-regressive action output handles the large action space while remaining latency-friendly on a single consumer GPU. We report qualitative results showing competent play across simple Roblox and classic MS-DOS titles, ablations on unlabeled data, and outline the scaling and evaluation steps required to reach expert-level, text-conditioned control.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pixels Under Pressure: Exploring Fine-Tuning Paradigms for Foundation Models in High-Resolution Medical Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14931v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advancements in diffusion-based foundation models have improved text-to-image generation, yet most efforts have been limited to low-resolution settings. As high-resolution image synthesis becomes increasingly essential for various applications, particularly in medical imaging domains, fine-tuning emerges as a crucial mechanism for adapting these powerful pre-trained models to task-specific requirements and data distributions. In this work, we present a systematic study, examining the impact of various fine-tuning techniques on image generation quality when scaling to high resolution 512x512 pixels. We benchmark a diverse set of fine-tuning methods, including full fine-tuning strategies and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). We dissect how different fine-tuning methods influence key quality metrics, including Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID), Vendi score, and prompt-image alignment. We also evaluate the utility of generated images in a downstream classification task under data-scarce conditions, demonstrating that specific fine-tuning strategies improve both generation fidelity and downstream performance when synthetic images are used for classifier training and evaluation on real images. Our code is accessible through the project website - https://tehraninasab.github.io/PixelUPressure/.</p></details> |  |
| **[UNICON: UNIfied CONtinual Learning for Medical Foundational Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14024v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundational models are trained on extensive datasets to capture the general trends of a domain. However, in medical imaging, the scarcity of data makes pre-training for every domain, modality, or task challenging. Continual learning offers a solution by fine-tuning a model sequentially on different domains or tasks, enabling it to integrate new knowledge without requiring large datasets for each training phase. In this paper, we propose UNIfied CONtinual Learning for Medical Foundational Models (UNICON), a framework that enables the seamless adaptation of foundation models to diverse domains, tasks, and modalities. Unlike conventional adaptation methods that treat these changes in isolation, UNICON provides a unified, perpetually expandable framework. Through careful integration, we show that foundation models can dynamically expand across imaging modalities, anatomical regions, and clinical objectives without catastrophic forgetting or task interference. Empirically, we validate our approach by adapting a chest CT foundation model initially trained for classification to a prognosis and segmentation task. Our results show improved performance across both additional tasks. Furthermore, we continually incorporated PET scans and achieved a 5\% improvement in Dice score compared to respective baselines. These findings establish that foundation models are not inherently constrained to their initial training scope but can evolve, paving the way toward generalist AI models for medical imaging.</p></details> | 10 pages, 1 figure |

We introduce Memory-Amortized Inference (MAI) as a formal framework in which cognition is modeled as inference over latent cycles in memory, rather than recomputation through gradient descent. MAI systems encode inductive biases via structural reuse, minimizing entropy and enabling context-aware, structure-preserving inference. This approach reframes cognitive systems not as ergodic samplers, but as navigators over constrained latent manifolds, guided by persistent topological memory. Through the lens of delta-homology, we show that MAI provides a principled foundation for Mountcastle's Universal Cortical Algorithm, modeling each cortical column as a local inference operator over cycle-consistent memory states. Furthermore, we establish a time-reversal duality between MAI and reinforcement learning: whereas RL propagates value forward from reward, MAI reconstructs latent causes backward from memory. This inversion paves a path toward energy-efficient inference and addresses the computational bottlenecks facing modern AI. MAI thus offers a unified, biologically grounded theory of intelligence based on structure, reuse, and memory. We also briefly discuss the profound implications of MAI for achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI).</p></details> |  |

It's self-supervision of reconstructing the input from slots struggles with complex object textures, thus Vision Foundation Model (VFM) representations are used as the aggregation input and reconstruction target. Existing methods leverage VFM representations in diverse ways yet fail to fully exploit their potential. In response, we propose a unified architecture, Vector-Quantized VFMs for OCL (VQ-VFM-OCL, or VVO). The key to our unification is simply shared quantizing VFM representations in OCL aggregation and decoding. Experiments show that across different VFMs, aggregators and decoders, our VVO consistently outperforms baselines in object discovery and recognition, as well as downstream visual prediction and reasoning. We also mathematically analyze why VFM representations facilitate OCL aggregation and why their shared quantization as reconstruction targets strengthens OCL supervision. Our source code and model checkpoints are available on https://github.com/Genera1Z/VQ-VFM-OCL.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM 2025</p></details> |

Accurate demographic forecasting is essential for informed decision-making in areas such as urban planning, healthcare, and economic policy. This study explores the application of time series foundation models to predict demographic changes in the United States using datasets from the U.S. Census Bureau and Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED). We evaluate the performance of the Time Series Foundation Model (TimesFM) against traditional baselines including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), and Linear Regression. Our experiments across six demographically diverse states demonstrate that TimesFM achieves the lowest Mean Squared Error (MSE) in 86.67% of test cases, with particularly strong performance on minority populations with sparse historical data. These findings highlight the potential of pre-trained foundation models to enhance demographic analysis and inform proactive policy interventions without requiring extensive task-specific fine-tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Minecraft provides rich complexity and internet-scale data, but its slow speed and engineering overhead make it unsuitable for rapid prototyping. Crafter offers a lightweight alternative that retains key challenges from Minecraft, yet its use has remained limited to narrow tasks due to the absence of foundation models that have driven progress in the Minecraft setting. In this paper, we present CrafterDojo, a suite of foundation models and tools that unlock the Crafter environment as a lightweight, prototyping-friendly, and Minecraft-like testbed for general-purpose embodied agent research. CrafterDojo addresses this by introducing CrafterVPT, CrafterCLIP, and CrafterSteve-1 for behavior priors, vision-language grounding, and instruction following, respectively. In addition, we provide toolkits for generating behavior and caption datasets (CrafterPlay and CrafterCaption), reference agent implementations, benchmark evaluations, and a complete open-source codebase.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causally-Guided Pairwise Transformer -- Towards Foundational Digital Twins in Process Industry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13111v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundational modelling of multi-dimensional time-series data in industrial systems presents a central trade-off: channel-dependent (CD) models capture specific cross-variable dynamics but lack robustness and adaptability as model layers are commonly bound to the data dimensionality of the tackled use-case, while channel-independent (CI) models offer generality at the cost of modelling the explicit interactions crucial for system-level predictive regression tasks. To resolve this, we propose the Causally-Guided Pairwise Transformer (CGPT), a novel architecture that integrates a known causal graph as an inductive bias. The core of CGPT is built around a pairwise modeling paradigm, tackling the CD/CI conflict by decomposing the multidimensional data into pairs. The model uses channel-agnostic learnable layers where all parameter dimensions are independent of the number of variables. CGPT enforces a CD information flow at the pair-level and CI-like generalization across pairs. This approach disentangles complex system dynamics and results in a highly flexible architecture that ensures scalability and any-variate adaptability. We validate CGPT on a suite of synthetic and real-world industrial datasets on long-term and one-step forecasting tasks designed to simulate common industrial complexities. Results demonstrate that CGPT significantly outperforms both CI and CD baselines in predictive accuracy and shows competitive performance with end-to-end trained CD models while remaining agnostic to the problem dimensionality.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 2 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Traditional panoptic mapping approaches are constrained by fixed labels, limiting their ability to handle novel objects. We present Unified Promptable Panoptic Mapping (UPPM), which leverages foundation models for dynamic labeling without additional training. UPPM is evaluated across three comprehensive levels: Segmentation-to-Map, Map-to-Map, and Segmentation-to-Segmentation. Results demonstrate UPPM attains exceptional geometry reconstruction accuracy (0.61cm on the Flat dataset), the highest panoptic quality (0.414), and better performance compared to state-of-the-art segmentation methods. Furthermore, ablation studies validate the contributions of unified semantics, custom NMS, and blurry frame filtering, with the custom NMS improving the completion ratio by 8.27% on the Flat dataset. UPPM demonstrates effective scene reconstruction with rich semantic labeling across diverse datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[Citation accuracy, citation noise, and citation bias: A foundation of citation analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12735v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Citation analysis is widely used in research evaluation to assess the impact of scientific papers. These analyses rest on the assumption that citation decisions by authors are accurate, representing flow of knowledge from cited to citing papers. However, in practice, researchers often cite for reasons other than attributing intellectual credit to previous research. Citations made for rhetorical reasons or without reading the cited work compromise the value of citations as instrument for research evaluation. Past research on threats to the accuracy of citations has mainly focused on citation bias as the primary concern. In this paper, we argue that citation noise - the undesirable variance in citation decisions - represents an equally critical but underexplored challenge in citation analysis. We define and differentiate two types of citation noise: citation level noise and citation pattern noise. Each type of noise is described in terms of how it arises and the specific ways it can undermine the validity of citation-based research assessments. By conceptually differing citation noise from citation accuracy and citation bias, we propose a framework for the foundation of citation analysis. We discuss strategies and interventions to minimize citation noise, aiming to improve the reliability and validity of citation analysis in research evaluation. We recommend that the current professional reform movement in research evaluation such as the Coalition for Advancing Research Assessment (CoARA) pick up these strategies and interventions as an additional building block for careful, responsible use of bibliometric indicators in research evaluation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Transformer-Based Foundation Models for Time Series Forecasting via Bagging, Boosting and Statistical Ensembles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16641v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series foundation models (TSFMs) such as Lag-Llama, TimeGPT, Chronos, MOMENT, UniTS, and TimesFM have shown strong generalization and zero-shot capabilities for time series forecasting, anomaly detection, classification, and imputation. Despite these advantages, their predictions still suffer from variance, domain-specific bias, and limited uncertainty quantification when deployed on real operational data. This paper investigates a suite of statistical and ensemble-based enhancement techniques, including bootstrap-based bagging, regression-based stacking, prediction interval construction, statistical residual modeling, and iterative error feedback, to improve robustness and accuracy. Using the Belgium Electricity Short-Term Load Forecasting dataset as a case study, we demonstrate that the proposed hybrids consistently outperform standalone foundation models across multiple horizons. Regression-based ensembles achieve the lowest mean squared error; bootstrap aggregation markedly reduces long-context errors; residual modeling corrects systematic bias; and the resulting prediction intervals achieve near nominal coverage with widths shrinking as context length increases. The results indicate that integrating statistical reasoning with modern foundation models yields measurable gains in accuracy, reliability, and interpretability for real-world time series applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Structural Foundations for Leading Digit Laws: Beyond Probabilistic Mixtures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13237v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This article presents a modern deterministic framework for the study of leading significant digit distributions in numerical data. Rather than relying on traditional probabilistic or mixture-based explanations, we demonstrate that the observed frequencies of leading digits are determined by the underlying arithmetic, algorithmic, and structural properties of the data-generating process. Our approach centers on a shift-invariant functional equation, whose general solution is given by explicit affine-plus-periodic formulas. This structural formulation explains the diversity of digit distributions encountered in both empirical and mathematical datasets, including cases with pronounced deviations from logarithmic or scale-invariant profiles. We systematically analyze digit distributions in finite and infinite datasets, address deterministic sequences such as prime numbers and recurrence relations, and highlight the emergence of block-structured and fractal features. The article provides critical examination of probabilistic models, explicit examples and counterexamples, and discusses limitations and open problems for further research. Overall, this work establishes a unified mathematical foundation for digital phenomena and offers a versatile toolset for modeling and analyzing digit patterns in applied and theoretical contexts.</p></details> | 57 pp, 12 figures |
| **[Foundation Model for Skeleton-Based Human Action Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12586v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human action understanding serves as a foundational pillar in the field of intelligent motion perception. Skeletons serve as a modality- and device-agnostic representation for human modeling, and skeleton-based action understanding has potential applications in humanoid robot control and interaction. \RED{However, existing works often lack the scalability and generalization required to handle diverse action understanding tasks. There is no skeleton foundation model that can be adapted to a wide range of action understanding tasks}. This paper presents a Unified Skeleton-based Dense Representation Learning (USDRL) framework, which serves as a foundational model for skeleton-based human action understanding. USDRL consists of a Transformer-based Dense Spatio-Temporal Encoder (DSTE), Multi-Grained Feature Decorrelation (MG-FD), and Multi-Perspective Consistency Training (MPCT). The DSTE module adopts two parallel streams to learn temporal dynamic and spatial structure features. The MG-FD module collaboratively performs feature decorrelation across temporal, spatial, and instance domains to reduce dimensional redundancy and enhance information extraction. The MPCT module employs both multi-view and multi-modal self-supervised consistency training. The former enhances the learning of high-level semantics and mitigates the impact of low-level discrepancies, while the latter effectively facilitates the learning of informative multimodal features. We perform extensive experiments on 25 benchmarks across across 9 skeleton-based action understanding tasks, covering coarse prediction, dense prediction, and transferred prediction. Our approach significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods. We hope that this work would broaden the scope of research in skeleton-based action understanding and encourage more attention to dense prediction tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TPAMI, Code is available at: https://github.com/wengwanjiang/FoundSkelModel</p></details> |

We present jXBW, a fast method for substructure search on large-scale JSONL datasets. Our method makes three key technical contributions: (i) a merged tree representation built by merging trees of multiple JSON objects while preserving individual identities, (ii) a succinct data structure based on the eXtended Burrows-Wheeler Transform that enables efficient tree navigation and subpath search, and (iii) an efficient three-step substructure search algorithm that combines path decomposition, ancestor computation, and adaptive tree identifier collection to ensure correctness while avoiding exhaustive tree traversal. Experimental evaluation on real-world datasets demonstrates that jXBW consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving speedups of 16$\times$ for smaller datasets and up to 4,700$\times$ for larger datasets over tree-based approaches, and more than 6$\times$10$^6$ over XML-based processing while maintaining competitive memory usage.</p></details> |  |

When humans wield tools -- such as writing with a pen or cutting with scissors -- our hands would reach very specific poses, often drastically different from how we pick up the same objects just to transport them. In this work, we investigate the design of tool-wielding multi-finger robotic hand through a hypothesis: If a hand can kinematically reach a foundational pose (FP) with a tool, then it can wield the tool from that FP. We interpret FPs as snapshots that capture the workings of underlying parallel mechanisms formed by the tool and the hand, and one hand can form multiple mechanisms with the same tool. We tested our hypothesis in a hand design experiment, where we developed a sampling-based multi-objective design optimization framework that uses three FPs to computationally generate many different hand designs and evaluate them. The results show that 10,785 out of the 100,480 hand designs we sampled reached the FPs; more than 99\% of the 10,785 hands that reached the FPs successfully wielded tools, supporting our hypothesis. Meanwhile, our methods provide insights into the non-convex, multi-objective hand design optimization problem -- such as clustering and the Pareto front -- that could be hard to unveil with methods that return a single ``optimal" design. Lastly, we demonstrate our methods' real-world feasibility and potential with a hardware prototype equipped with rigid endoskeleton and soft skin.</p></details> |  |
| **[Geological Everything Model 3D: A Physics-informed Promptable Foundation Model for Unified and Zero-Shot Subsurface Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00419v3)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding Earth's subsurface is critical for energy transition, natural hazard mitigation, and planetary science. Yet subsurface analysis remains fragmented, with separate models required for structural interpretation, stratigraphic analysis, geobody segmentation, and property modeling-each tightly coupled to specific data distributions and task formulations. We introduce the Geological Everything Model 3D (GEM), a unified generative architecture that reformulates all these tasks as prompt-conditioned inference along latent structural frameworks derived from subsurface imaging. This formulation moves beyond task-specific models by enabling a shared inference mechanism, where GEM propagates human-provided prompts-such as well logs, masks, or structural sketches-along inferred structural frameworks to produce geologically coherent outputs. Through this mechanism, GEM achieves zero-shot generalization across tasks with heterogeneous prompt types, without retraining for new tasks or data sources. This capability emerges from a two-stage training process that combines self-supervised representation learning on large-scale field seismic data with adversarial fine-tuning using mixed prompts and labels across diverse subsurface tasks. GEM demonstrates broad applicability across surveys and tasks, including Martian radar stratigraphy analysis, structural interpretation in subduction zones, full seismic stratigraphic interpretation, geobody segmentation, and property modeling. By bridging expert knowledge with generative reasoning in a structurally aware manner, GEM lays the foundation for scalable, human-in-the-loop geophysical AI-transitioning from fragmented pipelines to a vertically integrated, promptable reasoning system.

These objectives adjust the statistics of noisy speech representations, enabling the model to capture diverse acoustic characteristics and improving the generalization ability across different types of noise.

Analysis and Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12255v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speech foundation models (SFMs) are designed to serve as general-purpose representations for a wide range of speech-processing tasks. The last five years have seen an influx of increasingly successful self-supervised and supervised pre-trained models with impressive performance on various downstream tasks. Although the zoo of SFMs continues to grow, our understanding of the knowledge they acquire lags behind. This thesis presents a lightweight analysis framework using statistical tools and training-free tasks to investigate the acoustic and linguistic knowledge encoded in SFM layers. We conduct a comparative study across multiple SFMs and statistical tools. Our study also shows that the analytical insights have concrete implications for downstream task performance. The effectiveness of an SFM is ultimately determined by its performance on speech applications. Yet it remains unclear whether the benefits extend to spoken language understanding (SLU) tasks that require a deeper understanding than widely studied ones, such as speech recognition. The limited exploration of SLU is primarily due to a lack of relevant datasets. To alleviate that, this thesis contributes tasks, specifically spoken named entity recognition (NER) and named entity localization (NEL), to the Spoken Language Understanding Evaluation benchmark. We develop SFM-based approaches for NER and NEL, and find that end-to-end (E2E) models leveraging SFMs can surpass traditional cascaded (speech recognition followed by a text model) approaches. Further, we evaluate E2E SLU models across SFMs and adaptation strategies to assess the impact on task performance. Collectively, this thesis tackles previously unanswered questions about SFMs, providing tools and datasets to further our understanding and to enable the community to make informed design choices for future model development and adoption.</p></details> | Ph.D. Thesis |

While artificial intelligence(AI) tools have demonstrated promise in dermatological image analysis, current models face limitations-they often rely on large, manually labeled datasets and are built for narrow, specific tasks, making them less effective in real-world settings. To tackle these limitations, we present DermNIO, a versatile foundation model for dermatology. Trained on a curated dataset of 432,776 images from three sources (public repositories, web-sourced images, and proprietary collections), DermNIO incorporates a novel hybrid pretraining framework that augments the self-supervised learning paradigm through semi-supervised learning and knowledge-guided prototype initialization. This integrated method not only deepens the understanding of complex dermatological conditions, but also substantially enhances the generalization capability across various clinical tasks. Evaluated across 20 datasets, DermNIO consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models across a wide range of tasks. It excels in high-level clinical applications including malignancy classification, disease severity grading, multi-category diagnosis, and dermatological image caption, while also achieving state-of-the-art performance in low-level tasks such as skin lesion segmentation. Furthermore, DermNIO demonstrates strong robustness in privacy-preserving federated learning scenarios and across diverse skin types and sexes. In a blinded reader study with 23 dermatologists, DermNIO achieved 95.79% diagnostic accuracy (versus clinicians' 73.66%), and AI assistance improved clinician performance by 17.21%.</p></details> |  |

We investigate a case study of extending LANDFIRE's Existing Vegetation Type (EVT) dataset beyond the USA into Canada at two levels of granularity: EvtPhys (13 classes) and EvtGp (80 classes).

While numerous benchmarks (e.g., MMLU) and leaderboards (e.g., Chatbot Arena) have been proposed to help evolve the development of LLMs and MLLMs, most rely on static datasets or crowdsourced general-domain prompts, often falling short of reflecting performance in real-world applications. To bridge this critical gap, we present Inclusion Arena, a live leaderboard that ranks models based on human feedback collected directly from AI-powered applications. Our platform integrates pairwise model comparisons into natural user interactions, ensuring evaluations reflect practical usage scenarios. For robust model ranking, we employ the Bradley-Terry model augmented with two key innovations: (1) Placement Matches, a cold-start mechanism to quickly estimate initial ratings for newly integrated models, and (2) Proximity Sampling, an intelligent comparison strategy that prioritizes battles between models of similar capabilities to maximize information gain and enhance rating stability. Extensive empirical analyses and simulations demonstrate that Inclusion Arena yields reliable and stable rankings, exhibits higher data transitivity compared to general crowdsourced datasets, and significantly mitigates the risk of malicious manipulation. By fostering an open alliance between foundation models and real-world applications, Inclusion Arena aims to accelerate the development of LLMs and MLLMs truly optimized for practical, user-centric deployments.

It has shown promising performance across multiple datasets in diagnosing diseases, both eye-specific and systemic, from retinal images. However, to our best knowledge, it has not been used for other tasks. We present the first adaptation of RETFound for optic disc segmentation, a ubiquitous and foundational task in retinal image analysis. The resulting segmentation system outperforms state-of-the-art, segmentation-specific baseline networks after training a head with only a very modest number of task-specific examples. We report and discuss results with four public datasets, IDRID, Drishti-GS, RIM-ONE-r3, and REFUGE, and a private dataset, GoDARTS, achieving about 96% Dice consistently across all datasets. Overall, our method obtains excellent performance in internal verification, domain generalization and domain adaptation, and exceeds most of the state-of-the-art baseline results. We discuss the results in the framework of the debate about FMs as alternatives to task-specific architectures.

In ophthalmology, several FMs have recently emerged, but there is still no clear answer to fundamental questions: Which FM performs the best? Are they equally good across different tasks? What if we combine all FMs together? To our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically evaluate both single and fused ophthalmic FMs. To address these questions, we propose FusionFM, a comprehensive evaluation suite, along with two fusion approaches to integrate different ophthalmic FMs. Our framework covers both ophthalmic disease detection (glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and age-related macular degeneration) and systemic disease prediction (diabetes and hypertension) based on retinal imaging. We benchmarked four state-of-the-art FMs (RETFound, VisionFM, RetiZero, and DINORET) using standardized datasets from multiple countries and evaluated their performance using AUC and F1 metrics. Our results show that DINORET and RetiZero achieve superior performance in both ophthalmic and systemic disease tasks, with RetiZero exhibiting stronger generalization on external datasets. Regarding fusion strategies, the Gating-based approach provides modest improvements in predicting glaucoma, AMD, and hypertension. Despite these advances, predicting systemic diseases, especially hypertension in external cohort remains challenging. These findings provide an evidence-based evaluation of ophthalmic FMs, highlight the benefits of model fusion, and point to strategies for enhancing their clinical applicability.</p></details> | 12 pages, 3 figures |

Using Inductive Bias to Probe for World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06952v3)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models are premised on the idea that sequence prediction can uncover deeper domain understanding, much like how Kepler's predictions of planetary motion later led to the discovery of Newtonian mechanics. However, evaluating whether these models truly capture deeper structure remains a challenge. We develop a technique for evaluating foundation models that examines how they adapt to synthetic datasets generated from some postulated world model. Our technique measures whether the foundation model's inductive bias aligns with the world model, and so we refer to it as an inductive bias probe. Across multiple domains, we find that foundation models can excel at their training tasks yet fail to develop inductive biases towards the underlying world model when adapted to new tasks. We particularly find that foundation models trained on orbital trajectories consistently fail to apply Newtonian mechanics when adapted to new physics tasks. Further analysis reveals that these models behave as if they develop task-specific heuristics that fail to generalize.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in ICML 2025</p></details> |

As their commercial potential grows, critical details of the most capable CUA systems remain closed. As these agents will increasingly mediate digital interactions and execute consequential decisions on our behalf, the research community needs access to open CUA frameworks to study their capabilities, limitations, and risks. To bridge this gap, we propose OpenCUA, a comprehensive open-source framework for scaling CUA data and foundation models. Our framework consists of: (1) an annotation infrastructure that seamlessly captures human computer-use demonstrations; (2) AgentNet, the first large-scale computer-use task dataset spanning 3 operating systems and 200+ applications and websites; (3) a scalable pipeline that transforms demonstrations into state-action pairs with reflective long Chain-of-Thought reasoning that sustain robust performance gains as data scales. Our end-to-end agent models demonstrate strong performance across CUA benchmarks. In particular, OpenCUA-32B achieves an average success rate of 34.8% on OSWorld-Verified, establishing a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) among open-source models and surpassing OpenAI CUA (GPT-4o). Further analysis confirms that our approach generalizes well across domains and benefits significantly from increased test-time computation. We release our annotation tool, datasets, code, and models to build open foundations for further CUA research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updata author list, modify first page format, correct typos</p></details> |

Specifically, Yan comprises three core modules. AAA-level Simulation: We design a highly-compressed, low-latency 3D-VAE coupled with a KV-cache-based shift-window denoising inference process, achieving real-time 1080P/60FPS interactive simulation. Multi-Modal Generation: We introduce a hierarchical autoregressive caption method that injects game-specific knowledge into open-domain multi-modal video diffusion models (VDMs), then transforming the VDM into a frame-wise, action-controllable, real-time infinite interactive video generator. Notably, when the textual and visual prompts are sourced from different domains, the model demonstrates strong generalization, allowing it to blend and compose the style and mechanics across domains flexibly according to user prompts. Multi-Granularity Editing: We propose a hybrid model that explicitly disentangles interactive mechanics simulation from visual rendering, enabling multi-granularity video content editing during interaction through text. Collectively, Yan offers an integration of these modules, pushing interactive video generation beyond isolated capabilities toward a comprehensive AI-driven interactive creation paradigm, paving the way for the next generation of creative tools, media, and entertainment.

To overcome the scarcity of data in this field, we employ a corpus collection strategy based on the domain knowledge framework of analog circuits. High-quality, accessible textbooks across relevant subfields are systematically curated and cleaned into a textual domain corpus. To address the complexity of knowledge of analog circuits, we introduce a granular domain knowledge distillation method. Raw, unlabeled domain corpus is decomposed into typical, granular learning nodes, where a multi-agent framework distills implicit knowledge embedded in unstructured text into question-answer data pairs with detailed reasoning processes, yielding a fine-grained, learnable dataset for fine-tuning. To address the unexplored challenges in training analog circuit foundation models, we explore and share our training methods through both theoretical analysis and experimental validation. We finally establish a fine-tuning-centric training paradigm, customizing and implementing a neighborhood self-constrained supervised fine-tuning algorithm. This approach enhances training outcomes by constraining the perturbation magnitude between the model's output distributions before and after training. In practice, we train the Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct model to obtain AnalogSeeker, which achieves 85.04% accuracy on AMSBench-TQA, the analog circuit knowledge evaluation benchmark, with a 15.67% point improvement over the original model and is competitive with mainstream commercial models. Furthermore, AnalogSeeker also shows effectiveness in the downstream operational amplifier design task. AnalogSeeker is open-sourced at https://huggingface.co/analogllm/analogseeker for research use.</p></details> |  |

Collaborative learning can leverage local clients' datasets for fine-tuning, but limited client data and heterogeneous data distributions hinder effective collaboration. To address the challenge, we propose a flexible personalized federated learning paradigm that enables clients to engage in collaborative learning while maintaining personalized objectives. Given the limited and heterogeneous computational resources available on clients, we introduce \textbf{flexible personalized split federated learning (FlexP-SFL)}. Based on split learning, FlexP-SFL allows each client to train a portion of the model locally while offloading the rest to a server, according to resource constraints. Additionally, we propose an alignment strategy to improve personalized model performance on global data. Experimental results show that FlexP-SFL outperforms baseline models in personalized fine-tuning efficiency and final accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, Submitted to INFOCOM2026</p></details> |

Recent advances in deep learning and availability of large scale transcribed data has led to development of speech foundation models that have shown dramatic improvements in ASR performance. However, their performance on conversational child-adult interactions remains underexplored. In this work, we provide a comprehensive evaluation of ASR performance on a dataset containing child-adult interactions from autism diagnostic sessions, using Whisper, Wav2Vec2, HuBERT, and WavLM. We find that speech foundation models show a noticeable performance drop (15-20% absolute WER) for child speech compared to adult speech in the conversational setting. Then, we fine-tune the best-performing zero-shot model (Whisper-large) using LoRA in a low-resource setting, yielding 8% and 13% absolute WER improvements for child and adult speech, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Workshop on Child Computer Interaction (WOCCI 2025)</p></details> |
| **[EXAONE Path 2.0: Pathology Foundation Model with End-to-End Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06639v2)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In digital pathology, whole-slide images (WSIs) are often difficult to handle due to their gigapixel scale, so most approaches train patch encoders via self-supervised learning (SSL) and then aggregate the patch-level embeddings via multiple instance learning (MIL) or slide encoders for downstream tasks. However, patch-level SSL may overlook complex domain-specific features that are essential for biomarker prediction, such as mutation status and molecular characteristics, as SSL methods rely only on basic augmentations selected for natural image domains on small patch-level area. Moreover, SSL methods remain less data efficient than fully supervised approaches, requiring extensive computational resources and datasets to achieve competitive performance. To address these limitations, we present EXAONE Path 2.0, a pathology foundation model that learns patch-level representations under direct slide-level supervision. Using only 37k WSIs for training, EXAONE Path 2.0 achieves state-of-the-art average performance across 10 biomarker prediction tasks, demonstrating remarkable data efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>EXAON...</summary><p>EXAONE Path 2.0 technical report</p></details> |

Despite the rapid advances, there exists a fundamental limitation: Processing unseen medical codes out of vocabulary. This problem limits the generalizability of EHR foundation models and the integration of models trained with different vocabularies. To alleviate this problem, we propose a set of novel medical concept representations (MedRep) for EHR foundation models based on the observational medical outcome partnership (OMOP) common data model (CDM). For concept representation learning, we enrich the information of each concept with a minimal definition through large language model (LLM) prompts and complement the text-based representations through the graph ontology of OMOP vocabulary. Our approach outperforms the vanilla EHR foundation model and the model with a previously introduced medical code tokenizer in diverse prediction tasks. We also demonstrate the generalizability of MedRep through external validation.</p></details> | 18 pages |
| **[FM4NPP: A Scaling Foundation Model for Nuclear and Particle Physics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14087v1)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models have revolutionized artificial intelligence by enabling large, generalizable models trained through self-supervision. This paradigm has inspired the development of scientific foundation models (FMs). However, applying this capability to experimental particle physics is challenging due to the sparse, spatially distributed nature of detector data, which differs dramatically from natural language. This work addresses if an FM for particle physics can scale and generalize across diverse tasks. We introduce a new dataset with more than 11 million particle collision events and a suite of downstream tasks and labeled data for evaluation. We propose a novel self-supervised training method for detector data and demonstrate its neural scalability with models that feature up to 188 million parameters. With frozen weights and task-specific adapters, this FM consistently outperforms baseline models across all downstream tasks. The performance also exhibits robust data-efficient adaptation. Further analysis reveals that the representations extracted by the FM are task-agnostic but can be specialized via a single linear mapping for different downstream tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[PDEformer-2: A Versatile Foundation Model for Two-Dimensional Partial Differential Equations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15409v2)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Partial differential equations (PDEs) play a central role in describing many physical phenomena. Various scientific and engineering applications demand a versatile and differentiable PDE solver that can quickly generate solutions with adequate accuracy, and limitations of the traditional solvers and specialized neural operators motivate the development of foundation models for solving PDEs. This paper introduces PDEformer-2, a versatile foundation model for two-dimensional PDEs. Based on our previous one-dimensional PDEformer-1 model, PDEformer-2 receives the PDE form as network input via computational graph representation, which has the flexibility to encode most common PDEs. The mesh-free predicted solutions can be directly queried at arbitrary spatio-temporal coordinates. A large (40TB) diverse dataset is employed to pretrain the current model, making it capable of simultaneously addressing PDEs with different symbolic forms, domain shapes, boundary conditions, number of variables, and time-dependency. Accurate zero-shot prediction is allowed for PDEs that resemble the pretraining ones. When adapted to new unseen PDEs, PDEformer-2 demonstrates faster learning than many specialized models, and has smaller errors given limited (less than 100) samples. Additionally, PDEformer-2 can be employed in the inverse problems thanks to its fast and differentiable nature and produces reasonable results in our experiments to recover coefficient scalars and fields of a PDE.</p></details> |  |

However, current beat tracking methods face challenges due to the scarcity of labeled data, which limits their ability to generalize across diverse musical styles and accurately capture complex rhythmic structures. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel beat tracking paradigm BeatFM, which introduces a pre-trained music foundation model and leverages its rich semantic knowledge to improve beat tracking performance. Pre-training on diverse music datasets endows music foundation models with a robust understanding of music, thereby effectively addressing these challenges. To further adapt it for beat tracking, we design a plug-and-play multi-dimensional semantic aggregation module, which is composed of three parallel sub-modules, each focusing on semantic aggregation in the temporal, frequency, and channel domains, respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in beat and downbeat tracking across multiple benchmark datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by ICME2025</p></details> |

The deformability of garments leads to a vast state space and complex dynamics, which complicates precise and fine-grained manipulation. Previous approaches often rely on predefined key points or demonstrations, limiting their generalization across diverse garment categories. This paper presents a framework, MetaFold, that disentangles task planning from action prediction, learning each independently to enhance model generalization. It employs language-guided point cloud trajectory generation for task planning and a low-level foundation model for action prediction. This structure facilitates multi-category learning, enabling the model to adapt flexibly to various user instructions and folding tasks. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework. Supplementary materials are available on our website: https://meta-fold.github.io/.</p></details> |  |
| **[SpectralEarth: Training Hyperspectral Foundation Models at Scale](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08447v2)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have triggered a paradigm shift in computer vision and are increasingly being adopted in remote sensing, particularly for multispectral imagery. Yet, their potential in hyperspectral imaging (HSI) remains untapped due to the absence of comprehensive and globally representative hyperspectral datasets. To close this gap, we introduce SpectralEarth, a large-scale multitemporal dataset designed to pretrain hyperspectral foundation models leveraging data from the environmental mapping and analysis program (EnMAP). SpectralEarth comprises 538 974 image patches covering 415 153 unique locations from 11 636 globally distributed EnMAP scenes spanning two years of archive. In addition, 17.5% of these locations include multiple timestamps, enabling multitemporal HSI analysis. Utilizing state-of-the-art self-supervised learning algorithms, we pretrain a series of foundation models on SpectralEarth, integrating a spectral adapter into classical vision backbones to accommodate the unique characteristics of HSI. In tandem, we construct nine downstream datasets for land-cover, crop-type mapping, and tree-species classification, providing benchmarks for model evaluation. Experimental results support the versatility of our models and their generalizability across different tasks and sensors. We also highlight computational efficiency during model fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Scaling Laws for EHR Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22964v2)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of scaling laws has profoundly shaped the development of large language models (LLMs), enabling predictable performance gains through systematic increases in model size, dataset volume, and compute. Yet, these principles remain largely unexplored in the context of electronic health records (EHRs) -- a rich, sequential, and globally abundant data source that differs structurally from natural language. In this work, we present the first empirical investigation of scaling laws for EHR foundation models. By training transformer architectures on patient timeline data from the MIMIC-IV database across varying model sizes and compute budgets, we identify consistent scaling patterns, including parabolic IsoFLOPs curves and power-law relationships between compute, model parameters, data size, and clinical utility. These findings demonstrate that EHR models exhibit scaling behavior analogous to LLMs, offering predictive insights into resource-efficient training strategies. Our results lay the groundwork for developing powerful EHR foundation models capable of transforming clinical prediction tasks and advancing personalized healthcare.</p></details> |  |

However, existing models are frequently constrained by the limited scale of 3D data and the domain gap between datasets, which lead to reduced generalization capability. To address these challenges, we propose CitySeg, a foundation model for city-scale point cloud semantic segmentation that incorporates text modality to achieve open vocabulary segmentation and zero-shot inference. Specifically, in order to mitigate the issue of non-uniform data distribution across multiple domains, we customize the data preprocessing rules, and propose a local-global cross-attention network to enhance the perception capabilities of point networks in UAV scenarios. To resolve semantic label discrepancies across datasets, we introduce a hierarchical classification strategy. A hierarchical graph established according to the data annotation rules consolidates the data labels, and the graph encoder is used to model the hierarchical relationships between categories. In addition, we propose a two-stage training strategy and employ hinge loss to increase the feature separability of subcategories. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CitySeg achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on nine closed-set benchmarks, significantly outperforming existing approaches. Moreover, for the first time, CitySeg enables zero-shot generalization in city-scale point cloud scenarios without relying on visual information.</p></details> |  |

However, this integration also introduces distinct safety and security challenges. In this paper, we unify the concepts of safety and security in the context of MFMs by identifying critical threats that arise from both model behavior and system-level interactions. We propose a taxonomy grounded in information theory, evaluating risks through the concepts of channel capacity, signal, noise, and bandwidth. This perspective provides a principled way to analyze how information flows through MFMs and how vulnerabilities can emerge across modalities. Building on this foundation, we investigate defense mechanisms through the lens of a minimax game between attackers and defenders, highlighting key gaps in current research. In particular, we identify insufficient protection for cross-modal alignment and a lack of systematic and scalable defense strategies. Our work offers both a theoretical and practical foundation for advancing the safety and security of MFMs, supporting the development of more robust and trustworthy systems.</p></details> |  |

The VGGSound dataset is commonly used as a benchmark for evaluation audio-visual classification. However, our analysis identifies several limitations of VGGSound, including incomplete labelling, partially overlapping classes, and misaligned modalities. These lead to distorted evaluations of auditory and visual capabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce VGGSounder, a comprehensively re-annotated, multi-label test set that extends VGGSound and is specifically designed to evaluate audio-visual foundation models. VGGSounder features detailed modality annotations, enabling precise analyses of modality-specific performance. Furthermore, we reveal model limitations by analysing performance degradation when adding another input modality with our new modality confusion metric.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) 2025</p></details> |

However, a key hurdle in achieving this goal lies in the robots' ability to manipulate objects in their unstructured surrounding environments according to different tasks. The learning-based approach is considered an effective way to address generalization. The impressive performance of foundation models in the fields of computer vision and natural language suggests the potential of embedding foundation models into manipulation tasks as a viable path toward achieving general manipulation capability. However, we believe achieving general manipulation capability requires an overarching framework akin to auto driving. This framework should encompass multiple functional modules, with different foundation models assuming distinct roles in facilitating general manipulation capability. This survey focuses on the contributions of foundation models to robot learning for manipulation. We propose a comprehensive framework and detail how foundation models can address challenges in each module of the framework. What's more, we examine current approaches, outline challenges, suggest future research directions, and identify potential risks associated with integrating foundation models into this domain.</p></details> |  |
